My wife and I are about 4 hours in and this game has already totally blown us away. I honestly can't remember the last time a game made me smile and laugh this much while also being totally engrossed in the gameplay. The split screen takes a little getting used to at first and then you don't even notice it.Just an absolute joy to play and hands-down the best couch coop game I have played in about two and a half decades of PC gaming (yikes I'm getting old...).Buy it, you won't regret it! 10/10!!"

And then afterwards she couldn’t stop talking about it :). Only once every couple of years, a beautiful and brilliant story-driven couch co-op like this one is made. An instant classic."

While we expected it to be good, It Takes Two, the sophomore effort from developer, Hazelight, impressed us so much, it is now the benchmark for which I will measure future co-op game experiences. We simply lost count of how many charming moments we encountered whilst playing.I could go on and on, but, the selling points of this game are best experienced for yourself.Each painstakingly detailed level in this title offers you unique gameplay mechanics that are never recycled. Communication and cooperation are a must, as well as decent twitch response reflexes. Various mini-games are scattered around the environment, and give you a slight reprieve from your main objective, only to get your competitive juices flowing. (sore losers need not apply!) Controls are tight and responsive, and the camera does a decent job of keeping track of the action. However, those who suffer from motion sickness may occasionally become disoriented or even nauseated due to the mandatory split screen. Overall, this is a very high quality, one of a kind experience that could only be produced as a labor of love. Pick this one up, play it with someone special, and let the hilarity ensue.Highly recommended."

What was originally a game of heartbreak and painful memories, I had managed to find it someone new to play with. While this game had terrible memories, I had decided that a game such as this was undeserving of them, and thus created new memories with another special person in my life.The game is remarkable, with good writing, and amazing gameplay, and it is deserving of the buy. Each level is crafted with amazing detail, and all of the mini-games are just as fun as the main game itself. Don't let bad memories keep you down, and instead create happier ones.

When it ended it was So so so bitter sweet. It had been our thing to do when we had time together lately and now we have no idea what will fill that void of relaxing gaming with my little girl. She rushed to tell my wife we had finished it and she was so proud! But then when she returned to the study, she asked me if I could find a game just like this one...but one does not exist!I have never had a game in the last 25 years or so effect my heart so much as this game, it remind me of when I was young, discovering Shining Force 2 for the first time!The game play, the MASSIVE amount of genres touched on, the secrets, the easter eggs, THE MINIGAMES! The story, amazing!I have never played anything like this. As the final cut scene played my daughter said, ""you know daddy, mummy would probably be crying at this bit"", with tears in my eyes I turned to my daughter and said with a smile, ""Yeh, she might, but not me hey, Id never cry"" It was at this point she noticed my tears, she smiled and gave me a big hug. Now tell me what game could achieve that.10/10 a fan for life. Absolutely speechless on how good this game is!"

Naturally since I’m not able to clone myself yet, I had to actually go out there and find another person to play this game with me. And wouldn’t you know it, I remember that I was married. Seeing how this game is about a husband and wife, I figured it would be appropriate to ask my wife to be my co-op partner, for better or worse. Anyway, my wife insisted that, since she has played every single minute of this game with me, that she be a part of this review. Hello, dear!Yup, the story is honestly really cute and both of us really wanted to see it through until the end. Sure there were parts that we didn’t like but I think it’s safe to say that both of us had a grand time going through the entire game.And she isn't kidding. The game isn’t too challenging for veteran platform players, such as myself, who are basically more comfortable with jumping in games than they are with communicating with actual people. The game pretty much DEMANDS that you have played A LOT OF platformers, LIKE A LOT. It’s hard to deny this. Like I said, the platforming wasn’t too challenging for me but it was waiting for a player that just isn’t as skilled with these types of games. Quite honestly, I think I was more mad at the game than at my wife. I mean, the game clearly wants husbands and wives to play together, right? So, why not make it a little less challenging for newbies? Even though platforming was a huge part of the game, the game dipped it’s toes into almost all other genres. On almost every single level, not only will there be a new environment to navigate through but both players will receive level-specific power ups. Which ones did you like honey?Honestly, I liked almost all of them, especially because you always had to rely on the other player to get through a section. No matter how cool my own power was, it was useless if the other player wasn’t assisting. It’s one of this game’s best features in my opinion.Again, I liked almost all of them. I appreciate when the game keeps things fresh with the environments. With that said, the clock tower level and the music level can kiss my a**.Well, fortunately, the game is very forgiving with it’s checkpoints so we never spent too much time stuck on anything. What did you think of the mini-games? Personally, I thought they were a huge waste of time.Well, maybe if they actually did something for the game, but it’s just like you said, they were distractions. Glad you enjoyed them, though. Any favorites?So, honey, in your own honest opinion. Would you recommend this game to other couples?She is being too generous. I was a real ♥♥♥♥ to her during some harder ( ) sections. As for me, this is an easy recommendation. Not only is this game constantly changing the gameplay and keeping everything fresh but the way how co-op is absolutely essential in order to progress is what really sealed the deal for me.Now as for buying this game, it’s a bit expensive at full price. Fortunately, you can buy a month or two with EA Play and finish it that way, which I think is a better option. Regardless of how you get the game, I think it’s definitely worth playing. Any last comments, honey?(rolls eyes) I’m soooooo looking forward to that."
18,Mz Cookies,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mzcookies/,270,4,1,14.1,June,"18,",935,14,1,"Undoubtedly, It Takes Two is a coop masterpiece. Its extremely diverse gameplay is held to such a high standard from beginning to end. The visuals are stunning, the story is immersive, and the sound is memorable. Developed by Hazelight studios, the same developers that brought us the famous coop title ""A Way Out"", they prove once more, that the use of split screens can have a place in modern gaming.+ Exceptionally diverse, smooth and genre-bending gameplay.+ Detailed, gorgeous and bright visuals across a myriad of differing environments.+ Simple but relatable and charismatic story about marital woes.+ Copious interactive environments and mini-games to explore.+ Logical, simple puzzles to conquer.+ Friend's pass that allows friends to play the game for free with a player that owns the full copy of the game.- Remarkably easy with an awfully forgiving respawn system.Players are introduced to the dissolving relationship of Cody and May, an unhappily married couple. We witness their arguing and inability to get along, ultimately leading to the decision to tell their child about their looming divorce. This is where the craziness begins and where reality as we know it soon begins to evaporate. This chain of events ultimately causes the couple to transform into Rose's toy dolls. The two try their best to identify a possible cause for this sudden transformation and also brainstorm solutions. They do not get much time to consider their predicament before Dr Hakim ""Book of Love"" abruptly makes his appearance. With Rose's best interests at heart, he sets out almost obnoxiously optimistically to relight Cody and May's love. He sends them on many incredulous and bizarre quests with the goal of reigniting their passion, with each area forcing them to collaborate and understand each other to proceed. Driven by their desire to revert back to their own bodies and after working closely together, they slowly begin to see the value in each other. Realising each other's unique skills and passions which causes many old memories to arise, but is it enough to awaken their long lost love?The task of describing the gameplay of It Takes Two is a difficult one. It is perhaps one of the most varied, dynamic, and energetic games I have come across. Featuring too many genres to name, it masters everything it includes. Every level is a rollercoaster and seamlessly transitions through each element. From a top down section similar to , a fighting short scene akin to , and  gravity fuelled puzzles, reminiscent of  Each area almost feels and looks like a brand new game, it was just that unique. New weapons and abilities are constantly introduced throughout the game. These elements are only ever used temporarily, before being replaced with something else. Shoot down foes, reduce or enlarge your size at the click of a button, defy gravity with magnetic boots, slice enemies with a sickle and use a magnet to grip onto surfaces (or your partner). This is only a small selection of the differing aspects experienced throughout the game and the creative ideas do not stop here. Players also get to swing, fly, grapple and grind rails through the air with ease. Ride frogs, deep sea creatures, make friends and enemies, verse your partner in a variety of minigames and work together to solve puzzles. I was aptly blown away with the amount of sheer creativity seen in each and every level. Whilst the title shares a lot of similarities with other renowned games, the differing concepts are seamlessly combined, providing for a fresh and engaging experience.  It Takes Two is not designed to be difficult in any way. The whole premise is constructed so players glide through the levels with ease, never succumbing to fatigue or feeling bored, with constant new stimuli introduced to grasp players' attention. Despite this, it is important to note that with this in mind, the game is exceptionally and purposefully simple. You will die countless times, only to be respawned almost exactly in the same spot. Being hit with dramatic and seemingly deadly attacks is typically very forgiving and does not result in much damage. All guns have an automated lock on feature, there is no need to aim and so forth.Personally, I did not mind this. I enjoyed the relaxing and childish nature of the game. This stress free approach also ensured I was never frustrated, stressed or bored.  Those looking for a challenging coop game, this is not it. What it lacks in challenge, it more than makes up for with its engaging story and one-of-a-kind masterful coop gameplay.It Takes Two features a unique ""Friend's Pass"" system which allows anyone to download the full game. If both players do not own the full game, the first chapter can still be played at no cost to either party. If one person owns a copy of the full game and invites a friend who has downloaded the friend's pass, it is all free for the coop partner. There is no need for 2 people to purchase the game. Not only does this feature vitally increase accessibility, but it is also a fantastic and magnanimous move by developers, one I very much appreciate. For those interested in lag and connectivity issues, I played this online from Australia, with my coop partner being in the UK. Despite being at opposing regions of the globe, gameplay remained explicitly smooth. Perhaps the only fault could be the rare delay in cutscenes, but actual gameplay was unaffected.Majority of the game is experienced in typical split screen fashion; however, the camera angles are constantly changing, sometimes through a top down view or a shared screen for cutscenes. Each chapter is visually stunning, vibrant and immensely detailed. It maintains the child-like themes and brings household items to life, giving personalities to kitchen items, plants, tools and more. The metaphoric representation is hilarious, obvious and relatable. Ranging from exploring a winter wonderland (inside a snowglobe), the deep sea or infiltrating the wasps inner lair, each area provides a different and visually appealing aesthetic.   The voice acting is exceptionally well done, delivered with emphatic emotion and allows players to better relate to the characters relationship woes and concerns. The entire soundtrack is exhilarating, particularly during boss battles and just like the rest of the game, is ever-changing.There are not enough words to adequately explain the experience of It Takes Two. Featuring extremely varied and diverse gameplay, it stands out among other coop games as a true masterpiece. Its high-quality production proves that the once hated split screen still has a place in modern gaming. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for an unforgettable coop experience. For 12-15+ hours of playtime and a pricetag of $AU49.95, it is well worth it and deserves the many accolades it has already received.This review copy was provided to the Devils in the Detail curator."

We got about 14 hours of game play in to beat the entire game BUT there are definitely things we didn't go all the way through with (like all the mini-games). The music, the art, the character design, game mechanics, and settings were all gorgeously done. We had SO much fun in this game. With each level comes new items to use and new evasive maneuvers to participate in. Each character you meet is so unique and moves the story along in an exciting way. This game is definitely worth the $40. We aren't sure what next game we will play together after moving from this one because this one made such a positive impression on us. Definitely recommend!"

As others have said, it is an excellent cooperative multiplayer game with very satisfying controls, varied levels, and superb production values in art and audio.Aside from these things, what stood out to me was the game's decency.  It is *anti*-exploitative, quite deliberately excluding features like collectibles (let alone microtransactions) or character advancement that are predicated on Skinner box treatment of the player.  Rather than finding ways to  more from the player (money, time, etc.), the developers have found ways to  more to the player, with many small delights to be found.  In addition to not exploiting the player, the game doesn't exploit its characters -- only very occasionally playing the cheap tropes that the game's set-up would tend to invite.  The game's narrative may lack subtlety and surprise, but its straightforward positive message never feels preachy, perhaps because the scenario is so ridiculous.It is rare to play a big-budget game (the credits go on FOREVER!) that seems to have as its goal that players will find a fun, full, satisfying experience and go away better than they came."

There are also mini games to add some level of competition so its not always about working together. There is a roller coaster of emotions and the game itself is definitely worth the price.

This is probably the best representative work of the ninth art of the game: game content that can be enjoyed by any age, shocking camera movement and animation, rich and detailed scene design, fine modeling, wonderful music, and philosophical content of the story, and most importantly as a game, it has very creative gameplay and top-level design.It is generally believed that there is a close connection between this work and A way out. The two games have many similarities in gameplay, but in this one, you can see a leap in game quality. This game is undoubtedly suitable for people of any age, even if they are not very interested in games, they could enjoy it a lot.This game is simply too good. But in my opinion, the only shortcoming is that the plot is not too impressive-and this may also be a compromise for all ages. The most impressive thing about this game is the ability that coordinate between characters on different levels. I never felt bored and tired throughout the game, and I was always shocked by the creator's creative ideas. And since the game director is also a movie screenwriter, you can enjoy a visual feast that is no less than a Hollywood movie experience.No matter what kind of gamer you are, this game is definitely worth a try, and it will not let you down. If there are a few shortcomings of this game, apart from the fact that the plot is difficult to impress the players deeply, I am afraid that you must need a friend to play -after all, you can't play a co-op game alone, isn't it?"

60,Tamaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tho545454/,194,7,1,11.4,April,"17,",918,27,1,"(ITT) is an experimental co-op only game set in the present times. The story is about May and Cody, a couple that has seen their relationship progressively deteriorate over time, bringing them close to divorce. This triggers deep suffering in their only daughter - so much in fact, that it awakens an unknown magical force, that transfers her parents' consciousnesses into two animated dolls. The two will have to work together in order to regain their real bodies - and maybe, find love again along the path.ITT manages to deliver a fairytale-inspired general setting, that branches off with diverse locations, ranging from lush forests to castle dungeons and intricate clockworks. The level of detail and care in their realization is impressive, as in some cases, entire miniature cities ripe with details, minigames (and even NPCs!) were created just for boosting immersion. Textures, effects, animations and everything else are of the highest caliber, up to par with 2021 AAA release levels.There is no other game in my knowledge, that mashed together so many genres in a row, and successfully at that. Mainly, this title focuses on puzzles and platforming which are seen a lot during the adventure - however, each stage has several unique segments that transport players into an entirely new gameplay style: Action RPG, Shooter, Fighting, Boss Fights and much more. Such an astounding bouquet, keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting at all times.That's right! In a time plagued with DLCs, micro-transactions, live service games and whatever other hogwash, it's refreshing to see a developer committed to give players value for their money. Anyone who purchases the game, will be able to invite any of their friends to play along the whole adventure, for free. This can be used on multiple people even, if needed, not just once.The acting of the two main characters is spot-on, as it feels emotional and involving at all times. Secondary characters as well sit on a solid level: there is definitely good quality work in this aspect, across the board. Music and effects that encompass each stage feel appropriate, manage to emphasize the action or scene at hand in the right ways, most of the time. Even if ITT's narrative takes major inspiration from fairy-tales, and has a goofy, humorous tone most of the time, it doesn't shy away from some segments that are instead very unsettling. For instance, there will be a part where the protagonists will proceed to . These parts are all the more impressive, because of their stark contrast with the general theme.The choice of separating the view-area in two would be understandable, for local matches on the same computer - however it proves bizarre for online ones on two separate machines. Even if it is helpful to look in the other player's screen (sometimes), that's never a mandatory mechanic, so ultimately ITT could do without the screen-splitting. Especially on smaller monitors like the ones of laptops, the size reduction certainly could prove uncomfortable.My usual Gameplay Breakdown cannot be applied to It Takes Two, as it mixes-and-matches so many genres, making a full breakdown of each would prove nigh impossible, other than a spoiler as well., ITT puts high emphasis on Platformer and Puzzle Game: in each stage, there will be multiple obstacle courses that often will need the combination of the two players' different tools or powers, in order to overcome them. The difficulty curve of such enigmas and platforming sections gently soars, first to accustom players to the new mechanics, and then leaving them free to use them at their full potential. However do not expect a hardcore challenge, as the game is more oriented towards an average / casual audience - which is fine, as it's not *too* easy, anyway. vary for each level, and in many cases they are unique, non-repeating sections with their own, specific gameplay mechanics. For instance, one of them will have players being able to manipulate their body size and gravity respectively, while another one will see Cody pilot an aircraft while May mans the turret to fend off attackers. Multiply cases like this for the totality of the game's duration, and the result is amazing variety. are found throughout the adventure, and put Cody and May against each other in small, competitive-oriented challenges. Also in this case, each minigame is unique and original, can be replayed unlimited times, and some of them will even change or become more difficult as the rounds go on. Winning or losing them doesn't give anything to the victor, they're just for fun's sake, a diversion. Certain side activities though, have unique achievements related to them.Sure, players can die during a boss fight, a platforming section, or any of the unique combat-oriented ones - although a game over only triggers when both are dead at the same time: the blessing of immortality allows both to quickly resurrect if defeated. Checkpoints are anyway very frequent and forgiving, even boss fights will checkpoint at every new phase's start, so losing progress in a frustrating way is not an issue."

Ever since, I played hundreds... thousands of games. This game is something else. It's majestic game design. Seriously, no one has ever done a better coop game than this one. The way the story unfolds, the characters, the topics they discuss. Even the message the game sent! It's incredibly well written.And the most important thing: Game mechanics. The game introduces scenarios and mechanics that quickly get discarded before it turns repetitive. Every new segment of the game is worthy of wonder, both by its visual but also by surprise: they always make you do something different, unique. Something that the game will never let you do again. It's like playing 15 different games under the same premise.The only aspect you have to consider is that this game is better for couples. Playing it with a friend is fun, but you'll be missing a lot of references to the relationship with your couple.Do yourself a favor and play this game as soon as you can."

65,PK,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pk-fire/,82,3,1,12.9,September,"19,",331,0,1,"It's been a long time since I've played a game like It Takes Two. Very few games are able to truly understand the meaning of a cooperative experience. A lot of games tout ""co-op"" as a major feature of the game, but it never expands past the fact that you can play the game with your friends. Games like It Takes Two and Portal 2 aren't like that. This game is not functional without a friend and it takes full advantage of that fact. I highly recommend picking this game up especially since your friend can hitch a ride with you for free with the Friend's Pass or Steam Remote Play.Gameplay has always been the biggest selling point of any video game and It Takes Two does not disappoint. It's a cooperative puzzle platformer at its core, but don't let that brief description fool you. It Takes Two is constantly throwing gameplay elements from every possible genre to keep things fresh for the whole experience. One moment you're playing a third person shooter with an extremely deadly combo attack and the next moment you're playing a top-down RPG with magic spells. Every chapter of the game gives you a new toy to play with and each mechanic is flushed out to its fullest potential. There was one moment when I thought an area's gimmick was fairly boring with the magnets, but then shortly after I was given a turret that fired magnets that were used to traverse a massive wall. The sheer amount of genres displayed here makes It Takes Two look like a love letter to video games as a whole. And that's not even mentioning the fact that each player gets a different toy to play with. The only exception is the magnet level, but every chapter gives both Cody and May a different tool and mechanic to play around with. Let's use the shooter chapter I mentioned earlier as an example: Cody gets a goop gun that stuns enemies and May gets a flare gun that ignites bugs. And that's where the beautiful cooperative elements come into play, combining those two guns together creates a massive explosion that instantly kills most enemies. It Takes Two's fearlessness when it comes to new mechanics and the fact that the two playable characters offer different experiences makes it so this game has amazing replay value. Movement is another thing the game loves to play around with. There are tons of different vehicles for you to operate in drastically different methods. And that's not to say the game is weak without these mechanics, the core platforming and puzzle solving are strong in their own right. Every puzzle felt very natural and my friend and I never once had to look up a guide when we got stumped. Overall, the game design showcased here is an absolute marvel.Something I wasn't expecting to praise this game for is the artwork and environmental design. While the normal human models are kind of uncanny to look at to me, I think the toy models you actually play as and everything else look really nice! All of the artwork is fairly pretty and what I believe should be the standard for modern AAA games. There's a lot of attention to texture and detail for every model in the game and I really appreciate that. I swear it's good but it's hard to write ""This fur looks like actual real-life fur"" for too long. What I was really taken aback by was the amount of unique environments that were explored. I was worried that the game was going to entirely take place inside the house and everything was just going to be navigating furniture. That fear was quickly shot away as soon as I started exploring the inside of a tree-cave-like-system and inevitably found my way to a medieval castle. One of my personal favorite environments was the use of a snowy wasteland village that entirely took place inside of a snow-globe. It's a treat that the environments are as varied as the game design. And for a platformer, it's pretty important that the environment you navigate is interesting to look around for where you need to go to next. Oh and a quick note: I recommend turning off the soundtrack and listening to your own music of choice. The soundtrack isn't all that engaging and it's very cliche at some moments.However, my biggest complaint for It Takes Two has to be the game's story and writing. The plot is simple, Cody and May are getting a divorce and The Book of Love is a magical entity trying to get them to fall back in love. A love story would sort of imply that the main characters would have some actual chemistry, but I didn't believe Cody and May liked each other (even as just friends) for a single moment. It was very weird for them to be constantly at each other's throats and blaming each other for every little thing only for them to get back together seemingly out of nowhere in the final chapter. There was no build-up to that moment. There wasn't a slow second spark of love, they just went a complete 180 on their opinion of each other in the span of a few minutes. There was even a moment where my friend and I mocked Cody for complaining that May isn't at home because she's paying the bills. Cody and May in general aren't very interesting characters anyways, as they boil down to the stay-at-home mom and stay-at-work dad tropes with the genders swapped. Dr. Hakim was also an extremely annoying character that the game wanted me to like, but he only filled the role of an irritating antagonist up until the final chapter. Tone is something I think It Takes Two struggles with. It's a divorce story with profane language, but with such a childish attitude and understanding of the whole situation, so much so that it got to the point that it was actually humorous. There was a major plot point where the couple decided the best course of action was to make their daughter cry and that was eventually followed with one of the darkest scenes I've seen recently. If you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about and it was completely out of nowhere to me. Both my friend and I didn't care for the story at all and we actively wished for a different outcome in regards to the ending. It's really hard to care about a love story when both of the main characters are insufferable and hate each other.Overall, It Takes Two is worth the $40 price point. It was really surprising to see EA publish a genuinely good game, although that's most likely because they had little involvement in the creative process. It Takes Two is a wonderful experience that I enjoyed from start to finish. There wasn't a single dull moment in the 12 hour playtime."
66,Eraserhead Baby,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054775337/,70,1,1,26.0,February,"26,",70,0,1,"I never write real reviews for games but this honestly the first time I ever really felt compelled to write something that had such an impact on how I view the medium of Cooperative games.When I first heard of the game I was shocked to realize it was from Josef Fares (A Way Out, The Game Awards “♥♥♥♥ The Oscars” guy (legend).) I had known him firstly from when Jerma985 played A Way Out on stream with a friend and thought of the concept of how Josef tackled Co-op games was interesting; something that was in real need of innovation because it always just feels like an afterthought with most games. While the way it was tackled was interesting, I thought the gameplay itself was more or less lacking in comparison to the story and ideas that they kept serving up to the two playing. Finally It Takes Two was announced and honestly at first I thought it looked corny and such a weird departure from the more serious tone Josef’s game had in the past. I was cautiously optimistic regardless of my really baseless first impression because as we know from Josef, passion and determination run through that man’s blood like water runs through a river. After waiting for a while since launch and somewhat keeping an eye on the game, I was shocked to see the sheer amount of positive reviews for the game (and the bad takes from negative reviews from people who played like, 1 hour of the game that took me nearly 15 to finish.) I decided to take a chance on the game, to get myself out of the rut of playing my usual 3-4 games I do. I bought a copy for my best friend and I for their birthday after casually mentioning it here and there. I wasn’t too pleased with Origin integration (side note, ♥♥♥♥ game launchers, stop making us launch from 2 separate things!) but I knew it was just a necessary minor inconvenience in order to play.Let me tell you, the reviews do not lie about how fantastic this game is. From the first moments you can move around you feel how fluid the 3D platforming is, coupled with the beautiful graphics and genuinely fun gameplay. I was actually impressed from the first level of the game. It was such a simple idea turned into this adorable, fun and quirky adventure between this couple trying to fix their broken relationship. The various game elements that shift every chapter to add constant variety without feeling overwhelming having to adapt to how you face new challenges. Level design is so creative and fun that every new area just kept me filled with awe as I constantly wondered how they could possibly top the previous area. I could talk more about the story, gameplay, levels, concepts all day but I would be afraid of spoiler territory for folks who are questioning whether or not to get this. It’s hard for me to remember the last time I had my face light up in surprise or like, genuine fun over experiencing a game. The memories you have with the person you play with could go on and on. There are many games that influence this, because in art we’re always informed by the things we’re inspired by; but few actually are able to mold the medium to create something so compelling and fun. It was an experience from front to back that was so much fun and I’m happy I got to experience it with someone."

72,Colonel Patrick Sanders,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ColonelPatrickSanders/,89,2,1,14.9,May,"12,",767,1,1,"I remember I played the previous game from Hazelight Studios “A way out” a couple of years ago with a friend, and we absolutely loved the concept. A game focused around co-op with a good story, where you need to help each other out to get further all while being able to see each other's screen. So naturally we got hyped as soon we heard about It Takes Two.So ever since the trailer I’ve been keeping an eye on this game, and recently me and a friend finally had some time to start it. From the beginning we were instantly blown away. You follow the story of Cody and May. They get shrunk down and need to find a way to get back to their normal human size. As you get shrunk down, everyday stuff like a book, a closet or a bed suddenly become huge, and this is where for me personally the magic lies in the story/environments of It Takes Two.Gameplay feels great. Movement is really well done, interaction with objects is good and during the game you get a wide variety of weapons and abilities. The game mixes combat, platforming, racing and much more really well. And not only mechanics change, perspective also changes. From third person, to 2D, to top-down. Everything is blended together perfectly. Never once during the game I felt like mechanics became boring.The story of It Takes Two is also really well done. It’s interesting, entertaining, has humor and the further you get, the more you start to actually live with the characters, and understand them.Environments are definitely the strength of It Takes Two. As I said above you walk around in everyday scenarios such as a garden, a bedroom, a childrens playroom etc. The twist is, because you’re so small all these environments get a complete other dynamic. Suddenly you’re spending tens of minutes just to climb a bed, that small garden with plants becomes its own world where squirrels are bigger than you, you become friends with spiders and that small pond becomes a real challenge to cross. Not only are environments interesting, original and well thought through, they’re also filled with easter eggs, minigames and fun little interactions. I highly recommend taking a minute and exploring every corner of a map. You’ll find so many small interactions and details that make you smile. This has to be one of the most detailed games I’ve ever played.Ambiance wise this game is amazing. It has beautiful graphics, environments are jam packed with details and music/sound effects are excellent. From the main music, to character voices to small details like walking over a piano and actually hearing each key have its own tone. Props to the developers for the amount of detail.For me, It Takes Two is one of the best, if not the best game I’ve played in the last few years. I enjoyed every bit of it and played from beginning till the end with a big smile on my face. I encountered only 1 bug(visual one) and the game is actually quite long for the amount of content you have. It took me and my friend 15 hours. I recommend everyone who likes co-op games to buy this. Especially because whether you play local or online, only 1 person needs to buy this. The other person can either join through local play or the free friend pass. This is a game I will remember for a lifetime."

77,Grubby Shinoda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/grubbyshinoda/,86,6,1,35.2,July,"10,","1,442",2,1,"is definitely the best co-op games I’ve ever played! It has had to be the game of the year to me so far. It is really amazing and breathtaking.There are few such excellent two-player co-screen games on the market. I’ve played  which is also published by EA before and it is a great co-op game too with a refreshing gameplay and a dramatic story. Until this year,  refreshes players’ perception once again. It has richer interactive content and much greater gameplay.The two protagonists, May and Cody, are a couple with a rift in their relationship. When the couple was about to divorce, their daughter wished that their parents would not be separated, which triggered the power of application to allow the souls of their parents to be attached to a pair of dolls that are made of wood and clay. Shocked, they could only temporarily form a wartime alliance in order to recover their bodies, and stumbled into a big adventure.With bright colors and cute character modeling, the overall plot tone of the game is relaxed and cheerful. However, part of the plot in the game also exposes the utilitarianism and selfishness in the adult world. For example, the first BOSS vacuum cleaner lost its sanity under the promise that the husband and wife would repair it again and again, and turned into a monster. Finally, the eye-catching violent execution method is just like the 18 prohibition inserted in a children’s picture book which makes the scalp numb.The difficulty design of the game is generally relatively friendly, and the condition for failure is that both characters must fall into a state of disability. When one player is in a state of being unable to move, click the button continuously to fill the ""heart"" in the center of the screen and it will appear on the battlefield again. Even if both of the players fail, don’t’ worry too much. The game has many save points and will not bring severe punishments that will require a long run from the start once you fail.The settings of each level are just right. From the beginning to the end, all the content will not be told to you in a moment. Basically, it guides us step by step, and when we reach the right opportunity, we begin to freely explore the pattern we are looking for. We will gradually learn a lesson from exploration and adventures.Each level will have different gameplay and different props. Basically, it needs two people to coordinate at the same time to use it. Players can also use their own props to spoof each other, which is really interesting.The decryption aspect is also considered part of this game. The overall difficulty is not very difficult. It can be researched with a little thought. Every location needs time to explore and research to get through.The game itself also has a lot of challenges and a certain degree of difficulty, which adds more fun to this game. There are many different mini-games in different levels. If two people find the mini-game, they will start the game. Of course most of the games require a pair of fast hands.There will be a boss battle in every level, and every boss’s style of play is painstakingly designed. I personally think that the battle is more repetitive, but in fact it is not very boring. Many of them require two coordinated operations. The overall difficulty is not very high, but it also tests the game operation ability of two players.I hope there will be more similar games on the market."

Because obviously every single set in the game is a romantic scene where you want stay forever. You never get bored as long as the story's moving and you never feel lonely cuz there's always someone watching your back or someone you need to attentively take care of. My partner and I live 6000 miles away from each other and have an upside-down time difference, we're like an international team. So in real life we most likely won't be able to have any intersections. But it just doesn't matter cuz in the game, I can throw my butt at her face anytime she makes a noob move and murders me. My partner is not even an English speaker, so if someday she happens to see this review, my ridiculous crush on her probably have already faded away, but the beautiful and lovely memory of this incredible journey won't."

We couldn't believe some of the things we saw (Cutie). The absolute horror, dear gawd....we will never forget lol. I haven't played a co-op game this clever since ""A Way Out"". The mechanics stay fresh as they keep changing, and they are implemented in really fun and imaginative ways. Ways I've never seen before. Sometimes we stopped moving forward just to have fun goofing around and enjoying whatever mechanic was being implemented at the time. There are mini games littered throughout that are all a blast to play (at least once), and they let you take a break from working together for some friendly competition/feud building.The controls are responsive, and the graphics are pretty damn good especially if you have the hardware for it. We had a lot of laughs with the characters and the writing, and the voice acting was spot on. Everything feels top notch. I do have small gripes though. First is with the audio. It's happened probably 3 or 4 times during our 16hr playthrough. Sometimes the audio would go out and never return, or go out and return when the sequence changed, then go out again when the sequence changed again. The only fix for this was a hard restart. We've also had UE4 crashes, and even a game breaking bug that we fixed by restarting and doing the sequence over like 3 times. While most of the experience was smooth, it DID happen enough to start slightly getting under our skin at certain points.As a package though I'd still recommend this game to couples or people in long term relationships. It's a great co-op game period, but I think couples will definitely get the most out of it. If your relationship is currently on the rocks due to games like Overcooked, this game will have you sailing off into the sunset again. Best to wait for a sale though as there are indeed a few bugs, and your mileage may vary."

Also, allowing a free friend pass to play with a friend, amazing!I loved A Way Out and I love this. Really, this game has raised the bar and as long as they keep making them, people like myself who love these will keep buying them, really it is a work of art to play and experience a well written story!Graphics: The graphics of the game are pretty unique and visually gorgeous to look at, really. There are some great effects that really set the bar to something awesome. There are lots of little detailing in the game that makes it amazing from sparks to glowing effects etc etcAudio: The audio of the game from the voice acting to the sound effects, it's all spot on really good to listen too, the audio alone is a masterpiece.Controls: Super easy to pickup, change your keys and get used too with very easy character control.Gameplay and everything else: The game is a 2 player co-op puzzle solving master peice. Each level is completely different from the last and it builds upon a story of a young girl who's parent are divorcing and her tears basically turn you into the puppets, there is where I will leave it with no spoilers, but you go through basically trying to rebuild your relationship with a Mexican book of love, why is he Mexican? I do not know but it's amusing.The puzzles in the game are unique and all over the place, each map, zone and area changes to completely new every time so when you are going through, you do not get the feeling it's rinse and repeat, it's all different style of puzzles every part of the map, plus you get some mini-games along the way to find and compete against your friend, which makes the game enjoyable.Overall, the story, art style, sound, gameplay is just amazing and one hell of a great purchase for anyone looking to play something different.You can be zipping along a zip line to running for your life to solving a puzzle to defeating a boss, to sucking the eyes out of a hoover... I laughed so much because it was dark but appealing to my humour to beating a monkey boss with a gun, FUN.Would I recommend the game? 100% Yes, the game is worth full price and discounting this game is an insult because it's just superb and deserves the positive scoring it's got all over the place.My only issue is in the trailer you can see the top down spell and warrior scene, I would love that as a full style Diablo game, which would be awesome!"

Its gameplay is 100% dependent on each other as both players need to rely on one another to accomplish tasks and complete levels (each player has to be fairly competent since one can't carry the other throughout the entire game), a lesson that both protagonists need to learn in the game's narrative. I found the abrasive engineer wife x whiney nature-lover husband dynamic unrealistic, which I feel is the biggest flaw with this game, but they're both annoying [together] and no doubt serve to drive the point home about their marital conflict and toxicity within their coupling. Dr. Hakim also gets pretty grating as the over-the-top talking book but at least his heart's in the right place. The daughter character, who sets this whole adventure in motion, is probably the most sympathetic character of the lot and maybe even the most relatable for many. Gameplay wise there's a plethora of diverse mechanics and genre styles including both 2D and 3D platforming, race and escape sections, third-person shooting, and lots of puzzles. You'll never get bored or tired because there's so much variety and no section ever overstays its welcome. This is one of those games that'll have you smiling from ear-to-ear and get you right in your nostalgia feels. Take a pass on the couples therapy and buy this for a one-time fee of $40 (or less), it'll save you tons of psychiatry bills in the long-run...and if you can't complete this game together, then you might be better off apart.

On the surface, it looks like a normal third-person platformer and that's what it is for the most part but it definitely isn't all the game is offering.The game has a great variety of sections. A great selection of sections you can select.There are chapters where the game plays like a third-person shooter. You and your friend each get a gun with unique abilities that you use to shoot down enemies and get through obstacles. There's also a lot of puzzle-solving, side-scrolling, fighting, racing, all kinds of platforming (they get really creative with platforming sections), and even a ""Diablo-like"" hack 'n' slash chapter where you and your friend play as a wizard and a knight. In this hack 'n' slash chapter you both have different abilities and the entire chapter is in an isometric view.There are also a bunch of mini-games to be found. In mini-games, you compete against each other in various challenges such as ice skating, target shooting, snowball fighting, etc.Mini-games are really fun and a great way to breathe from the oh-so chaotic and over-the-top fast-paced campaign.I say chaotic and fast-paced and the game is all that but it's also pretty casual and fun so don't be frightened by those scary words. It Takes Two is a great game for both ""gaming veterans"" and people who are new to gaming.From time to time you also end up in these big sandbox areas. You can explore around in those areas freely and exploring them is extremely rewarding and satisfying. You can stumble upon easter eggs, secret platforming sections, find previously mentioned mini-games and just discover both cute and funny stuff to interact with. 99% of the achievements are earned by exploring so be aware of that if you care about achievements. Completing the campaign gets you only one achievement out of 20!What about the story? Is it any good?The short answer to those questions is YES.The story is quite simple and pretty straightforward but it's also a pretty good story.It's funny, heartwarming, and even a bit traumatic at times. Poor Cutie - Those who know, know.You play as Cody and May. A married couple is about to divorce each other. You both go to take a nap after another one of your married couple's fights and you wake up as dolls.In order to get back to your real human bodies, you have to reignite the passion for each other, and to do that you have to work together. COLLABORATION is the keyword.The characters are well written, the humor is top-notch and never feels forced, and overall just great casual and family-friendly fun. It Takes Two is a breath of fresh air in terms of storytelling and combat alike.Definitely worth the full price not to mention only one person needs to buy the game and your friends can just download the free friend pass to play with you.There's also split-screen co-op which I used to play this gem of a game with my girlfriend and it was a truly pleasant experience. I know some people think your PC has to run two games at once when playing games in split-screen but that isn't true. Ran perfectly fine in 1440p, everything maxed out at 120fps.It's a great game to play with your friends but I'd say you definitely should play it with your girlfriend/boyfriend."

The new mechanics that come into play are not a gimmick at all, are well thought out, easy to pick up, and coincide with the level-design.

The plot of the story is probably the worst part about it but it's not that bad. The graphics, music, gameplay, and everything in between are absolutely great.

126,Snort Cannon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/,56,2,1,18.9,April,"12,","3,329",4,1,"The absolute mad man that is Josef Farres is back with yet another pure co-op adventure.Story:The story of It Takes Two follows on two characters, Cody and May (you pick which one you want to play as in the opening minutes of the game). Their marriage is on the rocks and they are planning on getting a divorce. When your young daughter Rose hears of this, she runs off and begs for her parents to stay together and when she sheds her tears on two dolls, Cody and May consciousness are transported into the dolls. A book Rose owns named Dr. Hakim is your guide into exploring the crazy world around you while you try to save your marriage. The story of It Takes Two is absolutely delightful and is filled to the brim with plenty of magical moments and crazy set pieces that just create a one of a kind experience. The writing is top notch and the banter between the two leads is great and hilarious as they bicker constantly. There's plenty of laugh out loud moments as well and with how crazy the story gets at times, you will certainly going to crack up at the antics of the characters. Graphics:Graphically It Takes Two is a really brilliant looking game. You go through plenty of different environments and all of them feel incredibly alive to the point where taking some time off and exploring your surroundings just to take all of it in is just amazing. Going through winter wonderlands, toy sets, outer space and the wilderness is just amazing and some of the environments in the game are absolutely stunning.The design of Cody and May is also incredibly simplistic yet quite charming. They definitely look like something a kid would make out of spare parts and play with them, with some rough edges on them. Other NPC's you encounter through the game are also really unique and you visit plenty of environments through the game and their inhabitants differ in each location you visit to match the themes of the area, with tons of attention to detail. Audio:The audio design of It Takes Two is also incredibly top notch. The voice acting is incredible across the board and every single actor nails their characters. It's filled to the brim with charm and emotion that makes the experience that much more enjoyable when playing. The music is also incredibly charming, from relaxing tracks to awesome intense tracks during the more action packed moments of the game. Not to mention there's an entire chapter themed after music which has some of the best music in the game. Gameplay:Back when A Way Out came out, Josef Farres stated in interviews that the game would never have the same activity twice in a row, so in each level you would always do something new. I was shocked that this statement was true and It Takes Two takes that idea to an even new extreme. On the surface level It Takes Two is a 3D Platformer where you and your friend need to work together as a team to make it through the dangerous environments as you try to restore your marriage. You do plenty of jumping on platforms, however each level takes it up a notch and introduces a new gameplay element to keep things fresh from level to level. For example in one level the main two characters get two different tools with Cody getting a nail which he throw and make a platform for May to use, while May gets a hammer that allows you to destroy items and allows you to swing on the before mentioned nails. Once the level is done you get an entirely new set of mechanics like weapons, or super powers and that changes gameplay in major ways.Some of these moments are just purely amazing and you need to see them yourself to actually believe that yes that actually did just happen. Each chapter just gets increasingly more amazing and honestly that's where I will stop as not to spoil the amazing surprises this game has hidden for you to find.Now to break up the tedium of the story you can find plenty of other thing around the world like spots where you can interact with things like cameras, a painting canvas and a printer, etch a sketch and plenty of other things. One thing that was pretty popular in A Way Out was the competition mini games. Every so often Leo and Vincent will come across a friendly competition to take a break of them escaping from police. Cody and May also find these things scattered around the world. There's around 25 mini games you can find throughout the entire game and some of these are just tons of fun. One of these games me and my teammate found ourselves going back to even after finishing the game it was just that much fun and we had tons of fun competing against each other. However a few of these aren't that great, but that's like 2 mini games out of 25.Verdict:It Takes Two is pure and simple a borderline masterpiece. It's an amazing game that sparked so much joy and fun that most games wish they could do. If you have a friend or family member to tag along for the ride the experience is one of a kind and I have no trouble recommending it. Apart from minor technical hiccups like frame drops in certain areas, this game is pretty much perfect in my eyes and worth the money. Josef, wherever you take us next in your next crazy adventure, I will be there Day 1. Final Rating:10/10Pros:+ Incredibly charming and funny story+ Visuals are stunning+ Great audio design+ Each level is tons of fun and adds new mechanics to keep things fresh+ Mini games provide a nice palette cleanser+ Adding a pro just for that one easter eggCons:N/AIf you liked this review please consider following our groups and curator pages at  and"

The amount of content could easily be split between 2 games. The levels, mechanics, world, humor, heartfelt and pure fun this game gives, makes me not care that it’s a casual baby game in terms of challenge that I slam other games for. Here it’s so non-gamers can take part in a once in a lifetime game that will be forever loved by all and sets a new bar for co-op design."

The story and setting make it feel like a children movie with high production quality, yet the game offers decent difficulty for new and avid gamers.

They bicker and argue and have started to drift apart. Deciding enough is enough they agree to divorce.Their daughter Rose is upset that they are unhappy and feels a little neglected. To replace the love she is missing, she plays with a couple of dolls that she has made in her parent’s image. One day, after a particularly bad argument that she overhears, she confides in her dolls once again. A tear of sadness drops onto the dolls which magically transporting her parents’ life essence into them. Enter Dr Hakim, the book of love. He is tasked to remind Cody and May why they fell in love and sends them on a series of adventures reminiscing good times and rectifying the problems in their relationship.Cody and May must find a way back into their real bodies and maybe fix their relationship along the way.Its gameplay is incredibly varied and the story is wonderfully conceived. Presentation is top drawer with superbly drawn characters and environments, and flawless voice acting which is full of emotion. The main characters are incredibly likeable, especially Dr Hakim who is absolutely hilarious with his stereotypical Spanish flair and over exuberance. He will have you constantly laughing at his antics.Cody and May are portrayed quite sympathetically with their ongoing marital issues. The relationship problems are revealed in quite an adult fashion with an array of emotions acted surprisingly well. The game cleverly uses these relationship moments to drive the gameplay, and their trials and tribulations are played out in a wide variety of genres.The gameplay is so diverse. Almost every single genre of action gaming is covered, and it is all done well. The only criticism I would give is that sometimes platforming can be made more difficult by poor depth perception. There is not always a shadow to gauge character’s landings on jumps. If you die, it is not long before you are back in the game and starting roughly in the same place you died. This can sometimes behave erratically though. On a couple of occasions, I bypassed puzzles completely because I died and respawned next to my playing partner, circumventing my part of the puzzle.It's a great co-op experience. I think voice chat is essential however. It would be very difficult to play this effectively without verbal communication. The game is not easy but it certainly isn’t difficult either. I thought it was challenging in places but mostly you should be able to complete whatever the game throws at you without too much hassle. It Takes Two is designed to flow. It is constantly moving you along and it never feels frustrating. Its main objective is to make you have fun and that involves giving you a helpful hand whenever possible. You will die a lot, but respawns are generous and any progress gained is continued where you left off. The actual gameplay can be difficult and quite frantic but the inclusion of these benefits means you’ll complete tasks eventually and keep moving forward. This creates a cleverly paced game and manages to keep it fresh and varied throughout.Gameplay revolves around the story of Cody and May’s relationship.Dr Hakim, Book of love, is in charge and sets the couple tasks to try and rekindle their marriage and remind them why they fell in love.He introduces the level in a hilarious fashion. Typically, you have to make it to a certain point on the map by using your abilities and performing platforming elements. The special abilities are always changing depending on your environment. For example, Dr Hakim suggests that passion has been lost in your relationship. Cody used to love gardening so one level is set in your garden. The abilities revolve around the scene too, so Cody can control plants whilst May can water plants so that they grow for Cody to climb. You are constantly working together in true co-op fashion. Each level follows a different theme with new abilities to master. The abilities will always complement each other and ensure that you need to work as a team to complete your goals.Some abilities remain constant however. The couple can always run and perform double jumps and dashes. These are useful to navigate larger jumps and avoid enemies during boss fight scenes.The levels are incredibly well designed and integrate into the story perfectly. There are so many nice touches and small details that make all the difference. It’s fun just to go around the levels pressing buttons to see what they do or interact with objects. It usually results in something funny happening. It’s up to you how long you spend in each level though. The path is usually obvious so you can either mess around or just get on with it.The game should take between eleven and fifteen hours to complete depending on how much you interact with the levels. There are numerous achievements which will also add time but you’ll probably need a guide as they are not obvious to get.The game is so much fun that you could easily play it again and not get bored. The visuals are superb.Characters are very well drawn and feel incredibly life like.The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed around a theme. They look gorgeous and are very detailed.Voice acting is astounding. The characters emotional range is quite impressive, from moments of personal reflection to jokes and japes. It all sounds realistic and entertaining.Special effect noises are also amazing."

I played this with my GF and the whole journey could be simply described as an emotional roller coaster but to only highlight its heartfelt story  would be to understate its well deserved acclaim. Imbued with the spirit of animated films during my childhood, it captured what it was that made those experiences magical. The fun gameplay can only be complemented by its brilliant level design which as a whole is a pallete for the senses. Whether it's the wacky thrills or moments of serene melancholy. Whatever it was, the game design intends to make the player feel certain emotions to outstanding effect. It's detailed in places where it doesn't have to be and the fact that the devs went the extra mile for a game of this genre, shows how much heart and soul was poured into this.

I got this game through EA Play to play with my girlfriend and both me and her are absolutely loving the experience so far. The mini-games are goofy and fun, the puzzles are good, relatively ""easy"" but not too easy either where you just zoom through everything, but not too hard either where you end up getting frustrated. When you die, you do not feel like you are punished either, which massively helps the game being an overall smooth and fun experience. As far as visuals go, the world is BEAUTIFUL and with a mind like mine that is capable of appreciating a very child-like enviroment, will leave you in awe at times. Visually this is a beautiful game, no ifs or buts. Also I applaud EA - not every day you hear someone say that - for having the friend's pass, where only one person needs to buy it in order to play it with a friend or loved one. This system is brilliant and should be present in more games. Without a doubt my favourite co-op game!

The story is simple but meaningful. It's about working together to solve problems that arise, and it emphasizes the importance of dedicating both the time and the effort that are necessary in order to nurture and maintain a loving, strong and healthy relationship. When you really care about someone, it is entirely worth it and rewarding to do so, even though it's not always easy... because life, itself, is not always easy or predictable.  The main characters are a couple named May and Cody who are going through a divorce. Their daughter, Rose, is devastated by this and desperate to get them back together. She makes a wish on a book and her parents get transformed into small wooden dolls that she made to represent them. They are thrust into a magical world where they encounter The Book of Love AkA Dr. Hakim, the flamboyant, mustachioed deuteragonist with a Spanish accent who is determined to repair their relationship. They need to get through a series of challenges so they can return to their human form.  The world is colourful and absolutely gorgeous, the puzzles are perfectly balanced in terms of difficulty (not too easy but not too hard), the bosses are tough, the mini games are entertaining, and the dialogue sometimes makes me laugh because it's so cute and comical. Also, there's so much to explore and so many toys to play with that it often makes me feel like a little kid in the world's biggest playroom. Honestly? I can't recommend it enough. It has become one of my favourite gaming experiences in many ways, and I'm not at all surprised that it has won several awards."

First I thought that the game will be boring but it is not at all what I expected. The story, gameplay, art style, mini games, puzzles, music and soundtracks are unique. And I bought the full game because it is so good and fun to play.The story is about a young girl named  who's parents ( and ) are divorcing and her tears basically turn you into the puppets. You'll need to trying to find answers and rebuild your  :P.The gameplay is pure 2 player co-op puzzles solving and each level is completely different from the last and unique boss battles. There are so many different puzzles and every level requires different types of thinking. And there are also different mini games to compete with each other.The graphics in this game is pretty unique and visually gorgeous to look at, really. The art style is amazing and the environments in this game are very beautiful.The music and soundtracks in this game are unique too.For me, it is a masterpiece, GOTY and amazing story telling co-op game. And I found the lovely heart-warming relationship of  and  in this game. I absolute recommend for players who like to play games in story telling co-op. And if you own the game and your friend don't own, your friend can play and fun together with free Friend's Pass. I believe that everyone should play this amazing game at least once in their life.

Is really hard to find anything wrong with the game on this department.Gameplay: about 15-20 hours of mostly 3D gameplay, plus extras for mini games and achievements. Co-op only, and best played with voice chat. Only one player requires a copy, if playing online. Puzzles and maps are very easy, assuming both players know what they are doing, yet lots of fun. The optional mini games, plus some of the tools and puzzles the game offers, certainly adds a bit of fun PvP mechanic in the game. That being said, once finished, the game has very little replayability factor.Story: for a game that describes itself in the Steam store as ""a universal tale of relationships"", this game does not delve deep into this theme, not surprising given the younger audience of the game. That being said, those that do not mind a cheesy and humorous story that invariably ends with a happy note will like the game quite a bit.Music: it is good, not the strongest suit of the game in my opinion, but still enjoyable, and fits the gameplay and the story well. Which may be good as it does not detract much from the superb voice acting that is present throughout the game.Kid friendly? The game certainly is made very easy to play, likely with a younger audience in mind - that being said, beware of inuendo and mature themes.Summary: a fun and great game to play with family and friends. Just beware that it might be rather short, and for the grown-ups out there, on the easy side. 9/10."

179,timɘ_bendeя,https://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/,29,,1,22.2,September,"6,","4,375",6,1,"It Takes Two is indeed a game where it takes two. Having played through it with the wife I can say we enjoyed it both and also both thought it overstayed its welcome about 75% into the game. Playing through it once will take around 10 hours. For this price that’s incredibly long for a co-op game and believe me when I say it tries to keep things fresh all the way through, with new gameplay mechanics and levels. And it always succeeds. Except when you get an item that you don’t really like to use, or just doesn’t seem so fun. My wife frequently got the better/cooler weapon. Now, the game splits the gameplay evenly, so you both get to use your weapon/gadget as much as the other person, just in different ways. And as I mentioned it really takes two. You can’t proceed without the help of the other.Besides the story oriented puzzle platformer gameplay there are also plenty of mini-games to be found and enjoyed, The variety of gameplay here is exceptional and the controls are simple enough that they can be played and enjoyed by anyone. But if you’re the more experienced gamer between you and co-op partner then you’re usually at an unfair advantage. And that makes these games a little less fun unfortunately since they’re competitively oriented and not co-operative like the rest of the gameplay.The graphics and animations are top notch. The characters move lifelike, both in human and doll form and all of the environments look detailed and are made with a lot of love.The voice acting is also stellar, with the exception of the daughter who sounds like an adult trying to imitate a kid. I loved the voice of the ‘Book of Love’.As I mentioned the game became a bit tedious for us near the end, when we had to collect several pages. These segments went on a little too long for our taste. But that’s personal, of course, I’m sure there are tons of people out there who enjoyed it all the way through.So if you’re looking for the ultimate co-op game look no further: It Takes Two is one of the best puzzle/action platformers there is. There’s a ton of variety in gameplay and a whole lot of mini-games. You won’t be bored! At least.,, not for a while."

Their young daughter, who is watching it all from the sidelines, tries to fix their marriage by asking a magic book for help. Through her request, the parents are turned into dolls and must work together to return to human form. She helps them with this, and basically just gives them advice and introduces humorous elements with her character although some may be annoyed by her manner, the very magic book that is Dr. Hakim. Special attention must be paid to the gameplay. This one is so very accepting that practically every moment we can do something different. As many as 25 different mini-games have been included in the game, which perfectly fill the time while passing the game. It is impossible to get bored in this game, because something is happening all the time. Compared to Hazelight's previous game 'A Way Out' we get much more interaction, the game is longer and in my opinion more interesting, although it is a completely different game atmosphere. It is worth mentioning that we play on splitscreen, so we can watch the other player's movements all the time.It is also worth focusing on the game world. Here, as with the gameplay, we cannot get bored. Every now and then we land in a new location, which are closed, but have a lot of interactive elements. On top of this, the bosses fit perfectly into the surroundings and can sometimes make things difficult. While we're on the subject of the game world, it's worth noting the graphics, which, although cartoonish, look excellent. On top of that, the dubbing is very good and the overall sound design changes depending on the locationI'm sure It Takes Two is the best co-op game I've played, right next to Portal 2. It has all the qualities a good co-op game should have. It doesn't get boring, it's not long, it's cheap if you decide to buy EA Play, but also the usual price is worth paying for this masterpiece. Especially the 96% positive reviews attest to how good this game is. It is impossible not to have fun with this game."

Things are constantly changing so even ADHD players can get through this.  Like Mario levels, new gimmicks or mechanics are introduced, used a bit, and then thrown away before they have time to get too stale.  Very creative scenarios always cropping up.  My only complaint is that the difficulty is overall pretty low, auto-aim is too generous (an option to turn it off would be great), etc.  It'd be great to have a hard mode or at least some extra-challenging post-credits content to try to do, to really push your teamwork to its limit.Overall a strong 8/10 despite those issues for me, and the best co-op experience to date."

The mechanics are used just enough to showcase just about any unique ability or advantage they offer, and didn't lack in the number of ways could be used. Overall my experience with the game was very good and I would recommend to anyone who wants a mostly relaxed platformer, with a few intense parts sprinkled in, along with a decent story.

The platforming is tight, the environments are nice and it's fun to have such a co-op focused game. I cannot recommend it though, because while it's fun in hand, the story and characters dragged it straight down. Cody and May are shallow, uninteresting people and bad parents. I can't think of a real redeeming quality between the two of them. May is a... breadwinner? Cody... likes plants? They're not kind or caring in the slightest, tearing through essentially all new toys in their way. I don't remember a point where either of them took any responsibility for their problems. The book is annoying. The child is sad, but also annoying. I couldn't get behind any of them.As for the story, I understand that divorce is hard, but the writing in this game is just so flippant. The big idiot book's solution is just ""work it out"" basically. There was no subtlety or nuance to the self-centeredness of the parents. None of the humor landed for me. Also the legendary elephant sequence felt bad. I've never been so close to quitting a game just because it felt bad.It's a mechanically fun game. I genuinely enjoyed jumping around and playing mini games and getting my brother killed while he was trying to platform, but most everything that surrounds and encompasses those moments makes playing this game a slog.

In some areas it plays like a 2D scroller, or another part you play like an isometric RPG, or in another area it resembles Mario Kart, but they all play very well even though they are almost individual games.  Since you are two players, the game is littered with random side games for you to play that has nothing to do with the storyline.  They have a chess board, a slot car game, and so much more just for you to play and have fun and compete against each other.  It is absolutely a blast because there's always something new that you are doing.While the game has a serious tone for the story of two adults thinking of divorcing, the game just doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it is just hilarious.  The script is hilarious, the action is hilarious, it is absolutely great.  For example, in the Mario Kart section, Cody, the father, says, this reminds me of something, but never says what it is.  The Book of Love narrator is annoying, but even the characters in the game are annoyed with him.I'm sure I've said it before, but truthfully it is just fun.  This is what video games are all about....having fun together.  This is a masterpiece, can't wait to see what else comes out from HazeLight."

The game design of every chapter was so gorgeous and diverse. The gameplay felt super smooth and intuitive, I don't think I encountered a single bug. Every level was so unique, and the different tools & co-op playstyles needed to work together was refreshing. Although the puzzles weren't very complex and the deaths were more forgiving, you can clearly see that the game is centered around HAVING FUN. And boy was the co-op gameplay so so fun. The minigames were a great addition, and I love that you could go off and get distracted by something as simple as taking photographs for 10 whole minutes. I also found myself getting invested in the characters, even though the plot was fairly simple. Who doesn't love a good slowburn?! Game of the year for couples, hands down."

Worth getting, but I would recommend when it's on sale, since it's great to play the first time, but not worth your time to get multiple ng pluses you know :) because those puzzles and quizzes are very easy to solve, playing it the first time gave us lots of joy, but play it second time is kinda too easy for adults or even for kids :) Don't get me wrong, I think that small imperfection doesn't swing It Takes Two's status in my personal opinion, it's a flawless mini game, we love it :)"

Definitely worth buying!"

We separated two years ago after falling into difficult times, which led us to go separate ways and not speaking for a while. As of recent we have been spending more time together and it made me realize how much I missed this ridiculous guy in my life. We may not be back together, but the connection for eachother is still here. Time does indeed heal and I'm looking forward to what the future holds.This game has brought up many emotions. From happiness to anger, from impatience to feeling proud. Working together while also being competitive in minigames. It's almost a mixture of Little Big Planet, Pixar and Dreamworks. I also really liked that some the of scenes reminded me of other games and movies, which was a nice little touch added to the whole game. You meet different characters and encounter so many opportunities to just walk away from the main story line to explore and interact with things around you. The conversations, the little pokes at eachother, the fighting and the making up. This game has a fantastic balance of everything you need."

We agree this one is the one of the best ever. In short, we absolutely loved this game. Although split-screen is quite possibly the worst for a PC gamer, it was easy to overlook/get used to, and what came from it was a delightfully charming, witty, and fun game. The well-told story weaved around tons of new and interesting levels, with brilliant and beautiful level design mixed with interesting mechanics for each section of the game that allowed each player to play a little bit differently, and you each get to solve problems using new tools. We both agreed that it was a wonderful and beautiful game, and although it wasn't difficult at all we both absolutely adore the game. The boss fights to me were screaming ""raid mechanics"" but the mess-ups were very forgiving throughout the entirety of the game which allowed us to never get stuck through any part of the game for very long and for the game to flow naturally as you uncovered more of the story. I will probably forever make my GF laugh by saying CO-LA-BO-RA-TIONNNNN. Turns out we only unlocked 16/24 minigames, so we'll have a reason to play it again and also swap roles so we can try the other half. I was pleasantly happy with the entire game, and would recommend it to anyone. The friend-pass allowed my GF to play the game without owning it, and that is an amazingly cool concept. It makes total sense with the game being split screen 95% of the time. Bravo game with great writing, fantastic gameplay and graphics, and a very enjoyable experience that we won't soon forget for a long while. I know many will compare this to portal 2, but portal 2 is puzzle solving, whereas this is so much more condusive to relationship building - just like the story. 14.5hrs and a wonderful week of smiles, laughter, and solving puzzles together made for a great experience. Would recommend to any two people who enjoy gaming together."
217,Teddie95,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tedboiii/,10,,1,11.1,June,"30,",235,0,1,"It takes two is honestly the type of game that reminds me of why I even started playing video games. It has a soul, something that is increasingly difficult to find outside of indie games.Without spoiling much the game is a multitude of genres but mostly a puzzle platformer, new mechanics are added each chapter to keep things fresh, the two different characters also get differing abilities, so its worth playing at least twice to experience everything.While the mechanics are not too deep and the puzzles aren't the hardest, they are always satisfying and clever, in the 11 hour run I have not been bored in a single scene or thought something dragged on too much or was frustrating.Later levels open up for some optional exploration, which is something I rarely do, but felt compelled to find all the neat secrets and easter eggs.Graphically speaking the game is just top notch, it is just beautiful. The human models seem a bit off but you rarely see those. The real stars to me were the enviroments, there is just so much to see and all of it is unique.In conclusion, buy this game and invite a friend with you, in a rare show of good thinking, the game requires only one person to buy the game, the other person downloads the full game for free and can join and play through the entire game. Think of it as inviting a friend over to play at your house when you were younger. If they cant run the game, Parsec or Steam play together is also a decent option if your connection allows it.Thank you for reading my review, I do not usually do them, if it has gotten someone to give this game a try, I consider it a worthy time investment :)."

Visually, the game is outstanding and the world keeps looking better and better as you proceed. Sound design and music were great too, especially towards the later parts of the game. The mechanics and gameplay are easy to pick up and the puzzles aren't that hard either so this makes it perfect for gamers of any sort, even if you don't have much experience with them previously!

There is one scene in the game which is disgusting and certanly not ""dark humor"". It is just f****d up and for me personally it ruined the game experience a lot since I didn't like the characters to begin with and with the storyline being nothing special and the character development going down the drain it just turned into a mediocre game which could have been outstanding in regards to the amazing job the rest of the team did."

You'll get maybe 11 hours of gameplay, we got a bit more due to being a little too competitive and spending a lot of time with the minigames.

The wide range of abilities that go hand in hand with the different 'regions' you play in are top notch out of the box thinking and the lighting is believable to make it a cohesive game. Super fun to do a playthrough playing as May and after a few months another one as Cody. The inside jokes and mini games are the cherry on top and the elephant scene was our favorite. Pretty sure I'll pick this up again regularly with new people to introduce them to this amazing game. Definitely well deserved to win prizes as it sets the bar for storytelling to another level.

Bunch of mini-games and gimmicks to enjoy. Also puzzles that involve both players are well designed, well thought, and challenging at the same time.Story : Sweet, cute, warm, and engaging. The story line is based on family, surrounding a beautiful house with lovely areas. Becoming little dolls lets you see your house, your family, and your loved ones from a much smaller perspective, and allows you to see these ordinary items with a much more meaningful way. The story tries to tell you a story that can happen in any of our real-life, and intends to let us know how to fix it. Truly a fun and amazing story.Optimization: First, I just want to point out that the only disappointing part is definitely origin. Sometimes I just couldn't log in, or I couldn't open the friend list. Other than this, the controls are really smooth, player camera is great, transitions and interactables are well-rounded, and I hardly found any bug. Really well polished.Art style and music: Nothing to complain about.

Trapped in a fantasy world where the unpredictable hides around every corner, they are reluctantly challenged with saving their fractured relationship.The story is straightforward and there is no complexity in it, the goal of the game is to restore the relationship. But the events that happen around you may teach you more about the characters and different aspects of their lives and the cause of the main problem and why some things in their relationship were torn and marginalized. And do not forget the ""Wise"" book, which gives a beautiful effect in the game, the story, and the beautiful and funny discussion between them.The game in terms of control is - without hesitation - above excellent. The diversity in the game is very large and not boring, and this diversity is not only limited to abilities... but also in the map, the world, and also in the fights. The game is not complete without cooperation to solve puzzles. Few games with this genre contain this amount of diversity and abilities. There are also side challenges that are quite fun (fun only if the person next to you knows how to play).The game is not complete without the graphics and sounds, and the performance here is second to none. The diversity here is unparalleled. You will see a quiet and noisy world and you will see the life that stems from them as well as the hidden sides in them.- There are some mentions of other games in their game ;)- The game is narrative, and as usual, these games are linear.- You can play with your friend through the Friend Pass feature even if you don't own the game.- This game is available on EA play. You can save your money and try it there at a generous price.	The game is complete in all respects. It only lacks the right person to play with.

The devs added in lots of little things you can play around with and the game feels so full of stuff to be able to do thats optional from the main story, but still on the main path. Also, at one point the game has a short street fighter minigame where you fight a squirrel army captain on top of a plane. This game is definitely worth more than the $40 price tag."

I'm glad to say that one of the strong points of this game is...well, gameplay. The co-op gameplay is always evolving through every stage, and you will have to solve and play multiple puzzles, platforming challenges and well...basically a bit of everything. I mean it. Every stage is crafted to give you a new surprise fun mechanic to work with.Difficulty level is just right to not be mindless but it keeps frustration very low. And the experience is different depending on which character you are choosing so keep that in mind too!Levels are designed with a lot of care (it shows) and there is a lot of side content to find through the journey, and little details and things that can be interacted with just for fun, put there just to satisfy your curiosity or do silly things with your partner.It also has minigames that you can find semi-hidden in levels that can put some fun competition into the gameplay, and they are all quite different!Visually, it can be quite stunning and there lots, lots of incredible looking stages and pieces through the whole experience, and the main doll characters look super detailed too, which combined with the gameplay and store, makes this game feel like some kind of Pixar movie in the best of ways.Controls and camera tend to be as good as it can get in 3D platformers (They are never perfect, that's just how it is) and in general, it just tends to feel super responsive, tight and fun to use (Played with a controller, partner played with keyboard and he was fine with it too)Music and sound are great too and there are some very memorable music, specially towards the end of the game (No spoilers though :) )Overall, I just can't recommend this game enough if you have a good friend, fiancee, partner, whatever you want to play with. It's an incredible, super fun cooperative journey like you have never seen before and it makes me super happy that it got the GOTY award because there is nothing like it, and you can tell the team that worked in it put love and passion into it above anything. ♥♥♥♥ THE OSCARS"

At times we weren't sure whether the game was leaning toward childish or mature but it seems like it was the golden middle. Some of the levels really brought out that childlike wonder, while the storyline kept surprising us with its display of real-life issues.Throughout the whole experience, we got to interact like in no other game, learning that you're not gonna get far without cooperating. We have not encountered any bugs and the game truly felt fleshed out with a lot of time, effort, and care behind it. I wholeheartedly recommend it.

It features 15-20 hours of genuine cooperative engaging enjoyable gameplay, that feels like it was designed to do what it's doing, which it was, meaning the execution is done exceptionally. In the game, you play as either May or Cody, which are married, and have a kid named Rose. May and Cody are seeking a divorce, after some time of being emotionally disconnected from one another. They tell Rose this, and she seeks to find a way to fix it. The ""Book of Love"" by Dr. Hakim, transports May and Cody to the shadow realm, (not really) but it's a place where they attempt to tend and re-kindle their relationship. The game's mechanics are amazing, smooth, I experienced little to no bugs when playing with my friend, and the soundtrack is AMAZING.

Until I learnt the game was edited by EA games, one of the most disliked editor in the world. And there are good reasons for this. So you have to install Origin and create a f***** origin account to play. But the integration with Steam is not smooth for everyone. For my girlfriend, it has been a nightmare. Origin would launch, but not linked to steam. And the account creation process has been a mess. Asking for stupid ""Recaptcha-style"" puzzle such as ""find the set of dices which sum is 14"", 4 times in a row, in limited time. This is completely insane.

This game has a stunning level design, a good story line (not my cup of tea however, still very good).Dr. Hakim appearance will trigger your anticipation as with his arrival, new game mechanics are always introduced.The visual design of all elements are wonderfully crafted.The environments are imaginative and cleverly designed.Only noticed one particular bug during the whole gameplay. As i was playing with friend, he was invisible on my side of the screen in the garden section.Worth every penny.If all the puzzle are solved quickly then it will take about 10h during your first walkthrough. However, the average is set to 12-16h, so if you take in all the mini-games and take longer with puzzle solving.It's pretty lovely to play with your partner, but if you're playing with your bro, it will still be pretty lovely, just consider that there's a 50% chance of you guys dating.From my experience, no grinding was involved.Honestly, this game is highly optimized, impressively so. So i'd say a carrot or a potato from the supermarket should get this going. All the jokes aside, check the PC requirements, they're not much.Honestly, i will want to point the target audience to all ages, however, i think i will be pointing it to adults, as i've never felt so bad about an elephant doll and a girls tears so much. Note: There's a whole bunch of references to other games and movies, like the lion king, a way out, Mario, +++.The variety introduced was a vital piece as it lead to the lack of repetivity in the game. So, VERY GOOD. In one game, i felt like a played soo many games.As said, this coop game is worth EVERY PENNY. Can go from good to eargasm!I'd like to thank the developer and publishers for this wonderful game, the experience that was offered will most likely never be forgotten.

The art is exceptional, the level desing is superb. Some levels truly will leave you in awe and joy! I believe this game will be a great experience for anyone in the family and to be fair, even if the writing is not very deep might still inspire some important conversations with your kids about what it means to be a family for you. Which is really cool.  Looking back, I think I started this game with some kind of expectation, as everyone was praising it so much, so maybe that's why I got so picky about how it's written.

It had me hooked from the start and kept it that way till the end, although I wish it didn't have to end.The game is absolutely brilliant, the story line, the voices and the humour all in one is fantastic, they are reflecting a child who's parents are constantly fighting and decided to divorce, turns them into dolls where they stay around their massive house, shed, garden etc as miniatures solving problems together to get to the finish line. They struggle, they fight, they throw insults at each other, but they also come together, they compromise, they work, they pick each others brains and they support each other. It makes you reflect on your own life and relationships with your close ones as the story goes along, and if you're giving it your all to make them work, like you once had.By having the friends pass, only one of you needs to actually own the game, it cuts the cost in half €20 per head which isn't bad for the amount of hours you play and you can play it again but reversed characters so you get to experience the game in a different shape, with different tools. So far I got 13 hours of the game, if I rerun it again it would probably be another 13 or more by exploring every single corner the game has for us.THE GAME GETS 10/10. SOLID ALL THE WAY THROUGH.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------As we played together I will attach my boyfriends review just below as it's only fair given the game takes two ;)It takes two is more of a journey than a video game. You share a vibrant and wondrous experience with someone special, and are both left with a rich memory. The closest description I could give you is being in a pixar movie. The game is a combination of 3D platformer, problem solver, exploration, isometric rpg -- all weaved together amongst the backdrop of a touching story line. The voice acting and animation are brilliant, the humour is conveyed exceptionally well. As a product it demonstrates the future of interactive entertainment experience: a beautiful compound of video game and movie -- not too cut-scene heavy, not too punishing either. Post credits I was left with the same feeling when walking out of the cinema: readjusting to the banality of everyday life.Such a great experience, I not only look forward to playing it again with flipped roles, but to whatever Hazelight create next."

I think it would have been better if May and Cody realized they could stay friends and move on, or just we played them as a happily married couple right off the bat. Was a slog in a couple chapters."
330,shifty,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973193752/,5,,1,10.9,July,"7,",319,0,1,"Hazelight, aka F' the Oscars guy, brings back that split screen couch co-op style in It Takes Two, their second major game after A Way Out. That nostalgic split screen style was refreshing in A Way Out, the game was decent although it didn't push the boundaries too much in the story and gameplay departments. It Takes Two, on the other hand felt more refined, more developed and in general, a total improvement on their craft leading to a more memorable and amazing experience. The overarching story revolves around Cody and May, who you play as, going through a tough time in their relationship and are revealing to their daughter, Rose, they are planning on splitting up. Rose becomes upset and through the power of magical tears, Cody and May embody their daughter's dolls and encounter the Book of Love (Dr. Hakim) who is determined to rekindle their relationship with the help of COLLABORATION.It is definitely a story that is more geared towards couples, but that's not to say it can't be enjoyed by people who aren't in a relationship. I played this with a friend and we still had a great time. The characters that are introduced are interesting, the humour and back and forth between Cody/May and Dr. Hakim is amusing. Overall it's a fun, lighthearted and entertaining time excluding that one dark, out of place moment that made us both feel uncomfortable.At the core, the game is a puzzle platformer while the puzzles themselves aren't overly difficult the game shines in the ever-changing outstanding gameplay. In every new area Cody and May receive new weapons/gadgets, and with them entirely new mechanics. Learning how these tools worked each time made it constantly feel fresh, and half the fun was figuring out how to troll the other with them. Along with the huge amount of variety in genres and settings makes for an incredible experience from start to finish. It'll be a third-person shooter, then a top-down dungeon crawler, then a fighting game, then a rhythm game. Each genre never overstays it's welcome and switches up before it gets too dull. The minigames have a lot of variety as well, and are a nice detour that promotes that competitive fun banter between players. Boss battles are fun and creative, and again vary in their mechanics usually incorporating the mechanics you learnt throughout each level.Graphically the game looks magnificent and has a Pixar-esque style, the animations are well-done, the different set pieces and cinematic scenes are awe-inspiring. The level design is well thought-out and immersive. The split screen really helps the other player see what they are doing, and makes it convenient to convey to each other on how to solve puzzles.The voice acting was decent. Music was fine, there were only a couple of moments that were memorable or exciting but it never nailed it to the point where I found myself checking out the soundtrack, like I had done with other games. The rest of the sound design is great, there is a high level of work that has gone into producing fitting sounds for all the different mechanics, bosses, enemies and levels.Hazelight seem to have found their niche and have put a lot of passion into this. A fantastic co-op adventure game, and I'm excited to see where they'll take us next. If you are even somewhat interested in this, you NEED to experience this game. The friend pass makes it even easier so grab your partner, your friend, a random on the internet, just get anyone! And I just can't wait for my second playthrough when I actually get a significant other and we inevitably get into arguments."
331,Apathetic,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198178447249/,7,,1,13.1,March,"28,",516,1,1,"Whenever I first saw this game announced during the Game Awards, I was excited more so than I had ever been about most games. There was just something charming about it and then have heard that Hazelight Studios was behind it? The people behind a way out? The game that is probably the thing that saved my friendship with my best friend? I had to buy it, I didn't have any real expectations. Though, it did take me a bit of convincing to pre-order it myself. Though, I knew without a doubt without that trailer in January...I wouldn't have thought otherwise about that game. To tell you the truth, I was kinda expecting it to be a bit of a disappointment and kinda dull at times (maybe hitting the same story beats of a way out) like A Way Out. Then I also heard about how you'd end up playing the game on steam and I was afraid of Steam's Remote play. I was afraid that the experience would completely ruined.However, my fears were unfounded as we later found out that the entire experience had a friend's pass just like a way out. I finished the game the day it came out on stream, and I have a lot of opinions about it.I think its a 10/10 game straight out of the gate because of the level design and how they use every single ability to the fullest they can per level. It was balanced, it was clean, it was corny as hell but lovable, and it was overall a much funner game in contrast to A Way Out which had its strong moments. This blew the hell out of it with its vibrant colors, simple tutorials, amazing settings and world building, and simple and fun puzzles. Everything flowed smoothly and there's times we didn't even know we had just done the main story, we thought we were just exploring. It was a really unexpectedly smooth experience. You'd be able to play this game with anyone, the level designs are all extremely diverse. They're all a unique experience and the characters just don't stay the same. Each Level truly shows how they affect them, and how they become more and more attracted to each other. I will say that the collision is weird at times, we were only lagged out once in the game due to EA's server (you have to sign into origin to play this game), and doesn't really have as much choice as a way out did. Its a beautiful game to play on a weekend with somebody, though I definitely don't recommend somebody playing the full 10 hours of this game. Its short, but its better than most games with its 40 dollar asking price and only you have to buy it in order to play with your friends. I definitely recommend this game and it will DEFINITELY stay in my heart for a while just like a way out did."

The latter is relevant since you will need an EA/Origin Account to play the game and to invite a friend to play even if you buy the game on Steam. The game tells the story of May and Cody, a married couple about to get divorced who are transformed into dolls made of wood and clay by a strange book their daughter Rose found. May and Cody are forced to work together over the course of various levels, getting to know each other and themselves better again bit by bit. You will play with a split screen almost all of the time, which for me took some getting used to. Other than that the gameplay was a lot of fun. The movement mechanics are very nice, I was happy that I was able to use two of my favourite platformer abilities right from the start, Double Jump and Dash, which makes for fun and fast-paced gameplay. During the different levels you will temporarily get new abilities as well. Most of the time you will play a platformer game, but there might be some surprises along the way. In our 15 hours of playtime, It Takes Two never got boring!In fact, it was so much fun that I would easily list this game among my favourite multiplayer/co-op games. I was pretty certain of that very early on and still the game managed to get even better over and over again. The levels are incredibly detailed and lovingly made, and even though the game itself is quite linear, there is so much to explore and discover. But not all of it is fun. Expect to be annoyed a lot by the book that got May and Cody into this mess. Also expect to almost hate the character you’re playing from time to time and to do things you absolutely don’t want to do - unless you don’t have a heart (no judgement here). However, those are but minor drawbacks that still contribute to the overall great experience."

357,ouroboros,https://steamcommunity.com/id/escalobba/,9,,1,16.1,March,"31,",221,0,1,"Full of charm and creativity. If you remotely like co-op, this game is a must play. It's not the most mechanically challenging game but that doesn't mean it's devoid of challenge, the game is more forgiving when it comes to mistakes and is more about having fun with a friend.There are quite a few fun minigames you can play in between levels and there are enough creative ideas in the levels themselves that it was a joy going through them. The levels and their locations are varied and full of little details waiting to be discovered. A lot of care was put into making the locations fun to explore aesthetically and mechanically; Movement is fluid enough that it makes getting from one point to the next relatively painless although it can get a bit finicky at times with ledge grabs, grapple points, and climbable walls.True co-op games are rare these days and as someone who loves them, it's nice to see one with obvious passion behind it. I hope this means the future is a little brighter for games like this and it's easily my favorite game to come out this year so far."

359,LordGandhii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/,16,2,1,10.4,June,"18,",771,1,1,"After playing  last year, it was very refreshing to play a pure co-op experience since there's not much of that on the market currently, and it left an itch that nothing's come close to scratching. So, I guess it's a good thing that Josef Fares and the talented folks at Hazelight decided to release another pure co-op game that expands upon the foundation laid by  called  And I'm happy to report that  is an incredibly entertaining experience that is a significant improvement over its prison break predecessor that surprised me in more ways than one.While I think most people are going to compare this game's visual style to something out of a Pixar film, I would say this game feels a lot closer to something like  It's a delight, with so much variety in the environments considering that the story is basically contained to one house. The game also did an excellent job of not being too overwhelming with color, which on top of being paired with great character designs (especially in regards to the playable characters), made everything visually distinct enough that you could tell who was supposed to interact with what without getting in the way of the style that the game was going for. While I did play this game with slightly messy settings because I was streaming it, I could tell that this game is an absolute looker in terms of its style and environments, so the game absolutely succeeded in this regard.As I said before,  expands on basically all of the concepts laid by its predecessor. While it is still largely a puzzle platformer, one of the game's biggest strengths is in its variety, as it would switch up the genre very frequently. The parts of the game where I was witnessing my partner take on a boss structured like Street Fighter, or where we were tearing through a castle using fire and ice powers like a Diablo game were my absolute favorite parts. They didn't overstay their welcome, and were always a great way to change the pace as soon as the platforming/puzzle segments started to feel dull. Both characters had ample opportunities to shine, and I didn't feel like the power-ups were skewed in favor of one character at any point. While the game's on the easier side, I still found it incredibly engaging and didn't mind the difficulty since the game was meant to be accessible to as many people as possible. The boss fights were also very fun, and never felt mindless to beat since they all had different mechanics that felt like a proper assessment of your skills with whatever tool you're using. In terms of a pure co-op experience, this is arguably as good as it gets. It's balanced, engaging, and a constant delight from start to finish. I have nothing to negative to say here.Where the gameplay was near perfect in execution, this game's biggest weakness is its story. The game tries to foreshadow a few things, (for example: ) but ultimately get disregarded as soon as they move on to the next setting. I also feel like the game was too lighthearted tonally, and should've leaned more into its Pixar-esque appearance by suddenly changing the tone to something heavier in order to drive home the game's themes and sticking to that tone for more than one scene. While I did like the characters, and the game was genuinely pretty funny, I thought they were the only redeeming qualities in a story that felt like an excuse to throw the players into different situations, when it had plenty of potential to expand upon its themes using player interaction. The story is funny and entertaining, but its unwillingess to take itself seriously makes it disappointingly shallow overall.Not much to talk about here. The voice acting wasn't particularly remarkable, and there were a handful of moments that took me out of the game, but it wasn't noticeably bad. The music is also serviceable, though I'd say it is of a higher quality than the voice acting overall, outside of the final song which I found rather underwhelming. The sound design also works well enough, though again I'd say it's nothing to write home about. Overall, it's fine, though it's nothing I'll be talking about years from now. In terms of value, I'd say it's worth it at full price just for the reason that  But even then, I'd still say it's worth it simply because you'll remember your time with it because of how it constantly finds ways to reinvent itself. Sure, the story isn't anything to write home about, but it's still very memorable just for how good the gameplay is. You're not going to play it more than once most likely, but it's definitely fun enough to warrant doing another playthrough with someone else if you wanted to. is an absolutely amazing co-op experience with a story that holds it back from being an all-time great. But even then, the story isn't going to significantly ruin your experience because the way the gameplay constantly finds ways to keep you engaged definitely makes up for this to a degree. If you have someone to play this with, it is absolutely worth your money just to help these types of short, story-driven co-op games become more commonplace. It's not the ""perfect co-op game"", but it comes quite close. I loved my time with this game and I cannot wait to see what Hazelight does next.  - 9.5/10 - 10/10 - 5.0/10 - 6.0/10 - 9.0/10+ Incredible gameplay variety+ Beautiful environments+ Humorous writing+ Well-paced+ Only needs to be purchased once to play with a friend- Shallow story and themes- Tonal issues"

Puzzles are quite easy and short, and there are many game modes sprinkled throughout, making this an excellent introductory game for young gamers. Not to mention, small mini-games to unlock in each level. absolutely stunning! The world is colorful and detailed, most of it designed around a child's environment, with bosses who come to life in the same way a kid would imagine they would.So why the negative review?(No story spoilers, I'm just describing the event)Well, quite a long way into the game, the director decides to add a torture scene in which our protagonists have to catch and dismember a sentient toy, limb from limb, as it begs you to stop and play instead. Look, I get the trying to intentionally make the player uncomfortable and to question themselves and how far they are willing to go, I've played Spec Ops: The Line and it was one of the most unique gaming experiences I've ever had, but WHY on earth would any sane person have this in a colorful co-op game so perfectly designed for children? Why? What would this contrast achieve exactly?This feels like those stories on Facebook about people hiding razor blades in Halloween candy, but in game form."
365,Nachy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NachoPiggy/,6,,1,23.8,October,"26,","1,657",0,1,"Really fun! It Takes Two is the kind of game that does a lot of things, and for the most part, does it well. Coming from the same developers of the co-op-only game A Way Out, It Takes Two takes that familiar brand into a more gameplay-oriented experience.The game at its core is a 3D platformer and builds on top of that by throwing a variety of different gameplay concepts and scenarios built around the co-op experience.There's a lot of enjoyable platforming sections, and while going through them, you and your friend will be occupied as well with a different gimmick through each chapter of the game. Such gimmicks come in a mixture of different combat methods such as having one player cover enemies and obstacles with a flammable sap that the other player can detonate with their own unique fire projectile.During sections where it takes a focus on puzzles instead, you get different gimmicks such as the player navigating through an obstacle while another uses a device or ability to help the other player get through things. I found myself just enjoying spitballing ideas and figuring things out with my friends, and on the times we got stuck, it's less on the game being obtuse and just more on us just having moments of hilarious stupidity, which is its own kind of fun.Optional activities also are peppered throughout the game, with various competitive minigames and moments of exploration to serve as breathers between chapters. If you loved goofing off and playing minigames such as Connect Four in A Way Out, It Takes Two amplifies that idea further in this game.The game keeps this pacing mostly consistent throughout, and you'll never be doing the same thing twice. However, it does feel like the ideas start to falter towards the end, where the new gimmicks start just feeling like less interesting variations of what you were doing a few hours earlier. The game could have merged and cut out a few things to make the experience tighter and make the last hour less of a slog. Still, for the most part, there's hardly a dull moment throughout the game thanks to just the sheer variety it offers throughout the hours.Visually, the game looks fantastic. The environment variety alone is great, but the details put into them really show how much work is poured into the game. From experiencing daily household areas as miniature toys to beautiful snowy mountains, green gardens, and even really abstract spaces, it consistently manages to look really good.The narrative itself unfortunately isn't as compelling as A Way Out, and at best you might find the dialogue passable with a few chuckle-worthy moments, and at worst annoying. Nevertheless, the premise does serve its purpose as a vehicle for the scenarios you go through the game, and it does have a few notable moments, which I won't spoil, but I can say that it's both hilarious and horrifying and can guarantee that it will elicit a reaction.It isn't a deal-breaker but it would have been interesting to see if they minimized the plot further and just focused on the gameplay parts, as I feel like it is enough to carry the game, and taking out the story won't really impact the main enjoyment of the gameplay itself.I personally played this twice with two different friends, with the playthrough months apart to keep my experience somewhat fresh, and absolutely enjoyed both playthroughs and had fun rediscovering solutions to the game, alongside finding new stuff I didn't come across on my initial playthrough. It isn't the easiest game to do full replays with considering its long length, though the option for chapter selections and jumping through minigames instantly is a nice way to do bite-sized revisits.All in all, It Takes Two is a really enjoyable experience, and there is a lot of fun stuff to go through even on just a single playthrough. Like the neat thing with A Way Out, only one of you needs a copy to play the game together. If you're in the mood for a fun co-op experience, It Takes Two will provide a solid experience."

The main game had so much variety to it and every level was more fun than the last.

I could leave it at that, give the game a positve review and go on with my life, but I won't. I want to convey just how good this game is and how much fun my best friend and I had playing it. So this could be a little long.I first saw this game in a trailer last year and immediately thought to myself: ""We need to play this!"" Especially since the previous game of Hazelight ""A Way Out"" brought us many great hours of fun. But when I saw that ""It takes two"" classified itself as a Platformer, I was scared, because I knew that genre wasn't really my friends favorite. Nevertheless we decided to at least play the demo on release. I'm so glad we did. The demo alone was about half an hour to an hour long. (Probably an hour since we just messed around at every opportunity) The first thing we both noticed was, that the game looks gorgeous. The graphics had a particular style between realism and fantasy. Especially later levels really look magical, but I don't want to talk about them too much. You should really try to go into this as blind as possible. To be surprised is half the fun in this game. The second thing we noticed was, that the controls were really tight and snappy. The characters were really nice to control and misinputs were a rarity and entirely our fault, when they happend. With that said, we made our way through the demo, which was the entire first level and at the end of it we were both sold. We didn't know what else to expect of the game. The first level was pretty simple with straightforward mechanics and simple puzzels. When we continued to the second level, we hoped the game could at least stay at this level of quality. OH BOI were we wrong. The game gets continuously better, the longer you play it. Every new level we started, we said to each other: ""I can't wait to see what's next!"" And a few times in every level we laughed out of pure joy and yelled: ""This is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome!!!"" Normally you'd expect a game to have highs and lows, but ""It takes two"" was almost constantly high. With some exceptions. One part in particular just was heartwrenching to go trough. Those who played it will know what I mean, when I say Elephant. Just terrible. But just in a Story-sense. It won't impact my feelings of the game overall. The other aspect, that was a little bit disappoiting for me was the Ending. I won't spoil it, of course. What I can say though was that it just came to suddenly. We didn't even notice that we played the final level. It was just lacking that sense of finale, but that's just my opinion and maybe you see it differently. With that said, I absolutely recommend this game to everyone who wants to spend a good time with their loved ones. With the whole Friend's Pass thing you don't even need to buy it twice, so 40 Bucks is definitely worth this spectacle of a game. ""It takes two"" set a new bar for COOP-Games for me and I can't wait to see what Hazelight will be working on next. Like I said, this game was really special. Thanks for this great ride!"

I have been looking for years for a game that takes Co-Op to a new level, This is that sort of game, I'm so AMAZED!!!!Have played for 6 Hours so far and we are still not done, I'm writing this review because I can't hold in all the positive feedback. The game mechanics in this game is beyond my expectations. At first, I found it irritating because of the split screen that the game uses, but later on, I was more amazed. The perfect sync between me and my friend was an easy alternative when trying to explain where to navigate. The story is so far more than good. It might even teach us a thing or two about what we might take for granted. So many real-life memories bubble while playing this game.Considering buying it? Then do it! Worth every penny and I will support the studio for an awesome game !!"

Непревзойденное кооперативное приключение про женатую пару на грани развода, которая превращается в пару маленьких кукол. А грандиозное приключение призвано скрепить их почти разрушенный брак.Основные места действия - дом наших протагонистов и их задний двор, на которые нам придется взглянуть под другим углом, и не только ввиду небольшого роста героев.Ведь с перспективы наших зачарованных героев и окружающий их мир будет таким же магическим: оживший пылесос, который хочет отомстить за то, что о нем забыли, заменив новенькой моделью, или война белок и ос, которая напоминает классические боевики 90-х, и многое другое, что не раз удивит вас.В нашем большом походе к счастливому браку нам будет помогать Доктор Хаким - Книга Любви, хотя он предпочитает называть себя Книгой Мудрости (да, буквально говорящая книга).По большей части он создает нам проблемы тогда, когда мы не создаем их себе сами. Но его конечная цель - сплотить парочку и научить их решать проблемы вместе, в какой-то момент даже начнется подобие настоящей терапии.Истории в их играх никогда не были на первом месте, но на этом и не делается акцент, так что без зазрения совести его простоту можно проигнорировать. История служит лишь площадкой для веселых испытаний, которые вы преодолеваете с вашим партнером, но все же почерк их первой мрачной игры, про Братьев, местами прослеживается, например, когда мы серфим по внутренностям мертвого кита. Да, порой игра способна преподнести “недетские” сюрпризы, заметно перегибая в жестокости. Но таких моментов за всю игру наберется штук 5-6.Игру намеренно сделали излишне казуальной, в ней даже нет привычной смерти. Если хотя бы один из двух игроков жив, то второй возродится незамедлительно, а погибнуть одновременно - это нужно постараться.Это сделано для того, чтобы привлечь аудиторию, которая далека от мира видеоигр.Но самое захватывающее в It Takes Two - это разнообразие геймплея. Буквально каждые 10-15 минут игра предлагает новые механики, многие из которых достойны отдельной игры.И тем печальнее, что они настолько скоротечны.Сама же игра имеет продолжительность примерно в 10-15 часов, что достаточно много. Определить жанр у It Takes Two даже еще сложнее, чем у предыдущей игры авторов, A Way Out.Если у A Way Out скелет геймплея составлял, по сути, квест с решением задач, то It Takes Two - это скорее платформер с решением головоломок. На самом деле, очень грустно расставаться с этой игрой. Ты понимаешь, что это игра штучной выделки. И при этом реиграбельна, как минимум еще один раз, из-за наличия двух героев с разными способностями, но важно понимать, что сами по себе их способности ничего не стоят. Они обязательно дополняют друг друга. На этом в целом построена вся игра. Вы не можете быть единоличником, это не та кооперативная игра.Оба игрока зависят друг от друга. Взаимовыручка - главный двигатель как геймплея, так и основного сюжетного мотива.Эту игру больше воспринимаешь как игровую площадку, которая возвращает в детство, нежели что-то современное и привычное.Но часто меняются не только механики, но и сами локации. От простой детской комнаты до сувенирного снежного шара. Или сад на заднем дворе, который напоминает атмосферу Grounded, и многое другое.В игре нет коллектблсов, поэтому локации попросту незачем досконально изучать, к сожалению или к счастью решит для себя каждый сам, ведь их наличие могло бы затормозить повествование игры, излишне отвлекая игроков. А с другой стороны, кто-то бы так и так их игнорировал. Но зато по локациям разбросано огромное количество мини-игр. Какие-то хорошие, какие-то скучные, но с задачей они справляются: задержать вас немного подольше в этой замечательной игре, и при этом они ни сколько не портят общую динамику.А вот уровень интерактивности с объектами не впечатляет. Если вспомнить, то в тех же Братьях наши герои постоянно могли взаимодействовать с чем-то внесюжетным. И у каждого персонажа была своя реакция и анимация на это.В A Way Out это повторили и заметно приумножили.В It Takes Two таких моментов можно по пальцам сосчитать, но не будем записывать это в недостатки. Просто хочется хоть за что-то поругать эту игру.Эта игра подойдет абсолютно каждому, даже тем, кто не увлекается видеоиграми. Это отличная игра про семейные ценности и важность взаимоотношений. И такая игра прекрасно проявит себя на семейных посиделках.Вопрос звучит скорее так: ""А кому ее вообще можно не рекомендовать?"".Наверно, тем, кого не привлекает атмосфера детских мультфильмов. Сюжет здесь максимально прост, как и наши протагонисты. Каких-то интересных твистов здесь можно не ждать, а финал очевиден, даже если вы просто прочитали описание завязки, и это действительно может оттолкнуть кого-то.Но ведь угодить всем все равно не выйдет."
428,Ruji,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lykeagsix/,5,,1,15.4,April,"2,",385,0,1,"This game is legitimately built for people with ADHD with the back-to-back minigames and constantly changing gaming environment. One time you could be platforming and puzzle solving another you would be dungeon crawling or playing a third-person action game. There is even a time where it turns into a Tekken duel with the other player steering while one fights on the wings.My girlfriend does not play many games outside of animal crossing or Stardew valley. However, the game introduces a simple and consistent control scheme throughout the game even through the different “game modes” that appeared. It is amazing for non-gamers and played even better when played with a loving and communicative part. (communication plays a key-role as you will see early on)Overall, the music, art, story, and characters all carry a whimsical nature and aesthetic to it. Bombastic bedroom designs, an awesome clocktower boss fight and a wacky saw-style work shed you will never see the same thing twice. The entire tone is very “Disney-like” whimsical, light-hearted, and warm (minus this whole part with an elephant, my god that was horrible)."

This game is crammed with diverse content: every area looks different, plays differently, and has different pacing and challenges. And toys! There is so much stuff here to just fool around with, without you having to worry about how it connects to the story or progress or anything else.  wants you to have fun, to dazzle you with spectacle, awe you with its grand scope as well as attention to detail, and for you to already miss it when the end credits roll (after ~20 hours).Difficulty level is casual to medium, making it accessible to most gamers, though I suspect that complete newbs might find some of it challenging. There's a bit of fast reflex boss combat here, a bit of confusing 3D platforming there, and intentional coordination challenges. But that's why it takes two: an experienced gamer can team up with a newb and help them learn how to, well, play video games.So much stuff! Lots of little homages to classic video games. Lots of silly characters. Majestic environments. Soaring music. Special effects. I can't think of a single moment that was boring or tedious. That said, if I must really dig deep to complain about something, there were  a few areas where affordances weren't very clear or controls were a bit wonky. But, here's the thing: the price of death is small. So, go ahead and try something crazy. Worst case you die, best you die in a hilarious way.There's a story to it, too. It's rather skin-deep, but perhaps it could be meaningful to certain couples dealing with relationship trouble. Everybody else: don't worry about it. It's just a proverbial carrot dangled in front the proverbial donkey that keeps the action going. This is not a story-driven game, but an experience-driven game.Fun, fun, fun. Get a friend and play.

There are huge problems with getting origin setup though, and you will have to finagle using the touch screen and onscreen keyboard. I recommend getting whoever you are playing with (hopefully not on Steam Deck) to invite you and having them added on origin prior to playing, or you will have A LOT of problems. Once you get over this hurdle, the game has no issues on the Steam Deck.The game itself is honestly incredibly overrated. I had low expectations considering their previous game A Way Out was a mediocre, completely on rails, forgettable experience. This game is vastly improved in that regard, with a lot control and more variety to the game play. The story, is pretty insulting and likely unrealistic to anyone who has to experience divorce in any way. All of the dialogue is pointless, and frankly annoying. The two main characters are unlikable psychopaths. At one point they in full agreement decided to destroy their daughter's favorite toy, while the toy begged for their life, and forcing her to cry with no evidence that this will even assist them.The coop is OK. In general, one person will be having more fun than the other since both have two different ""powers"" in every section of the game, but one is always more entertaining and important than the other. There's a chuckle or two hidden in here, and you can get competitive with the basic side mini-game, but it's just an OK game all around. Get it on sale or play it on game pass if you're bored, but this is not a children's game at all."

It has more charm than most games I've played in my life and definitely doesn't lack in other departments.  The minigames range from fresh spins on puzzles I've seen in other games to completely new ideas I've not really seen explored.  The puzzles are difficult enough to keep you interested but give enough context to figure them out.  I found myself needing to finish the game but saddened that it was over.  The overall tone and visuals of the game make me nostalgic for something that doesn't exist.  The game does a fantastic job of making you feel small but not helpless.  The fact that it only requires you to own one copy while a friend can use the Friend's Pass to play it for free really drives home the fact that it takes two and is intended to be experienced in such a way.  The characters play relatively the same yet take advantage of different mechanics to solve the numerous puzzles, sometimes even splitting apart to tackle different elements.  Boss fights are fair, yet punishing.  Comedy is present, yet doesn't beat you over the head.  You grow together as friends and really learn what it means to COLLABORATE.

There's a lot of potential to explore these relationship issues in a healthy and thoughtful way, but this doesn't.  It's just ""make time for eachother and you'll be friends again"" which is just wayyy to simplistic, even for children.   The characters are annoying and lack any depth to push this narrative even if it was good.It's too bad the gameplay isn't any good either.  It introduces new mechanics in each area which is good - but it never goes past the most basic implementation on how to use these mechanics.  I'd expect each area to ease you into new mechanics with some simple uses and then ramp up to more interesting, challenging, and satisfying uses... but it just does the basic stuff and then moves on.The zones do have a lot of cool visuals - but the shallow story, characters, and gameplay means they are rarely used well, and then we move on quickly.I'll also never forgive this game for the elephant.Thumbs down on this game.  If you are starving for a coop game then I guess you might as well, but it won't be very good."

It tells an engaging and humorous story with both heartfelt and serious moments. It is easily my favorite game from 2021 and the fact that I went through the campaign twice is a testament to its replayability and the amount of fun to be had in the game. You and a friend or loved one play as either Cody or May, a husband and wife going through a divorce. Because of this their daughter Rose makes a wish and cries on a so called ""Book of Love"" turning Cody and May into a clay and wooden doll respectively. They both then go on a journey through about seven main locations with a ton of subsections and worlds to explore. The game takes you through gorgeously crafted environments such as  all experienced through the perspective of a small bug. It Takes Two is about Cody and May's shared journey to heal their broken relationship. Along the way they meet tons of fun characters and unique bosses that are full of life. One of the main ones is Dr. Hakim. He is sort of an antagonist because he's putting them through all of these challenges, but he's also a big source of comic relief, albeit the main characters provide a lot of that comedy already. The game has a heavy dependence on cutscenes to articulate the story but it handles them well. And throughout the adventure it switches between real life and the shrunken down magical world.  The stunning and richly crafted settings that you traverse throughout the game are home to tons of fun minigames to take part in during moments of downtime. There is also a nice level of achievement hunting to be done from finding a ton of special areas and interacting with the world. The levels are further fleshed out by the music which is nothing to write home about but really fits well with all of the locations you explore, furthering the experience as a whole. The main component of this game is its expertly integrated co-op experienced through a split screen. Experiencing the game with a friend or partner brings a whole other level of fun to the experience and it's extremely cool that they made it so that only one person had to buy the game and the other could just join with the friend's pass. The other feature or selling point that truly makes this fantastical adventure stand out is all of the incredibly implemented mechanics differing from level to level and region to region. Each player has a unique item or ability depending on the level that helps them work together to solve puzzles which are seamlessly integrated with fun platforming. The fact that Cody and May have separate abilities makes it fun to play as one character first and then as the other because you get a different experience each time. The amazingly designed stages integrate 2D platforming with 3D and 2.5D.  The only real complaints I have are that Origin was a pain to set up and it was extremely difficult to find my friend initially. The other complaint was that the game wouldn't output audio through my headphones so I had to listen to it through my speakers. Other than that the game's stellar writing, gorgeous environments, entertaining minigames, mix of puzzles and platforming and the memorable characters all make this an easy recommendation leading to a resounding ""WHY HAVEN'T YOU PLAYED THIS YET?!"""

I want to see more games like this have a 'friend pass' so only one of you needs to buy it. I thought from watching the trailer I had a good grasp of what this game had to give but there was so much more to experience. I played on PC with a controller whilst my friend used keyboard and mouse, they each had their pro's and con's.Achievements: The only downside to the friends pass is that achievements will only trigger for the person who owns the full game so it could be hard to convince a friend who's used a pass to replay to unlock everything. I don't see this as an issue however as it's so good if you have the full version you'll no doubt end up playing with more than one person who wants to experience this masterpiece of a game!"

Her name is Kiara, she was absolutely amazing. I loved her so much even with our ups and downs we still managed to be with each other for 2 years and I have to say, it was the best 2 years of my life. I loved her with my heart and soul but I guess that couldn't keep us together. It was at 8th grade where we broke up and I felt so devastated. I couldn't keep my head up especially with covid-19 quarantine (among)st (us). It was terrible but thankfully with the work of God himself, he brought her back to me, not as a partner but as a friend. Unfortunately I couldn't win her back because she already in the arms of another man. A 7-foot frame, but I swear this man had rats along his back. His name was Bruno, we don't talk about him. All I have to say was he was a terrible dude and I know I was much better. They ended up breaking up.This is where this game gets involved.Current day: It's winter break and I go along to meet my sisters and I come back home with a bit of money. I saw the game was on sale for $20 less, which was my selling point. I had bought the game to bond with her more and thought it would be a super fun time. I told her about this game in advance when I saw it and bought the game for us to play when I got back from my mini trip. I was only gonna be about 3 days gone and she said she was fine waiting for me to get back. Sad stuff, turns out she told another dude about the game and he bought it to play with her when they both knew that I had bought the game to play with her first. I get back from my trip and the first thing I see on her discord status when I get on my computer, is ""Currently Playing: It Takes Two Friends Pass."" I was furious! I had just bought this game to play with her but she went on to play with someone else. I didn't know what to do and went off on her. She completely turned the tables and blamed it on me. I was flabbergasted. I couldn't believe she had done such atrocity. I blocked her instantly out of my fury. I didn't know what to do and I was heartbroken.There I was sitting alone in the dark. Not being able to comprehend what happened. It was just me, my bright ass pc (Ryzen 5900x, 3080 TI, 64 GBS 3600 MHZ Ram, NZXT Kraken Z63 AIO and NZXT AER RGB Fans that I all got for Christmas in a Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL computer case BTW) and It Takes Two which I had no one to play with. It was a sad day for me until I talked to my friend about the situation. He had offered to play the game with me and I was rambunctious, and ecstatic of his offering. I instantly accepted his offer and started playing with him, I realized I didn't need to play with that woman that had did me dirty and I could have fun in other ways.In conclusion, this game is actually pretty good and holds up pretty well. It even holds a special place in my heart because of all this.Thanks for reading my review on It Takes Two :) Edit:I am now playing this game with my new girlfriend and I have never been more happier in my life. She is everything to me and I'm glad I got to play this with her, I no longer have any regrets for buying this game because playing this with her made her so happy and seeing her happy makes me happy."

My girlfriend and I played it together, and I can't tell you how much we both loved playing this together. Every moment, every level, every mini-game and every little detail was absolutely astounding. This was hands down the best game that I've ever played, ever. I have THOUSANDS of hours on multiple games that I've played on steam; however, this game was definitely the most meaningful and loving game that I've ever played. I cried a lot for the ending, and I hope in the future we all can see more from this wonderful team that created this game.I will also say, this is the first time I made sure to look at every name in the credits of any game that I've ever played. I just can't express enough of how much this game really meant to me. This was amazing in every single way. Thank you so much to the developers and every person who helped create this absolute masterpiece. Amazing job, and thank you very much for the work y'all put into this.I seriously can't express how much I appreciate the work that went into this game. Every level was something unique and seriously astounding in the detail and level design that went into this. We had fun EVERY.SINGLE.MINUTE that my girlfriend and I played together.THANK YOU SO MUCH to this entire team! I guarantee this entire gaming community that has experienced this masterpiece loves the heck out of you guys for this beautiful work!"
508,Pablo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023019965/,3,,1,28.9,July,"19,",105,0,1,"When It Takes Two was released, I took a chance. I bought the game without knowing if I was going to play it. This game is multiplayer only, and to me, most of the people I know of that loves video games lives on other countries, on other time zones and they are busy as well. This is the life I choose, this is my passion, and it is a lonely one. But this game has something to say about that: if you buy it then you get a friend’s pass and the second player plays for free…Now, that was something… but i was still out to find the second player, I had to…  and this proved to be challenging, unsurprisingly, but in the end I managed.When I finally got to play with my good friend, I was glad I did. One of the best things about It takes two, comparing it to other multiplayer games is that it is not really competitive as in “I have to kill the other player” but it is more of a collaboration… (if you play the game you will know what that really means) But deeper meaning aside, it is just that: a truly co-op experience between two players. And I mean that: you will laugh, you will cry, you will scream in ecstasy… and you may also agonize… probably putting your “real world” relationship to the test… This game really needs you to communicate one way or the other with your partner, or your friend or whoever is the other person you are playing with.This game shows emotions through the mechanics you play with on different levels.While playing I experienced once again what is it to play with someone that you are in great synchro with, someone that playing with is like flowing effortlessly and joyously even without spoken words… I also played with friends on other time zones and have a great time while doing it. And finally I also played with someone where gameplay was not always in synchro and where communication was not always flowing effortlessly and was even challenging… but funny enough, this was also a time were communication was key, and through communication we had a great time and many laughs while trying to advance and failing and then succeeding (but mostly failing!). This led me to have one of the best times I had in games with a friend since forever.All this while in the middle of a pandemic, where going to someone’s house was not possible… so that made this experience all the more significant. And in all honesty, in a way it made it even more easy and accessible since I didn’t have to physically go to my friend’s house each time we wanted to play.It reminded me once again, on how far video games have come as a way to express yourself and share experiences with others. This was above everything else, a fun game, with so much variety in it: different levels with different mechanics,  each one having their own distinct theme and mood, feeling almost like a new game each time and still managing to keep it all as a one full cohesive experience with endearing main characters and some surprisingly emotional moments."

It's gorgeous, it's funny, and my partner and I have had an absolute blast with it so far.  You can tell this has been authored with love.  At first I thought the split-screen was unnecessary given we were playing on separate PCs over the internet - but it quickly became important, whilst talking on discord, to be able to see what the other player was doing and give them advice.Additionally the fact that only one of you needs to own the game, and your partner/friend can just use the Friends' pass edition is another cherry on an already well-iced cake.I guess the only way I could not recommend the game, is if you literally have zero friends.  Like, zero. And if that is the case, you have more important problems than whether or not to buy this game."

They constantly keep changing the way you play and introducing new concepts and mechanics so the game really doesn't get old.- Varied environments - Every level is entirely different. Surroundings, movement, weapons, everything changes.- Graphics - Overall the game is visually impressive. Some specific scenes are breathtaking.- Coordination - Unlike other coop games, you really can't solo this one. You need to work together to beat it.- Story - The concept is quite simple, but this game really shows you it is all about the journey. You get to learn more about the characters and how they got to where they are as you play.Cons:- Needs Origin launcher.It looks expensive, but it is definitely worth the money. We got two copies and have no regrets. Not even halfway through the game yet, but really enjoying it."
532,Ryock,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ryock/,12,1,0,15.2,October,"20,",173,0,1,"It Takes Two does a lot of things right. Engaging level design, thematic maps, interesting puzzle mechanics, and a two-player system that feels like it requires two people to complete. There are too many two-player games where it's one player leading the charge while the other lags behind as deadweight. This isn't one of them.However, for as intuitive and fun the gameplay itself is, the story is absolutely miserable. Someone called it the ""divorce speed run,"" and I wish I could say that's what happens in the end. Cody and May, the two main characters, are terrible for each other. They emerge from their trials the same toxic people that they went in as. They use and manipulate every side character they meet along the way for their own gains, no matter the cost. There's also this constant mood shift between, ""We're going to die!"" and ""We can't die! Get in there!"" It's conveniently scary when the story wants it to be. Since you can't die, there's no real urgency to the game; no real risk. I wish I could recommend this game. I played this to the finish with my SO and it left us both feeling empty. I want more two player games that utilize interesting systems. But I don't want the story to suffer for it."

The story behind the game is really nice and in some instances it can feel close to home as I am sure everyone knows someone in a broken home. Visually the game is incredible. The art-style is really beautiful and you can see all the effort that went into making this game. The music and sounds in the game is really fitting to all the circumstances and situations you are in. All the characters have their own stories and their own personalities show in everything you do.

You play as parents of a little daughter called Rose and about to get a divorce. But, due to a final wish from Rose, you are given a chance to change that by working on your marriage.

A young girl mourning the news that her parents are planning to divorce prays to a Book of Love to make her parents friends again. Her tears take her parents' consciousnesses into two dolls that must work together to find a way to become human.  Along the way, they rediscover what attracted them together, learn what came between them in their marriage, and realize the other person brings something unique and special to the family relationship. At its core, It Takes Two is not a game for children, but rather a deep emotional discussion about love, relationships, family dynamics, and raising children, all expertly woven together into a fantastic adventure that continues to bring new challenges and mechanics to the players.The developers somehow managed to merge a superb narrative with highly varied and fun gameplay such that neither takes second stage to the other.  Each area presents the characters with new unique yet compatible abilities, requiring them to collaborate to overcome obstacles and enemies they face along the way. The world is filled with detail to give the feeling that you really are doll-sized creatures exploring your own backyard, play room, attic, and more.  Also spread throughout the world are 25 mini games included for no other purpose than to give a short competitive diversion. These are fun to find, fun to play, and show that little bit of extra effort the developers put into the game to make every bit of it fun.The game is never too difficult to proceed and never too challenging to feel hopeless. The characters have infinite lives and a great checkpoint system that never requires you to repeat significant parts of any level. I believe gamers of all skill levels would find this game tremendously fun."

Luckily, It Takes Two comes with a free friend's pass; which means that only one person has to purchase a copy of the game. The adventure delivers a story beginning that most of us have come to know either now or during childhood, given the 40-50% current divorce rate in America: one of two parents in a struggling marriage. The narrative is directed by The game is enticing for multiple reasons; those being the fact that game experiences can a lot of the be times better-enjoyed w/ friends or family, plus, I'm sure more than a couple of us have had wistful desires for our parents to reunite after witnessing constant fighting & the lengthy processes of divorce & custody battles. In this game, you can finally fix that impossible issue. You and your friend take on the roles of May & Cody, the parents of your daughter named Rose, and you suddenly appear in your backyard shed, with much smaller perspectives than before; coming to the realization that you both have shrunk to inhuman sizes. This epiphany is followed by a hysterical freakout from the two, and then the plan of getting out of this situation and back into your regular bodies. The very first level  By now, you & whoever you're playing w/ have to learn to work together efficiently to take on the challenges, optional minigames, & eventual boss fights of each level, this one being about navigating through your abandoned shed & defeating your old vacuum cleaner & toolbox.  You then comb through the dusty ant-infested corners of your forgotten shed, learning to put forth coincided efforts for traversing through each menial challenge with whatever new objects or weapons you're given (this time being a hammerhead and a nail shooter), finally coming to the conclusion: defeating the divided section's boss levels. The next chapter takes you to the tree in your front yard, tasking you with becoming military operatives for the squirrels, who are in an ongoing feud with the wasps. May is given a bazooka & Cody receives a sap gun, & when both weapons are combined, you have the ability to make things explode, which is how you're expected to defeat the wasps. I'm sure all of us at one point have wanted to commit genocide against pesky bugs, & this section allows you to do just that. Even though every chapter has similar elements, there are always new and imaginative ways to go about proceeding with your missions.  Each area, whether it be the shed, pillow fort, literal cosmos, or your child's room; is made with tons of scrutiny & thought, not only with the beautiful & sometimes nearly photorealistic graphics, but also the unique level design & clever mechanics of helping each other triumph through. Nothing ever feels overdone, & you're given ample opportunities to just release stress and have fun whether that be through sliding on massive slides, steering airplane maneuvers, sailing through seemingly ""treacherous"" waters, riding on hallucinogenic catfish, rhinoceros beetles, fluffy bees, frogs, dinosaurs, and just about anything else you can possibly imagine. In addition to this, the game is also littered with amusing references to both Hazelight's previous games and other things like Street Fighter & Dungeons & Dragons, for example. The third segment contains your journey through Rose's room, which has you reliving childhood dreams by passing through a colorful pillow fort and ultimately flying to space to fight an astronaut baboon. The controls often invert depending on what you're currently doing, but luckily this circumstance, nor any of the puzzles or boss fights ever feel too bewildering or impossible to figure out, especially when you have the essence of collaborative teamwork. The only thing I'd really warn you of is the possibly seizure-inducing kaleidoscope part, but the difficulty remains intriguingly challenging whilst at the same time manageable. After your stint on the messy floors of Rose's room,  Dr. Hakim returns to harass you (which he does basically throughout the entire game) by forcing the couple to make it through three challenges, the main themes being collaboration, attraction, & passion.The 1st part, collaboration, brings you to the guttural insides of your household wooden clock; which incorporates a Victorian era, Steampunk-esque village, farmlands, & the only actually difficult area in the game (a platforming puzzle aptly named Hell tower.) When you finish this place, the next segment shrinks you even smaller to the correct size for being inside a snow globe. You trudge through arctic depths where you swim in extremely deep waters equaling only the Mariana Trench itself, which I'd say for people w/ thalassophobia to take caution in only because of the creepy sea creatures that live below. But this level isn't all impending doom, you're also able to explore the lively and adorable holiday village where After freezing through the ice & snow, the last area of the game guides you to Overall, the game takes about 16 hours to complete and it is appropriate for any situation, whether that be two friends undergoing an entertaining encounter together, or a broken couple looking for a profound experience full of metaphorical reasoning to stay together. It Takes Two deserves the outpour of overwhelmingly positive reviews, and it truly builds on A Way Out's strengths. 10/10."

The level design, atmosphere, mechanics, puzzles and minigames are all outstanding and blend together incredibly well. It's a lot of fun.Some people may not like occasional forced split-screen perspective even while playing online, but it is done well and doesn't feel intrusive at all. The variety in tools per chapter and how Cody and May's unique abilities work together to solve the puzzles leaves you looking at the other player's screen occasionally to see what's going on - it's like each of you are playing a different game sometimes.The two main characters are just sort of.. dumb and childish sometimes. It's funny for sure, and can make sense considering the absurdity of the situation, but it's a bit of a whiplash between their lightheartedness and the heavy, sometimes dark overlying story. Perhaps this will change further into the game, though.So far there's been a trend in some of the chapters - pick Cody if you want to drive or maneuver vehicles and pick May if you want the shooting or fighting. They both swap roles frequently but this has been the overall feeling I've had.10/10 Co-op adventure puzzle game"

A lot of the areas you get to explore are very detailed and fun to explore.Cons:- Forced split screen that serves no purpose 90% of the time. It's a tragedy really, since the environments are so well crafted and imaginative but you can only ever see a small sliver at a time due to the forced split screen. This could have been a really cool mechanic that no other game has attempted, but instead it was a massive hindrance.- Boring. Most of the ""co-op"" was pulling levers at the same time. The mechanics you see in the trailer all pretty much feel the same once you boil them down, and most of them feel quite repetitive after the first five minutes in a level.- Forced writing, bad dialogue, and annoying unfunny characters. The game's plot is so contrived, it's almost insulting. I honestly have a hard time believing the writers had any personal experience with divorcees due to how cliche and uninteresting the story was. On top of that, the characters are annoying as can be - constantly throwing shade at each other and really ruining a lot of the fun moments. These people are NOT easy to root for either. At one point, they even brutally  in order to make their daughter cry, then show absolutely zero remorse for their actions (the game doesn't give you a choice not to , by the way). Most importantly, by the end of the story the main characters still have not had any real self reflection or character growth.- May tells you exactly what to do. All. The. Time. She'll ruin even the most obvious puzzles IMMEDIATELY because she opens her obnoxious pie hole to spell it out for you. ""Pull that lever, Cody! Get the key, Cody! Put the key in the hole, Cody!""- Between some of the crude humor sprinkled in, the game's theme, and the absolutely brain dead puzzles, I seriously can't tell who the intended audience is. It's definitely not meant for kids - or is it? A majority of the puzzles take absolutely zero brain power, but the game itself has a fair amount of adult themes that would be lost on a kid. Playing with a friend can get awkward, but I definitely wouldn't want to play this with a significant other. So if it isn't for kids, it isn't for friends, and it isn't for couples, then who is it targeted towards?Overall, this game was a decent experience, but it's definitely not worth the $40 asking price."

609,Wil Darlington,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jetrox/,3,,1,13.4,May,"2,","1,034",0,1,"Co-op games are a very unexplored art. I can think of dozens of games across many genres that let me and a friend conquer objectives together, but more often than not, that experience really just feels expanded by another player instead of entirely redefined. I miss games where I really had to connect and rely on another player. The shared critical thinking  gave us in its puzzles that were duplicated in scale, the terrifying shared stakes and antics of , even the  games nail that feeling of cooperation and deliver some really fond memories with a friend. That’s why I’m so impressed by how  has nailed the feel of the co-op game.  is built around cooperation, and it does such a good job of nailing this feel that it makes me yearn for more games like it. While I didn’t think it had the best story or a solid delivery on its themes, what  does offer is a memorable platformer with constantly innovative gameplay, a great cooperational feel, and most importantly, copious amounts of fun. It's absolutely insane just how much gameplay variety  has packed into such a linear adventure. I love the willingness to try so many ideas to  shake up the gameplay, whether you’re unlocking a new way to move, additional environmental gadgets or entering what feels like a completely different game. It all feels so enjoyably seamless thanks to each mechanic's simplicity, allowing you to constantly encounter new ideas without getting overwhelmed. The toybox of mechanics is encapsulated in a very fun platforming system that bridges most of the game together, this alone feels like it could’ve made for a good game, so everything else feels like an incredible bonus.The best part of the constant shakeups was the player's unique abilities. Cody and May have a different central power in every chapter that always feels like such a natural extension of the character. These powers allow each player to bring a unique perspective to the table, but their real beauty in how they integrate with each other. The narrative theming of each power reflected in Cody and May’s cooperation  made for great puzzles and platforming, accompanied by an awesome feeling of progression within each level.On some occasions however, these mechanics did start to feel like they were stretched a bit thin. The tree and clock tower levels especially felt like they may have relied on their mechanics for just a bit too long, as their mechanics really didn’t have enough varied uses to justify the length.This game ended up looking so much better than I anticipated. Each world you visit is simply gorgeous, the bright colour palette really sells the toy-like world, but the texture detail on every object is pretty insane. I really love how each environment had its own feel, I can point to any moment from this game and tell you which chapter it came from due to the vastly different colour palettes and camera angles dedicated to differing aesthetics. The way they all relate to the house together is an awesome touch. It’s pretty obvious for the first couple levels, but getting transported into imagination-fueled interpretations of ordinary household locales felt whimsical, and always kept me guessing as to what world would be next. These worlds are just so well fleshed out too. All of them are more than serviceable for gameplay, but the amount of cute distractions along the way were so fun. There's plenty of minigames implemented across the levels for some friendly competitions, but the silly distractions such as the paint canvas or a very chaotic Etch a Sketch provided some wonderful moments. These were usually scattered across the game, but finding one of those massive hub worlds full of pointless content was always a massive rush, as I knew there’d be tons of diversions to get lost in. I do wish each world shared a bit more connection though. There's a linearity to them to begin with & they often connect to the story events, but they end up feeling so singular at times that it feels like this game could be completely rearranged with minimal impact. It's not a big issue, but I do feel that some of the emotional heights of areas lacked an emotional and thematic punch since they felt so detached from the rest of the game. Unfortunately I often struggled to find the central theme of fixing the relationship very appealing. Credit where credits due, the cast here is amazing. Cody and May have phenomenal voice acting, the dialogue isn’t always great, but the delivery lets you understand their characters immediately. All the minor household objects turned sentient made for some great levity and fun over the narrative too, they were vital to the narrative tone.However, I really struggled to buy the conflict between Cody and May. Some of their issues felt far too basic to be the basis for a divorce at times, most of the arguments felt far too simplistic, it seemed like they’d never communicated about their issues, which didn’t really make sense with the characters actions. A lot of these conflicts felt unresolved over the narrative too, it feels like most issues were skipped or forgotten, while the “resolutions” provided were very hard to buy. I feel like this is a very basic plot tackling a theme that's far too complex for its content, and I don’t think it resulted in a very healthy portrayal of a relationship.The story is all under the guise of Dr.Hakim, a very flawed character which I ultimately enjoyed. On one hand, he's outright hilarious, although I’m unsure to what extent that’s intentional. His dialogue is just so chaotic and strange, a lot of his appearances brought joy in their complete absurdity, but most of the humour just came from how extra his performance felt. On the other hand though, he’s not a strong catalyst for the narrative. Many of his appearances to the couple felt annoying and bloated with repetitive information, and his structure of the narrative is quite bizarre. It feels like you’re accomplishing nothing for the first half of this game, but as soon as the second half starts to get a good rhythm, the narrative reaches its conclusion at an alarmingly abrupt rate. While I think he worked for the fun of the game, he needed a lot more depth to carry the narrative and it’s execution.Favourite Moment:  deserves to be remembered for its celebration of cooperation, a fond gameplay style near and dear to many hearts. The fact that only one player needs to purchase this game means at it's current price makes it a brilliantly valued game. I can’t say the story’s particularly worth the investment, yet I cannot recommend this game enough based on it’s pure deliverance of a fantastic co-op experience."

The link between story and game-play is honestly unlike any other game (Apart from A Way Out) I've played. From travelling through white water rapids, to being kidnapped by giant squirrels, the story and game-play never gets old or ceases to amaze. Just for some background; at it's core, It Takes Two is a story-driven, 2-player co-op puzzle game, with game-play that genuinely never stops changing. The main game is split into 'chapters' where each chapter let's you play around and solve puzzles with different gadgets. As well as sometimes throwing completely different types of games at you ranging from street fighter to rhythm game. Even without the story, if you enjoy puzzle games, this will be a blast, and a lot of fun. The story however, ties it all together so well that it just blends it into one amazing masterpiece!With a single play-through time of about 12 hours- The game managing to stay new and fresh throughout- And a great story to tie it all together, this game is Absolutely Brilliant!"

It Takes Two is a super casual game, but it's extremely varied and much longer than I thought it was going to be. The puzzles and challenges are fun, accessible, quick to pickup and the game at times forces you to work together, in such a way that it never seems like one player has more fun or a more interesting task than the other. The variety of gadgets you get along the way is also another highlight, you always get something different to your partner, and these tools usually require you to work together again.There are times you're against each other too, in the minigames you find along the way; some better than others, but there is a full version of chess, races, shooting type games - the usual sort of mini-game fare.The story/plot is pretty simple but centers around the reasonably grown-up topic of divorce... I found that, because the game is so long, with so many sentimental moments, I actually found myself getting invested in Cody and May's future. Maybe I'm getting old and soft, but there are sections of the game that are purposely made into sort of 'profound' type moments, where you'll be flying through an amazing place or running away from something and the point is that you should be just enjoying these moments together - there is no real challenge or threat - these were just cool, memorable moments for you and whoever you're playing with to enjoy. You don't see that often in video games, to be honest, I've only experienced this a handful of times in many, many years of gaming.Visually the whole style of the game looks amazing, with lots of highly detailed, interesting fun characters you meet along your journey. The detail on the main characters in particular is fantastic.There are various chapters to the game that are all entirely different, and each of the environments are interesting and detailed. They usually have something to interact with for no other reason other than to mess around or get hidden achievements etc so in certain areas you end up exploring and procrastinating.In summary, It Takes Two is a unique coop game, that sticks to a coop style throughout - it works really well and I'd say this was a rare gem of a game. If you have a close friend or family member that'd play through this one with you - do it."

I played with my partner and we have decent gaming experience.  We still fell down random holes, but the platforming wasn't difficult at all.  However, I have a few issues with the game.1) It's too long. While it was fun initially, the game peaks in chapter 5(? or 6, the wizard level).  We played the last 4 chapters just to finish the game.  The last chapter is especially anticlimactic, and doesn't compare to the excitement from chapter 5.2) The abilities are repetitive.  I think the developers intentionally gave the female character the more aggressive abilities and the male character the supportive abilities in the teamwork.  While I appreciate the sentiment (as I do usually support in other games), it was tiring for both of us to be supporting and waiting for the female to do all the jumping by chapter 6.3) The narrative on divorce is (???)4) Cutie.  I am traumatized forever.Would still recommend as the game is well made and pretty unique.  It's super beginner friendly and probably more exciting for pairs that don't game so often."

Each section had new weapons, controls are tight and rewarding, and puzzles aren't too hard or too easy. CONSYou get to play as a husband and wife who are nasty to each other and always putting the other down. They constantly make side comments throughout the game insulting the other. They are completely unlikable and I honestly would prefer it if they didn't speak. I dropped a ball during a task on accident and the other character said ""Hey, butterfingers pay attention"" automatically. They just have insults ready to go! There is a magic book that is kinda annoying that is driving the plot and always around.Spoiler AND THE REASON I STOPPED PLAYINGYour characters assume they need to get their daughter to cry to reverse their curse. They don't ask the magic book and just assume the best course of action is to destroy her favorite toy to make her cry. One of her other toys tries to stop them because he says he's her protector but you blow him up. You get into the castle, get thrown in jail, and break out and kill any guards in your way. Then, you drag this cute sentient elephant that sounds like a little girl over to the side of a tower to throw her off. She screams and cries the whole time asking why you can't be friends, asking what she did wrong, and pleading with them to let her go and she would hug them and make them cookies. You rip her arm and her ear off in the process of dragging her and, ignoring her screams, throw her on over the edge.The parents then dance and laugh while their daughter cries and find out that that isn't how to break the curse. Nope! Didn't have to do any of the crazy malicious things they did."

You can tell by their interactions that they know each other very well and know how to pick on one another lol So seeing the two of them together through the game was really enjoyable. If I may say, I thought the ending was a bit rushed and I wish there was one more ""mission"" before it. The whole game is beautiful and I liked the story, but I felt like there was a small part of it missing at the end of the game. Still, I guess this is a solid 8/10 game for me.

655,Dusk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Duskbatty/,11,,0,12.8,February,18,442,0,1,"Ok, so, I have mixed feelings on this one.  I played this exclusively with one other person, and I played as May.To be totally fair, I understand why this game is as popular as it is.  It's got incredible mechanics, there are times where they throw the visual style and take it to gorgeous extremes.  It also never gets dull, as the game is constantly throwing new mechanics at you and swapping out the old ones roughly around the time where they outstay their welcome.  It does a little too much handholding on the controls for my tastes(yes, for the 100th time, I know F grapples objects), but given the amount of mechanics that this game throws at you, I can totally understand why they decided to tell the players what button does what every time any interaction comes up.  The variety of the minigames is also really good and pretty well paced out to give you a break from the campaign nature of the game of going from point A to point B.Now, for the minor downsides.  You need to make an EA account to play this, that does annoy me.  But it's an EA game, so whatever, I got over it.  I initially had some issues launching the game at all, but apparently something went wrong with the initial installation.  Uninstalling and reinstalling the game got around that issues and the two of us had very few technical issues throughout the rest of the game.  As for some of the sections.  I don't understand what control scheme you are supposed to use for this.  Both me and my friend used KBM, which I feel really served us well in the shooter portions of this, but some of the isometric and top down sections really did not suit themselves to the KBM control scheme.  There were portions where I had to hold down W and tap D to really get the correct average direction to not fall of bridges, not to mention the dash had really weird angles to try and land on the correct platform.  My partner also appeared to be having similar problems with the teleporting mechanic, but I can't comment too much on that because I didn't play Cody(and I'm not planning on going back to this to do so).All of that would be fine, and the upsides far outweigh what I've posted so far.  The issue is the story.  Oh boy the story is... how do I put this?  You know that meme that was going around where people would constantly say ""Better love story than Twilight""?  Well, I can't make any comparisons to Twilight, never saw it you see.  But you could take every one of those memes and put the text ""Better love story than It Takes Two"" and it would absolutely be correct.The story was kind of ""meh"" at the start.  Ok, two people who are getting divorced get Isekai'd into dolls and basically a world created by their past mistakes.  We have a weird ""antagonist""(although not really?  This game doesn't have a true antagonist, which is another problem in of itself) of a book that has them going through challenges to get them back together for love or whatever.  They go through and try to figure out how to return to normal.  For some reason Cody ""figures out"" that since Rose's(their daughter) tears caused them to go into this world, they must be the key to get them back, so they run off and try to get their daughter to cry on them so that they can go back to normal.  It's a really weird leap of logic and the characters honestly have no reason to assume that this is true.  Spoilers from this point on.Then they get to the castle level.  Rose has a toy castle that they get to, and they decide the the best way to get Rose to cry is to kill the queen of the castle.  Queen Cutie, Rose's toy elephant.  They go up to the elephant, and brutally destroy her, limbs ripping off and Cutie begging for her life.  This goes on for maybe... 2 minutes or more?  All with both players needing to press buttons to continue the sequence.  May and Cody are horrific people for doing this, and even if the rest of the story would have been tolerable, it is all soured by the fact that THIS is the first thing that they agreed they should do.  They did comment that they felt like horrible people, but neither of them even remotely thought ""Hey, maybe we shouldn't be doing this?"" and that speaks volumes of their characters.  Shocker, Rose's tears don't work, and they are stuck as dolls.  They deserve it.And then they go to therapy.  It's whatever, probably would be pretty decent if it wasn't completely overshadowed by the previous scene.  It ultimately boils down to Cody and Rose need to find their passion or whatever.  It's from this point that I will take a break from what is going on to our two ""protagonists"", and describe how Rose has been seeing all of this.  Everything has basically been life as normal for Rose, she's more or less been left all on her own and trying to deal with the fact that her parents are getting divorced.  Her age is never stated I don't think, but she's like 10 maybe?  Her parents bodies are still in the house, but they are just kinda sleeping for Rose, she's got no idea any of this magic stuff is happening to her parents.  She goes to her dad and he's just sitting upright at his desk, just sitting there with his eyes closed.  She tells her dad about the book she's gotten and she thinks it would help the marriage.  Her dad doesn't respond(for reasons obvious to the players) and Rose eventually leave, but what really stands out to me is that Rose never left the entrance of the room to go and actually see him.  This all happened with Rose talking to her dad from the doorway.  She eventually leaves the room, but she never approaches her dad.  She also does the same thing with her mom as her mom is sleeping on the couch.  Rose leaves her alone because her mom must ""have that headache again"".  She does approach her mom to play her favorite song when she finds the vinyl recorder up in the attic, but Rose takes a look at what is going on(and has been going on since almost the start of the game) and makes the conclusion that she is the cause of the divorce and runs away from home.  Like what?  Ok, I can understand that she's not entirely thinking clearly because her parents told her that they are getting divorced, but shortly after that, both of your parents completely stop responding to the outside world, and she doesn't consider that they might be sick or injured?  She has conversations with them were they(from her POV) are *completely* ignoring her and have gone catatonic, and she doesn't think that something is horribly wrong with them?  The only way that I would believe that to be true would be if she has been neglected for a very, VERY long time.  And that just makes me consider that it might be better if she were to run away to a friend's house or something.  At least then she might be able to get some help.  Just utterly heartbreaking how this implies what's been going on before the game even started.Returning to Rose and Cody(what? did you think my complaints about the story were done yet? Almost) they are going through therapy, slowly learning to get along again, but the real kicker for me is the final cutscene.  It is revealed(or at least HEAVILY implied) that the only way that Cody and May could possibly get back to normal is to kiss.  I will be honest, I was furious with the game after that scene.  I know somebody who was in an abusive relationship.  Like a real life threatening situation she was in.  So what, somebody like that is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the situation that this game brings up?  Honestly, if some people go through this scenario, the right call could EASILY be to stay that way, and run from your abuser never to return.  Once you make it even a few houses over, you would never be found by your so called ""partner"", and the abuser would effectively be dead in the real world, never to prey on anyone else.It's a real shame.  To have such fantastic visuals and mechanics linked to such an abysmally bad story.  This game is the worst tragedy I have ever seen in every way."

Its near perfect! The grapchis are amazing, sweet and playful. The gameplay is creative, casual and everchanging. The story is deep, powerful and heartwarmning.

Its a bit sad, that they haven't implimented that.Stuff worth knowing besides above info? You can play with a friend via Friend's Pass, but one of you need the full game. Only the person with the full game version will unlock achievements. If both players own the full game, both players will unlock achievements simultaneously.All achievements are super easy, as is the whole game. A very relaxing, causal gameplay with lots of elements to keep you interested and entertained for hours!"

They absolutely loved it, and completed the game twice so that they could try all the levels with both characters.Sitting on the sidelines, the game really impressed me with extremely polished and variying visuals. Amazing texture work, lighting and 3d models.Gameplay wise it's a fairly simple platform action puzzler, with strong emphasis on teamwork. But even though the mechanics never get very complicated, they constantly change throughout the game, as the two characters get new abilities that synergize together.I didn't do my homework in regards to the story, so the subject of divorce hit a little too close to home. It's well told, and gets quite emotional at times.Now I have to go try and find a worthy follow up game for them to play - and that's a tall order!"

Josef Fares and his team at Hazelight Studios have once again made a staple in the co-op gaming genre. If you have never played one of their games before; you actually  a second person to play this. They swiftly cut-out any issues with this as only one person needs to purchase the game, while the other can install the ""Friend Pass"" and be invited to play with no extra cost. Amazing! The game itself is excellent with so many concepts and ideas utilized to create a fantastic co-op experience. As usual with Hazelight, you'll play upwards of 4-5 different genres of games within this story. From 3rd person action-adventure, to fighting game, to hack-and-slash, to rpg, to top-down, etc. etc. There's no shortness of fun and exciting new ways to keep you playing. This game is a bit longer then Hazelight's previous development; A Way Out, which is certainly welcome. Especially because the game never feels like it is taking too long or putting in little effort... If anything, you may feel like you are going too fast in some of the glorious-looking and creative environments you and your partner will be in. I can't recommend this game enough, it is worth every penny it is asking for. Buy it!!!"

This was simply *not* possible. After sending each other friend requests, noone had received them, and thats that. We ended up playing with the steam ""remote play"" option, which sucks, because the input lags, the quality is impacted, the game is in split-screen mode...TL;DR: Coop circumstances are a big disappointment thanks to EA / Origin and f**ks up the whole experience. Too bad..(I'm open to help/suggestions at this point, so if anyone knows how to fix this, please shout)"

735,Lotus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreamylotus/,2,,1,12.9,July,"12,","1,629",0,1,"After developer Hazelight already offered a very entertaining coop-experience with  in 2018, they're back again with a more family-friendly 2-player game, this time with a focus on relationship and cooperation. Still, the basics remain the same: One player has to buy the game, the other one can use the ""friend pass"" download to play for free. And a second player is absolutely as this game simply can't be played alone; don't expect an option for an AI-controlled partner or something similar. A last heads-up: there's also no option for online-matchmaking, so you'll have to find your coop-partner by yourself.So, what can you expect after finding a coop partner and setting the game up? A surprisingly long story campaign with a lot of variety that'll have the two of you cooperate in ways you never thought about. Seriously, the biggest surprise I had with this game was probably the amount of time it lasted.  lists playtimes between 11 and 14 hours and this matches with how long it took us to beat the game. What's even more amazing is that the game rarely felt like it's getting stale despite its length, the overwhelming majority of the time always offered a new spin on things.And I mean that in more ways than one: From the gameplay to the settings or locations, this game is just bursting with ideas. To not take away any surprise, I unfortunately can't go into detail here, but the featured screenshots should already provide a small glimpse at what's waiting for you. Most of the game feels like a wild theme park ride that moves on just in time when things are about to become predictable. The abilities the two protagonists, May and Cody, can use also change at about the same pace. Sometimes each player controls one part of a magnet, sometimes each of you has a hammer while the other one has a set of nails and so on. Some of these abilities are more standard - like just having a different set of ""guns"" - but many are entirely unique and used accordingly.And when I say used, I mean used to traverse areas, solve puzzles and so on. Think  but constantly switching the environment and tools. Sometimes a player needs to clear obstacles for another, sometimes the two of you fight together, sometimes you just play discoverable minigames together - ranging from stuff like chess to more exciting ones like Whack-a-Mole (one player being the whacker, one the mole). This does require the players to show off various gaming skills, from aiming to platforming to beating rhythm games.This variety should not pose a problem even for less experienced players: The difficulty isn't high and there are a lot of checkpoints. Boss battles, etc. also only reset when both players die and offer a quick respawn. The game is very forgiving in that regard. However, some parts do require a tighter cooperation between both players. For example, one player might need to cross a huge gap by themselves. The only way to get across is by jumping across a few platforms. These platforms can only be moved by the second player, who constantly has to adjust their positions - or the jumping player might fall down the gap. In a case like this, it's impossible for the jumping player to offer any ingame assistance to the other player. Reloading checkpoints, etc. are not going to help either. The player controlling the platforms has to perform the required actions or the game won't continue. In cases like these, it might be preferable to play the game using local coop, so players can offer each other ""real life"" help.Moving on from the gameplay, let's talk plot. To keep the whole experience together, a Pixar-like story serves as the rail for the gameplay train to move on, featuring four main and a large amount of side characters. It's not a tense, more gritty experience like , it feels more like a playable Disney movie for the whole family. The message isn't particularly complex and story developments are predictable in some parts, but it features great moments that'll make both, the ingame protagonists and you + your coop-partner feel amazed. This is a game that you two might not talk that much about in regard to the general plot afterwards - but you'll definitely talk about some characters or setpieces or minigames you lost/won against the other.Lastly, I have to mention the graphics. The game offers great looking visuals, which is even more impressive considering just how many different places you are going to visit. Again, no further details because of spoilers, but expect some ""wow!"" moments - not only because of the used Unreal Engine 4 but because of the amazingly creative designs and setpieces. This game might not break any boundaries for videogame graphics in general but it's still a treat to look at.To conclude,  is an extremely enjoyable coop experience that offers a huge amount of variety despite it's length. It offers some great moments, locations and characters which are certainly going to get both, you and your partner, talking. Sometimes a few chapters stay a little too long and the overall story might not be somewhat predictable and not the deepest - but the overall experience is still amazing and definitely a must-play coop game."
736,Vitlök,https://steamcommunity.com/id/witols/,14,1,0,2.0,September,"19,",895,0,1,"I played this game with a ""friend"", on the couch. This review is based on both mine and her impressions of the first two hours of play.Our first issue was that we didn't like the main characters. My friend in particular was very annoyed at the sheer vitriol they have for each other. To paraphrase her: ""This is a point where anything but a divorce is just cruelty to everyone involved."" Like, wow, I saw my fair share of toxic families, but these guys are on a different level. Cody and Rose hate each other with a primordial passion of a thousand suns, and constantly (and I do mean constantly) nag and insult each other. And Mr Book, the guy who's supposed to make the player characters come together, is pushy and not charming at all.But hey, if the game's fun to play, we can just suffer through the cutscenes until things hopefully get better. Yeah? Well, it was quite well thought and diverse, I'll give it that. You constantly get new toys to play with and they're used and reused in interesting and creative ways. That said, I rarely felt like I'm having actual fun there. It was almost like Simon Says: figuring out what is the intended way to proceed, and then doing it in tandem with your partner. We've played a lot of coop games over the years and didn't have a lot of fun here. And finally, the biggest thing - the tone issues. The game presents itself as kid friendly. Little girl making a wish to a magical book to keep their parents together. And surely enough, that's how it starts out...And then suddenly you have to do a God of War-style execution on a boss as they What in the unholiest of hyucks is that? Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem with brutality or viscera (to an extent): DOOM 2016 is my jam, I just beat , and I stomped the crap out of the necromorphs in Dead Space. But here this level of violence not only came out of nowhere, it completely clashed against the general tone of the game. And that's not all: later on you get locked by squirrels in a murder room, where you were expected to be killed by wasps - but instead you respawn, and die over and over again (in a cutscene). Also, for some reason there's a torture minigame - one of you gets locked in a jar, while the other one can press buttons to make the other die in horrible ways.What sort of starfish blue and orange morality is this? Oh, the game's made in Sweden? Are you guys okay? Or maybe I've been the starfish all along, considering I've never heard any complaints about what I just wrote.The game's quite pretty, that's for sure - and has this distinct aesthetic that's sure to draw people in. If I had to guess, the popularity of this game comes from the fact that it has this AA/AAA level of production values, and there aren't a lot of coop games of that magnitude. Also, it's published by EA, which grants it massive reach and some top shelf marketing. But the okay-ish gameplay, annoying writing and horrifying tonal issues completely negate any and all goodwill I've had for this game.I'll give it one thing: it improved my relationship by showing me that both me and my partner are sensitive to the same things. But it also revealed to me just how desensitised people are to acts of cruelty. Hope that helps."

I had this problem earlier on in the story line but It went away on reopening the game. (The issue that I ""Can't connect to EA servers"" even though my network is strong and everything else on my end looks fine)Until this issue is fixed I can't say I recommend, as I don't want someone else to spend money only to not be able to progress any further than a certain point in the game.

The developers really paid amazing attention to detail, and the visual sequences and level designs were stunning. Both myself, and my friend have a whole folder of screenshots dedicated to some of the scenes. It would've been amazing if the game play was choice based, and how you worked together affected the ending (either staying together or getting a divorce). Overall though I would recommend this to everyone, and if you don't have someone to play it with then find someone in the community groups that's also looking for another player.

Thankfully you don't both need to buy the game, if one of you owns It Takes Two then the other can download a free version of the game and join you through that. It's mainly a platformer game, but it switches between a ton of different genres throughout its run. Game length is anywhere from 8-14 hours, my partner and I did a 100% run and that took us a total of 11.8 hours. The story is very light-hearted with quite a bit of adult humor thrown in there, the game also does have some genuine dark moments. Every chapter in the game has it's own gimmick that you need to deal with till the end of the chapter. Overall I'd say nearly every chapter is relatively fun! Sadly the last chapter is the only chapter in the game that didn't entertain my lover and I. The last chapter feels rather rushed, but the mediocre chapter is followed up by a touching finale in the form of multiple cutscenes. My lover and I both agreed that it's roughly an 8/10 game. I'd recommend playing it in small bursts of 1-3 hours at a time and just taking it slow."

There are two playable characters: A husband and a wife.There are 25 mini-games, including a Chess mini-game (don't forget to pick ""infinite time"" while playing chess.)  It even allows the ""En Passant"" move!!!  My Polish friend was flabbergasted when I did it, thinking that I had cheated or something.  No.  It's just ""En Passant"".  I then sent her the Polish Wikipedia page about it.This is such a lovely tale of a couple at the breaking point and their counselling/therapy.

Origin, which is very unstable was forced not only to me who bought this game but also to the person I played this with. So the whole 'Friend's Pass' thing makes 0️⃣ sense. And even when I made everything as needed for it to work, it didn't. Boooo EA, boo forever! There were also plenty of places on the map the characters got stuck but that's a minor issue.The thing that is special in this game is all about the gameplay elements that are constantly introduced, similar to how Nintendo does in 'Super Mario' games. They are unfortunately sometimes too short for a player to enjoy but the diversity of them makes up for that. You can catch yourself asking ""Oh, what now?!"" during the play, and that's a good thing here as it keeps it fresh and inviting. I would rave about the graphic but with the GPU prices, I'm stuck with the gtx 10xx that had a hard time keeping up with this game even at low settings. But I've seen it played on max settings on better PCs and it's gorgeous! So the co-op aspect, gameplay mechanics, and great overall graphics definitely check out. What didn't check out are the characters that I simply could NOT stand. I recall calling their daughter Sméagol every time she would pop up and do some dumb thing... Like Jeniffer... gurl, your parents are in a coma (probably) and you're running away from home, tf(?)! The same goes for the parents and Hakim. Lawd, I felt like they all deserved a ♥♥♥♥♥ slap! NOT Cutie III, Queen of the Magic Castle. Oh no, she didn't deserve a thing we were forced to do to her.In the end, it somehow felt underwhelming. The cheesy story met with the heavy subject didn't help. I legit sat there when the rushed end just happened and felt let down with the anticlimatic vibe. Still, would I play it again for the joy of the gameplay and the art? You betcha! There are tons of fun mini-games to explore and 'It Takes Two' is, despite all the issues one of the best couch co-op games in recent years."

839,Severely Artistic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SeverelyArtistic/,2,,1,12.4,January,"2,",411,1,1,"Played it through with my close friend. Well deserved Game of the Year. Let me first preface this with saying this is not a game meant for kids. Concepts like divorce and the effects it has on children is not for the faint of heart. The infamous ""elephant scene"" is viewed to be dark and turned a number of people away from recommending this game to others, but in my opinion those individuals overlooked the bigger picture of what the scene was meant to offer in terms of the story and the player's views on the overall narrative. That's not what I'm going to make as the topic of my review however. You can find a more in depth explanation on a 30 minute YouTube video essay or something like that.That aside, the game has a well-written narrative backed by incredibly unique game-play. Every level feels different from the previous and offers an experience not found in many other games being developed in recent times. I don't want to spoil anything in particular. So, to say the least, It Takes Two succeeds in offering a unique spin on the Platformer genre not found in other games developed in recent times.Level design is generally linear and easy to play through. I can't say I struggled with the game or really had any frustrating moments, although some parts did require a bit of finesse to get through. Overall very intuitive and easy to get a hang of alongside some small mini-games thrown here and there to compete with whoever you're playing with. They don't do anything to the story, just offers something random and fun to do every now and then. It Takes Two succeeds in all aspects of a co-op game. It is possible to play through one sitting, although it would be a very long sitting, with an average of 12-14 hours to complete. I guarantee whoever you're playing with whether it's a friend or a significant other that you'll have a joyful experience and take something away from it at the end."

All-in-all, a very greatly made game and very enjoyable solo or with a friend.Only issues I have about this, is the signing in to play (Why make it so difficult to log-in or play the game even though it's available on Steam? Not to mention the creating of an account with both Origin and EA -.- ). This took a long time to set up initially and we ended up giving up the first time around trying to sort things out so we could play. Tried again the next day, and everything seemed to work much better. If this game could be made available through steam and only steam (no extra game launchers or accounts needed), it would make it much more easier for the player their self to enjoy getting into it better. Other than that, a wonderful game and enjoyable to play throughout it~!"

But no worrries you get a friend pass for a person you would like to invite to play, so only one person needs to buy the game! Luckily I played with a great person who also didn't want to rush the game. We both didn't have time to play often, so we played once a week at times. And to confuse ourselves a little more we switched the characters each time we played again - it was funny to get used to one side of the screen again. I liked that there were lots of details in the game and you could tell there is a lot of love behind the game design. Storywise it was really interesting and well transmitted. ,,It takes two"" became a sentence I frequently used with the person I played with to joke about something and it actually relates to good situations. Various jump 'n runs, 1v1's against each other, boss fights or solving small puzzles made everything more enjoyable. BUT of course it also helps strengthen a relationship. I was not too close with a friend when we started playing, but because it also needs communication, patience and sometimes a lot of patience ;) - it definitely helps in that way. Especially at the end of the game we took enough time to finish it. The 3d chess game was lots of fun, so we ended up playing it for some hours. One short moment of respect to a particular character:Rest in peace cute little elephant.Overall:I recommend this game to everyone who likes good puzzles, to play with a friend, to have a great time, to play mini-games and listen to a talking book with a neat accent."

It gives you opportunity to look at many things from a different perspective. There are many fun minigames you can play, and compete with your friends. The main story is actually very deep and serious. This game gives you something to think about, it gives you lots of challenges to overcome together with your game- partner, but at the same time is very fun to play. At least  I had lots of fun. I enjoyed this game to the last second of its gameplay. Thank you for this masterpiece. I hope, that there will be similar games to this in the future!"

Diverse gameplay, minigames, and challenges presented in each chapter. I love all the little nuances.As seen in the trailer, there is a spider section and it's somewhat time consuming (not terribly long but also not a short hop). If you can, I recommend playing this section with someone else or taking/giving the controller to the other player.Unfortunately my SO has bad arachnophobia and since we played online, we pushed through and it soured the whole level/game night. I haven't encountered any other possible triggers in regards to phobias specifically and if there were, it seemed short lived.There is a possible seizure trigger in a section of  It is exactly what it sounds like. The last section of the game is also rather trippy.It would've been nice to skip these sections if possible as neither contained much to the overall story. It was just game mechanics that were used once and never again.(I put spoilers just in case but I also kept it rather vague.)But I was intrigued by the fun mechanics and gameplay more than anything as opposed to the story. Despite all that was said above, it really is a solid and fun game for anyone looking for a story-driven co-op game. There unfortunately aren't many games out there like this so if you've got a friend or a loved one to play with, I highly recommend giving this a shot.I do wish there were more easter eggs. I was constantly looking for hidden areas. Gimme my eggs."

Don't get it to play with your kids.Visually speaking the game is one of the best I've seen. There is great understanding of color, composition and visual story telling that is very much felt throughout the game. The game plays mechanically as well as it looks visually. The puzzles are fun and creative and characters feel agile and responsive. Playing the characters feels like playing Mario to me personally.However. This game is *not* for kids, despite its PG12 rating. 98% of the game is absolutely kid friendly and genuinely lovely but the other 2% is completely out of place unnecessary cruelty.There is a scene in this game that ruined the game for me due to how cruel it was. Without spoilers, if you are sensitive to cruelty / torture then don't get the game. Mild spoiler on the scene:  . This specific scene in all honesty pissed me off so much because I never signed up to this. This game is rated PG12 and if you're sensitive to this sort of stuff it can be a little traumatizing. Of course your experience will vary but I for one think this scene alone should've took the game to 16-18+.  I am a 23 year old grown man and this was too much for me.This is such an absolute shame because it puts this big red stain on an otherwise absolute masterpiece. Seriously, who greenlit that scene? Did no one in the development team think it was completely out of place and unnecessary?Despite this genuinely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ scene, I can't say the game is bad. 98% of the game is a masterpiece, the other 2% is abhorrent and completely unnecessary."

There is an impressive amount of content (even if you don't choose to find all the minigames and secret areas), and throughout the whole experience there are new mechanics and gameplay types introduced constantly.  No mechanic ever overstays its welcome (though I will admit some stages occasionally feel like they go on a bit too long), and thanks to the immense variety, I think anyone can find something to get excited about.There are some glitches and softlocks occasionally, plus you need to invite friends through Origin rather than through Steam, but outside of that I can't think of much to say negatively about It Takes Two.  If I had to complain about something, it's that the character development is pretty nonexistent for a lot of the game (and the main characters just come off like bad people) until a point where everything suddenly changes; it feels almost insincere when they start improving.If you've got a friend or a partner or just anyone who you'd be interested in playing co-op games with, this is a STRONG recommendation.

The levels are well paced and the puzzles are good.*Different game mechanics for each “chapter” you enter. In one level May could have a hammer-grapple and next she could have a match launcher that explodes on impact.*Lots of Minigames; each mini game was very fun to play and I'm pretty sure there are 25 mini games total.*The Bosses are all unique and relatively easy to beat.*Dr. Hakim’s Book of Love saying “The Book of Love”.*Trippy Level design; I have no idea what drug the devs were taking but in the game, the best way I can describe it is “Honey, the kids are acid tripping AND i accidently shrunk them”. An example is you get transported to a pillow fort, it instantly transforms into a full functioning castle with people living in it. It's very trippy and I love it.* WE KILLED CUTIE!!!*Lots of stuff to explore and interact with; Surprisingly there’s stuff to do besides the story. Throughout the level, you will come across mini games, people to interact with, and smaller stuff to play with like an enlarged etch sketch.*Absolutely no in-game glitches that we came across! *Voice acting was great. *Awesome Platforming levels and action scenes.*Devs truly put their heart and soul into this game. I cannot exclaim the amount of detail they put into each and every level. Lots of creativity!What It Takes Two did Wrong/Bad:*Almost every cutscene jittered and was lower quality than the actual game graphics. Normally the cutscenes are supposed to look better than the gameplay, but it was quite the opposite.*May and Cody constantly bickering; I know that they are fighting and don’t love each other, but at times it got quite annoying hearing them fight all the time.*May’s voice actor; Don’t get me wrong, the voice actor is talented. But May’s voice was so annoying and whiny. *One Liners...*Dr. Hakim’s Book of Love's entire character was cringy and unpleasant to the eye.*CO-OP partner felt that they dragged the game out a little too much at the end.To be perfectly honest with you, there’s parts of this game that my CO-OP partner and I made 18+. All I’m going to say is the Sap Cannon XD. This CO-OP platforming game, filled to the brim with creative ideas and unique gameplay mechanics had me constantly entertained. I got this game for $30 and I highly recommend getting it while there's a sale. (Because saving money is nice)"

I personally love games like this and games you can play with a friend. Me and my friend were eager to play this game since it's the same studio that made ""A Way Out"", and we both loved that game. So we bought the game on launch. We hade high expectations of the game and me and my friend can say it did not disappoint.I could probably talk all day about how great this games is, but I won't. The game overall is great and if you and a friend are thinking about getting it, do it. Plus, one of you can buy it and then you can split the money between both of you, because only one needs to buy it, because of the firend pass.The story is great, lovely in fact. You'll play Cody and May, parents of a child. They are going through with a divorce, and the child Rose is sad about that. Cody and Mays spririts are transported in to these dolls that Rose has made. The story is really about them getting out of the dolls and back in to their own bodys. And to get out to their own bodys they have to take some sort of relationship counseling from a book, called Dr. Hakim. At first I thought he would be annoying with his humor and such, but it was acually kinda funny, plus the accent is a great touch and makes it so much funnier and better. In the beginning of the game Cody and May don't really like each other that much, they are annoyed of each other. So in the beginning of the game the dialog between the two is kind of fun because they roast each other. As they start to work together and communicate with each other, the dialog gets more humble, and they start opening up and talking about why their marriage isn't working. It's lovley to see their relationship develop through out the game.Gameplay wise, I can't find anything negative really. Some parts aren't as great as others, but they are still good don't get me wrong. You and your friend will decide which character you want to play, Cody or May. I played May trough out the game. Anyway, you'll play different part of, I guess you can call them stages, and on every stage Cody and May will have new and different abillites. In the first stage, Cody will have the ability to throw nails, and May have a hammer she can use. And on the next stage the abillities will be diffrent and so on. May and Codys abillities do work together so to complete most of the pussles you have to make use of each other and work together. This means that your experiance of playing the game will be a lot diffrent depending on which character you are playing. This opens up great for playing the game another time, maybe with someone else or with the same person again.I love the abillities and they aren't boring or something I can say I have seen before in a game. New and unique.I could go deeper in to gameplay but I would be writing forever becuase so much of the game is great. You can find stuff that's related to ""A Way Out"" in the games. I like that, it's nice to be reminded of a great game.So, my recommendation is buy it, it's worth every little penny. It's totally worth it for full price. Me and my friend could have payed more for it, becuase it was that good. For the great times you'll have playing this game, it's worth full price, if not more."

1006,David0vić,https://steamcommunity.com/id/david0vic/,2,,1,10.3,May,"7,",479,0,1,"This is undoubtedly a very creative, unique and interesting game that is worth giving a look if you're looking for a coop experience. I bought this game because of all the praise it's received and i do think it's a bit overrated. I think this game overstays it's welcome and is way too long for this simplistic gameplay. I think the game starts off great because it feels fresh and new but after a few hours you start to get the gist of the experience. Even though the game does a terrific job at trying to versify the gameplay mechanics, environments and level design, it still somehow manages to feel by the numbers after a while, mainly because the core gameplay design and loop is still there. I also think the difficulty is an issue, it's just way too easy and passive which i think is fine for a short game, but for a 10 hour journey, i expect something more to keep my attention for that long. I had a lot of fun in the first half but in the second half i was just wishing for the game to be over despite some cool levels and set pieces. The story also didn't work for me. I thought the premise was neat but it didn't do enough to keep me hooked or motivated. There wasn't that drive for me to keep pushing to see what happens next mainly because the story loves to wander and meander around without much of a direction. The end goal of the story wasn't very compelling either mainly because i wasn't big on the two main characters, they were just kind of there for me. With all that being said it's hard for me to give this a negative review because i did have a good amount of fun, probably 50/50 fun and boredom and i can't deny the amount of creativity and passion that was put in this game. It's very unique and unlike anything out there. Some of the puzzles and sequences where you have to cooperate with your partner to progress is very clever and sometimes makes you lean back and think 'how did they come up with this'. Also local splitscreen is pretty much dead so we should support games like this to help give it some life.6/10 (Decent)"

1009,ANALSCHLAG,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Balliarx/,2,,1,17.5,May,"4,",102,0,1,"Gameplay BreakdownMy usual Gameplay Breakdown cannot be applied to It Takes Two, as it mixes-and-matches so many genres, making a full breakdown of each would prove nigh impossible, other than a spoiler as well.As main genres, ITT puts high emphasis on Platformer and Puzzle Game: in each stage, there will be multiple obstacle courses that often will need the combination of the two players' different tools or powers, in order to overcome them. The difficulty curve of such enigmas and platforming sections gently soars, first to accustom players to the new mechanics, and then leaving them free to use them at their full potential. However do not expect a hardcore challenge, as the game is more oriented towards an average / casual audience - which is fine, as it's not *too* easy, anyway.Secondary genres vary for each level, and in many cases they are unique, non-repeating sections with their own, specific gameplay mechanics. For instance, one of them will have players being able to manipulate their body size and gravity respectively, while another one will see Cody pilot an aircraft while May mans the turret to fend off attackers. Multiply cases like this for the totality of the game's duration, and the result is amazing variety.Minigames are found throughout the adventure, and put Cody and May against each other in small, competitive-oriented challenges. Also in this case, each minigame is unique and original, can be replayed unlimited times, and some of them will even change or become more difficult as the rounds go on. Winning or losing them doesn't give anything to the victor, they're just for fun's sake, a diversion. Certain side activities though, have unique achievements related to them.Sure, players can die during a boss fight, a platforming section, or any of the unique combat-oriented ones - although a game over only triggers when both are dead at the same time: the blessing of immortality allows both to quickly resurrect if defeated. Checkpoints are anyway very frequent and forgiving, even boss fights will checkpoint at every new phase's start, so losing progress in a frustrating way is not an issue."

This is one of the best games I've ever played and the fact that it has you share that experience with someone you're close to is even better. This game is very, very worth it and I highly recommend it to everyone! A big that that surprised me is that it seems like it could be a kids game when, in reality, it's good for all ages! ( Although, there are some moments that I wouldn't say are not kid friendly, for sure. ) If you guys are looking to really connect with a friend or loved one I would definitely buy this game. It's hours of fun and there's some amazing things that the devs have come up with for the gameplay and general experience. Literally, just buy it, you won't regret it."

I learned to communicate even better and praise my partner so much while playing. This game refuses you to being selfish but in a way praise yourself for winning the mini-games... BUT it gives you the chance to be competitive with your partner and learn their style of game play! It caught me more about collaboration and how all the things that make a relationship come alive again. This goes for any relationship, not just a marriage or whatever relationship others might consider a relationship - it shows you how to be human and how to work as one with one another if you really put your mind to it! IN LOVE WITH THE ENTIRETY OF THE GAME! Thank you ~"

The game takes you to many different places and each place feels unique and fun to explore together. I finished the game in around 14 hours and enjoyed every last second of it. I honestly was sad that it was over in the end. I definitely will go back later to try and get all achievements.People are complain about Origin being involved, which is true. But honestly, you don't even notice it considering you just start the game trough steam, steam then starts origin in the background and just launches the game. I never even once thought that origin got in the way of things so i really dont get that people downvote this game just for that.. it's kinda childish to do that. EA made a great game here, and if you ask me, it's only logical to try and advertise you're own launcher a bit with it. At least they didn't pull a ""Epicgames launcher classic move"" and made it exclusive to they're launcher. People forget that that is a thing and im really glad they didn't do that here.10/10 game.

1156,Xonifur,https://steamcommunity.com/id/XoniOfTheFur/,2,,1,32.1,July,"13,",199,0,1,"It Takes Two is a charming 2 player game focused on teamwork and trust. You take control of either Cody or May, whom are 2 parents having a divorce. Both characters have unique mechanics attached to them, but May is usually the character with lots of action and Cody is actually pretty supportive. Firstly, the game utilizes their focus on teamwork incredibly well. You never really feel left out when you play as either character because all the puzzles rely on using a character's mechanics together to make interesting plays as you progress through the game. Of course, as every game of teamwork must be, you can still troll your friends and force them to fall down cliffs or crush them with a hammer. Secondly, the game changes its mechanics constantly. At one point, you're using a hammer and nails together to lock things in place or smash things out of the way, the next you're using sap and a flare gun to make massive explosions together. The game never gets old and will evolve constantly. This is absolutely the game's strongest point, and they make use of most of their mechanics to an exciting degree. This game is absolutely very creative and even if you find yourself hating a mechanic you don't need to worry about it for too long because after about an hour you're met with a different one to toy around with. Thematically, the game is very beautiful. It takes place in all kinds of different environments and fantastical lands. There were times where you'd just hang out to enjoy the eye candy or admire the setting of some worlds you enter. Furthermore, the game does have a little bit of replay value. Most times, the character you pick gets a unique toy to play with that can change your experience of the game. For example, early into the game Cody will get nails that he can stick into walls for May to pole jump off of or he can stick them into boards for May to cross. May gets a hammer for smashing things or moving an object into place for Cody. The game also features cute minigames which are hidden all throughout the map for you to find and compete against each other with. Admittedly, some challenges are pretty biased in favor of one Character, but a lot are balanced pretty well for fair competition. This game absolutely is worth a try, and I'd definitely pick it up immediately even if it's not on sale. Your friend doesn't even need to purchase it. They just need to download the friend pass and they can play so long as someone owns the game. The game is also pretty long and entertained me and friend for a solid 10 hours before we actually even beat the game. Definitely worth a try if you're looking for something to play with friends or your lover."

While it is a bit on the shorter side (with our first playthrough taking 12 hours), it had such refreshing gameplay and replayability.  It Takes Two uses mechanics that are familiar to games, but introduces them in unique ways that kept surprising us as we played through the story. The story had a good balance of silly and dark, and there were subtle changes in the dialogue between the characters as the story progressed, reflecting their growth. The characters are well-written and have a lot of personality to them, and they had their own unique skills to use to support each other. The game also contains a bunch of neat little easter eggs, and nearly 30 mini-games to play, some of which require you to look for. With all the secrets there are to find, and how interesting the level designs are as well as how captivating the art style is, a full, thorough playthrough can easily surpass 10 hours of playing, during which you'd never be bored."

The game has you control one of two characters: Cody or May as you go through a magical version of your house in order to mend what it seem a too far gone broken relationship.The story begins with Cody and May announcing their divorce to their daughter. Obviously the daughter is incredibly upset by this and blames herself. She cries and her tears fell on some dolls and magically it transport the consciousness of Cody and May into those dolls. They are then greeted by this (in my opinion) funny character known as the Book of Life. He enthusiastically send the two of you off on a journey in order to fix your relationship so that Cody and May can return to their body. The story drives home some points on what relationship needs in order to be fix or work to begin with such as affection, willingness to work together, being a good partner, etc etc. The writing is alright with the story but where it really shines is all the interaction between Cody and May. Cody and May begins the story bitter towards each other, resentful, belittling, even bringing up the past and blaming each other. Through the game you will slowly see the two regain their affection towards each other, fall in love again, compromise and actually communicate with the issues they have with one and another. It is sweet but it is not a linear growth, you will see them progress and regress like a roller coaster but that is the best part about them. They're humans and flawed but they're trying. The two speak often as they're the only other characters aside from the book and the daughter so there is plenty of time to enjoy the interaction between the two, especially when they joke around or get competitive during minigames.Graphically the game is amazing. The colors and everything is vibrant and eye catching but not overly-saturated in comparison to games like modern Mario games. While retaining its cartoon-y art style that fulfill the purpose of making the  game feel whimsical and magical, there are also some very detailed textures and beautiful lighting that make things also give a sense of realism as well. I can't quite describe it but compare it to a high-budget modern Disney animated film where the art style still retain its identity while also delivering very highly detailed environments. There were multiple moments in the game where I had to simply pause and admire the view because of how beautiful it could get.As beautiful as the graphic can be, the gameplay outshines every part of the game. What appears to be just a platformer co-op switches up on you insanely often, touching on nearly every popular genre in gaming out there from racing to puzzle to shooters to even beat-em ups. And there is even more genres if you consider all the different minigames you can play with your partner that are completely optional. Typically you would worry about a game if they just simply jam all kind of different genres into one game as it can lead to multiple issues such as certain parts not being as polished or the game just lacking an identity, but it all just works like a cog in It Takes Two. The game also handles co-operative play insanely well where the two of you will not be just working together on the same puzzle, but often time than not the two of you will be doing two completely different objectives while helping the other progress. The game balance this really well cause at no point does it feel like the player playing May or Cody feel like they're carrying the other. As the title implies, it takes two to overcome all these obstacles and progress throughout the game. The game was never stale and always a pleasant to play. In terms of difficulty, the game is perfect for both casual and serious gamers. The game isn't so hard as so casual players can't pick this up to play with their partner but it also isn't so easy where it feels insulting and non challenging. This game truly is designed to be played by as many people as possible. Also for the griefers, it is also pretty fun to cause your partner to die in often hilarious ways.Overall, this game is probably my game of the year in 2021 because of how well crafted it is, especially as a co-op experience. This game isn't mind-blowing or that deep with innovative gameplay or super engaging story but because its just simply a blast to play with someone, whether its a friend, significant other, or family members. If you're looking for a good co-op experience, this game is a must play."

I have played games my entire life, but this one is just unbelievably good. In my personal opinion, the present day is the worst for good video games because all these million-dollar companies have huge teams to produce big titles but they always have flaws or lack in their fundamentals because they just want to squeeze profits. Nothing beats the classic games from the past, and this will be one of them. Everything about this game is good, I have nothing else to say, please buy it.

You can always rebind, though+ Great co-op - Not just ""you have another person there to talk with while you both effectively play single-player"" - Your partner is vital in completing the game+ Voice acting is surprisingly good, but my standards aren't as high as everyone else's so YMMV here+ Great for couples and/or family - This is definitely a game you'll be seeing played by parents and children for years to come+ Friends pass, which requires only one of you to purchase the game for both of you to play===CONS===- Steam just launches Origin, requiring you to make/use an existing EA account- Aforementioned Origin has a slew of UI shenanigans to get through, primarily when adding/inviting your friend- No manual save function (sort of) - My friend and I kept getting stuck when one of us would disconnect halfway through, forcing us to replay up to that point with our fingers crossed. There is a workaround, however. Manually quitting via returning to the main menu right before the disconnect will allow us to rejoin and pick up without issueI imagine that this'll see the ubiquitous-ness that Little Big Planet did on the PS3.

There is much to explore..minigames or small touches that elevate the game even higher.The whole package fits together perfectly. It's a major step up from A Way Out and Brothers, both of which I really liked. It Takes Two has taken the best ideas of both and ran with them. I will play this again. What a ride."
1251,ABunchOfFruit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fraant/,3,,1,11.4,April,"13,",119,0,1,"WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERSIt Takes Two:Gameplay 10/10: As far as gameplay goes, it was extremely fun. Every chapter had a new mechanic that involved some aspects of teamwork and some aspects of working apart. And the game never dwells on one thing. Its one great mechanic after another and it keeps the variety and spark that makes you want to progress one chapter after anotherVisuals 10/10: Every single scene, every single backdrop, every single animation in the doll form was perfect. The scenery looked amazing, the characters gave life into every area, instead of just blank, non interactable faces. The visual style in the game just exceeded expectations and it was such a beautiful experience. Story 9.5/10: The story was very strong. From the start it established two believable main characters, May and Cody, and their attempt to get a divorce after some marital issues. The acting and character design makes you believe that they could never and will never not get a divorce, but the game allows them to slowly reconnect and regain the passion that they once shared. Almost every single bit of dialogue was perfect and I loved the way the characters, who were at one point so far apart, grow together to love each other again.Verdict:9.5/10One of the best games I've played in a long time"

This Game brings creativity really to the next level,I only can recommend you, give this game a try.

1258,Qain,https://steamcommunity.com/id/onomatopesha/,2,,1,27.0,April,"7,",791,2,1,"What a delightful experience - Not without its kinks - It Takes Two FEELS like PIXAR: THE GAME from the very beginning, with the use of a very bright palette of colours, everything just pops out of the screen.I played this game mainly with a friend online and my girlfriend locally and, in both cases, it worked just fine. My friend is a veteran gamer, whereas my gf is pretty much DAY 0 noob and, despite the differences, in both cases we felt a degree of challenge, whether in the clever use of mechanics or just learning the grasp of jumping, double jumping, dashing while jumping, etc. With that said, my friend and I came to a few conclusions:The mechanics are quite unique in the sense that on each level, there will be a new mechanic to be used and exploited. Their implementation and the context in which they are used is just magical, to the point where at some points we were just saying ""WOW"" out loud several times as the game changed mechanics and perspectives constantly. However, after a few levels, we noticed a certain pattern where one character would serve as an instrument for the other, and this remains like so for the entirety of the game. In a way that is fine because you can always change players whenever you are going to play, but at the same time it would be nice if the roles were switched every now and then.The main theme of the game, or the trigger for the whole thing to happen (the two main character's divorce) could have been exploited much further. I don't think the game is made for children, mainly because of the theme used, that's why I believe it could've been exploited much more so as to expand on the character's arcs (otherwise there is not much growth on the characters). While there are a few key levels and mechanics which do emphasize on this topic, I still feel that, in their ""casual"" interactions (outside of a cutscene), the theme could've been pushed much better. Still, this is a very minor complaint.In the context of forced co-op (be it online or local), we felt the game was just a tad longer than expected. Specially considering we are two young adults (does 30 ish count?) who are juggling with work and daily life just to coordinate a time to play and finish the game. Some particular levels we feel could've been shortened out or changed so as to shorten their pace.With all of that said, the ""negative"" points are basically us being rather nitpicky about the game. It Takes Two could very well set a new standard on which co-op games to base themselves on, with great voiceacting, an interesting, though not fully exploited, plot, an EXCELLENT implementation of co-op through Friend's Pass and an art design and mechanics that kept us entertained for about 12 hours.Highly recommended."

Playing this one singleplayer is just not an option. Developed by Hazelight Studios as the ""successor""of A Way Out, It Takes Two does indeed succeed at the already few things that the studio's previous co-op game could not. Faster, harder and somehow more enjoyable than the previous one, this is THE definitive co-op game you can play right now.+ An incredibly creative, rich and entertaining package.+ Unique gameplay, spread across multiple chapters, you won't encounter the same objective twice.+ Enjoyable music and general soundtrack, which fit the game perfectly.- Entirely co-op, that is not really a negative as the game is designed this way, but a good thing to keep in mind. You will need a friend to play it.- The story, which is not bad at all, but rather oriented towards children, or younger people. Due to my personal tastes and being an adult, I prefer deeper, more complex stories. Again this is very personal opinion and absolutely undeserving of being called a ""negative"", but for the sake of my review formats it is placed under that category.If you have two, then It Takes Two is for you, as simple as that. With its incredible ingenuity and entertainment, it is not surprising that this game is 2021's Game of the Year for most people. For me it falls just slightly behind Life is Strange: True Colors, which is my personal Game of the Year for 2021. Both games are complete opposites in reality, one had the most unique gameplay we've seen this year, or in a long time even. The other one had the best story of last year's titles. In the end, I take story over gameplay that is why True Colors edged for me. In regards to It Takes Two I give it a solid . Just remeber, you need CO-LLA-BO-RATION to get through this one."

I can't remember the last time I played a game with a smile the whole way through. is a lighthearted co-op game that plays like a platformer for the most part, but introduces all sorts of new gameplay elements throughout the game. Along with your partner, you will be solving puzzles, fighting bosses, competing in mini-games and just exploring large zones, each with their own unique theme.If you're looking for a co-op game to play with a good friend, a significant other or someone who generally isn't into video games, this is it.Everything you do feels so familiar, yet it kept surprising me all the way through. There were so many segments whose inspiration I feel I could recognize, it truly felt like an hommage to video games in general. There was at least one very direct reference I didn't expect, but they certainly didn't make an effort to shove it in your face.It managed to feel nostalgic even thought it's brand new. I saw a ton of games that made my childhood in it: Donkey Kong Country, Rayman 2 & 3, Mario Party, Mario Sunshine, Zelda, Diablo. Whoever designed each segment clearly loves video games. If you are familiar with these games, you will love  and if you aren't, it will show you most of what video games can be.There was honestly a lot more to the game than what I expected. The first level introduces a couple new gameplay elements and I thought that was it. I was ready to play the rest of the game like that. But as soon as I got comfortable with what I was given, I was already in a new area with a new theme and new gameplay elements. Every time I thought I was nearly done with the game, there was more. I was looking forward to finishing the game but at the same time I was hoping it wouldn't stop delivering; And it did.Growing up, video games felt like they were made to be fun first and foremost. Everything didn't  to have a purpose or a reward and I think that's what I liked the most about this game. There are a ton of things you can interact with that don't do anything particularly meaningful or rewarding... They're just there. This reminds me of old PC adventure games where some of the  fun I had was to just click stuff and see what it would do. It encourages you to explore and try things.There are also a lot of mini-games that are only there for you to compete with your partner. You don't have to play them at all but you'll  to play them and win. I found there was a nice enough variety that it gave both players a chance to shine, even if they're not the best at video games in general.It's absolutely gorgeous. Every level has an insane amount of details. It made me want to look in every corner of every level, not just because I was hoping to discover something hidden but just to see how everything was built. You'll play as miniature characters in big, surreal worlds. You're going to see a lot of original uses for otherwise boring household items, interesting materials used to craft the world you're in.Every cutscene made me forget I was playing a video game and made me think that this very well could have been an animated film.Hazelight Studios managed to take everything that  did right and improve on it, while adressing everything that wasn't so great about it. I set out to play both games one after the other with my girlfriend, without initially knowing the two were developped my the same company. I can say with confidence that everything I didn't like about  was no longer an issue.My gripes with  were mostly with the dialogue and story. I couldn't figure out whether I was supposed to take it seriously or not.  makes it abundatly clear that it doesn't take itself seriously. It takes an overall serious subject and makes it fun and lighthearted.The dialogue felt natural and believable. Most of all, it didn't take me out of the game like it did in . This style definitely seems to suit Hazelight Studios better than the more serious ."

Will you be able to pass a level without them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you over at least once during a puzzle? Will they disconnect their controllers in rage over a dumbass platforming sequence, or completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ own you in a button-mashing minigame? During these 15 hours, we have toiled over these struggles as we watch the two main character ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repair their marriage after a really stupid argument causes their gremlin daughter to run away. Like where the ♥♥♥♥ is she gonna go? I don't even think that bus stop she goes to in the ending is real, it's probably just a drop-off for the local human trafficking ring. I was laughing as the book tortured and cucked them, time and time again, from regaining their human bodies and getting the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other's lives. In truth, sometimes people aren't the right fit and no amount of forced Saw-esque therapy is going to fix a completely trashed marriage. The book understood this and used this opportunity to put them in a never-ending hell, and both May and Cody ended up getting back together out of sheer exhaustion. If I learned anything from this game, it's to:1. Never marry a British woman who owns a large tract of land in the middle of the country.2. Never conceive a daughter with this woman, who by judging the look of the daughter, may mean that your spouse is already a very close relative.3. Never own a red book in fear that it will send me through all seven layers of Dante's Inferno.4. Definitely buy a space baboon stuffed animal and name it Moon Baboon.Overall, a solid 9/10.(May)After we kissed in the game my partner and I had to resist the urge to pull off each others clothes and start passionately making out. It was hot. It was moist. But most importantly it took two. Just like this review, which was written by my partner above and me the account holder here. Also the daughter is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ugly which can be off putting at times and the wife is British which is kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lame as ♥♥♥♥. She is also really mean to Cody the whole game so she kinda sucks(Cody)                                                                            Fortnite Battlepass (included)I landed tilted towers but cody started default dancing on May's corpse and she slowly faded into the sweet release that was death. Fortunately Dr. Hakim came and told Cody that it would be ok because the real treasure and love is the friends we made along the way."

The main theme is problems of EA app.1, Background service not responding: Almost every time I launch the app it occurs the error that ""Background service not responding"" or simply report error.2, Software coding problems. In windows language is set to Chinese, the user can not choose the software installation location, more f*ck is, after switching to English although you can choose the installation location, but no matter how to choose, will eventually be installed in the C disk under the default location.It's not just about software bugs. It;s about EA's attitude.And I would say f u c k y o u EA. Tried and tried launching the app again and again, I finally realized there's no wonder many people play pirate EA's games.

1379,Aerothorn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aerothorn/,3,,1,18.6,June,"21,","1,742",0,1,"I cannot recall the last time I found such an irritating game so delightful, and such a delightful game so irritating. Really wish that Steam had a ""mixed"" rating for this one.To wit: It Takes Two is a co-op adventure incorporating platforming, puzzle-solving, and light combat (including boss fights). It’s surprisingly full of content, and all of it is polished and has the small details that indicate a labor of love. Over the course of the game you’ll explore a wide variety of genuinely beautiful environments, and each stage gives your characters different asymmetrical abilities and tools, to the point where It Takes Two feels like playing a succession of separate games with a shared control scheme. The design has clearly benefited from extensive playtesting, such that every element is accessible even to people who don’t regularly play video games. The downside of that accessibility is a certain lack of depth in every new mechanic it introduces, but this is solved by the constant retirement of existing mechanics in favor of new ones. It’s a brilliant solution to the challenge of building a game that appeals to both casual and enfranchised gamers. And, of course, video games are almost always more fun in co-op, which further elevates the experience. This is the delightful bit.The irritation comes in the fact that, rather than playing the sort of silent protagonists you’d often find in this sort of game, the two players embody Cody and Mae, a deeply unhappy married couple who spend most of the game needling each other, trading blame for their myriad failings, and generally being insufferable. This is not a clever Battle of the Sexes tribute; it’s time spent in the company of people who loathe each other almost as much as they loathe themselves, and have neither the wit nor self-awareness to trade proper quips. This is exactly as much fun as it sounds. Cody and Mae’s sole redeeming feature is that the other principle character, an animate book who communicates primarily in hip thrusts, is even worse, and the protagonists are never more relatable than when the book shows up and they briefly stop squabbling to go “Christ, not this guy again.”A lot of video games have unsatisfying and unambitious narratives, but these are typically conveyed in isolated cutscenes or exposition dumps in games that otherwise “focus on the gameplay,” where the narrative is simply there to communicate the game’s objectives. It Takes Two is the polar opposite: Cody and Mae will not shut up, and will constantly chatter over and comment on every single thing that happens on screen. I’ve never played a game with more vocal protagonists.To give credit where credit is due, It Takes Two isn’t phoning it in; the writers seem to genuinely want to tell a moving story of a troubled family finding a path forwards aside from the “easy out” of divorce (if that framing bothers you, you’ll find you have a lot of company). And it does have its moments; a now-infamous scene involving a plush elephant is an excellent slice of horror, and it’s true that Cody and Mae become at least somewhat less irritating as they learn to like themselves and rediscover what brought them together. Unfortunately, that really only happens in the last quarter of the game, and by that point I had long since tired of their company. The entire plot also rests on the premise that their daughter (who approaches Stepford Wives levels of implausible perfection) is so dumb that she doesn’t notice that both her parents are in magically-induced comas as they lie splayed on a couch, and assumes they’re just ignoring her."

My gf before playing this game had no experience whatsoever playing video games, yet she picked up the controls within 30 mins and non stopped laughed and had fun. This game is definitely a good entry point for getting into gaming, she is even creating her own Steam acc now and is getting a computer. I honestly can't remember the last time a game made me smile and laugh this much while also being totally obsessed with the game, also spending time with someone special while playing this game makes it absolutely memorable. I have never played anything like this in the 15 years of my gaming life, this game has pretty much touched every single genre and put it into one.I don't usually purchase games unless they are on a sale, but this was well worth the original purchase price. It is an absolute joy to play, the story is fantastic, the mini games are so damn fun and competitive, very impressive gameplay, the exciting secrets, the Easter eggs are really fun, its immersive, has a gorgeous soundtrack and is an absolute bundle of fun! We can defo see ourselves replaying this gem in the future. The graphics are beautiful and I thought the lighting was bloody stunning. The developers should be proud of this amazing game, (not EA though lol).If you have someone you want to get into gaming, or you just want to have an absolute ball with your partner or friend, pick this up. Take it from me, this game is %100 worth the money, 11/10 you wont regret it in the slightest."

To anyone who enjoys platform/co-op games; it isn't even a question - buy this game.

1386,Nightserg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stealthycockatrice/,21,,1,24.2,March,"30,",600,6,1,"and give me a follow on twitch if you liked my review, it really helps me out. It Takes Two is a casual but wonderful coop experience, a game that always comes up with new gameplay mechanics to keep you and your coop partner entertained. 👍 +Gameplay mechanics always change with each chapter to keep things fresh from start to end.+A visual treat, with different and unique locations.+Great overall sound design.👎-Incredibly easy, with little to no challenge at all in regards to platforming and puzzles. -Main story is nothing special. It Takes Two is a story about the divorce of a couple, and how their kid through magic and with the help from the Book of Love will help them get back together. It's a simple story, no plot twists, nothing really special. You know how it ends the moment you start the game. What is special about it, sorta, is the small parts of the story that happen while you're exploring the magical world of your house and its surroundings and how you're fixing your relationship with one another. The story starts with you and your other arguing while your daughter is trying desperately to help you get back together which sadly fails. She then goes back to her room and starts crying and somehow, never explained, through magic you two become dolls and are teleported to a twisted reality of the house you live in. The Book Of Love, comes to her aid and forces you both to deal with your relationship through several trials or chapters, each bringing you back closer to one another. It is nothing really special about it, so don't jump in the game for the story, It Takes Two is more about experiencing something, hell I'd even argue this game would fit better an actual couple rather than playing it with your friends and most will see it that way which will make it less appealing to a lot of players. Story rating: 7/10You play as either Cody or May and the main genre of the game is platforming and puzzle-solving with a bit of combat in between. I'll start with the worst aspect of the game because really there is just one, the difficulty. Unfortunately, this is a casual game, a very easy to play and get into no doubt but it will make a lot of its mechanics irrelevant. To put it straight, you cannot die in the game, sorta. If one if you falls down the pit you are brought back to life instantly or if you fall in combat or other events you can resurrect yourself easily by tapping E. If both of you should ""die"" at the same time, the game has a ton of checkpoints, even in mid/end boss phases that you'll never truly feel punished for it. That means a lot of the platforming events such as avoiding traps and whatnot become pointless. That being said, the very easy difficulty won't matter much if you jump into the game with the right expectations, even more so when the gameplay mechanics always change. What I mean by that is, in each chapter, you are given a set of tools, unique for each character and these tools will help you traverse the maps, solve puzzles, and progress through the level design. The coop aspect is extremely important as each tool will be used in combination with your partners. For example in the snowy chapter, you are given half a magnet, the blue for May and the Red for Cody, which is positive and negative and you will help each other push or pull obstacles for one another or simply traverse chasm by ""attracting"" to one another with the magnet force. Now imagine that in each chapter you get different and unique tools and you'll see why the game never really gets boring. It's a shame the difficulty is so easy because there are some really nice boss fights that could've been so much intense but alas, as you cut through its 10 to 15 hours all these awesome moments are more visual spectacle than gameplay challenges. There are some 1v1 moments called couple challenges where you play unique and fun minigames which can certainly prolong the experience if you wish. As for the split-screen thing just like in A Way Ou but probably more so here, it's pointless if you play online. You will almost always see what your partner sees and I get that it's a creative choice but it's not a good one, to be honest, and it's only good if you play on the same device. Gameplay rating: 8/10Straight out the bat, the first tunnel you go through or when the first event song starts playing, you'll notice how incredible they are. I was honestly shocked at how great the sound effects were and how they sounded unique, different, and accurate as you jumped and went through different places. There was clearly a lot of effort put into that and even the music, as you go through the last chapter, you'll be in awe. I think the final chapter of the game is one of the best visual and audio moments I've experienced in gaming. It felt like a Pixar/Disney movie so huge props to the team that pulled that off. As for the voice acting, while it has some cringe moments they do a great job at acting out their roles, especially The Book of Love. Audio rating: 9/1090% of the time it feels like you're actually playing a game straight out of Pixar or Disney animations. It's visually incredible and some set pieces will absolutely stun you. The character models, especially the ones you play look very detailed, the world, the level design, and how it all seamlessly fits together is truly an incredible work of art. Each chapter will put you through unique places, from snowy areas to a toy city that feels like it came from an RPG. But such visual performance does come at a cost, and there's going to be moments where the framerate will tank heavily but those are very rare moments luckily. There are some issues with connectivity and the second player might experience delays and lags so beware of that.Graphics, performance and tech analysis score: 9/10So is the game worth it? Hell yeah, it is. It's a wonderful coop experience, even if you play it with a friend rather than your lover/partner and while the difficulty is very casual-like it should not stop you from experiencing this work of art."

Its a family friendly game, so if you are looking at a way to bond with your gamer kid who has no time for you, this is an awesome way to do so. The game often changes according to the story. At one point it hands you with guns to shoot down a bunch of pests, at another time gives you a sword and magic to fight off guards in a castle. The story of the game is beautiful and gives a lesson of appreciating the people around you. It revolves around a couple, Cody and May who are getting divorced soon and Rose, their daughter, stuck in the middle of it. Rose wishes for them to be friends again and then you get into tiny dolls and try to get back into your body. Simple enough, but along the way you meet friends and foes, and cute creatures too.

The roughly 10 hour story adventure is filled with so many varying minigames and gimmicks so there's never a dull moment. It's exciting, it's daring, innovative. There's a lot of passion put into the game and it shows. It's like playing through a Disney/Pixar movie with all the charm and soul it's known for, and you do it all with a friend. As far as platforming and puzzle solving goes, most puzzles require timing and full cooperation but it's nothing too big brained given enough time but it's engaging all the same. Platforming is fluid, some of the best I've ever come across by far and very forgiving as both you and your co op partner have infinite lives which allows for great freedom of exploration. Story is very heartwarming and charming. Ending left me satisfied. The pacing was rather cliche but ultimately enjoyable. The Friend Pass System is one of the best features I've ever witnessed with regards to gaming. One player owns the game, partner plays for free. Wanna try the game out? Both players download the friend pass and try out the first chapter for free. It's brilliant. One of the best co op games I've ever played in terms of overall quality and fun factor.

Every single mission uses different places and weapons/equipment and you don't get the feeling that the game recycles assets. 9.5/10 Well done!"

Each chapter is fresh and exciting, with massively different settings and worlds each one as charming as the last, with references and Easter eggs strewn about everywhere. The puzzles are mixed up constantly so nothing feels repetitive, yet they remain thought-provoking and enjoyable to complete. The action set pieces are great, one mission you'll be flying a plane made out of underpants, the next you'll be battling toy knights as a wizard. Overall, I can feel that a lot of love went into this game, and if you have someone to play this with, I would highly recommend it."

You want to rush through the game or examine everything and participate in all the minigames? No problem, this world is your playground!- There's plenty of different gimmicks through the game and the gameplay is so fluid and ever changing that it's very hard to get bored even for just a moment. There were some unexpected moments that really stick out and that I am sure will remain in the memories of the players for a while!- The story in itself is very simple, but the good part here is the way the two main characters grow during the  adventure and how the relationship evolves.- This is not really a negative within the game in my opinion, but my partner found the game a bit too easy. In my opinion, the game is not excessively hard because they wanted for every type of player to be able to enjoy it and not just the hardcore ones. If you are looking for a harsh challenge however, this is not the game for you.- It is pretty easy to guess in which direction the story goes and how it will proceed overall.TL;DR: the game is loads of fun, it's extremely beautiful and will grant quite a few hours of enjoyment. A must play with your partner and/or friend! :)"

It is a beautiful game, and they did an amazing job of making it look as good as it does. Fully immersed in the world, I'm 100% here for that. What I'm not here for is these pieces of garbage that are the ""protagonists"". I don't think there's been a point where I haven't looked at the both of them and gone ""what is wrong with you?"" There isn't any redeeming qualities of the characters. They keep doing things to their daughter or to each other and there's no apologizing, no recognition of the things they've done that may or may not have been traumatizing (IF YOU KNOW YOU FREAKING KNOW). They don't have any qualities that make me root for them or their choices. Now, onto the farce that is the writing. The story itself is good, it is, but there are absolutely UNNECESSARY things that the characters do that add nothing to the story. It's just for the jarring tonal shift to make them come across as horrible people who make horrible decisions. Plot twist, didn't need any of those occurances to understand or know that. Whether or not the story gets better after the climax is irrelevant. Be prepared for this game to test you on a lot of levels. Long story short, if you make the characters insufferable, why on earth would I want to play it? Don't play this with your significant other if you want them to actually want to play games with you. Devs, you guys make a beautiful game. You need to do better on making the characters worth playing as, as well as working on some specific scenes. I shouldn't leave a game feeling extremely sad and horrified at something I've done when I didn't get the choice to opt out or just not have to participate. At least make those parts something you don't have to play, or even come with some type of warning."

The levels are engaging, and game play is always changing. The art style is beautiful, and the scenery is more unique one level to the next. That said, as much as I enjoy the game, the writing of the story is pretty terrible. It feels like there is very little character development throughout the game, and there is one scene in particular that completely ruins the lighthearted nature of the game.           (SPOILER ALERT) There is a scene where you and your partner gruesomely murder a very nice sentient toy elephant, because of a theory they had to turn back into humans. They rejoiced after killing this creature, and making their daughter cry, even dancing in her tears. Instead of showing remorse for what they just did, they are pissed off that it didn't break the spell. They have no reflection of this terrible act, and move on like nothing happened. This is terrible writing in my opinion, and one of the worst moments I've experienced in a game. It is rare that a game makes me feel truly terrible, and changes my emotions beyond a surface level. Just as a comparison in COD MW2 there was a terrible/controversial level where you are undercover with a terrorist group. The difference here is in COD you have the choice not to shoot anyone, and as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as it was, you were a pawn following orders. In this game, the terrible murder is unavoidable, not shown with any negative feelings, and was planned out by the main characters on a loose theory. Long story short, I don't recommend this game for kids anymore (even beyond the cuss words, and overarching themes), and even don't recommend it if you are emotionally sensitive. It is fun, but this one scene put a bad taste in my mouth regarding the main characters, and really lowered my opinion of an otherwise great game."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."
1499,Neensxo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Neensxo/,2,,1,37.6,August,"10,",121,0,1,"It Takes Two is hilariously fun! I love co-op games that have replayable value as I'd likely be playing it with multiple friends and this game has certainly got it! The game went on a little long, but it benefited me since I had to play it with another friend, so by the time I played the first part again, it was like I was playing it for the first time. Totally worth getting! Remember friends, if you end up purchasing it, you can play it with friends who don't have it! They just need to download the friend's pass so your frugal friends have no excuse but to try it with you! If you're still unsure about whether its worth it to purchase, please consider my pros and cons below.Pros: Its a story based game, so you really become invested in the characters. Lots of different obstacles that rely heavily on team work and cooperative gameplay, so its certainly a great challenge.Each level is new and exciting so it keeps you wildly entertained.The mini tutorials help each step of the way, so you don't feel lost.Easy to pick up on mechanics and controls feel smooth.Mini games in between levels that keep your competitive spirit up. These games can be played infinitely as well.Easy to navigate chapter selections so when you leave and come back, it won't be difficult to start where you've left off. You have the ability to switch characters at the beginning of chapter selection or resuming your saved game. The great thing about being able to switch characters is that you can replay a chapter and try out the unique gameplay mechanic that the other character has.The level designs are ABSOLUTELY beautiful and creatively done.And lastly, has a great message and positively hilarious!Cons:Went on a little long.Although 99% of the controls were smooth, there were some stages (particularly the ones where there's a lot of movement), the controls were a little sticky. Story can be predictable and cliche.Dialogue scenes were sometimes too lengthy. Honestly..look at the cons. I was pressing to try to find cons. HahaAnyway, I hope you end up getting it. x Take care!"

A pretty rare occasion that I come away thinking I really wouldnt have minded paying more (Keeping in mind I got it 60% off!)From the name, and likely you already know, It takes two, takes two. It is splitscreen regardless of local or online, and the friend pass means you only need 1 copy to play it online.Its a nice mix of puzzle platforming, with an approachable level of challenge to both. Neither myself, or my not-the-best coop partner, were stuck on anything for too long. Interestingly, because of our setup atm, we played without voice chat (he doesnt have a mic - ordinarily we would be in the same room - and having just moved to a new place we are not even on the same floor.) So, if we failed on a boss for eg, without saying anything to each other we just tried again and generally had figured out what went wrong, and then worked together to succeed with many 'nice!' moments.Game ran fine, and looked very well. In fact part of what made it a blast was each location never overstayed its welcome. The environments all look top notch with great variety too. And each new location was accompanied by a new gameplay mechanic to keep you engaged. On top of this, there are mini games all over the place which you can quickly revisit from the menu too once you discover them. Brilliant stuff.The story is fine. Its about a failing marriage, which makes for a change from monsters/zombie and good v evil etc. The lead female did come across overly whiny and the child has a very punchable face IMO, but whatever! They are making this into a movie - which is neat, but I cant say Im counting down the days. Also, it was kinda funny that by the end I found their voices were so well paired with their dolls vs their real selves.Enjoyed it from start to finish, would not have felt bad paying full price honestly. Huge thumbs up :)"

They will give you a gimmick for each level and fail to revisit that same gimmick in any capacity. In that respect - the game could have really benefited from a 'tool belt' system, allowing players to re-use tools and gimmicks from other levels in order to add depth to the puzzles. I imagine the game was intended to be extra casual for this omission alone.I'd still recommend the game just because of the friend pass system and length of the game being quite reasonable, just maybe not at full price."

1528,ttv/Excel_Xesient,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EXesient/,5,,1,16.3,July,"8,",214,1,1,"The second game from Hazelight, the dev from “A Way Out”, this time with more colorful and cartoony approach! I never play A Way Out before, but seeing everyone playing It Takes Two and seeing a glimpse of how beautiful the game is, I immediately bought the game at full price. Didn’t regret any of it!You only need one copy of the game to play together with your partner. And it uses a dedicated server as far as I know, and I have low to zero connectivity issues. The game did crash for both of us one time, but never happen again.You are playing as Husband(Cody) and Wife(May). Your marriage is on the verge of the end, but your Daughter(Rose) makes a wish that both of you can reconcile and fix your marriage. Through the help of a magical love book (Dr. Hakim), both of you turn into a living miniature doll! To revert the magic, you must follow the guidance of Dr. Hakim on what to do to fix your relationship with your partner. To be cooperative, to be understanding with each other, listen to your partner,  spare your time for each other, to reignite the love deep inside!Along the adventure, you gonna keep bantering with your partner about everything, and that is when we start to see the reason behind the divorce decision. But along with those, you also rediscover a little thing about your partner, that made you love them. A reminiscence of memory you spent together, from the silliest, dull thing, to a romantic one. Overall it is a heartwarming, hilarious, and joyful experience that you never gonna forget.At first glance, it looks like a Toy Story game, where you shrink and inanimate objects came alive. There are not a lot of enemies to fight with, but there’s a ton of puzzles and you need teamwork to do all of that, including defeating an enemy. Segmented with chapters, and each chapter has a unique theme that gives you a whole other experience that feels like a brand new game.The control move you can do is pretty basic, and you got a special item on each chapter to use, and you got a different item with your partner. It is predetermined on what you get on who are you playing as. Even tho the item does a simple thing, the application on the game is so genius and so varied, making solving a puzzle is not a daunting task, but a fun way to experimenting. The game is 3rd person view and sometimes there’s a shooter segment, but it still quite comfortable to play it with a controller.You can find dozens of minigame along the way, that you can procrastinate with to compete with your partner to determine who is better. You can play as long as you want, and even replay it from the main menu once you find it. There are also a few easter eggs to be found, and a fun achievement to unlock.This one is one of the main reasons that made me bought it. Not only is it rendered beautifully, but the art style is so cute and fun! They go hardcore on details and with each chapter with whole new themed, you never gonna be bored with it. From a simple garage, into a snowy field, underwater, and another magical world you dive into, be prepared to be awed by it.The music overall is having a cheerful atmosphere, knowing this is a fun and joyful game. The one that takes the trophy in my opinion is the voice cast behind the characters. With Cody and May being the ones constantly communicating, bickering, and joking, their character is really shown by their voice acting. And Dr. Hakim, it’s a either love it or hate it situation with Dr. Hakim, but in a good way! No matter what you feel about Dr. Hakim, he is a character that keeps lingering in your mind till the end of the game.Final ScoreIt is the best game I played so far in 2021. What really impress me is as my experience playing it with my partner, we do bickering in real life like Cody and May while playing it, and at the same time, we also being competitive while playing the minigames, also all the silly things that we can to in the game. All the experience Cody and May get in the game, in a way, also reflect to us as a player. Our feelings are mutual with Cody and May, and I think that is intended by the dev, and that’s what makes it’s a great game."

The voice acting, the graphics, the art style, the controls, the game mechanics and the story (so far) are a 10/10. It feels almost like playing through a Pixar movie or playing a Nintendo-quality title, it's honestly that good. The basic controls are insanely tight and easy to use, up there with the best of platforming games. Every level introduces new game mechanics that only last for that level, and they're all very fun and never outstay their welcome. The characters are all very well done so far as well, and the voice actors have done a great job. The amount of detail in all the levels is also mind blowing.Neither I nor my brother have had this much fun playing a game in a very long time, it's a blast.

Outside of Overcooked, Mario Party, and a handful of other co-op games, there's few that muster the sheer amusement and belly-laughing joy brought on by this game.First off, the game's levels and characters are beautifully designed and incredibly functional.  The worlds are immersive and really creative.  There were so many times during our playthrough that my wife and I remarked to each other how cool our surroundings were.  There wasn't a hint of a glitch or technical sticking point throughout our 18+ hour experience.The real star is the diversity of game mechanics on display here.  From levels underwater, flying through the air, using magnets, teaming up with flammable goo and fire, transforming into a potted plant... the list goes on.  Each area introduces a fun, not too difficult to learn or master, ability set that keeps things fresh throughout this 3D platforming action / adventure.The worst part of the game, in our opinion, was towards the middle of the story where things took a dark turn.  Naturally stories have conflict, and they need to pile this on to fulfill the character arcs, but we just had less fun in that middle section.  In the end, the redemption arc makes it somewhat worthwhile, but slogging through what you undoubtably know will be a dead end before your characters realize themselves was a bit morbid and felt like checking something off of the list.  I was hoping to see some kind of return to the character you had wronged in the end of the game for some closure, but it never happened.  Oh well.In the end, this is a fantastic game to play with someone you know will be up for the adventure with.  You'll have fun, you'll get frustrated, you'll yell at each other, you'll laugh until you cry, and you'll eventually beat it knowing you had a great time doing so.  It's all about CO-LLA-BO-RATION!9 / 10 would summon the gyrating book again."

Only one person needing to own this game makes this such a worth while purchase too. In terms of the level design this game was amazing. My only knock against this is the writing and story being quite cringe with the main characters as well as the plot progression.Note - If you have a vision impairment, this game does work with magnifier and also includes text-to-speech for menus. A lot of the levels may have contrast issues for people with various color blindness, but sharing this co-op experience with someone else who has normal functioning eyes means that they can guide you."

1579,Timestamp,https://steamcommunity.com/id/headofsuperpolice/,2,1,1,23.4,June,"14,",379,0,1,"Gameplay & Level design: Every level is extremely well made from start to end. The puzzles are challenging but never frustrating (apart from the Helltower, but that's optional). Every piece of furniture or jumping platform is a well made asset and placed perfectly. Nothing seems out of place and it's like living in a Pixar movie. Truly a work of genius. My favourite level has got to be the Time Town. Followed closely by the Dungeon Crawler level. Plot: A good 20+ hours of co-op playtime. It hits the right notes on its plot all the way through. The story involves two people on their quest to fix their relationship, while transformed into toy dolls. You get super powers in each level, and each power is unique and fun. They relate to attraction, spending time with each other, and the passions of each other's life. Gardening for Cody and Singing for May. The design for these concepts is truly stellar, and they work it into the story so nicely. From breaking the ice in the ice level to, literally, break the ice on their attraction again; and caring about their passions and supporting each other in what the other person loves to do, it involves the game in the story of the relationship well. Truly one of the best stories I've seen of a game, and I give the writers props for actually keeping a grip on me all the way through.Sound: Sound is A+ and all music and effects are spot-on. I think sound is underrated in most games, but this one has a truly triple-A sound direction by Gustaf Grefberg and Kristofer Eng's original tracks. Like the Pixar movie the game is inspired by, this sound track could be in any Hollywood picture. I loved the music of the finale chapter, where it was all about May's singing, and I was relishing in the creativity of the designer's imagination, as the superpower of May's singing was changing to the beat of the 70's guitar, 80's techno and all the fast paced on-rails races has soundtracks I'd listen to in my own time. Wonderful.Overall: Hazelight Studios is a great company and I fully expect masterpieces from them in the future. This was truly a game I did not expect to be blown away by, but this game blows its EA sponsorship out of the water and shines for the creators behind it. One thing I want to mention is that it has all forms of homages to other games, it has a full Dungeon Crawler level and side-scrolling platformer components, even a Street Fighter clone level fit with dodging and shoyukens. One of the best games I have ever played, and fully surprisingly too. If this isn't up there for Game of the Year in multiple awards I'd be shocked. 10/10"

It's challenging in some areas without being brutal, and so long as one person if alive you never truly fail so it's supremely forgiving.I rarely write reviews, but I cared enough about this that I felt compelled to with this game. Honestly, the reason I originally got it was because I love playing co-op games with my wife but it's frustrating to have to buy the same game twice just to do it. Now that I've played It Takes Two, I can confidently say that not having to buy two copies is the least in the long list of reasons to get this game. Seriously, get it."

I played with my girlfriend and we both liked it.It Takes Two was definetly made with the level of passion we see very rarely in today's games. Thank you Hazelight! Time to replay it with switched characters :)Pro:The story is great and impactful, with right amount of humor and references (which are also in game mechanics, characters and level design)Game mechanics are just brilliant. It changes on every level, so it doesn't get boring, it feels like you are playing a completely different game every time there is a new level. Also it creates a wonderful synergy between the two characters. You NEED to work together in order to complete the tasks, but do not worry, you WILL enjoy it very much. Although there are some rather difficult parts when you may need to start the sequence over and over again, it doesn't feel frustrating. I cannot put my finger on it, but it just doesn't make you rage at all. It feels like just the right amount of difficulty, forgiving checkpoint system and ""death"".Oh boy. The level design. The level design is just from another world. It is detailed to the last piece, looks astounding and just like the mechanics, it changes all the time. It never gets boring. Coupled with the well written soundtrack it creates an unforgettable experience.Cons:The only negative thing is the character (couple) development's pacing. It felt a little bit slow up until close to the end.Cody and May are a bit too stubborn. However the pro in this con is that it doesn't feel ""cliche-y"", it is not black and white, thus it is more real. I just feel there should have been a better balance in pacing.BUY THIS GAME!"

It fits all, and its done very, very, very well. Its an absolute MUST play with your significant other or best friend.  Visuals:Absolute stunning visuals, and beautiful screenshot worthy scenery.

1631,KittyKaut,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KittyKaut/,6,,0,12.2,September,"27,",367,0,1,The game would've been fun if we were actually able to play consistently. First issue was getting origin to actually launch the game. Then origin kept saying we were both offline and therefore could not invite each other. When we finally were able to get into the game it ran well up until the first boss battle in which my Player 2 kept crashing under 'Low Level Fatal Error'. Even after troubleshooting that issue it still crashes no matter what we do. I bought this game after having my BF mentioning wanting to play it but this entire game has been frustrating just to even start. I don't even want to touch that game anymore in case I go over the 2 hours and can't refund a game that doesn't even work.Update: Finally got the game working and completed it. The game itself was fun and it never felt like one person got all the cool tools. If the point of the book was to be hated the entire story then they did it right because we both hated the book the entire time. Another issue was the input lag or just complete lack of input detection especially when jumping. My view of the game hasn't really changed after completing it as it was an absolute hassle just to get it to work every time we wanted to play.

The developers managed to get all the aspects of the game right and the result is impressive and enjoyable. Let me start with the story, which is both serious, lightweight, sad and funny at times, it is a very nice cocktail and they balance it well, so none of these dominates too much and goes out of proportions. It is about relationships in general with its ups and downs, sometimes literally, being it a platformer :). Excellent narrative and characters, well crafted and diverse map design with gorgeous graphics and game mechanics that change from chapter to chapter, I must give special credit how creative they are. The map design allows for exploration in some chapters before pushing forward and there are in-built mini games you can discover and play together before progressing through the main story. They are excellently crafted and very enjoyable, a lovely addition. Boss fights are great, not too hard, fun and rewarding.The game has two characters and they do not only differ by the looks but every chapter they have a different arsenal of skills, tools and weapons. The main motto of the game is ""collaboration"" and you really need to interact with your partner to get through the levels. This imbalance and diversity works well and gives the game a very unique variety, a very nice design choice instead of a copy-paste approach. This also provides room for replayability, where you can switch the characters and have a totally different experience playing it. I cannot pinpoint any specific negatives, for sure I liked some chapters, design choices and weapons/tools better than others and did not enjoy all the mini games but this is very subjective. I already mentioned the game is not particularly hard, so for those looking for a challenging one, apart from the jumping and some trickier parts it is more on the pleasant side. I also felt some parts of the narrative were a bit dragging and not that engaging.Find a partner and play it, you will have fun for sure and it might also get you to think about relationships, which is not bad from a video game :)."

An absolute masterpiece of a game, a co-op experience unlike anything else out there. The hardest laughs I have had in a game and a shared joy between my co-op player and I that is simply unparalleled. Every level plays like a new game, the mechanics change, you interact with the world differently no sooner then it starts to get stale. No game has ever worked so hard to keep you interested, motivated, and wanting to experience what comes next. I am completely floored by how genius every part of this game was made. You will go from platformer to 3rd person shooter, to top down dungeon crawler, to co-op flight and many more all in the span of a few hours. And the craziest part is that it all feels great! Every level is a new mechanic that keeps the gameplay fresh and engaging. Every level is a new part of the story building to expand on the interaction between the main characters and their daughter. It is a true cooperative masterpiece that deserves all the respect and praise it is receiving. Some puzzles are harder than others, but you will never feel completely stupid, just smart enough to get your way through them and on to the next part. Puzzles actually require communication and collaboration to complete, which believe it or not, is not common in most ""coop"" games. Each character has their own function, purpose, role in the game that requires that visual or audible communication is had. there is no obstacle that can be done as a solo player.  Brilliance. The story works because it's relate able, grounded and part of many peoples lives. Screw what any media outlet says about it, there is a story, it plays a role, and though the theme (divorce) is not unique, the method in which it is told, the style in which you experience it and everything in between are absolutely genuine. This dev studio is a gem, a company that I hope to stick around for a long time giving us the greatest coop experiences on the market, raising the bar for AAA companies to show what can really be done when you have a team of passionate, talented and motivated people collaborating on a project that they all feel actually matters.  They should all be proud of what they have accomplished, I only hope that EA see's this for what it is and does not smother it like every other great dev studio they have ruined. As a student of game design, and someone who has worked at Disney studios, games like this are rare. You should be proud Hazelight, you have made your mark on this brutish, uninspired, and greedy industry. I look forward to seeing where you take us next!"

It is great on every possible aspect: gameplay, story, soundtrack, animation, graphics.. I also appreciate the sense of humor in the game coming mainly from Cody and Dr Hakim. One other thing, you don't have to buy the game if your friend has it; just get the friend pass and you'll be good to go. Otherwise, ITT is really worth its price. And finally, I really like how Hazelight works on co-op only games starting with Brothers, and then A Way Out, and now It Takes Two."

The animation feels like it's out of a modern film. Each chapter introduces new controls, and they all feel snappy. Nothing ever feels clunky or unfinished.Like with a Pixar movie, you'll get something different out of the story depending on where you're at in life. The characters are extremely well-developed, and the story takes them through clear arcs that make sense. I actually think I learned something about how I approach relationships while playing through this game.The game can only be played with two people, and it's paced perfectly with that in mind. Plenty of downtime after intense scenes to just let you talk with your co-op partner or separate and unwind, whatever you need. Moments where you're teaming up are interspersed with moments of exploration.Everything just makes for a great experience, one that's even greater than the sum of its parts."

What bugs? Oh the ones my friend and I exploded with a matchstick bazooka?This developer sets a new standard for gaming in an industry that's largely forgotten what it means to make something that's quality and rivals any triple A developer out there.In a word - Brilliant.Oh and did I mention the friends pass?

My character was going through walls, there was a huge timing delay resulting in failing levels over and over again, which meant we had to troubleshoot the game pretty much every single level. We tried Steam remote play which would only allow my bf to play with a controller and not his keyboard, which added extra input lag. This however seemed to be the only way to combat the game's many glitches in normal online co-op. The root of this issue seems to be that it launches through EA's Origin severs DESPITE running through Steam as well, which completely overloads the connection you have to the other player. EA's inability to run a game properly made this game extremely frustrating to get through, and made me question my $50 AUD purchase. Also they make you mutilate a cuddly Elephant to make their daughter cry? Jesus.This game would have been fantastic if not for the awful technical issues you are forced to slough through, making it unpleasant and tiresome to play.Update October 2022:EA seems to have patched many of the issues which were experienced in my review from last year. The game is no longer anywhere as near as laggy as it was, making it much more enjoyable to play. You still have to kill the elephant though."

I am so looking forward to what you can do as your next game after this was such a big hit - being a fan of A Way Out, and now It Takes Two - I can't wait for the next one. If we're all lucky, maybe it's closer around the corner than we think, DLC content following all the unique characters in each chapter? Spice it up with harder difficulty levels?

1789,ameyer2o06,https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkkslayer41/,1,,1,10.4,April,"16,",212,0,1,"Very well made coop game.Difficulty is pretty low. This is a casual co-op game that doesn't really require any advanced puzzle or platforming skills. Levels are extremely well made for the most part, with only a few segments getting a little repetitive. Every level has unique powers which are funny and provide a lot of entertainment. Both players get their share of cool moments in each stage. The good:- lots of content, very little reuse of assets or mechanics- good use of coop, the game doesn't feel like a single player game with a 2nd person tacked on- generates a lot of funny moments, definitely entertaining the whole way though.- letting the 2nd player play for free is awesome- 3D environments are definitely above current standards and look unexpectedly good (and continue to do so through the entire game)The bad:- origin service is trash and annoying to set up/get moving- occasional performance problems. I lost frames basically every time the game loaded something or i entered a new area, but this was not a problem in minute-to-minute gameplay.TL;DR: If you like coop games and are not looking for anything super brain-busting, definitely a good buy.9/10"

1806,ZeroPC,https://steamcommunity.com/id/elementalhero/,1,,1,22.2,April,"4,",219,0,1,"Wow. Just. Wow.From the same studio that brought you A Way Out, It Takes Two is a remarkable masterpiece that is exactly as it is described; you can't beat it without your friend.The games story is simple, but easy to follow and get attached too. You and your friend play as the married couple Cody and May that are planning to divorce. Their daughter, Rose, is afraid of them divorcing and wants them to stay together. After some magic and feels moments, poof, you and your friend are now pint-sized-puppets that must navigate through several levels, puzzles, and bosses, while following the instructions of a walking, talking, Mexican book of Love that tries to restore the relationship between you two and make the whole family happy again.The gameplay is really fun and VERY creative. It Takes Two is primarily puzzle focused and captures that focus almost flawlessly. The levels are all designed around different power ups both you and your partner receive and must use those new powers to navigate to your destination. This aspect is wonderful and prevents the game from getting repetitive, always giving the players new ways to get around the obstacles. The game is mostly plat-former (Mario, Sonic, ect.) however from time to time, the gameplay style changes for a bit, referencing other video games (I wont spoil the surprises) which I found funny, fun, and unique for the parts that they took place in.The game is beautiful. Absolutely gorgeous. My partner and I quite often found ourselves complimenting how amazing the backgrounds and visual designs looked quite often. Normally for games like these, I always have a least favorite visual design between all the different levels, but this game is so damn beautiful, I cant choose. One minute you're navigating a tool shed at pint size, next minute you're travelling through space and childs bedroom fort.The story is sad, sweet, and heartfelt. Every now and then during all the levels, the couple will briefly interact about their relationship (both positively and negatively), and look back at past memories ultimately building up to certain points in the game.  Overall I loved the experience this game gave me. I was on the edge of my chair the whole ride, excited for the next best thing in every chapter. I played this game with a really close friend which made the experience only better. If you are looking for a fun, immersive, co-op 3D plat-former, this masterpiece is a perfect choice. And remember, it takes two to make this experience its very best, not just one."

1820,Radiant Wisp,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198343887449/,13,3,0,12.3,November,"11,",109,0,1,"TL;DR: A game of missed opportunities from game mechanics to lore. Presents itself as relationship advice, and completely fails at it.I am leaning towards a negative review, although overall impression of the game is ""it's okay"". I would not recommend it to my friends, and I think there are better ways to spend your time than playing this game.So now onto why part. My main reason is that the game tries to be everything at the same time and it's really bad at it. The mechanics of the game change from chapter to chapter, very frequently, and none of them are used to the full potential.The biggest disappointment in gameplay was the last chapter. It introduces May power to sing and ""attack"" with voice, and Cody's power to wield a shield or boomerang type of weapon. And then the game just uses these mechanics as isolating button presses. Here is a wire that only Cody can interact with. Here is a bunch of microphones that only May can interact with. This has nothing to do with the power itself, at all, it's just separation of buttons for two players, without use of the actual mechanic.For example, game throws a leading through the maze puzzle, where May is screaming into different colour microphones to control the platform that Cody is on in different directions. Here, you can replace singing power that May have with anything else, at all, and the puzzle is still exactly the same. Her power is completely irrelevant to how you play the game.This poor design is felt through the whole game. Great potential for puzzles, and not used properly.Second great disappointment is the lore of the game. (major spoilers ahead)1. May and Cody murder Queen Cutie III in a brutal sequence with no player choice to cause their daughter to cry, they proceed to bathe in her tears, only to find out that they are wrong about the spell that was put on them. The book steals the letter from May and Cody and locks them into therapy session, in which the first chapter takes them to their vacation place where Cody proposed to May. Here is a thing. Neither May nor Cody never acknowledged that they have just abused their child, and made a mistake. They never mention the murder that they went through, they just forget about it and enjoy the revisit of the vacation. This is awful writing.2. The premise of the game is great. A broken relationship that is about to lead to divorce, and the struggle of the child accepting the situation. The ending is obvious from the start - the marriage will be repaired, that's the goal, family will be reunited. It's fine to have an obvious ending. And then the writers completely messed up on how to get to the ending. They throw in a ""therapy"" book, and ""expert"" on relationships, and give themselves a out of jail free card at the very end saying that the book was found in trash. This is an incredibly awful writing, that doesn't explore the actual causes of relationship issues, doesn't actually fix them, and just forces the two characters into romantic setup that magically recovers their marriage.3. Game gives bad relationship advice and ignores the obvious problem: communication issues. The game says that the relationship is restored by addressing:1) time that the couple spends together (more time = fixed marriage), which is not how it works in real life2) attraction between the two, which is not how you fix a marriage that is heading towards divorce3) Cody's passion towards gardening, which is completely irrelevant to the marriage4) May's passion towards singing, which is even more distant from the broken marriageThe game ignores real issues and forces players through a teenager's view of how to fix the relationship. The company that created the game could have just added a single most important person to the team that would make the lore work. A marriage therapist. It's so obvious for the game that presents itself as relationship fixing game, that I am baffled on how a big company did not get a therapist onboard to actually make the writing sensible.There were other issues with the game. There were a bunch of great moments in the game as well. This review is getting long already, so I am going to stop here, even though good moments are worth mentioning, but I bet you can find praise in other people reviews already."

It's an absolute staple of what modern game design should be. The game is so chock full of new, fun and reliable game mechanics that you leapfrog from one type of enjoyment to the next with incredibly well laid out pacing. Its akin to going to a fancy restaurant that has a taster plate of 100 different foods. It constantly surprises you with new flavours of fun you just wont expect. At one point there was just a pile of snowballs with the mechanic to pick up 3 snowballs at a time indefinitely, which lead to my duo and I having a 2 hour long snowball fight.Its just a fantastic experience overall. Also the business model is a rare gem, only one person has to buy and the other just joins with a free client. This eliminates the guilt/awkwardness of trying to get someone else to buy a coop game to play with you."

The developpers have really pushed it to the limit in terms of creating an ever changing gameplay experience. One second you are playing a plattformer, only to fight monsters RPG style the next. The puzzles are smart and depending on the levels and abilities you currently have the solution is always a little different.

1878,BunseyBunney,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BunseyBunney/,1,,1,23.0,March,25,46,0,1,"An absolute masterpiece! There are so many great things about this game but first off I want to start with my favourite part of the game which was the stunning environment design. Each level is so creative and immersive and it is so cool to see such detailed areas inspired by other environments in the game, the exaggerated world and all its quirks made exploring super fun! Combined with all the hidden mini-games and interactions one could easily spend hours just gawking at the wonderful art and design! I was also consistently engaged with the world with each level's newly introduced game mechanics, having two or more new mechanics introduced new ways to interact with the world and each other. Having these systems made every part of the story feel so unique to itself but it was done so well that even with the amount of mechanical content we were introduced to it never once felt out of place in the game. I also loved how with each new ability we were given it seemed to build upon May and Cody's characters, giving us more of a glimpse into what kind of people they are, I played as May and my favourite abilities of hers was the 'DrillBazzer X2000' and her harmonic singing voice. At first I was skeptical about the games story-line as I'm not big on romance orientated games, especially marriages however once I was really immersed into the game and learnt more about the characters and got to see how they interacted and their personalities I basically fell completely in love (ha) with the game in almost every aspect. By the end I was rooting for them! The story was so fulfilling and enriching, as long as you have a buddy to play with, I couldn't recommended this game highly enough in words that can encapsulate my playing experience."

I’m usually flabbergasted whenever we enter a new area.There are so many different mechanics and ways of utilising each that keeps the gameplay incredibly fresh.The puzzles aren't that difficult (pro and con, imo) but push for communication.Most characters are also unique and entertaining.It has moments of weirdness, cringe and an instance of unhinged brutal torturing that was NOT okay to go through with, but other than that scene, my only proper complaint is running the game through EA...10/10 biased and as a couch co-op 8.5/10 trying to be unbiased with my personal experience"

It just has it all to make every hour pass by like nothing. Story, puzzles, platforming, action, teamwork and fun. Just some of the major parts of the game, which is stunning from every perspective I can think of. Really have no complaints at all.Platforming was extremely varied with a good amount of familiarity throughout the whole game. The way they made it all fit the theme of the levels made it feel very fluent and so easy to be drawn in. Only so many ways you can change up platforming, I thought. But this really just knocked it out of the park. I never even once felt bored or annoyed at it, as it was seamlessly integrated with the beautiful environments. Works well for both experienced and casual gamers alike. Even the open sections were always fun and interactive so walking somewhere never felt like anything but an enjoyment. As well as that they still were easy to navigate and find your way forward. The game really gave just the perfect amount of hand-holding for you to feel in control, but have something to follow while playing through. The puzzles were spot on between fun and rewarding, as never did we get stuck on anything for more than a minute or two. And looking around, it often made it quite clear. The game kept this nice and even level of difficulty in all regards throughout the whole game, which never made it become an annoyance. So works perfectly if you want to have a fun and casual game together.So all in all, for sure one of the most fun platforming/puzzle games I've played in a long time due to such a balanced feel from minute one until the very end. Adore this game."

My only complaint is that I didn't like that certain parts in the game switched up the controls/views- how you move and whatnot. It made it harder to play. (I'm a noob lol) Otherwise good game!
1938,Mehrain,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mehrain/,1,,1,22.2,February,22,576,0,1,Wrote the review after finishing the game with my partner: For someone who likes action FPS with as much gore as possible this game was refreshing. Its been ages since i played a true co-op game and each chapter comes with its own surprise. 10/10 Would play again. Will play again. Recommended with partner.

Amazing co-play, lots of variation, smooth and stable and with surprisingly good graphics. One of a kind. Don't underestimate it though, it starts light but it's going to be a challenge for newbie gamers. Only play with people that never gamed before if they don't easily give up."

Fun, wonderful story, smooth and balanced co-operation, and extremely solid level design with nice eye for details. In the beginning I thought this was going to be one of those boring games, but further on in the game I came across level designs that made me wonder what the ♥♥♥♥ the writers were smoking when they wrote this game.

1948,High_Adjudicator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994077603/,1,,1,12.5,February,12,65,0,1,A clever mix of mechanics that do an excellent job of requiring the players to work together without making one feel inferior to the other or allowing one player to carry the other through challenges. You naturally end up cheering for each other to complete your respective challenges. Great game for couples. Though I will say that the cut scenes all feel like we are being forced to go through the couples and/or parent-child therapy of the writers. Could be a fun party game if you could skip the depressing cut scenes.

I expected some 5 hour game that'll be fun to play with a friend... It is so much more than that. It is full of adventure and is truly a love story. Some scenes in this... man. Some scenes in this are so good, beautiful, even I wish I could be there. But first I would have to get married and have a kid then fight and divorce and have her cry on her wooden and clay dolls then be turned into those dolls. Quite frankly that is too much work, so the creators of the game made it possible! There are so many huge and small details that you can tell took a lot of work. I love seeing them to the fullest. This is truly an amazing game, well done."

The creativity of this game is by far the most impressive. Every SECOND of this game leaves you absolutely mind blown at what you are, where you are or what you are doing. The level design is SPECTACULAR, we often found ourselfs at a stand still just taking in the BEAUTIFUL scenery around us, truly remarkable. This game is a 10 out of 10 throughout.

1961,bonkus donkus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bonkusdonkus/,1,,1,10.2,February,5,214,0,1,"On the whole, It Takes Two is a fantastic co-op experience, and one that's rich in diversity with a seemingly endless list of mechanical and stylistic approaches to different sections of the game. There's 3D platforming, 2D platforming, chase sequences, stealth sections, rhythm games, racing sections, incredible boss fights, unique puzzles, and more - and almost all of these different approaches tie into the theme and setting of the individual levels incredibly well, while also being polished, fun, and constantly reliant on cooperative gameplay.The plethora of movement and combat mechanics keeps the main game exciting. The minigames are lots of fun too, and the pacing between the main story and this side content makes for a great juxtaposition between cooperation and competition. And the top-notch atmosphere had me hooked for most of the game - the various detailed environments with unique character and enemy designs (plus great voice acting) gave off the same fantastical, cinematic vibe that a Pixar movie would.Not every section of It Takes Two is equally enthralling - the final level in particular felt a bit disjointed, with less polished controls and a pretty abrupt ending that I personally didn't think was all that satisfying. That being said, the majority of the game blew me away, and the atmosphere, polish, creativity, and variety of It Takes Two makes it an easy recommend from me. 9/10"

I have been wanting to play it for so long, but my partner was a little against the idea as it is a puzzle game. At the end of the day he bought it for me as a gift and it was everything I hoped it would be and much much ""mucho"" more. Not only did we play for hours on end, complementing each other as we go, but somehow our communication while gaming also improved. This game is really one of the best I have played in a very long time and I take my hat off to the creators, animators and the character designers. Screw it, the whole team! Well done! It was a little challenging, but easy enough to survive the next time and was very engaging. Would definitely play it again!!From: Hawke, my partner, since he could not leave a review on the free version.It Takes Two. Its in the title - and don't be fooled into thinking this is simply a game. This is an epic! The gameplay is smooth, creative, fun, interactve and a balls-to-the-wall coordination extraordinaire. Be sure to play with someone with patience, skill and who is entirely in sync with you. It'll bring you closer to them and will leave you shooting compliments at each other before you realize it.10/10. Perfect score. Absolutely brilliant!"

Game itself is a solid 15 - 20 hour experience, and perhaps more depending on how much of the side-content you do. Definitely a game built for couples but also very rewarding for just two friends. Very impressive visuals and sound design and a lot of emphasis on the small details in each environment of the game, of which there are many (snowy, musical, garden, etc). Some of the scenes could be banger wallpapers on their own. Game is a very teachable experience with great nuggets of wisdom for helping relationships and a great set of memorable characters and mini games, including races, arcade games, and even chess. Highly Recommend"

Such an emotional story and such a wide variety of game play mechanics from dungeon-crawlers to fp-shooters and the combat styles aren't so difficult that it's frustrating but technical enough to put some effort in and resolve a technique with whoever you're playing with. For Approximately 15 hours of game play. With 25 fun mini games and a wide-selection of game mechanics and detailed understanding of a story-line, there are plenty of secrets to find and cute-little set-ups that make players actively look around for the cute, little features. With a sometimes abrasive, gory touch it is an amazing game 10/10."
2000,zCody,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199104722999/,1,,1,33.2,January,18,15,0,1,"Genuinely one of the best games I've ever played.The main concept might sound boring at first but as you play you'll slowly realize what a beautiful game it actually is. The way this whole game was made and the amount of creativity that was in this, is literally mind blowing. Halfway through this game you will find out more about them and from that point on you won't even dare to stop because it's not repetitive gameplay. The amount of switches in the gameplay style is one of the things that made me still play it. I get it that it was quite boring at first but please if you have the game and didn't make it through the first part - It's so worth it. Even the length of this game is well optimized. I played this in 14,5 hours and was taking my sweet time exploring the area too - meaning you don't have to waste tons of hours just to finish a story game. If you do not like story games that are boring because they have no large variety of things you can interact with - THIS IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE. The amount of details you could explore was incredible - interacting with things you didn't imagine you could is the exciting part aside from the main tasks. Since it's a 2-Player game, makes it even more fun and engaging. Just goofing around exploring the small details is part of the experience, this will sort of automatically give you the urge to take your time and not rush the storyline. This game was an emotional rollercoaster, sometimes you screech because of how cute it is and a few seconds later you're almost crying. One thing I really like about this game, is that you know it is gonna happen but you will still be shocked after it happened, because of the teensy tinsy hope that it doesn't happen. It's the small short voicelines that made me sob. You can see the relationship of the two sort of evolving but not fast at all. The progress of the two realising everything around them that just screams couple goals. Seeing the two carefully warm up to each other after the challenges or when they're just walking around interacting with random objects is one of the best feelings, especially near end game you can 100% notice it. The producers of this game have done a great job and outdid themselves definetely. The fact that you play it with a friend with only one person spending the money for the actual game is THE greatest feature, I've ever seen. In the end I will say that this is THE best 40 bucks I've ever spent on a video game and please do buy it if you have a friend you can play it with. AND if you do play it, please don't rush trust me the exploring is a huge part of the experience.Oh yeah I still dislike that book with those fake ahh eyebrows. - Creds to him tho for fixing the relationship in the oddest way"

Every two player game is here in the form of a mini game. While the game was fun to beat, the ending was kind of wimpy for me. No big boss battle or puzzle to end it with a bang. Still a great story that i wont soon forget!"

Played with a friend and had a great few hours playing it together. A lot of fun and very interesting puzzles. Wish there was a New Game + that made the puzzles harder or made it so the split screen would go away and make you communicate more. But It was a lot of fun to play. Would highly recommend this game if you have someone to play with.

She really never wants to play PC games because of the mouse & keyboard, but I let her use the MS Xbox controller for PC I have & I used keyboard. Not gonna lie, I thought it would be cheesy & the story itself is a bit. However, the interactive gameplay & required 2 players to solve problems is awesome. Do I think it could be a bit more challenging, maybe. It is an awesomely fun time to get some game time in w/ the wife though, so no complaining here. :)"

Gameplay isn't too difficult so if you are worried about it being a hard platformer/beat-em-up you'll be okay. Story isn't ground breaking and the book character is very annoying (I think he is written that way on purpose) but other than that the gameplay was fun and enjoyable. 7/10

Little interactive items around the levels; discovering that each and everything has a personality really brings the whole concept to life. The ""abilities"" that you and your co-op partner receive feel equal and nobody is the side kick when it comes to the puzzles. Playing this game with your significant other/ best friend has to be the most fun! It's quite therapeutic sometimes to intentionally kill them. Overall Great game, just over half way through at the moment myself.Definitely recommend no matter what type of gamer you are."
2040,Sajid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sajid213/,1,,1,14.0,January,3,24,0,1,"A few months ago, I met this girl that I liked a lot. And I invited her to play this with me and hoped that she would take a hint. She agreed to play. A few days later, I actually told her I liked her and after talking about it for a few days, we started dating. We took our time progressing this game instead of rushing it. But today I finally completed it with my girlfriend. We loved playing it together and we had lots of fun and memorable moments in the game.I've been playing video games for almost 25 years now. And I have never seen a co-op experience executed so perfectly. I absolutely RECOMMEND this game to anyone who enjoys playing co-op games, if you have someone you can play with - it doesn't have to be your partner or someone you are romantically interested in. You can play this game with pretty much anyone as long as you enjoy their company.Story:The story follows Cody and May, a couple on the brink of divorce which makes their daughter upset and she asks the ""Book of Love"" to help fix their relationship. Suddenly the couple get turned into dolls and the Book of Love guides them on their path to returning to their real bodies and fixing their relationship in the process. The story is decently paced. It sometimes felt a bit slow to develop but it's not really much of a bother.Visuals:The visuals are absolutely stunning. Every single scene in this game is breathtaking and beautiful to see. You will often find yourself just pausing and appreciating the view and looking at all the minor details they put into the game.Gameplay:Fresh and creative. Every single chapter of the game brings in new mechanics and fun elements to the game. You get new abilities and so the game never feels stale or boring. The devs really went crazy on the gameplay making it fun and exciting at almost every moment of the game. There are countless elements in the game's world that have literally nothing to do with progressing the game but they are just there to make it fun. You can take a break from progressing the story play a mini-game you find lying around. And I believe that's how the game should be played - Just enjoy the experience without worrying about reaching the end.Co-Op:It Takes Two. You will need to work together with your partner for every part of this game. It's all about COLL-ABOR-ATION. You can't do anything in this game without working as a team. And that's how co-op games should be. You might even become closer with your partner because of how much trust you will need to put in each other.Overall:Loved it. The game felt fresh from the start to the end. The character development was nice especially towards the end. I think the Hazelight Studio really outdid themselves with this one. If you have a person who is special to you - lover, sibling, parent, or even your best friend - You will most likely love this game. My personal suggestion would be to play the game for the experience and enjoying all the small details instead of rushing to the end."

For most platformers that would be a neg, but this game works for a co-op experience because of that. The people in my life that I'd want to share this with aren't always gamers. The story itself never blew my mind but despite that, I always felt a connection to the writers and their characters. Soni Jorgensen and Josef Fares are said writers and I feel the depth of a lived life in the way their game scenarios describe love. I don't always agree with the minutiae presented here but I do agree with the overarching message. Love doesn't emerge by existing in the same space but instead by building something together within that proximity. In that way, I feel a co-op game is the perfect facsimile of that journey. Me like game. Give thumb up."

Quanto mais tempo eu jogava... mais incrível era a experiência... principalmente por ser um jogo 100% Multiplayer... Ele faz sua mente votar a época de ouro, sentado ao lado do seu melhor amigo, ou irmão com a tela dividida e diversão pura...É um jogo que te oferece um pacote completo... Mecânicas novas a cada área nova... Mini-games opcionais interessantes, momentos maravilhosos... e talvez até de quebrar o coração... sim... aquela fase..., Mapas detalhados e lindos... e a experiencia de jogar com alguém que você se importa.Eu tive a oportunidade de jogar ele com a melhor pessoa que eu já conheci em toda minha vida, e foi a melhor experiência que eu poderia querer...  é um jogo incrível, com uma historia boa e momentos ainda melhores.É com certeza um dos melhores jogos COOP já criados e eu recomendo bastante, se tiver a oportunidade de jogar com alguém, jogue... você não irá se arrepender...

I've played many, many games throughout my lifetime but no game has ever shown a combination of all the great qualities listed below:- Varied scenery/backgrounds- Gameplay mechanics- Small fun features that have no actual benefit to progressing through the gameplay, just features to entertain the player- Minor details- I have to re-emphasize this point: gameplay mechanics! Holy *** the game just keeps giving and giving.Currently 17hours in at the time of writing this and I am dreading the moment of completing it. We're having so much fun! Probably the best game I ever played and hands down the most fun co-op game I ever played. And yes I played Portal 2. Can recommend this game to anyone considering buying this!

Why? Because the main characters are complete psychopaths! They have no concept of mercy, or kindness their instinctual response to any sort of adversity is murder and destruction. Their bloodlust is such that they are willing to torturously murder innocent creatures begging for their own lives.Regarding characters that they didnt brutally murder, for a game about fixing a relationship the characters are incredibly cavalier about the mental health and emotional well being of any other characters in the game including  their own daughter. At the start of the game the characters were unpleasant, however you expect that to moderate or change through the story on their path to reconciliation, but they dont get better, if anything they get worse. About half way through the game there is a scene which made one of my friends quit and refuse to continue playing, and while I continued through to the end, my sympathy for the characters was completely erased.Other than that, the game was great! The environments were very detailed and beautiful, the gameplay was innovative and the incorporation of various household objects as platforming or environmental puzzles was refreshingly creative."

I played through the entire story with my boyfriend, and was stunned at the level of design and care poured into this creation.  First off, the story is much more nuanced than I was expecting, and took several unexpected and deeply emotional turns throughout the game.  It was very meaningful to play through this as a couple and see how the characters interacted, both in dialogue and behavior as their dynamic emerged throughout the story.  I was expecting a throwaway story to move me from one puzzle to the next, but as the story played out I found myself invested in the characters, cheering them on just as much as that rage-inducing book did at each new chapter.Next, the puzzles!  Incredible.  No two were the same, and each was well designed so that each character felt just as necessary as the other, but also just as useless WITHOUT the other.  Despite knowing the story, I am looking forward to playing through again from the other perspective, because each puzzle is wildly different based on the character selected.  In a way, I was almost disappointed in the ending, purely because it meant there would be no more awesome exploration and cool problem solving.And speaking of exploration, this game looks absolutely gorgeous.  My boyfriend and I spent probably just as much time wandering around looking at stuff as we did actually playing the game.  Each level is beautifully designed and a visual feast, and once again I was disappointed when I had to leave because I had so much fun in each area.  During our explorations we found countless easter eggs, funny mini-games and just neat stuff, so it never felt like wasted time.Do you have a significant other?  Buy this game and play it with them.  Do you have a friend?  Buy this game and play it with them.  Do you not have friends?  Get one so they can too experience this game with you!  This will always remain one of the best games, and certainly the best coop game I have ever played.  Enjoy your CO-LLAB-O-RA-TION!"

This genre-bending platformer lets you take on a series of episodic adventures, each with a completely different tone and gameplay mechanics. In an unusual premise for a game - you and your co-op partner play as a married couple about to divorce. Early on you meet a creepy, vaguely foreign sounding anthropomorphised talking book ""The Book of Love"" who introduces you to a wide range of odd characters and props that change how you play the game. The controls are simple and intuitive throughout the game and the puzzles/battles you encounter are clever and unique. It is funny. It is beautiful. It regularly hands out emotional gut punches. It's neither very difficult nor very long. It is absolutely one of the best games of 2021 and one of the best co-op games of all time."

There are just too many favorite moments to choose from. My partner and I kept constantly screenshotting the game because it was so fun and beautiful, and gives you tons of fun moments to express yourselves and have fun outside of the actual story. I WILL SAY that it can be quite challenging at times and require some epic gaming skills, but nothing some good old fashioned TEAMWORK can't solve! It's co-op for a reason. Dr.Hakim is the best book/therapist/coach ever. Rose is the sweetest. This game has created such beautiful memories for us, I honestly wish it never ended or that we get a second game, or can replay in our human forms.

The pay off at the end of the game was absolutely worth it.Not only is the story so well written, there is a lot of replay-ability with the numerous minigames added to it. We found ourselves coming back to the game repeatedly to explore past chapters, play the minigames and just goof around with all the small details and fun little easter eggs hidden around. And we both wanted to punch and thank that book consistently throughout the game. Honestly, we found nothing that we could ever complain about with this game. Pure masterpiece."

2228,Irisirl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Irisirl/,1,,1,13.8,September,"9,",70,0,1,"It Takes Two is a magnificent work of art, and an example of what the videogame medium can achieve when heart and soul is poured into its creation. I’ve never been a fan of platformers or split screen video games for that matter, and when my partner offered me to play I was very sceptical. However, I can safely say that after having finished the game alongside him, this experience has left such an impact I would consider this my favourite narrative game of all time.The game presents a simple narrative about a family going through a divorce and uses said narrative to draw parallels between the dynamics of a healthy relationship and the challenge of cooperative video games. Both players must be perfectly in sync and communicative to solve the many puzzles in It Takes Two. Talking of which, the challenges and puzzles in the game are all expertly crafted and designed. The sheer gameplay variety will have you in disbelief that you are still playing the same game. One moment you will be piloting a plane out of twigs shooting down turrets, another you will be in an isometric POV dungeon-crawler working in tandem to defeat bosses. Each area in the game contains its own progression and storyline, all relevant to the overall plot. With each area the players are also given a set of unique abilities they can use to interact with things specific to the environment. Something to note is these abilities are dependent on each other to be effective, further encouraging teamwork and communication between the players.The game can be quite challenging at points, and if like me you aren’t very good at platformers the game will force you to get good. However, never did I feel the game was unfair in its difficulty. If something was not working; I had the wrong approach or the wrong technique. The game also has a subtle way of teaching the players new mechanics by forcing them to experiment with the environment. There is a clear difficulty ramp throughout the game that made sense and made me feel engaged and challenged at all times. The sheer amount of ideas in this game just boggles the mind. It Takes Two is content-packed, with a solid runtime of around 15 hours. Tons of minigames and side areas to explore; ranging from simple doodle boards to fully fleshed out racing minigames. There are hours upon hours of fun to be had in this game.All of the action sequences gave me chills like no other game. Just when you think the game can’t possibly 1up itself, it will astonish you once again. The voice acting is on point, and the game knows the right balance between comedy and seriousness. It Takes Two has some wonderful writing that conveys lots of emotion. It will have you laughing, jaw-dropping in awe, coping with resentment and even spilling some tears. It's a transformative experience. An incredible journey that will see both players evolve and learn throughout. The art in It Takes Two is frankly some of the best in the industry without question. The environments are beautiful and every asset, every texture, every corner of its world so polished and well made that it’s hard to believe the game was only in development for two years. The music is also impeccable, with adaptive parts mixing together with the player’s actions leading up to climaxes of gargantuan proportion. This game wowed me repeatedly more than any before.I will close off this lengthy review by you how this game was an experience that I will remember my whole life. I had the privilege to play this with my partner, whom at the time of playing I have only been dating for a month. This game made us bond in such a beautiful way that its fictional narrative transcended to become a real learning experience. It brought us closer. Being able to share this outstanding experience with a loved one is an irreplaceable gift. It is without exaggeration that I say: It Takes Two is one of the best things to happen in my life.With that being said, I would like to personally thank the developers for pouring such heart and soul into this game. Thank you for granting the world this incredible work of art.It Takes Two is a monumental achievement in the history of digital media, and a true masterpiece.10/10"

2239,bottolo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bodolovsello/,1,,1,15.0,September,"4,",836,0,1,"There's no doubt that It Takes Two brings the cooperative play to a whole other level, proposing an extremely curated (both in animation and design) linear adventure instead of a soulless open-world game with cooperative elements, which seems to be the standard nowadays.And to think that Hazelight brought this kind of experience to life  seems like an achievement itself. There are many things to talk about, but before diving into it I'll start by saying that I liked the game and I would definitely recommend it, even though there are some things which I would like to tackle along the way. So if you're interested in playing It Takes Two, then do so by all means! You and your friend or partner will surely have a good time. If you want to hear more, then buckle up.One of the things which caught my eye right from the start was the overall  around various levels. Everything feels alive, polished, interesting. There's always something around the corner which will grab your attention and there'll be plenty of times where the actual scale of things will make you appreciate how everything was made.So, environmentally, there's a lot to be excited about. You can clearly see that who created all of this was pretty inspired, technically speaking. In fact, levels feel smooth and balanced: not too long, but not too short either.  is the key, and you'll be traveling plenty of locations across your home. I didn't expect it to be so varied and it's safe to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The constant motion between different ""biomes"" is what makes the experience refreshing.There's really not much to say about It Takes Two's difficulty: it's really easy, and everyone can jump in and play. In fact, as a more experienced player, I would've liked a mode with more challenging mechanics, but they went the ""simplest"" route and made everything the easiest way.Needless to say, you'll be able to complete it smoothly and without dying all that much, and that's perfectly fine. Challenge wasn't the main concern here, it was more like a whole package deal for a cooperative title. Commands feel really nice too, I've always felt like I were in control of my characters' every fine movement. So, in synthesis: really easy, incredibly accessible to everyone, even to someone who doesn't play games at all. I've played on mouse and keyboard, while my partner on the pad. It's comfortable either way. You might've noticed I didn't quite talk about this game's plot or characters. Well, this is where things get a bit .I've learned to be quite judgemental of EA, since it's a rich company who really doesn't seem to care about integrity anymore and tends to follow the abruptly commercial way of paywalling even oxygen. But by publishing this game, I've got to give them credit for helping to bring this game to life. A curated, accessible game which proceeds very smoothly. The only things which I really  like were, unfortunately, the dialogues. It's almost as they've got the Disney treatment or something. Specifically, every line said by Cody and May was always accompanied by a feeling of embarassment and unnaturality. Pretty cringy. And that's a shame, since the game is so well made... It's similiar to what happened in BF2042. No one would speak in such manner: Cody and May are constantly pushing out expository dialogue for the sake of talking... and it shows, since it seems written by someone working at Disney or something.Another thing I've noticed for me is its lack of originality. Yes, the environments are really well made, but they pretty much sum up your average ""toy room"" ambiance or ""space"" ambiance. Everything, creatively, feels like something taken from an average movie. I wanted to see something more original, design wise. But, ultimately, enemies and animals were kinda underwhelming in their appearance. To put this in context, there's a reason why Alice Madness (which, quite comically, was published by EA) was a big success. You didn't expect that kind of art direction from an Alice in Wonderland game. But it did, and became instantly recognizable. Sure, here you have beautifully made landscapes and really curated environments, but ultimately they lack personality. I just wanted to share my thoughts, as this aspect is a big thing for me. But I've got to give credit where credit is due: Cody and May's designs are interesting and cute, and they're really recognizable. Everything else... not so much.The game is totally worth it. I wouldn't buy it full price, though. I feel like 15/20€ is a justifiable price for this product. As a matter of fact, it still is an AAA-ish title. Maybe we would've got a prettier story, if it wasn't published by EA. Who knows.Until then... recommended. : :"

Doporučuju to hrát se svým dítětem, nebo se svou přítelkyní / manželkou. Já to hrál s prckem, 9 let, naprostá bomba. Co zažiješ? Naprosto epickou cestu, sbližování dvou partnerů, kteří se na začátku nenavídí, v prostřed nemají rádi a nakonec... Páč spolu prožijete pekelnou dřinu fakt propracovanýho koopu - se budete mít rádi. Hra trvá cca 15 hodin herního času, takže doporučuju plánovat, na každej den jednu část, budete se pak těšit na část další, a další... A můžu říct jedno. Viděl jsem koně blejt, žábu bít pěstí do země jak šílenej vrah a Babiše mluvit pravdu - ale tohle... Tohle je lepší než to všechno předtím. Naprosto geniální příběh, prostředí, ale i herní mechaniky... Takže jestli mohu něco doporučit, vůbec neřeš JESTLI tohle hrát, to je naprosto jasný. Řeš s KÝM to hrát, protože to bude společnej zážitek, epickejch rozměrů. Jo a jestli hulíš, tak si dej(te) brko před každým hraním, myslím že ten trip tě naprosto rozebere na součástky a pak znova poskládá, je to tak strašně milá hra, že milejší jsem snad ještě nehrál. Takže pokud to chceš hrát s partnerem/kou: 10 / 10S dítětem: 10 / 10Zkouřenej 11 / 10A bonus nakonec? V poslední fázi se pohybuješ mezi kazetama a kotoučákama - jestli jsi rodič, tak si to asi budeš pamatovat a je opravdu fenomenální, sledovat svý dítě, jak běhá po věcech, který netuší k čemu jsou a na kterejch tys nechal(a) mládí. :D Takže podtrženo sečteno: Trip tvýho života, kupuj, hraj, užívej - tohle je TEN z klenotů, na který budeš dosmrti vzpomínat v dobrým. ❤"

The Mission Design, variety in gameplay, the uniqueness in every location just blew my mind. Every level there was something unique around the world whoch you could interact in a peculiar with your new unique abilities granted every level. Nothing feels repeated, every second of the game showed a new world, new experience, new enemies, new bosses. Storyline was also pretty neat and sophisticated. We never sideline from our end goal despite exeriencing a unique journey. Such lovely experience and created with utmost tenderness. Kid's toys coming alive, playing with toys itself, fantasy world elements, distopian universe...If you finish the game using only 1 character, you can experience the whole journey in an entirely different experience from other character. 2 playthroughs will give you full experience the game has to offer.This game is for all : husband/wife, bf/gf, brother/brother.

Pretty much everything about this game was almost perfect. Additionally, the creators of the game stuck to the story without adding woke BS into it like almost all modern AAA games do, which makes this game even better.I would give this game a perfect 10/10, but I played the game with a PlayStation 5 controller, but the game gave me Xbox controller prompts, which is stupid. The game should either allow me to choose the prompts I want, or automatically detect the type of controller. Lastly, the game requires an Origin account, which is also stupid because it adds more complexity and takes longer before the game launches, when we just want to download and play the damn game. My overall rating is 9.5/10. If they fixed those two issues, I would've rated it 10/10.SPOILERS AHEADA lot of people dislike the game because there is a scene where you slowly and brutally kill a very kind and innocent stuffed elephant named Cutie that belongs to your daughter in order to dance under her face while she cries on you. Personally, me and my friend liked this scene because it was just so humorously ridiculous and f**ked up."

However it does feel like things drag on a bit and I was honestly ready for it to be finished when I was just over halfway through. The gameplay begins to feel gimmicky especially when you have camera control ripped away from you and you have to try to discern which of the ant-sized characters on screen is you. I love the visual style and world design and the general movement and abilities felt good. Animation is great. My biggest problem with the game is that the story is weak and shallow and I don't actually like any of the characters. They're so astonishingly unlikable and you get to listen to them bicker and whine about each other for more than half of the game. By the time they start being nicer to each other, I had already had enough of them especially because of ""that"" part. There was no real remorse or self-reflection and their change from toxic to nice felt unnaturally abrupt. I can't help but feel like parts of the game that would have fleshed this relationship out were cut while what existed was padded to make it longer.I'm on the last level and I can't wait for it to be over with. It started out fun but at this point I'm over the gimmickry and horrible characters. I don't regret playing it because it gave me some fun co-op but the sad part about it is that I don't feel like I could repeat the experience with someone else. Once the puzzles are figured out, playing the other character doesn't really freshen the experience. Ultimately I do recommend the game because it was a bit of fun, but I would only give it a C+. It passes but not admirably."

2353,Gle18,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gle18/,1,,1,13.6,July,"14,",37,0,1,"~Spoiler Free Review~SPOILER ALERT FOR THE REVIEW - GAME IS AMAZING AND WORTHY OF THE GAME OF THE YEAR AWARD IN 2021 - ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE BUY :)Ok, now to justify this verdict without spoilers.Gameplay - Someone told me about gameplay loops being 30 seconds long and then you just repeat it over and over again with the same mechanics and all. I call that theory BS coz Josef Farez, the director of this game, came up with one of the most creative concepts, if not, the most creative concept of constantly switching the gameplay within the game to keep us more and more hooked on to the game. You can't stop playing it once you've started, that's how good this game is. If I were to put this game up in a list of best video games, yes! It is on par with Witcher 3 (coz 1 its GOTY and 2 It's pretty good and worth your money).But wait! There is one thing that makes this game stand out apart from innovative gameplay.. and that is the price. Yea the game is kinda expensive, BUT, with proper planning, you can easily get the game at 60% off on steam sales (maybe the max would be going down to 75%), WAIT I'M NOT DONE YET! Only 1 Person has to buy the game! You see this! One guy buys the game, and he can host the session. The other player can join the game either online or play with the player locally. In this day and age, where there are greedy developers like Ubisoft and EA who feed off of microtransactions, this is an absolutely amazing thing. One player buys the game only and can play with pretty much anyone who has the friend's pass.Story - No spoilers, but the general gist is - Cody (Player 1) and May (Player 2) are married and they want a divorce, which upsets their (or your, if you consider being in the moment), and she basically cries on a bunch of dolls which causes y'all to like become them and play the game to save your marriage. Pretty cool concept. The ending, was kinda, not that great, but it is good. It's in no way bad, not even close to good, but I feel that the devs could have like, put in a teeny tiny bit of work in the ending and it would be better, but hey, I'm no professional, so take this with a grain of salt. Great Story!Graphics - IT IS BEAUTIFUL and kind of heavy on certain PCs. As long as you have anything past a 1050ti, you are good to go. Optimization - Ok, I hate to trash on the optimization but it's not that good. There is just lag in too many areas which me and my friend had experienced, and he had a better PC than my laptop. Optimization would be that one thing that needs to be really good in video games else, it will be the worst possible game ever. Thank god, this game is not horrible in terms of optimization. But it isn't great either. It's decent - like maybe 6 or 7 out of 10 in terms of optimization.Co op element - My friend is gonna agree on this statement 101% - C O L L A B O R A T I O N. It takes two, remember? ;) See what the devs did there? XD I bet the devs were - Hmmm, how do we make the player not wander away from the other player and play a tiny bit solo? And Josef Farez or someone else, just comes up and says, IT TAKES TWO REMEMBER? Make every single puzzle co op - There is no one finishing this game solo without a second player, and my oh my, this game was worth it! Hats off to the dev team! Oh and there are mini games (25 of them) to find in the world, to play with your friend :)Level Design - ABSOLUTELY TERRIFIC!!!Music - Amazing T_TBugs - NopFinal Verdict - 9.5/10 - AMAZING - BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY (For that one player who wants to host the game, only he has to buy, the other person plays via friend pass) ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE MONEY"

A lot of the time was spent admiring details and its creativity. One of the best aspects of this game was the fact that you HAD to work together to get ahead, making the effort a shared experience. In terms of game play and enjoyment, it is a 10/10. Fun, interactive, challenging without the overly frustrating feeling of failure, I'd recommend it to anyone. The best part is that you can play this game with someone who doesn't own the game, making it inexpensive if you're buying it at the right time (bought it for $23).If you want to nitpick at details, I'd say that the main characters are annoying and there is no major character development. I would have liked for there to be a two-ending option and maybe a deeper dive into why the divorce is happening other than May being away from home for work and Cody being a SAHD who likes to do fun stuff but is more than happy to let appointments and actual parenting needs slide. Genuinely think the ending needed a negative outcome or at the very least a different perspective on the fact that sometimes divorce is not the worst option on the planet which is what the storyline was preaching. Two approaches to the story would have made it 10x better. The book is also annoying, but again, this is nit-picking, it doesn't really change the fact that the game itself is amazing.The elephant scene was traumatizing. I loved it."

Your child is going through constant internal turmoil and struggle while her parents lay comatose and ignore her. The good news is while she suffers you get to have fun doing things like; have snowball fights, ride various animals, play rhythm games, and more that you could spend forever doing. Forget your kid AND marriage at this point just play in paint forever. Very good game that has a variety of things to do and different approaches which saves you from monotony. The characters are fun and even the side characters have personalities. Plus, who doesn't enjoy saying ""what are you doing?"" to someone you're playing with while you watch them fall into a pit for the 74th time? Overall highly recommend especially with a loved one, it's a good bonding experience."

Every stress inducing level or puzzle is met with an intermezzo mini-game wherein the two players can blow off steam by beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of one another. Level design and control schemes change so frequently, and the pacing of the levels is just right.

Different mechanics at different parts of the game and non overstay their welcome and become boring so far. The story is a little cheesy but the game play more than makes up for it. Hope more games are made like this in the future. I think its worth full price but I was lucky to catch it on sale.

EA servers SUCK. We got disconnected multiple times throughout the game, making us have to go through different parts a couple times (luckily the game autosaves rather frequently!).We even experienced an issue where the game server would crash right after hitting an objective, thankfully this fixed itself after a few days.

I played with my girlfriend and we completed the game over a week. The game aspires to touch both a great story and gameplay. It really doesnt leave a spot of game mechanics out. One mission you'll be fighting a giant squirrel in streetfighter combat, and then racing down rainbow road. It greets you with an actual real world problem and turned it into a comedic and lesson-filled game that for me had a 16$ price tag (not to mention you can invite and play with your friend for free). I think more AAA game titles should aspire to be how great this game was. The game not only offers all this but the replay ability in the form of gamemodes and online play. I would recommend this to anyone with a friend, i would recommend 5/5."

2468,Asian Smurf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GAOOOOOOO/,1,,1,18.1,May,"18,",269,0,1,Sometimes EA can develop absolute gems like this. It Takes Two is Hazelight's take on the long-gone multiplayer story-based game that utilizes co-op. A pretty good couch play on-the-go during weekends. There are a lot of variety in It Takes Two as the story branches through a lot of chapters and It covers the strained relation between 2 couples and them reconciling due to the daughter's request. It's a really heartwarming and simple story but there's so much more behind it. This game really relies a lot on co-operation as almost everything takes two people like the title said. The game is beautiful and not very graphic intensive so people can play on a potato. It is really well optimized surprisingly. I read up somewhere that EA only gave it a 5 million dollar budget which is quite low with such a beautiful quality game produced as a result which shows that great games don't take a lot of budget. It's really worth a mention that the game not only has the main aspects but also loads of minigames around the map to explore and find. There are also a lot of interactive elements that can suck up your weekends like a vacuum cleaner. Overall It's probably one of if not the best multiplayer games in recent years. A solid 9.8/10. It's also notable that the developers give out a ' Friends Pass' For friends so only 1 person has to own the game to enjoy the full game. It's absolutely one of if not EA's best games as it's not tainted by micro-transactions. A really great game for what it really is. It's always on sale too which is a steal if you get it for like 60% off.

Pretty much anyone can pick this up and play it, and only one person needs to own the game, with the other person being able to download a version for free just to play with you. And hell, if their pc cant run it you can use steam remote play to run it off your pc. They also managed to throw in a story about appreciating family in there somehow, and then actually made it good. Play this game."

In terms of the actual game, I want to echo what others have said saying this is the best co-op game they have ever played. It really is for us. My partner and I have tried some other games similar to this like A Way Out and this just blows everything out of the water. The art was great, gameplay was engaging and at the right difficulty level, and in terms of what it made us feel... it made us feel a lot, and with great intensity. We laughed, got angry at certain parts, really sad in others, but overall the game is the good kind of emotional roller coaster and it had been especially amplified by the feelings we had for the person we were playing with. Anyone who wants to feel feels with someone and have fun doing it should absolutely buy this game, even if it's not on sale. Looking forward to any sequels!"

This already makes it a very wonderful game because that means that only one person needs to actually purchase the game, which is a huge bonus for a game that's uniquely a 2 player experience. The game isn't too very long, running in at about 13 hours of game play with some side distractions like mini-games and snowball fights, but it is a very emotional experience that will last a long time for those invested. For actual game play, each section features a completely different type of game. In one section, you're flying through the air on a bi-plane shooting down bees, and the next you're sneaking through a garden trying to avoid moles that are 3x your size. I absolutely have to recommend this game, even at the full price of $40, just due to the fact that you'll be receiving a product that was made with love and so much attention to detail that it's actually worth the price they put it up for. Overall a very wonderful experience that is going to stick with me and my friend for years."

This is, by far, the best gaming experience I've had in a very long time. Each level in the game has it's own unique theme and gameplay style. The environments are gorgeous and very polished. The sound is immersive and of course the story is interesting, yet easy to follow. I ran into one bug during the entire campaign (bugged out volley ball minigame near the end) that had no bearing on my ability to move progress. There are quite a few competitive minigames games throughout that offer a nice change of pace from the co-op grind. In terms of difficulty I'd say it's a great game for younger kids; the puzzles are pretty straight forward and a many interactions involve various forms of button mashing, however it is a platformer so you'll derive a lot of the challenge from that aspect alone.I don't think I've ever left a steam review before, but this game really impressed me and it's definitely a worthwhile purchase if you're on the fence. 10/10"

A nice feature is the friend pass because the game can be a bit pricey if your buying for two people so personally it was nice knowing the creators thought about the community and all. Something though that really drew me to this game was that the story starting off kinda lures you in to wanna know how this will end. you may think yeah this is just gonna be a make up scene at the end but that's not all that's so interesting the cut scenes throughout give a crazy adventure that you couldn't even imagine its unrealistic and absolutely wild.

It's absurd how many different mechanics this game has.At one point, you're throwing nails at walls, at another you're walking on walls and in the next you're shooting syrup everywhere.Every chapter has it's own mechanics and the 2 characters rarely share the same one. And let me tell you, there are A LOT of chapters. You're constantly introduced to whole new mechanics and have to use them to solve the puzzlies. Those puzzles can't just be beaten by 1 of your powers. It takes the 2 of you to beat them.The game is pretty, there are a lot of well designed puzzles and mechanics. The dialogue is entertaining and the game just feels very polished overall.It took me a little while to try out this game, because, quite frankly, I don't trust EA, but the game didn't seem to have suffered from their influence."

BUT this was easily one of my favourite games and unique experiences I've had with a game. As someone who's not so well-versed in gaming and who stresses easily, this game was a nice balance between stress and fun. The characters, stories, levels, game mechanics and art were so breathtaking. You could see all the little love and details put into the game and there was a lot of emotions throughout the story.

The levels are very imaginative and each one reveals a fun new team based game-play mechanic.

I loved the aspects of being able to watch your partner's screen in case they weren't sure where they were.  I also think the book, Dr. Hakim, has some great tips for helping make a relationship better, and we're trying to apply them to our marriage. 5*'s!I hope if/when they make others games, they add in different endings you can get based on how much time you took for the environment of the levels. For instance, what if the two characters decided to get a divorce in the end, but it was because both players tried to speed run the game? I totally understand the effort and amount of dedication and time that would take. Just some feedback!"

2649,minimally,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199143807311/,1,,1,58.3,March,"7,",23,0,1,"I gave this game a 10/10 based on my 57.4 hours of gameplay. Even if I bought it at full price, I still think it is worth it. I do not regret the money I spent at all. This game has been selected for Game of the Year. Although you may already know that this is a fantastic game, I'd like to share some of my thoughts and experiences from the two times I've played. Intro: When personal conflicts impact their lives to the point of divorce, they are magically transformed into puppets. They are grudgingly tasked with saving their damaged relationship since they are trapped in a fantasy world where the unpredictable lurks around every turn. The Story: This game's story is simple to follow, makes sense, and is heart-warming. For myself, I've played twice and don't count the time I watched it on a steamer. This game's story continues to fascinate me. Even though I know how the story will end, I am still able to enjoy the game's journey. Because there will be a message or word in every cut scene in the game that makes me think and realize that it is true and can sometimes be applied to my real life. Gameplay: The main goal of this game is for you and your partner to work together. Although you may need to separate and complete the task on your own at times, you must collaborate with your partner in the end. And the game's tasks aren't difficult at all. You will instinctively know what you need to do for each task in the game, or you can simply explore the map, every corner you can hide in, every shelf you can jump on, and try to play everything they have included, and you will know what you need to do. However, passing the task sometimes necessitates the ability to jump (kind of like parkour), move quickly, and press buttons quickly. I play through some checkpoints 10+ times to pass them. However, if you play it for a while, you will learn the proper timing and your jumping ability will improve for the rest of the game. Graphic: Beautiful scenery can be found throughout this game! This fact may go unnoticed at the start of the game. However, the scene becomes more beautiful as you play more. This game was played on my laptop, which isn't suitable for gaming. I'll have to turn down the graphics, the shadows, and everything else in the game. But it did not ruin my mood at all, I swear. However, if you're playing with someone who has a better computer, I recommend that the person who has a better computer be the host. There's a scene that makes us disconnect from the game. It was fixed when my friend (who had a better computer) came to host instead. Extra note: -I recommend you to explore every corner in the map because you may find the achievements with surprise -You can play with your friend through the Friend Pass feature even if you don't own the game. I hope you have a great time playing this game! Best wishes. <3"

It's like an interactive movie, but on a whole different level than any game ever before. This is a new generation of gameplay, cannot describe it differently. It's sooooo much fun, do not miss out on this. Play it, there is NO way you will regret it. The gameplay changes constantly. You dive, fly, jump, run, ride, slide... there's a ton of epic mini games in the game, a ton of jokes things to see, discover, marvel. Wow. Just Wow.

The game always introduces new ideas without ruining the core experience, namely the co-op part. You are encouraged to communicate and work together and it's done beatifully and naturally woven into the gameplay and the themes. The levels are getting pretty lazy though when reaching the end, because it suddenly feels like a list of chores to complete, rather than a natural journey. Won't lie though, it's still pretty funSadly the story is not on par with the gameplay. The story often feels disconnected with the game itself, and sometimes reality. While imaginative, i don't think the Cody and May relationship was explored well and because of that, sometimes it feels unnatural how they develop/fixing their relationship.Overall, play it with someone, and dont take the story too seriously because...yeah, it's not told well. My girlfriend actually the one who told me how bad the story is and i agree. Shout out to my super detailed and observant girlfriend. Ton of fun playing this with her <3And this is mine:Overall it's an enjoyable game. But I guess I kinda have a curse when it comes to jump-dash section of the game. I will never forget the unlimited tries that I had done with da frogs. Man... it literally gave me PTSD. The bug was really bugging us (you don't say) but thank god it's still playable, only sometimes, I and my boyfriend needed to redo all the game section because we have to restart the game so we can get rid of the bug and it's annoying and ofc wasting our time tgt. I gave thus game 6/10 it should've 7 but i cut one point bcz of the gruesome cutie scene. It made me and my boyfriend had some arguments back then but thank god my boyfriend's so wise that we'd resolved it! Thank you and ♥️♥️♥️♥️ you Josef Fares for making this game."
2669,johan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/northernblade/,1,,1,20.4,March,"4,",494,0,1,"The gameplay is incredibly improved from Away Out in every aspect: brimming with inventive and the most diverse gameplay IMO. In each chapter, you will definitely never see repetitive or dreary gameplay. they'll give you a new gameplay mechanic for each chapter, which has become so rare these days. It was really exciting in the first place, but anyway, there're still a few chapters that are not well creative and kind of bore me out.  (To me, the snow and the wasp map, etc.) it's still not perfect in terms of balancing the fun between each map to me: it was very fun in the first 1-2 maps and it dropped so hard and became fun again and dropped, this topic is kinda subjective tho. But with today's standard this game really stands out in its own way and it's top-notch, I must admit it.All in all, there's a thing that let me down the most: and that again, the story: drags so much, I don't see that there is any change in the relationship between the two characters at the end of the game, I just can't feel the development of characters to that extent. feels like the story itself, writing or something can't properly represent what is the true relationship or being good parents to me. Not including the performance and the connection server makes me go crazy.-7/10-"

In fact, she doesn't enjoy video games that much.I was quite surprised when she started asking me to play this game with her. If you are wondering if this game is for non-gamer players (or girlfriends) the answer is YES!As for the game itself, it is a gem. These kinds of games are what the gaming world is missing right now. The story, level design, bunch of mini-games (including an actual game of chess) are top-notch. There are tons of puzzles made in a way a single play can't carry the game, it takes two (yap) to get through the level. Design is simple, intuitive, and beautiful at the same time. Each time we would get into a new section of the game we would say ""okay, this is the best section so far"" and this would repeat up the very last section. Each time you think ""okay they (devs) played their best hand, doesn't get better than this"" you are wrong.The amount of creativity, passion, attention to detail, and love that went into this game is astonishing. What impressed me the most is the creativity. Someone behind this game has crazy and rich imagination that I envy right now.From a technical perspective, the game runs great. There were minor drops in certain areas that I overlooked (plus my laptop is a 5 y/o smart toaster so I don't judge) and I still had a smooth ride. By the amount of care, details, and love it feels like an indie game but with a big budget and big ambition. Yet, it's from EA. I just hope this is not a one-time thing and that EA gives us more of this type of game. With the focus on imagination, creativity, simple, smart, intuitive but beautiful level and game design that is welcoming to new players and enjoyable for the veterans.

There is so much variety in game mechanics, set pieces, and overall ways for two players two interact with each other and the world. In addition to the normal playthrough, there are many minigames you unlock and can revisit at any time, driving some friendly competition with your partner/friend.Story is serviceable, and even though it wasn't the highlight for us, it was pushing us forward.Overall a great package, a must for local coop fans!"

Also good for people who aren't platformer enthusiasts.           Story is quite infuriating if you care about believable relationships...Long Review:The mechanics are really solid and make for great co-op fun. It's not a super difficult platformer so noobs like me and my gf can play it just fine with the bosses especially still being quite exciting. The minigames were a blast. I think there were maybe 1 or 2 games we didn't play multiple rounds of. Overall for the co-op gameplay this gets a strong recommendation from me. The story however...*BIG SPOILERS*Seriously. I'll spoil the entire story. You have been warned.May and Cody should get a divorce or talk about the *actual* issue at hand. May is overworked and doesn't have time to spend with the family. Really the issue isn't that Cody doesn't fix the garden or that May isn't singing anymore. The real issue is the time management of May between family and work. This is never really addressed. You have a time themed level but at the end there's no resolution just this weird last second rambling about PASSION and invention of Gardening and Singing problems.So after solving the frankly made up problems, Dr. Hakim and Cody came up with, their relationship is apparently fixed. Cody is very needy REQUIRING his overly stressed wife to cheer him on so that he can engage in *his* hobby otherwise f--- it let the garden rot I guess. It's entirely possible May doesn't really have a choice in working long hours all the time. Cody is presented as the poor neglected partner but is really inconsiderate of what May wants or how she feels. May doesn't want to sing but Cody and Dr. Hakim badger her into doing it anyway. It's always about how Cody (and Rose supposedly) feel abandoned even though Rose only ever complained about them fighting.  The real issue of time management/Cody not caring how May feels are never even remotely addressed. The only real reason why they would stay together is because they have a child together. Is raising Rose in all the inevitable conflict really good for her development either?In the end, May is if not explicitly at least implicitly, always portrayed as being at fault ""You never have time/You don't support me"" but Cody having no understanding of how May feels or not seeing the importance of May being the sole breadwinner of the family is seemingly not only lost on Cody but the game itself. Also the fact Dr. Hakim wasn't burned at the end (or eaten by a wild animal) is a tragedy. F--- that book. ""Therapist"" my a--"

How could this be very good, it's the same devs, same sort of idea...I picked it up, and my girlfriend used the 'play with friends' pass. Neither of us knew what to expect going in, and the first level was kinda... so-so. We finished our first play session both a little lukewarm on the game.By chapter three we were in love. By chapter five we didn't want to stop. By the end of the game both of us were just speechless watching the credits go by, and later we were messaging each other over how incredible it was. So what's the secret?I think my girlfriend said it best: It reminded both of us of the magic of games of our childhood. New mechanics come and go, beautiful sprawling worlds that are completely seperate from reality, and have their own rules. It was all different but all part of the same whole.The writing is lovely. The moment to moment dialog is fantastic, while the over-arching story is... so-so, it drives the plot. The cartoony artstyle fits this sort of game *way* better than the more realistic style of 'A way out'. It means that the silly moments work and the more serious ones still have the right gravitas needed.If you have a partner who enjoys games, don't do any further reading on this, just go ahead and pick it up and delve in. The whole thing took us about 10 hours or so, and we did a lot of the side content and stuff."

The collaboration did not feel forced, and the puzzles/bosses were just challenging enough to make you think. Plus gotta give cuddos to that book....had us laughing/crying with his humour.My only complaint is that it took a lot of fussing around with origin/steam linking-I had to create a new origin account specifically to get the game to launch.

Origin is simply terrible and way worse than Steam and being force to use it just make this more obvious. but in the end, I think It Takes Two is worth the trouble of using Origin, it's that good."

There were many moments where I just wanted to sit down and listen to the music while looking at the beautiful world around me. The story is also very well written. I paid attention to every cutscene because I was so invested into the story and character development between both characters.

The environments and scenes were our favorite part of the game, especially the snow section, as it reminded us both of the city of Leavenworth, WA. That section of the game also had the best moments in the soundtrack. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a cute story co-op game, that is simple but fun.

This game literally requires two players, and although this could be played this with a friend, I'd say its really in its element when played with a significant other. Its fun, lighthearted, and even inspirational at times. The game will be challenging, at first, if you or your partner are unfamiliar with playing platformer style games, but don't let that intimidate you. Despite the moments of challenge, the game is very forgiving and saves often, so you are never set too far back from mistakes. And if platformers, ""aren't your thing,"" I'd say don't let that be a deal breaker. This game nearly explores every game genre throughout the story. From racing to puzzle solving to overhead fantasy RPG, so there is something for everyone to enjoy. it really hits all the genres except for maybe horror and FPS. The only thing I have against this game is that the ending came a little unexpected, and unfortunately too fast. However, all story centered games have to come to an end, so its hard to fault it for that. I simply cannot recommend this game enough; its an adventure for everyone involved."

2827,DracheKonig,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Drachekonig/,1,,1,13.8,January,"30,",155,0,1,"TLDR: The game is really good. You should get it and have fun with a good friend. I played through this game with my wife and here is what we had to say. First off, I LOVE that we only needed one copy and could both play together. The friend pass works very well. This game has it all. I was amazed at how many different modes of play it had, and how smoothly it shifted from one to the next. 3rd person platforming is the bread and butter of it, but it has: ""cart"" racing types, snowboarding, driving a ship, mortal combat style fighter, plane flying, top down movement, puzzles, tower climbing, and more. It was fantastic. All this is set in a charming story with adult conflict. It is themed for adults for sure with a few swear words thrown in. The language is not terrible, and is natural like two adults who are at odds would talk to each other. Suitable for most kids without issues, but just be aware that there ARE some swear words if you are particularly sensitive to them. The scenery is amazing, and often times beautiful. Each environment has something new to look at and is well made. The music score matches each environment well, and the sound effects match without any problems. The combat in the game is not overly challenging, but can be difficult at times with more than one death along the way. But regardless of whether a monster killed you, or your own misstep off an edge, there is never a feeling of stress. It is not meant to be a hardcore game, and the penalties for failure are relatively minimal. Which brings me to another point. The overall game-play design is amazingly well crafted. There is barely any tutorial at all no matter what new mechanic or tool you are introduced to. The closest you get is a button prompt once just to let you know what to call the new thing you are wielding. Despite this, we were never stuck on any area for more than a minute or so before figuring out what we needed to do. No matter what the puzzle was, there was no hand-holding, no guide, and barely any prompts. But it was intuitively designed and was not at all frustrating. Or at least, we never got frustrated at the GAME, but occasionally at ourselves for the failure. The hardest part about the game honestly is the co-operation. Getting in sync with the other person is a challenge at times and led to more than a few accidental deaths. Most resulted in laughter as we learned better what to do for the next attempt. This was by far the single best co-op game I have ever seen, let alone played. Not because of the challenge, of the false need for two people. But because of how it is made to encourage you to work with your partner. All that above is positive. But what about the cons?The forces split screen is hard to get used to. And it would be great to disable it when playing online. Even if just for the over-world travel when you don't need to see what the other is doing. The controls were pretty good, but could use some adjustment with how easy it is to overshoot your jumps sometimes, and how some jumps force a ledge grab when it should not be needed for the area (EX: climbing stairs. Most don't need a ledge grab, but some do.) Couple that with some of the swing-shot points not latching quite right, and it led to some frustration. Even if it was minor. The story falls a bit into both categories. The overall theme is great, and it is paced well. But the conversations and banter between the two main characters, Cody and May, often feel forced or scripted and unnatural. And the little girl, Rose, speaks like an adult who does not know how to voice or write for a child. Rose spoke in a slow, deliberate, and basic manner and honestly came across as very hard to believe for one her age. She was written like someone who does not had kids sat down and wrote out her script with the singular thought that ""Kids are dumber than adults. So I just have to write like I'm stupid.""All in all, the cons were reasonably minor with how much fun we had playing through it. I would not hesitate to suggest this to anyone who is considering it. 9.5/10I truly do recommend this one."

First and foremost: If you're reading this, and you have a PS5/Xbox Series X (Or PS4/XBone), it is better to play on those simply for optimization. This game will ultimately run just fine on your top notch machine, but due to some poor coding, there will (possibly) be mild moments of stutter and frame dipping. Good news is it passes quickly, and runs 60FPS otherwise (assuming you have good hardware).+ Tons and tons and tons of gameplay adaptions per world, per area, per segment, per this entire game. You keep thinking they can't add more AND make it look good, but they do+ Visuals are stunning and incredible to look at from start to finish+ Teamwork REQUIRED and different between both characters+ Definitely recommended to play if you're in a struggling relationship. It won't fix it, but it may highlight things that could be tackled to help remedy a problem in a relationship. Who knows+ Voice acting A++ Motion Capture A+++ Music and sound A++++ Consumer service A++++. Having to only buy 1 copy for 2 people is very generous in this age of greedy game publishers and developers. I DO NOT give any of that credit to EA. ♥♥♥♥ EA. All that credit goes straight to Hazelight Studios+ And in my own personal observation, when it comes to the environments, I just love all the little details that area in the ENTIRE GAME. Every area that you may only see and explore for a couple seconds max probably had hours upon hours of work thrown at it. The love behind this gem is astoundingly good- Optimization stuttering from time to time. Internet claims shaders are the reason. dx12 mode helps immensely, but doesn't fix everything.- No collectibles other than the base achievements. Every area feels like there should be collectibles, but it's more or less get from point A to point B.Very excited for their next entry, and I hope it retains the same split screen online format."

Most stories don't hold my attention very well. This was a big exception, and I'm happy to say I played the entire game to the end. I'm writing this review right after finishing the game. I don't write reviews often, but I do for a reason.It Takes Two is a game that can be very odd with it's tone, especially early on. However the entire experience is fun and exciting. The story's premise isn't very complicated, but I think it does a wonderful job of fleshing itself out as you go. The creativity showcased on both the environments and the gameplay is remarkable.It Takes Two, literally. Almost everything in the game requires the cooperation between the two players. In a lot of the game, each player has a unique tool or ability that they need to use together to progress. No two of them feel the same and they all play off of one another super well. The team dynamic along with the super smooth movement and platforming make for a very fun experience. The game isn't super difficult, but that doesn't mean you won't mess up a few times. Thankfully the game isn't very punishing and lets you keep trying until you figure out what to do.The world that you explore across the journey is fantastical in every sense of the word. It takes the concept of playing as a pair of toys and runs wild with it. There are so many fun little interactables and mini games that you can play as you go through. A lot of them trigger extra dialogue and information about the story. If you play, don't be afraid to explore. It's worth it. The maps are much larger then you would think at first, but that isn't a real issue. Most of the game is fairly linear, leading from one puzzle to the next. Later on, there are a few areas that let you tackle puzzles in whatever order you like, and these areas are full of even more personality and little interactables then anywhere else.I don't want to say any more, because I would need to go into more detail then I want to. Not because I can't, but because I want you to experience it for yourself. I went into this game completely blind with a friend and it was worth it. If you want to play this game, please try to avoid spoiling yourself before you do. There isn't anything super dramatic, but the magic and wonder of everything wouldn't have felt as good if I knew what was coming beforehand.If you want to play this game, find a friend or loved one and play it together with them. You don't need to buy the game twice to play, only one person needs to own it. (My friend didn't know it at the time when they bought the game for both of us.)In short, if you want a fun, not too difficult co-op experience with someone, I don't know many games that will give you a better experience."
2949,Sgt.LMAO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SgtLMAO/,1,,1,25.6,January,"12,",443,0,1,"Wow! That's all I can really say about this. I absolutely love it. I love the scenery, the story, the characters, the gameplay, absolutely everything.Sure, the graphics might not be up to RDR2 standards, but given the more linear nature of the game you can really tell that the devs put that extra care and attention into making each and every environment pop with vibrant colors and a thick atmosphere. The outside areas are sunny, bright and inviting. The inside areas are incredibly dynamic, but each and every one is as beautiful as the last.The story is spot on where no line feels unnessecary. The characters frequently make snarky remarks towards one another, and aren't afraid to assess the absurdity of the situation they're currently in. It has that kind of Sunset Overdrive-esque tongue-in-cheeck approach to it all, and I love games that don't take themselves too seriously. The NPCs are wonderfully cute and endearing, similar to how they were in Banjo Kazooie back in the day, which just warms my heart. The story's bottom line/end goal is pretty clear from the start, giving you a wonderful sense of just how every step and every action in the game is orchestrated to help the protagonists reach it. The gameplay... I don't know how they did it, but they made even the menial task of getting from place to place an absolute blast. Grinding on rails, flying through the air, GLIDING through the air! It's so incredibly polished and refined, all paired with wonderful scenery to take in during your traversal. The minigames and easter eggs that are scattered around are great fun and a tremendous asset to the game as a whole! The toung-in-cheek approach is prevalent even in this aspect, with the game featuring a plethora of funny mechanics and concepts (such as Mortal Kombat style fights and fun ways to utilize the cooperative aspect of the game) that are introduced rather frequently.If I had to list one complaint about this game, it would be that I think it could have aimed for a lower age rating. It's currently PEGI 12 (ESRB Teen). Sure, a lot of the violence has a purpose and carries the story forward (and is definitely quite fun most of the time), but being strapped to a chair and repeatedly killed by wasps in a cutscene, or being able to partake in an optional 'minigame' where you can torture the other character really doesn't fit the style of this game, according to me. It feels like it includes some of the more violent aspects simply as a way to pander to the mature audience and give the illusion of not being a kid's game, whilst still being an excellent, fun and heartwarming family friendly game at heart.In any case, it's so refreshing to see a game made by people who seem to have a genuine drive and motivation to make games that deliver the best experiences for the player, and to have that reflected so well in the final product. Hats off to Hazelight studios for yet another fantastic co-op experience. You make me proud to be Swedish."

It was also nice that both characters felt equally important/relevant in completing each particular puzzle/section. I enjoyed the A Way Out Easter egg which was unexpected and cool to see. The only thing I disliked is that I found May's character to be kind of annoying/irritating, which I don't think was intentional.A few neutral things to note:Overall, I can see why this game won GotY - it's not the most incredible game ever, but it's certainly worth a playthrough and I highly enjoyed my own."

As for the pricing, the game is on sale quite often but even at full price every cent is worth it (especially since the game has the ""Friend's Pass"" which only requires one person to actually purchase the game).

Story wise it's ok, there's one very... surprising and rather terrifying moment which sees no story pay-off or consequence (and really should have) but I think you will only be disappointed if you *only* buy this for the writing. The characters are fun, the world is gorgeous, the gameplay fresh, it's pretty lengthy (longer than A Way Out) and I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a game to play with a friend, or significant other - it's perfect for that, and can be an introduction to gaming (but be aware that some of the bosses will frustrate complete beginners).Excellent stuff!

The difficulty is just perfect balance between not being too struggled and being too easy to get bored. One flaw is that once the puzzle showed up, you kinda figure out the pattern for each puzzle piece, it gets repetitive and being predictable that you have to fight for each boss.

It's definitely my game of the year for 2021 (nothing really came out this year, looking back at it). It is extremely beginner friendly - would highly recommend playing with your partner through this heartwarming tale of rekindling lost love. This has some of the best and most innovative level design I have ever seen in a video game. The soundtrack and story are both on point - it's like playing through a disney movie. Plus, when it's on sale you only have to buy one copy of it to play with a buddy of yours. I played through the game in 9.7 hours with a friend of mine in one sitting, but this could easily be broken up into several sessions because of the way the game is structured. The only downside is that it's really not that replayable. Once you figure out all the puzzles it just doesn't make sense to go back and re-do them. Another drawback is having to deal with Origin and connecting to EA servers to play. With that, this is one of the best games I've ever played and will hold a special place in my heart going forward."

I don't know how they managed to do this, but the game is nearly perfect. Although I have one problem with it, so let's get get that quickly out of the way.The game runs mostly smoothly, but man the frame rate tanks in some locations. I remember seeing dips bellow 20 fps on an RTX 3080 and R7 5800X. Don't get me wrong, the game looks astounding both on a graphical and creative level, but drops like these (and they weren't infrequent) for longer periods of time just suck.Now that the only objectively bad thing is out of the way, let's get to the important part. The gameplay is just simply fun. It's approachable, easy to master and perfectly fits the level design and progression. The levels are propably the best levels in a platformer I've ever played. Nothing here seems out of place and everything works as it should. The characters are well written, well acted and most of the time funny - of course that depends on your sense of humour tho. The thing I find the best about the dialogue, is that it makes it understandable for kids, but adults won't be bored, because just like in many fairytale movies (for example my favourite - Shrek) the dialogue gets a new meaning from the perspective of an adult. The bossfights (and there is quite a few of them) are serviceable. They aren't perfect, but the best thing about them is that they need to be defeated by both of the players working together. Of course the same applies to the levels, but during boss fights, there is not as much time for decision making and both players need to cooperate and communicate well to defeat them. And again the biggest achievement regarding the bosfights was, that even tho they were deffinitely not easy, they still were beatable for all age groups. The thing that left me speechless when I finished my playthrough was, how creative and interesting the individual environments were. The designers and writers must have been on some good sh*t to make all of this happen. Every single level is different, every puzzle is somehow not repetetive and all of the environments are so inspired that I just wanted to stop for a few seconds to admire them. There are so few games that make me stop and take in the beauty of what the developers have crafted and this one made me do that nearly every chapter at least once.There isn't enough praise I could give this game in a review. It is a must have, not only for couples that need a bit of couples therapy (where it has the potential to actually help sometimes), but also for basicly, well... everyone. I don't see a single person that wouldn't like at least a part of this game. If you like shooters, there is some shooting, if you like puzzles, threre is some puzzle solving, if you like story, the story is amazing, so on and so forth. And also did I mention, that you only need one copy and one system to play it in co-op? It might seem like I'm exagurating a bit in this review, but the only way to find out is propably to just go, play it and see for yourself."

3109,Link,https://steamcommunity.com/id/haolink/,1,,1,11.7,December,"29,",385,0,1,"It Takes Two takes you on a journey where you need to fix the relationship between Cody and May - a husband and a wife who lost the passion and love in their relationships. Their daughter wishes for them to learn to love each other again - and all of a sudden her wish comes true - kind of: her parents get transformed into tiny dolls and they must solve challenges in the tiny realm - by working together.And that's the core premise: 9 chapters - you must play Co-Op with a friend. The two player must work together. Each of you will always be given a special ability whether you choose May or Cody and neither of their abilities will be able to complete a chapter alone - but together, they can do it.Singleplayer is thus obviously a no-go - you can play together in front of the same monitor/TV or you can play remotely online. If you go the online route: fear not, only one player needs to buy the game, the other friend can join via Friend's Pass.I have played this game a short time after it was released with a friend - back then I was participating via Friend Pass - my friend has already played it once as May and felt they would get a different explerience if they played Cody - so back then I played as May. And now as I write this (December 2021) I bought the game because I really enjoyed my time back then - and now I invited another friend - where I did the same - now I played Cody, and my friend played May.So I can confirm: yes, playing as Cody gave me a different experience. I knew the story - but I had another role in it. So well, some people down there argued it's a one time experience. I would disagree - it's a two times experience. However, I would recommend to keep a little time between both playthroughs.But yeah: visually this game is a masterpiece. Every area in each chapter is lovingly designed - so many little details - so many environments. There is a lot of love and heart in the environments. Everything just looks like a dream - or nightmare. Even if some areas like the 6th chapter (cuckoo clock) can be really frustrating here and there - it's just a beauty to look at - never will I look the same way at a wall clock anymore - I toally want to buy such a clock now. Just to think of the game. Same for other chapters - they are just inspiring.The music: it's not overly special - but always fits. It never feels off. It's just a narration for what you play. So at that moment again: they just got that right.Ultimately the story: the main premise is obviously predictable. Right from the start you know - Cody and May would find each other again. But what's well executed - you learn about Cody and May. You learn about their first vacation, their hobbies, how they proposed - this gives them a great character depth. They also talk a lot about how they see each other as parents and how they rose their daughter (Rose).Ultimately: a little master piece - and in my opinion a well deserved Game of the Year 2021. I can recommend it to everyone who loved to play something together with a friend - and work together with them. COLLABORATION!"

Their fractured relationship is about to break and is on the edge of divorce. Rose, their daughter, does not want them to split up. She expresses her concern to her hand-made dolls, Cody and May. This somehow transforms both of her parents into dolls. Cody and May must now find a way to break the spell and travel into an unknown world, accompanied by Dr. Hakim, a talking book. .🔸Gameplay Endless fun with tons of gameplay mechanics.The gameplay takes place in a split-screen, third-person perspective, allowing you to see the actions of both your controlled character and the spouse at the same time. As the game progresses, the variety of different gameplay will never cease to amaze you. The developer has taken the old couch co-op game to new heights and may have already set the new standard for next-generation cooperative gameplay. .🔸Conclusion Kill hundreds of birds with one stone.""It Takes Two"" excels in Story, Presentation Elements, and Uniqueness & Creativity. The lighthearted storyline of this game will warm your heart. Each stage's distinct co-op gameplay and a huge array of minigames will bring you closer to your loved ones. It's not an exaggeration to say that It Takes Two has already become the new benchmark for the couch co-op genre.Highly recommend !"

There's no need to read the reviews, it's an absolutely fantastic game!If you're wondering if you can play this alone, the answer is no. You need a friend, but fortunately you only need one copy of the game, and the friend pass, which is 100% free. You can do this over the internet or locally on the couch, it's your choice!For the longest of time, Resident Evil 5 was my favourite co-op experience. Something to have dumb fun and to try new ways to play the game with my friend. But now, this game may have taken that title and ran with it. Incredibly fun, gorgeous visual, genuinely funny jokes and writing, and gameplay that constantly keeps changing and is a joy to play every time, for a very lengthy 14 hours of game time. The story is simple, yet takes you on a huge adventure to solve these couple's quarrel. The world truly feels massive (Mostly because you're very small), with everyday appliances becoming obstacles, tools, and even bosses to overcome. The game cleverly uses areas from around the house to transport us to completely new environments without feeling shoehorned in for the sake of a winter world or a water world, they feel like they belong in this game.The characters are lovable. The main two protagonists have witty banter, throwing jabs at each other during platforming, the minigames that are sprinkled across the whole game, and slow moments where they remember some of their past times together. There are times where they have questionable decisions to fix their problem, and the easy solution to their problem they can't figure it out until the end of the adventure. Of course it's for the sake of story telling, but it does irk a little bit. This doesn't ruin my experience with the two characters, I think they're enjoyable when they're having fun, and are silly when they get competitive or argue with each other.Another character who I enjoyed is Dr Hakim, the talking book that sends you on this wild goose chase of an adventure. Wildly entertaining and animated, the developers waste no time to make it obvious who Dr Hakim is. From his goofy expression to his overly energetic dances and movements. There's never a dull moment with this book, specially when the couples argue with him. These characters will leave you smiling when they're on screen together.The gameplay as I mentioned before, is constantly changing. New movesets and tools are given to you right after another, and they're constantly coming up with new ways to use these movesets to solve creative puzzles, challenging platforms and boss fights. Just when you thought they've ran out of ideas, out comes a new tool! And then another! Without spoiling too much, the first tools you get is a hammer and a set of nails. The hammer is typically used to break down things like glass bottles, but is also used to swing across platforms, catapult off of springs, and pulling up nails to create new paths. The set of nails I found really fun. They're used like javelins where you throw them at walls to stick them, allowing the player with the hammer to swing across pit falls. They're also used to hold down platforms to move across, or even to hold down enemies for an open attack. What I really enjoy about these tools is one small detail. Generally in games, something like a hammer is given to the heavy weight character, and something agile and light like the set of nails, is given to characters who are slim and fast. So to see the slim female character carry the hammer, and the large male character use the nails was a breath of fresh air, to have broken a trend like that.It Takes Two (at the time of writing this review was the name of the game) is a beautifully crafted game that was cared for, and wasn't blinded by unfinished deadlines, the use of micro-transactions, or hiring big name voice actors in hopes to sell the game. It stood on it's own feet and truly shows that the team put in every love and talent into this game. I was looking for a game to play co-op with my friend, and instead of having a simple fun game to try out, I ended up discovering my new favourite game of all time. Without a doubt The Best Co-op experience I have ever played, and I think it's going to be difficult to find a game to top this one. There's something for everyone in this game; it's got great platforming, beautiful scenarios, classic jokes, fun silly side minigames and interactions, and a heartfelt story that ties this whole game up with a lovely red bow.Game of the Year, hands down."

Probably one of the best co-op games I've played and definitely one of the best games I've played overall for some time. The story-line is pretty average and the sub-plot just gives an excuse for the gameplay, but it's really not important. The main plot between the player characters is enough but it's the gameplay that keeps you hooked. The sound and level design is just fantastic - and every area of the game feels unique and different to keep it fresh for the entire 15 or so hours it takes to complete. The game is very funny and had me and my friend laughing constantly. Lots of little mini-games for some PvP and there's a good amount of challenge across the game for experienced players if wished.Highly recommend this game.Rating out of ten -10/10For the more quantitative of folks - Graphics ☐ Beautiful☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Bad☐ AwfulMusic / Audio ♬☑ Beautiful☐ Very good☐ Good☐ Bad☐ AwfulDifficulty ☠☐ Baby - holds your hand the entire way☐ Easy - minimal challenge☑ Average - normal difficulty of most games, some challenge but mostly easy☐ Difficult - a good challenge to the player☐ Hard - game can be painful at times and hard to complete for a casual gamer☐ Pain - this game will make you rage, not for the faint of heartStory☐ Fantastic☐ Very good☑ Good☐ Decent☐ Minimal☐ Poor☐ Non existentGeneral Game-play ⚔☑ Outstanding - hard to fault and near perfect☐ Very good - smooth and enjoyable☐ Good - largely enjoyable☐ Average - as expected☐ Okay - nothing special☐ Rubbish - more bad than goodGame Length☐ Very short (0 - 3 hours)☐ Short (3 - 8 hours)☑ Medium/Average (8 - 20 hours)☐ Long (20-60 hours)☐ Very Long (60-100 hours)☐ You'll grow old together (100+ hours)"

Idk its hard to  put into words other than to say that they made this game for the player and so the players can have fun. its legitimately ironic that its published by EA because this game goes against literally everything EA has stood for for over a decade lol."

Now that everything is online you rarely see co-op games or modes especially from triple A developers, and much rarer are dedicated co-op modes where you need the other player to advance. This kind of design always has the two (or more) players working together and makes everyone feel like they are crucial for success. It feels magical to connect with someone through a game this way, and i heavily recommend playing this game with your significant other or a close friend. Game is accessible to all skill levels so anyone can have fun. Worth at full price and a must-buy on sale, its a sin to go without playing this gem if you have someone to play with."

Maybe the vodka and cheap beer helped, but it feels like casting in a Disney/Pixar movie but still retaining your personality as an adult, the game never tried telling you who you are, it just showed what you can do, and we loved that.Its been months since we had a gaming night this fun, and I usually abhor platformers.Get this game, play with somebody that matters, and prepare for a night in which you'd feel you are too young to f*ck.20/10, would def pay double for it.

Caveat: I'm writing this review before having played the entire game myself, thanks to a computer fry halfway through (hence the short playtime). However, I have seen the entire thing a few times via various Let's Plays, so do know the entire plot.It has amazing sound/music, incredibly innovative gameplay, wonderful graphics, and of course you can't even play it alone so it's definitely better with someone else. The story, while occasionally silly, is heartfelt and memorable. And some parts will stick with you forever (RIP elephant). I can't say enough good things about this game, truly. It's FULL of tiny Easter eggs and references; FULL of neat secrets; and not only is the gameplay fun but all of the tiny little things you can discover that aren't even part of the game just add that much more magic (the Zelda reference, anyone??), from little competitions to fun retro nods. Not a single part of this game is boring. I haven't had so much fun playing with someone else in ages. 15/10, will love it forever."

There are some really artistic places and sequences.- Fantastically designed world with so many unique regions to explore that you will never get bored. The use of scale and the integration of all these magnified daily objects at the level design is really creative and gives you a whole new perspective of the world.- Except of the main path, there is a big amount of activities, mini games and easter eggs scattered inside its world. Although the game is linear, it gives you at some regions an open world feeling. You will spend a lot of hours wandering around and playing with them.- Good gameplay and flow. Control mechanics are simple but effective and all your commands feel responsive. The game has great pacing too. Fast and slow sequences come one after another, so it never gets boring.- It offers a fairly decent cinematic experience. Some sequences are really well directed and the photography is always at a high level.- Characters acquire different abilities at each chapter which alternates the gameplay enough to make it even more interesting.- Great, smooth and quick characters' animations. Running, hanging and double jumps can be extra pleasant.- The main characters are interesting and well designed. May and Cody are adorable. Hakim is a character to remember.- Nicely designed enemies. There is a big amount of unique bosses to beat. It is really creative of how daily objects have been transformed into evil creatures that want to kill you- There are many puzzles with some good ideas here and there. Unfortunately they are too easy and a bit childish.- Mini games are extraordinary. You will have some really fun pvp time in a game that is considered to be mainly co-op. A very clever addition.- Incredible music. It always fits the action and enhances the game's flow and atmosphere.- Good, convincing voice acting performances.- Great sense of humor. Although it is generally cute and childish it packs some adult jokes and some, kind of, violent scenes that form a surreal result.- It offers some emotionally strong moments, although the story is a little bit cliché.- It packs a friend pass which you can use multiple times, so you can save some money to your friends. Nice.The bad- Action sequences are way too easy. In fact the whole game is too forgiving and unchallenging. When you die your character respawns exactly at the place of death. Even at boss fights if you lose the game restarts sometimes from the middle of the battle. You don't lose unless both of your characters die at the same moment, which rarely happens. You can easily lose your interest and do things mechanically (especially at some sequences where your characters run automatically and you have just to press the jump button). If you consider that there are no difficulty levels, It is like the game is made mainly for children.- There are a lot of puzzles but you won't ever need more than a few seconds in order to figure out the solution. After a while they get a bit repetitive too. I expected some puzzles to be more complicated and clever.- Many minor bugs and glitches that will force you to restart the game. Sometimes your character will stuck inside a random object, some others the UI will disappear for no reason etc. Also the issue with all these EA's client apps (EA Play, Origin, Steam's Origin) is unacceptable. If you and your friend are not both running the game through the same client app you will probably need some time to figure out how to play together.- In tight or rotating places the camera angles can be frustrating giving you no clear view to play the game properly. - The story is shallow with many clichés. Except of the first and the last cut scenes it doesn't really evolves though the actual game. Also many things of the plot make no sense at all (why there tubes with liquid candy inside a snow ball that you need to reactivate?). Nevertheless it is true that this kind of platformers don't really need a strong story to support the action.- I felt that sometimes it tries too hard to be cute."

3479,Aniche,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aneeshb/,1,,1,28.1,November,"12,",155,0,1,"Absolutely stupendous game in every sense of the word. I can't explain to you how much I enjoyed this game, it's so good!!First of all, this game really leans into the co-op aspect and is so much fun as a result. Literally every puzzle needed some form of collab between me and my friend, and it was so fun when we got things right and hilarious when either of us messed up. Most puzzles were challenging enough to make you think without being so hard as to slow down your momentum.Every new environment introduces several new gameplay mechanics, and they're somehow all really well-implemented. It never felt like they were running out of ideas or got lazy, and each new mechanic led to a whole new paradigm for puzzle solving. Not to mention, bosses were so much fun in this game. Like, SO MUCH FUN.The visuals are an absolute delight. Everything is just bursting with colour, life, energy. You go from a treetop to a toy room to a space station thingie, just to name a few. Every new area had amazing presentation with weird and sometimes surreal level design. Every single level is just so insanely creative.The story, while fairly simple, is elevated by some great writing, and the two protagonists are very interesting and distinct characters. I never for a moment felt one outshone the other, and the way the story addresses the flaws in how they manage their relationship was charming and heartwarming, without being overly preachy or cheesy. Not to mention, each level has fun minigames and literally hundreds of interactable items and elements. You get to explore entire miniature towns and villages brimming with toy characters, and there's silly little activities that both players can do together. It genuinely felt like I was playing with a box of toys, and everything that looked like I should be able to interact with it let me do something with it, however inane or pointless.All in all, I'm astounded at the sheer polish and attention to detail lavished on every aspect of this game. In a world where it feels like every AAA game releases with a clusterf**k of bugs or unfinished content, this game felt like it was tripping over itself to give you more, more, more. I was expecting to finish this game in 5-6 hours, I did NOT expect it to have this much content. And all of it was so good??? Seriously, if you're reading this, BUY THIS GAME. This is not a drill."

3499,ىchmiloff,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Schmiloff/,1,,1,12.7,November,"2,",296,0,1,"I have genuinely put this review off because I feel it really deserves an in depth breakdown that is almost impossible to put into words.  This glorious game is one that just keeps on giving, from the second you launch this beauty you are bedazzled by the effort that has been put in by the creators. I have never experienced a game in this genre that provides such a ‘bang for buck’. I honestly feel ashamed to have bought this at a discount, the game is underpriced as it is.  This review will explore the major selling points for me and try to include what extras I can along the way. Firstly, I’ll cover the typical cliché yet surprisingly engaging and well-delivered story. Secondly, we’ll explore the level of detail taken to create such an immersive digital world! Finally, the gameplay and how it not only incorporates cooperative play well but how it adapts throughout the game.Now whilst this is a ‘child makes a wish for their separating parents to sort their ♥♥♥♥ out on a fantasy adventure’ the quality of a cliché structure does not diminish the story whatsoever. Ironically, structured much like a child's movie, this game reinforces the cliché by adding some outrageously bad pun humour whilst also sneaking a few in for the adults as well. The story is genuinely beautiful and engaging, the emotional rollercoaster just keeps on going! I have 12.7 hours of playtime and the majority of that does not include too much time invested into the 'side extras' provided. It takes two (ITT) goes above and beyond to create such a beautiful world that provides such realism in a fantasy world. Without spoiling the story too much, the main characters are turned into dolls that adventure through the house and garden through several terrains. The way the game is structured typically changes the abilities/gameplay available to suit the terrain making each stage of the story different, fun and unique. Additionally, whilst providing such a large variety of worlds for us to explore the creators do not miss a second of detail throughout any of them. For example, the subtle yet significant attention to detail with such things as a kids road rug in the bedroom or battling a vacuum cleaner in the garage. Not to mention the quality of the graphics is superb!! ITT is created for cooperative play and whilst other games like  and  are similar in that sense, I feel this game sets such a high standard that future games will find it difficult to live up to. This cooperative game can be played split-screen on the same device or shared split-screen online (which only requires 1 copy of the game). As mentioned with terrain, the gameplay is forever changing and adapting to the environment, not once throughout the game do you feel ""oh this is the same repetitive crap"". In certain parts of the story, there are hidden extras and minigames you can verse each other in as well. Additionally, the progression of the changes throughout the game add consistent difficulty changes however, you’ll never feel like the game is unreasonable in expectations. To wrap it up, I can not fault this game and developers should take note, this is the targeted standard for a co-op game. This game is appropriate for all ages, you’ll get an immersive story that you won't want to put down! Aesthetically pleasing whilst going above and beyond that craving you have for a platform coop adventure. If you don't buy this game, you'll never be truly fulfilled in life. If  and  aren't already working on a sequel... WE RIOT!!!!!!!!!"

From the start you feel that you are really helping each other to beat the game, you never feel that you're competing, instead you really need to coordinate with the one that you're playing with. We even had fun making mistakes while trying to beat the challenges that the game put us through, but maybe not everyone reacts like us, 'cause we even saw the other reviews were they were fighting with their girlfriends.The storytelling in the game matches a lot with the scenery, the way they portrait the story it's viewed a lot in all the decoration and the level or part of the story you're at. There's also a lot of minigames in between the story that you can play and have fun, so you always having fun.

I bought it a few weeks ago for me and my girlfriend, for our anniversary date so we could play it together when it did roll around and, it was truly a blast. The story was great, the game-play really did bring us closer, excluding when I would win in all the challenges (she wouldn't let me lose). We had to think as a team and no one did all the work while the other one did nothing, you HAVE to work together. The ""Snow Level"" was by far our favorite, we roamed the level, exploring and just doing things together, laughing, by the time it was over it felt like an actual adventure, it was definitely sad it was over, and I'd do it over with her a thousand times if I could force myself to forget it after every time we played it. This is truly an amazing co-op game that I recommend not only to couples, but truly anyone who wants to spend time with a someone they care about. Easily a 10/10 game for me.For whenever you check my reviews and find this, I love you, thanks for playing this with me, it will be a memory I'll think of fondly."

Achievements apply on both friends (given both own the game) so if one person finds something, the other person technically finds it even if they don't interact with it.For the actual game, it has great cartoon graphics and is quite well optimized. It references several different game styles and each of the different world levels are just so interesting and interactive. There are many small decorations that are interact-able and overall the attention to detail is just satisfying.Story caters to couples but I had fun playing this with my homie.Soundtrack is aight.I haven't experienced any major bugs except for some minor clipping here and there.It's a shame that there is no replayability because I would love playing this with multiple different people."

This game also has no business being as beautiful as it is, it's really weird how beautiful this game is and it's screenshot worthy many a time. Each 'world' has a different game mechanic and it's just so so so damn creative how they thought of all of this. It's honestly really impressive how much thought and effort they put into the gameplay experience. Death is always funny and comedic. Cooperation is rewarding and it never feels repetitive.

The gameplay is fun and interesting as well; with each level you get new abilities that let you work together and solve puzzles to advance the story. There are even fun little mini-games where you can go up against your partner, which adds a slight competitiveness to the game and helps to break up all the co-op gameplay a bit.

I nothing special but it works. I the controls make sense, it's easy to figure out, the movements are snappy and we didn't find any game breaking bugs.- Entertainment. Honestly, the puzzles are easy. It's bog standard platform stuff. It won't challenge you, but it'll entertain you because they're creative and well paced. It never drags and the cut scenes are just enough to keep the story moving.- Cooperative play is seemless. My friend and I never had lag or connection issues.

And thank god I did.-Top class graphics. Could've been a Nvidia demo and I would have believed it.-Friend Pass. I bought this game and played with my friend who didn't own the game. Giving players this ability makes it so easy to try this game with any of my friends.-A sweet story. Its a straightforward plot but there was a specific mission where my friend and I felt emotionally invested...Not something we've felt about a game before. We had no choice, Queen.-Creative gameplay and . Man, I don't remember the last time I felt a game was just plain fun. No caveats. No 'frustrating but fun', or 'buggy but fun', its simply fun. For example, I expected this game to be a monotone style of a third party adventure, but there were many missions that surpassed my expectations. They had missions using mechanics gamers will be familiar with from other genres like stealth or traditional RPGs. A balanced variety and necessary in keeping the gameplay fresh and surprising.-Favorite Mission:  -Lack of bugs. Nowadays it feels that every game, regardless of its budget, is plagued with bugs. However, It Takes Two was bug free in my experience (except for the friend pass situation). And a modern game being bug free and well polished deserves a commendation by this alone.-Only con I had was the fact that using the Friend Pass required my friend and I to launch the game through Origin. I would bet that most people buying this game on Steam would be happy to keep Origin off their computer. Unfortunately if we launched via Steam, my friend couldn't join me. Meh.-*Nitpick* I really wanted to replay with the MPC portion, wish I could've gone back without having to redo the mission from the beginning.In summary, I'm a FPS head and I love this fun game. If you're looking to give this game a try I would have a hard time giving you a reason why you ."

It Takes Two is one of those games. Is it perfect? Nah. But somehow, despite its flaws, It Takes Two is still one of my favourite games of the year, and perhaps my favourite co-op game of all time. The +ves:- It really is a co-op game, and like the name suggests, makes good use of both players to complete each level- The voice actors for the main characters are good, and the banter between them is great- The worlds and powers are reminiscent of banjo kazooie and psychonauts;- Every level feels different and there are a few entirely different mechanics to play with- Rose's Room. Especially the bit with the Queen...The -ves- Rose's character always felt slightly annoying instead of endearing;- The 'real world' models have just a bit of uncanny valley to them;- As it is designed to be couch co-op, you have to connect via discord to communicate if you are playing online. Also no handy ping system a la portal 2 to point at what you want them to do. Unfortunately if you don't have a second person, you're going to miss out. I strongly suggest finding one and then playing this with them. It's worth the cost at full price, and if you see this one sale - really don't miss out."

I was only told to purchase this by a friend and so far this is probably one of the best coop games that I've played. The visuals are stunning it's like watching a Pixar movie and that you can interact in it. The story and the dialogue and voice acting are top notch. I like the way this game makes you think about how to solve the puzzles in a manner that involves two people. It is an overall wonderful game. 5/5 stars.
3689,Peacheenie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/floofypeach/,1,,1,22.4,August,"18,",357,0,1,"(Played as  and owns the game):Well, I've got to say I was incredibly surprised with all of the things this game managed to accomplish considering its simple starting premise of ""we're getting a divorce""! When first starting, I had no idea what to expect from It Takes Two and both me and my co-op partner went in completely blind which was probably the best call because we found ourselves absolutely blown away with the amount of game styles secretly packed inside this innocent little platformer; if you're looking for variety in your game then It Takes Two takes the CAKE with every level having it's own set of abilities and game mechanics to shake things up when you least expect it with the levels acting both as open world exploration and generic platforming interchangeably!The level designs themselves are chock full of life and character; the art design pushing itself to the limits with the beautifully rendered scenery and gorgeous details with everyday objects seamlessly implemented into both the background and foregrounds with lots and lots of things for you to interact with whilst you're exploring. If there's an object in your path you can usually do something with it and it makes for such a wonderful experience feeling like a kid again when you stumble upon a spinning light you can mash the button to spin or some paints and crafts to make actual art with; the actual amount of creativity and game play mechanics in It Takes Two is INSANE and the developers really went all out to make a memorable experience when they really didn't have to! I really can't say enough how much I adored this games design and premise of ""everyday objects but reimagined to be used in completely unique ways""; there's literally so much packed into this game that my review would probably be about 20 pages long if I tried to list it all!Last but not least the story and it's characters were very interesting despite it's simple premise! Dr. Hakim was at first quite annoying and brash but towards the end I genuinely liked him and what he was trying to set out to do for the main characters. Rose was very endearing and I constantly felt bad for her situation considering what she would have to be going through but what I found both Cody and May is that they have a very deep and troubled relationship of which I don't think I've seen represented so well in a video game before- it feels . Their relationship feels incredibly normal and human and oh so relatable of which is why I found myself growing on these two people and rooting for them to try and work it out and get back together despite their ever growing list of reason on why they should end it and split up. I'm glad the ending is open ended on this however because it shows that even if you do work things out together, not everything has to be perfect and sometimes it is just best to separate from your partner to be healthier and happier in the end.All in all I'd definitely recommend this game to people mainly for its gameplay because it's seriously one of the best co-op games I've ever played and it REALLY doesn't skimp on the co-op at all- you  need to work with your partner throughout and get used to depending on them and that's why it's so special!- (Played as  for free via Steam Remote Play):Right so firstly, THIS GAME IS BLOODY BRILLIANT!!! Legit, this game is probably the best co-op experience I’ve ever had playing a game. A Way Out was fantastic in itself, but this game takes the idea of a co-op game and just goes completely wild with it! So much creativity and imagination is on display throughout, be it from the levels’ designs themselves or from the various gameplay gimmicks, that the game never ends up feeling boring! Every moment has something new to offer and enjoy and once me and Emm were finished with it, I legit didn’t want it to end… My favourite areas in the game were probably the space themed area, the cuckoo clock, the snowglobe and the music-themed area but legit every area has something cool and fun to offer,, bloody great soundtrack too!!Plus, not only is the game constantly entertaining through it’s gameplay, the story is rly bloody engaging too! Even though the game has constant wacky setpieces after the other, it’s incredible how throughout it tells a legit really personal story about two people just trying to fix their broken relationship! Cody and May start out the game legit unlikable at points because of how toxic their relationship became and how oblivious they are to how it affects their daughter Rose, which results in one specific section of the game that was so surreally dark that it left me nearly tearing up over how guilty it makes you feel. The game rly is all about identifying the problems in relationships and ultimately working together to make it better again,, on top of just being rly funny 😂😂 . Dr. Hakim especially has so many quotable lines and moments throughout! (RelationSHIT to RelationSHIP!!)SO YEAH this game was great! And it was so much fun playing it through with Emm!! Cannot wait to see what Hazelight and Josef Fares do next and if they’ll even be able to top this!! Till then tho,, adiós 😀!!!!"

A Way Out was leagues better, but still a bit rough around the edges. It Takes Two has some of the best game design to come out within the last 10 years, the game is oozing creativity and innovation. There are many moments that made me say, ""I don't think I've ever seen this in a video game before.""With each new gameplay element the developers introduce, there was always that worry in the back of my mind: ""is my ability gonna be as fun to use as my partners?"" I'm happy to say that that moment never came where there was a ""bad"" section for either player, and the devs do a fantastic job of balancing out the co op abilities where one power doesn't really feel ""better"" than the other. They also managed to turn infamous annoying levels in video games (ice level, underwater level) into actual fun tasks to complete.The game sits at about 15 hours, but we had so much fun with it, it felt much shorter.

Its not mind blowing game of the year(or is it?), but its sure great at everything it does. A meaningful real story, level design and details were awesome, and length of content was not short, but not too long either. Lots of interactive fun things in each level. Something you and your current/future wife/husband can enjoy together without stressing out with high level skilled play. I played ""A Way Out"" with another friend, also a very solid co-op game from the same developer. Gonna be hard for them to beat ""It Takes Two"" though, this has set the bar for the 2 player cooperative game for me now.

3819,Muobman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Muobman/,1,,1,10.3,July,"18,",813,0,1,"Never have I hated a book like I have in this game. It Takes Two is the story of a husband and wife who are planning a divorce as they have grown apart over time. In a bid to save their marriage at the wish of their child, a magic book traps them in a nightmare dimension, where they inhabit the bodies of two dolls. In this realm, they can feel pain and die, but death does not offer an escape, the book can and will revive them until his unholy task is complete. The task in question? A gauntlet of deadly obstacles based on features in and around their own house. As they complete tasks, this malevolent deity periodically appears to torment them, and remind them that there will be no respite until they reconcile. The desperation of this scenario causes them to go to terrible lengths, and I found one scene in the game genuinely harrowing, so be aware that there are emotional gut punches in this game.In gameplay terms, this is a co-operative platformer that introduces new mechanics frequently enough to stay fresh, while also occasionally dipping a toe into other genres to further add variety. While many mechanics are a little shallow, all of these gameplay segments are carefully balanced so that nothing overstays its welcome, with new rules and mechanics introduced as soon as you have explored the full depths of the previous set. The game also contains a plethora of competitive minigames, which provide a nice breather and sideshow from the main game every now and then.The game is mechanically sound, and I encountered no major bugs while completing it online with a friend. The game and online functionality runs through EA Origin, so be aware that you will need to make or have an EA account in order to play it, as will your co-op partner (assuming you play online).This game is charming, funny and great fun to play through with a friend, and with the friend pass meaning that only one of you has to own the game, you owe it to yourself to play it."

Period. I always thought Portal 2 would never be dethroned but this takes the cake. The game never ever had a dull or slow moment. Every level a new mechanic is introduced. Every single character was unique. There were times where I was grinning from ear to ear with some of the stupid jokes that were made. My partner and I had a blast going head to head with the minigames scattered throughout the worlds.Please get this game. You can tell this was 100% a passion project and it's probably going to be on my mind for a LONG time.

At first I thought it was a little cringe, but I soon realised that was part of the game..... it comes across a little childish at the start bus that doesn't last long. This is my first steam review and possibly my last, I just had to do a review to show my respect for the hard work that went into this game. If you are looking for a CO-OP game, I couldn't recommend this enough. Trippy levels, great humour, awesome game play and beautiful graphics. Every time you get to a new area it feels like a completely different game so there is no risk of getting bored. The challenges / puzzle are at a good difficulty so new and experienced gamers can both enjoy. The best part about this game is how long it goes for (12+ hours), and when you do finally finish the game you can play it again as the opposite character..I played this game with my girlfriend who is currently in Spain and I am in Australia (can't really get much further away). Even with her bad quality internet we experience no lag or any issues which straight away is a big plus for me. Get this game, you won't regret it."

What's truly amazing about this game is that only one person needs to buy it. Your friends can either play locally or online through the friends pass.There is a very diverse range of game mechanics throughout the game. Each chapter introduces new obstacles and tools for you to problem solve with making each chapter unique. The puzzles required to solve are challenging enough to where you can still enjoy the game and not get frustrated on your first playthrough. My first playthrough took about nine hours. However I have easily spent another 10 hours of playtime just playing the minigames with the same friend. I have discovered something new each time I've played. Whether its a new mini-game, easter-egg or small detail. They are always a wonder to come across.The game is  and runs smoothly despite having to render two different perspectives most of the game. There are very few instances where I experienced frame drops."

Each section in the game is new, creative, and makes the experience all the more enjoyable. I say the story isn't the best thing because it just feels strange. The book you meet in the game is probably the most entertaining character I've personally encountered in quite awhile. The game does have moments that make you question the parenting skills of the characters you play as.The gameplay is the most enjoyable part about this game as it is super creative and diverse. You are taken on a journey and the game is basically sectioned off throughout this journey so you are in many different settings. From being in a toys view of a childs room to having a streetfighter-esque battle with a squirrel on a toy plane. It's pretty fascinating how the maps change and my favorite setting was definitely the space area. Each section gives you the tools you need to complete the area and the tools are always used in creative ways. The game makes you not only think through the puzzles your faced with but forces you to work with your partner/significant other/friend to get through the game. It's pretty fricken rad.The graphics in this game are great. Not amazing and not terrible. The designs for the characters are super cool and you can definitely see the creativity that went into the designs for each stage in this game. I didn't have any issues with the controls throughout the gameplay. Audio was great too. The voice acting in it wasn't as cringe as I've heard in many other games. The ONLY confusing thing about the game audio for me was the childs VA. Music was great in this game, They even bring you into an old school juke box which was super cool!!I have to recommend this to anyone looking for a co-op game to play with someone. I don't think anyone should be discouraged from playing this game just because of the stories ""relationship fixing"" topic. It is worth playing. I want more games like this. It was just fun. There's plenty of games that demand skills, teamwork, and have in depth customization's and rich stories which aren't bad things but I do miss just being able to pick up a game and have some ridiculous fun. This game allowed me to do that and I appreciate that feeling.Rating 9/10"

Great team building co-op game. We could play together on one screen, on different screens in the same room, or online when we weren't together. Made for fun versatile play. They somehow incorporated practically every game style in one short game from rail grinding to Mortal Kombat style fighting to Portal reminiscent puzzles. Loved to find all the mini games as well (makes for some replay-ability).Our only issues come from technical issues. I wish that game studios would allow their developers as much time as needed, because there are definitely known bugs. The biggest of all being our save file disappeared one day. Luckily someone has their completed save file uploaded online that we were able to download so we didn't have to start over. But we did lose all our recorded wins and losses in the mini games. There were also some glitches with the boss battles where we had to start over because things weren't showing up on the screen. Other than that though, we had loads of fun and would definitely recommend to any couple or or couple of friends who love co-op games."

I played this with my girlfriend and we both agree that this game is and was awesome. The level design and how everything looked, made you want to look around everywhere and just explore. The minigames and little things you could find in the levels were lovely and a lot of fun!! I would deffinetly reccomend this game too those that like platformers and Co-op adventures! This game in my opinion is by far one of my favorite games ever, and the best game i have played this year!"

I played the full story with my husband then again with my cousin-in-law! At first the split-screen is odd considering we have our own screens, but it becomes very natural after the Prologue and it's actually quite cool to be able to see what they other player is doing - it's also a nice concept for anybody spectating your gameplay. Would highly recommend, great story, great gameplay, hours and hours of fun, you will not regret it!"

Each level endows the two players with different abilities, and you can't progress without working together. I love the puzzles, and more so, I love the sense of movement in every scene. There's a certain joy to it I can't explain.It's not... perfect tho. The storyline is so-so (it tries too hard sometimes). But most annoyingly, you can't switch the splitscreen positions. May is always on the left, and Cody on the right. We have one controller, and my gf prefers mouse and keyboard, so i have to sit on the left, but control the right screen. @Hazelight, please release a patch for this simple issue!"

3939,FiBiE007,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fibie007/,1,,1,16.1,July,"4,",196,0,1,"I first heard of this game on Twitch where I watched a bit of gameplay. I checked the steam site of it and was surprised what hides behind this rather plain presentation. Quickly I decided to play It Takes Two with a friend who is also into coop-games.The graphics leave nothing to be desired. Textures are super clean, the lighting looks almost too good for standard rasterization and the cut scenes are well made, even though they lack a bit behind the gameplay (third person) graphics quality. The game looks great. All areas create a very distinct atmosphere which lovely portray custom art styles and themes. It is just a pleasure to look around and explore the levels.This one is a weird offset (not quality wise) to the otherwise consistent experience. There are no spoilers included. When you first look at the game it becomes clear that the main story is oriented towards a younger audience. In combination with the graphics and the general goal of the game, one would imagine the story to be not shallow but also not too deep. As it turned out at two specific points in the story it is quite macabre, even brutal. If there was an uncut version for adults, this could well be a horror game sometimes. How the main goal unfolds gives lots of opportunities for the game to show its potential. It is a linear quest line, but well, sometimes hidden, placed minigames are a welcome variation. Playing through the levels makes a lot of fun. A 100% run by exploring everything and playing all the minigames takes 15 hours.The biggest strength of It Takes Two are the coop mechanics. The whole game is a series of coop passages and parkours. All coop elements fit perfectly into each theme and range from an easy to lower-moderate difficulty. The controls feel responsive which makes the fine-motor parts an ease to handle. Some passages demand more coordination and others not as much. Not a single coop passage feels out of place - quite the contrary. Sure, not all of them are particularly sophisticated but none is tedious. It Takes Two shows perfectly that it does not take much to have lots of fun. Sometimes the little things and this one specific detail that makes one smile make the difference.I really recommend playing it. Only one of the players must buy it (the other one can play via the free Friend's Pass). On a weekend with some time, you will have a nice memorable gaming experience."

It's all flawless. There are no bugs that I've come across too. It's like playing through a Pixar movie including the stellar modern graphics. The designers clearly studied and beautifully mapped every environment and thought out every little detail present. The dialogue is fantastic along with the voice acting. It perfectly revolves around its concept of requiring two players, in the most fun way possible.Cannot recommend this title enough, 10/10."
3977,AfronTheDon,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165215265/,1,,1,10.1,June,"29,",241,0,1,"I'll start by saying this, the game is a 10/10 masterpiece. It features some of the best story pacing/writing and character development in recent history. The game-play is never uninteresting with its diverse and expansive worlds, free for you to explore and enjoy mini-games with your friend. The attention to detail is like watching a magnum opus unfold, from little things like snow footprints to the characters models looking supple and feeling soft to the eyes. The abilities the protagonists use through the story are always fun and interesting never lacking in creativity. The game introduces you to Hakim which is one of the best characters in the story especially for comic relief, the action in the game is fluid, the somber tones are impactful and accompanied with an amazing score. The calm moments divert your gaze from the characters themselves to the world around you, where the more you look the more detail you'll find. The puzzles were never difficult enough to hinder the experience while still leaving room for you and your duo to have light-hearted fun in figuring them out. The Easter eggs are impressive referencing older games, music, and events; there's even an Easter egg about the devs previous game A Way Out. And lastly the mini-games are in no way a driving factor in the main story but they still feel like something you should do, due to the massively explorable world; They offer solace, a good challenge, and competitive fun for you and your friend. Over all rating 10/10 If you want an experience that will stick with you this is the game to buy."

We completed 2 chapters by now and there is no repetition. So you will have 9 chapters of non-repetetive game play which is like ~20h game play for 2 people. The chapters are designed in a similar way. in the beginning each player get a tool/gadget/weapon which he will wield for that chapter. These stuff will interact with the equipment of the other player and you need to work together and talk to each other to solve the puzzles and progress further. Each chapter seems to have an endboss, which needs to be defeated with these tools.Every action, every control a player gets has a weight behind and its so much fun to fulfill each step and see the other player succeed in his/her tasks. Most of the game is in split screen. and you can track, what the other player is doing, which sounds clunky, but adds to the fun.100% recommendation!"

Across the 15 hours it took my brother and I to complete it we enjoyed an array of various puzzles, challenges and boss fights. Every section introduced new mechanics and I can definitely say that at no point did the game feel like it was dragging.The world looks great, and the story was perfectly serviceable. Actually, I enjoyed it more than I expected to. All the characters were well voiced and interesting, and Dr Hakim was a lot of fun when he got involved.I would say the only downside is that the game can be quite easy - but since we were always moving through new environments so quickly that was never much of a downside.We also never had any problems with the origin launcher. Overall, if you want a very fun, fairly long co-op experience than you should definitely try It Takes Two!"

Second, the graphics in this game are superb, they are beautiful and never fail and my computer ran 60fps 24/7. Third, cut scenes, I normally hate too many cut scenes, but this game was perfectly binded with them, they were AMAZIMGLY animated and looked so smooth to where it looked better that some actual movies animation. Fourth, story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the story is incredible, you see these two people who almost hate each other really change throughout the story, god I was so heart warmed by the end which I normally am not since I am a lunatic :). Lastly, Mechanics, this game shows how mechanics can be combined to really make a game, this game gives you new mechanics and trades them out fast, but not too fast so they are fun to use but never get boring. Also the soundtrack is amazing.This game is easily a 10/10, get it even though it is a bit pricey, it was 100% worth it, Thank you for this masterpiece, It was a lot of fun."

Each act has a fresh perspective and the mechanics you're given to work with are simply yet extremely satisfying to use. Even more impressive when compared to most other games released in this day and age was how polished everything felt. I've done QA years ago and have an eye for finding bugs or mistakes, but this game had hardly any at all and even then those found were just minor cosmetics more than anything.Story wise, everything is just so well thought out, nothing overly complex, just a deep understanding of core emotions we all go through on our day to day. The build up to the end doesn't feel rushed and you can feel the story grow organically which again, is seldom found in this day and age of quick release games.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed at everything this game has to offer and if you play with a loving partner, I can guarantee you both will come out the other end feeling even more admiration for each other.Hazelight, makers of ""A way out"" and ""Brothers"", has added another masterpiece to their library of masterpieces and I look forward to what comes next.10/10A+++A story all should experience once in their life"

The puzzles demand both players work together to achieve the goals in the level. You might be asking “how do I know if I should play this game?”    - Do you and your significant other fight a lot? Play it   - Do you have father/mother issues? Play it   - Do you have a friend whose parents got divorced? Play it   - Are you and your best friend fighting a lot more now days? Play it   - Did you already get divorced and want something to do with your kid? Play itPersonally I am playing this game with my partner, and it has been a really fun experience. We never tire of trying to find new ways to kill each other in Coop games. This game is no exception.

4069,Down Bad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stickpeople4/,1,,1,12.8,June,"16,",320,0,1,"Awesome game. There was basically nothing bad I could find through my playthrough. Definitely worth full price if you're a fan of a good story and puzzles. The puzzles in the game are simple enough to figure out for either a casual or more-hardcore gamer, but still challenging enough to make you stop and think for a moment. It may be difficult at times but the game is very forgiving to players. There is lots of variation in each chapter so it's fresh and fun while generally not long enough to become too repetitive.It took roughly 12 hours to complete with a friend, including messing around at many points and trying out each minigame. The main story, at my estimate, would take about 10.5 hours to complete.Pros:- Nice story- *Excellent* game design- Fun puzzles and minigames- Lots of variation, keeps it very fresh- ONLY ONE COPY OF THE GAME IS NEEDED> And more.. that I can't currently name. Lots of positives here.Cons:- Requires a second player (BUT ONLY ONE COPY IS NEEDED!!), so you're missing out if you can't find anyone- Goes through the Origin platform/EA servers (EA servers seemed to have gone down at one time)Bugs encountered:- Controller was stuck vibrating right before end scene (might've been my problem; fixed when tabbed out)- Shield bugged out and wouldn't deploy at one required section, had to restart section (annoying but no biggie, checkpoint real close)Overall, one very solid game that I could put on a list of favorites. Wholesome, though can be dark at times. No spoilers. Just play it.10/10"

The platforming challenges weren't too hard for my partner who's not a hard-core gamer, while still being visually interesting, fun and varied enough that they also kept me engaged.

It is just too good not to play with a friend or significant other. The amount of in-game mechanics is mind boggling, every level feels unique. The story, albeit simple, is a very fun and gratifying ride to experience. Over the course of the game Cody and May strive to return to their normal bodies. However, they are side-tracked constantly by their new bodies, personal disagreements, and ""The Book of Love"" AKA Dr. Hakim. With each passing stage/level, Cody and May attempt to fix their relationship by overcoming physical, emotional, and mental challenges. Each level introduces a new notion/spin on how to remedy a problem that could occur in a love-based relationship. The biggest problem Cody and May face is by far communication but there are a ton of other real-world lessons that you could incorporate into your own personal/future relationships.I don't want to reveal a ton more as I believe you need to experience the game without any prior knowledge to truly appreciate the level design, game mechanics, and story.Overall this game is a solid 9.5/10, it has the right message and great gameplay to keep many people engaged over the course of the entire story."

Easy contender for my choice for Game of the Year 2021. You MUST play this game, this is one of those games that I will frequently revisit and I will always have fond memories of my adventures in this game with my partner. This is what it would looks like if Pixar made a game: lovely art, lovely story, brilliant characters, amazing gameplay.First thing first, the smartest they did with this game is that only one player needs to buy the game. The second player can simply download a friend pass and able to play by joining the player that bought the game. That is just AMAZING, especially coming from an EA published game.Secondly, this game is VERY non-gamer friendly. It is PERFECT for those who have a partner who is not familiar with gaming. It is THAT well designed and welcoming. On top of the amazing art direction.As the title suggest this game is MUST be played with two players. This is a platforming game with an incredibly heartwarming story. The levels are built brilliantly surrounded by creatively designed levels and smart puzzles. The characters are well written and there isn't a single unmemorable character, including the bosses you face throughout the game.On top of the amazing levels, the game also have mini-games scattered throughout the game where you and your partner can face head-on against each other. Creating fun little detours for you and your partner.If I list all the things I love about this game, that review will be able to serve as a thesis for a PhD. This game is just brilliant, get it, play with a friend/partner and go on the amazing adventures that were laid out by the developers. This is an instant classic."

The friend's pass is really something that should be embraced by more companies that create co-op games within the industry, as it gives you that ""hey, wanna come over and play some videogames""... type of vibe, and we all deserve that treat sometimes.

I would even go as far as to say that it is one of the best games I have ever played. It is literally the perfect co-op game. Everything about it is amazing: great and emotional story, beautiful graphics, breath-taking world design (and especially a great variety of locations), characters with unique personalities (Cody, May, The Book of Love, princess elephant and many more), humour, fun, incredibly good gameplay, etc. It's just awesome from start to finish. And the friend pass from EA makes it possible to play this game with another friend. Great idea.The best thing about the game is really how varied it is. The gameplay is constantly changing, for example by giving you new abilities, changing your perspective, the environments are very different (which made me want to explore every corner of the game. Something I haven't done in a long time), mini-games, etc.For once, this is a game that is worth the full price (if not even more)! Absolutely recommended purchase.

This includes previous titles the publisher has made which we also enjoyed, but this new game blows them out of the water. The humour and gameplay compliment one another fantastically. Never have I felt areas were too repetitive, which is rare/unheard of for a platform game. This is achieved through each new chapter introducing it's own gameplay mechanics assigning both players their own specific roles which require teamwork and communication to coordinate together to achieve success. It has great replay value too in this sense, as replaying as the opposite character will give a new experience with different gameplay mechanics. It's a really clever new IP and I recommend this to anyone looking  for a fresh and fun co-op experience. It's honestly raised the bar for co-op and platform puzzle solving games for me and I hope other developers look to this game as an example of how to excute this style of game well."

Overall I can only give this game a positive review. The cooperative game play was fun and exciting, the mini games (that we found) were competitive and enjoyable to experience, and the story was fantastic! Each level gave us fun new abilities to play around with that worked off of each other to provide an awesome two-player collaborative experience.I will say that we did experience a few bugs throughout the experience that caused a hiccup or two during our playthrough, but nothing game-breaking!Also it is important to note that even if you are playing together online, the game forces you to play with a dynamic vertical split-screen.

You, and the person you play with, do not to be super into games to have an amazing time. There are several chapters, each of which introduces a completely new environment and game mechanics for both of the 2 main characters that are so well implemented, they could have made an entire game alone off of some of the mechanics. The story, despite being linear and basic, was pulled off really well and I can't help but feel that this was a passion project that was lucky enough to thrive: especially given that it is a game developed by EA. The game is a bit pricey but once u consider the fact only 1 person has to buy it and the other person only needs to install a friend pass to play for free, it becomes a reasonable value proposition.10/10 highly recommended.

The game doesn't punish you for dying, it simply allows you and your partner to have fun, laugh-off your mistakes and encourages you to mess with one another when the opportunity is given. The mini games are so unique compared to anything I've played before, while catering to each area you're in to make them fit that part of the story as well as utilizing some of the tools you currently have equipped. The game is beautiful, charming, unique in just about every way I can think of and perfect for gamers of all levels. I typically don't go towards puzzle based co-op games like this, I usually go for shooters or RPGs, but this game pulled me in completely with how different it looked.

This is an absolute GEM of a game to play with a friend, boss battles are intense & so satisfying to complete & because you play such different roles it has replay value too.10/10"

The developer trying to put anything all around the place hoping it sticks, and thankfully most of it sticks. This approach result in a rich gameplay experience. I think they're following Titanfal 2 approach where it 'gives player mechanic, change the mechanic before they got bored', this approach works as there's almost 0 time where I got bored when playing it. The game design almost on par with mario game's. It's solid, clever, fresh, inspired and most importantly FUN.The presentation is top notch, there's tons of love and care put in to this area. I lost count how many time I blown away in this area. The textures, the lighting, the models, the environment design are top notch. The shader team constantly flexing their skill, there's an area where it let you draw using a oil paint and you need to combine multiple color to achieve specific color and it behaves like a real paint. The asset and environment style are highly polished and fresh, each stage feels different. I kinda think it almost at Pixar's level, the human model are kinda flat but it rarely shown so no biggie.The story is decent, it does the job but no highlight here.The detail is insane, there's tons of small stuff that you can play around with. That oil paint thing that I mentioned earlier is not a main content, it just a small stuff on a small corner that developer put. It's insane how much love that being put in this game, I can feel the passion and love just by playing it.Highly recommended this, a split screen coop is a rare thing these days.

While it does require a free Origin account (boooooo!), it is well worth playing; lots of humor, cute moments, amazing gameplay, and some stunningly beautiful environments. The creator Josef Fares is an actual movie director, and if you have any experience with his previous games ""Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons"", or ""A Way Out"", you know he loves crafting a cinematic experience. No difference here; numerous points feel like you're playing in a movie. Every level brings in a new play-style, so the game always feels fresh.Super awesome bonus: only one player needs to own the game, and the other can play via the ""It Takes Two Friend's Pass"". (They also need a free Origin account.)Game is approximately 12-15 hours long, depending on how much you like exploring the levels, the occasional thinking puzzle, and how much you play the (optional but fun) mini-games, so use that as a guide for whatever your acceptable price-to-playtime ratio is.10/10 great way to spend some time with people you care about."

You and a friend play as ether May or Cody, two people who are looking to get a divorce, but then their daughter some how made a love book come to life and curse the parents to become little dolls. Now they have to work to together to get back to their real bodies and maybe back together. First of all, you need two people to play this game, it's all cooperative. The cool thing is only one of the two people needs to own the game, where the other just needs the free friend pass. This is a cute as hell game. Everything about this game is great; the story, gameplay,  visuals, music, characters, all fantastic. And each level introduces a new co-op game mechanics, both player get different abilities that helps each other. There are also mini games to find and play through out the game. We did have a bit of trouble, where my controller would just quit on me and we had to restart the checkpoint again. And the ending is kind of anti-climaxic. I feel this is a must play with your best friend, cause it really tests your teamwork and trust. And I give this a 9.5/10."

Take note gaming industry, these types of games are sorely needed. The integration of the coop mechanics for each level was stunning, as well as the level design. I havent played a coop game with this quality of level design since portal 2. Everytime you think you might be getting bored of a mechanic, the game completely switches it up and gives you a new tool to solve the puzzles with. The story is nothing shabby either, but in my opinion the gameplay design is the truly exception aspect to this game. Loved it, and I dont when I will next have an experience like this."

We both agree that the biggest strength of the game is the scale and atmosphere of the levels which stayed consistently amazing throughout the game. The story pacing was mostly good but it did drag during a couple of the earlier levels and one later level as some sections can be quite repetitive. Same goes for the gameplay. Most of the game is quite fun but there were a few power ups and sections that could have benefited from having the power ups be more free form, because as they are, most were only useful in specific circumstances. Otherwise, you can tell that the game has had a ton of love put into it and I can easily recommend it to anyone who has a friend that wants to play with them."

This will take you on a casual stroll through a marriage crisis and how you can go about fixing it. Overall for the type of game it is I would rate it an 9/10 if it was more difficult it would probably be higher. Just know this isn't Call of Duty and is meant to be casual and entertaining which I think it accomplished very well. Dynamic puzzles that feel satisfying.

Out of the 19 yrs of playing games from when everything started from the gamecube to now, it's definitely in my top 3 best games I've ever played! The fact that the devs didn't half ass any part in here for example like useless stuff you wouldn't end up using as gameplay was still so detailed along with the rest of the useful stuff! The story is well thought out as it is very hard to have a story like that in games now and days cough cyberpunk which brings me to another thing. This game is around 40 bucks and is STILL worth the money even if lets say this was 80 bucks and cyberpunk was 40. No brainer which one to buy.  One unique thing about this game that I love is even when you and your partner finish the game, you can still play it again with someone else as someone else! I love this game and can't wait to see what the devs have planned next! No one could do it better."

The way Hazelight constantly gives you new and fun abilities keeps the gameplay experience fresh throughout the entire game.

The game never got boring not even in the slower section, the dynamic duo Cody and May always keeps the story exciting and Dr. Hakim is always there to course correct if he feels the couple is slipping.The game looks absolutely stunning and you can tell the devs have worked hard on the lighting and texturing to create such a compelling game to look at, with a spice of humor here and there and a good partner by your side It Takes Two is nothing but a laugh and a joy to play. Strongly recommend you play it with a good friend, girlfriend/boyfriend or your son/daughter.

This game is wonderful in so many ways. Starting off with the environment... the developers did a great job in adding small things that didn't even need to be in the game which made everything so different with how you play the game and the pace in which you complete the game. It also has wonderful vibrant colors that make the game look beautiful. The story is so intriguing and you just want to get more and more and you just cant get enough. I Played this game for 13 hours straight with a friend who i usually argue with on the regular and this game was able to made us calm and enjoy the wonderful views and details that the game had. The game is definitely worth it and i have to say...I have never written a review on a game before but this game left me speechless. I believe this has the potential of being the GAME OF THE YEAR.

In my experience playing this game with a friend, I enjoyed every hour that we put into the game tackling the intense story line, character development and of course the mini games that became very addictive.The games fundamental system functions wonderfully. The controls are unique, every chapter invites the players with new mechanics and features to play around with in completely wild scenarios and environments, whilst still staying true to the original integrity of the game that the players are introduced to.This game exceeds my expectations in its ability to tell an extensive love story of a falling out between parents whilst captivating the players with tools to help make the experience personalized to themselves.Apart from the core narrative and game play features of the game being its strongest point, my most enjoyable parts of the game were exploring the small little bread crumbs that the developers left behind. In every aspect of every chapter, there are these little details that the developers leave, which more often than not, are interactive features players can use that really reflect the passion and effort that went into creating this masterpiece. This ranges from the ability to break, tinker with inanimate objects, draw big penises to even being able to play fully functional pianos.It is these small things about this game that really puts the cherry on top of the masterpiece that is the cake.To finish off, I wanted to say that the developers of this game could have easily made the coop require two copies of the game, but due to the unique (free) friends pass that operates on steam and origin, only one player requires the full game to play with any other friend that chooses to download the (free!) friends pass! Thank you!I cannot stress enough how great and immersive this experience is, and I will be going back to completing the story line more times with my harem of e-girls and discovering the various addictive mini games that are cleverly hidden across each chapter.Leo you better play with me..."

Each time we would go somewhere new, i would just be wowed by the look of it and the creativity of it. It couldn't have been done better. It is also very cool how they add little details to the game like the ability to play mini games or just interact with the world around you or with your partner. (snowballs, sleds, ice skating).

In some cases these games also make it impossible to explore their beautiful worlds without being glued to your second player the whole experience, basically playing follow the leader. This game is not like that, although you need each other, you can take in the environment without having to stay huddled up, although at the time of review me and my girlfriend have only gotten into it, clearing a few bosses (Yes there are bosses, and they are cool and all have their own mechanics) I haven't felt like I had to have them on top of me to complete tasks or puzzles, more often than not, your job is to set up the other player so they can do their own task. Like bridging a gap or setting up a bomb so they can blow up the bad guys. This game has charm, strangely surreal bosses and characters, and really neat mechanics that aren't over done, honestly I could go back and replay some of the levels to get achievements and I dont feel as though it would drag on. I recommend it, but make sure you play it with someone you care about, someone you fight with time to time, and someone who you understand. Me and my girlfriend have really enjoyed this game because it felt like the mission really mattered. Although EA has put their grimey hands on it, It wasn't tainted.Its a good step guys"

I was mostly playing for the gameplay.Summary:9/10Best and most novel gameplay experience I've had in a while.If you like this game, give ""A Way Out"" a try, its by the same devs and while its not as good as this game in my opinion, its still worth trying if you enjoyed ""It Takes Two"".I look forward to what this developer releases in the future.

4574,BubbleBlep (Violet),https://steamcommunity.com/id/bubbleblep/,1,,1,13.4,April,"17,",595,0,1,"Simply a top tier game to play with a buddy or significant other. This game is a purely co-op splitscreen experience, similar to their previous game A Way Out. At its core, its a action-adventure platformer but it jumps around a lot in camera perspective and gameplay. Sometimes it even swaps genres completely and its super cool.  Super fun and varied boss fights with a fair amount of them too. The game is easy enough that new gamers can get a challenge without wanting to give up, and creative enough to keep veterans engaged the whole way through. The story is probably aimed more towards a couple (which is based around a divorce, dealing with the child and the dynamics of the parents relationship), but the gameplay puzzles, bosses, and minigames really are fun enough on its own. The supporting characters you meet through the game are absolutely wonderful too. Good writing, good humor that lands at the right times, and AMAZING voice acting in my opinion.This seriously is game of the year contention and I would easily bet on it, even 4 months into 2021. It's just that well made."

Be advised there are a couple instances of swears (a**, s***) that's about as crude as it gets.

If you're single, don't play it tbh. This really is THE couple's game. It starts off very simple to help ease unfamiliar gamers into it and then requires more and more cooperation and coordination to solve puzzles/beat enemies. My girlfriend went into this not being comfortable using third person camera controls, ESPECIALLY on a controller (having only played Left 4 Dead and Far Cry 5 on mouse/keyboard before this) but now 6 hours in and she can swing and jump and dodge all while moving the camera around to maintain line of sight.

It takes two is an almost non-stop fast paced ride through a variety packed world, both in regards to the wide range of environments and the expansive array of gameplay styles. Its gorgeous the whole way through, with a depth of detail that never fails to impress with every new segment or stage you step into. Its best to go in blind because there are so many joyous surprises, and while the requirements and price are a bit intimidating, in retrospect neither of them felt like an issue at all as the game ran well enough with adjusted settings and still looked good, and the sheer amount of variety and content was easily worth the ask and with the potential to share the experience with another friend for free, it was more than worth it.If you like coop games, if you like platformers or variety adventure style games, this is an absolute hard recommend - for anyone else, if you have even the slightest interest in the style, this is well done enough that it'll pull you in anyway."

It's insanely good.You're playing through a Pixar movie, along a great story. Gameplay is always fresh, you're playing a puzzle platformer where you swap out abilities in each new world, and it never gets stale throughout the whole game. Occassionally it swaps out for short periods of time to a completely different game, such as at one point you play a fighter game alike Streetfighter, or a top-down dungeon crawler such as Diablo. I have the attention span of an ant, but this game could keep my attention.Downsides: - The splitscreen is forced most of the time, even when playing online, so it's perfect if you have a widescreen monitor, because then you're effectively playing on a 16:9 monitor.- I wished the EA servers stopped disconnecting me.

Has a lot of unnecessary but awesome extra minigames to play against your friend throughout the storyline (around 25). The game took 12 hours start to finish but did not seem short at all.

A magnificent blend of humour and a truly compelling story mixed with ever changing and dynamic gameplay. This is quickly becoming one of my favourite games ever.I think this will have little replay value but it is more than worth the money due to the excellent story that it tells.  I have been made to feel like a genuinely bad person at one point in particular (no spoilers) but upon reflection its a ridiculous situation that other developers may have played entirely for laughs.If I had to give criticism I personally don't like the way the protagonists move in some of the cut scenes with the excessive flailing, but this may have been a stylistic choice to promote a more toy like feel."

Hazelight really did it again.
4729,The Lolmighty,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theLolmighty/,1,,1,14.4,April,"9,",715,0,1,"It's only April 9th when I'm writing this so keep that in mind, but this game is definitely in the running for my personal GotY. Like Hazelight's other somewhat well-known game, A Way Out, only 1 person has to purchase the game and another person can play for free with the friend pass. A Way Out had great storytelling and some unique takes on co-op gameplay, and It Takes Two expands on that success in every single way.It was longer than I expected -- my friend and I took 14 hours to complete with a good amount of exploration -- but I have seen others complete it a bit quicker. Even while exploring pretty freely my friend and I missed I think it was 9 mini head-to-head games, so there is more to be done than even what we did. I tend to go by the general ""$1 / hour played"" assessment of value (eg. If I pay $20 for a game, I'd prefer to get at least 20 hours of playtime out of it). But if certain components of the game are entertaining enough and I feel like the developers and creators put lots of love and care into their game, I am happy to disregard that value assessment, and that's how this game makes me feel.I enjoyed every second of this game. There are ""chapters""/areas of the game to progress through with your co-op partner, and each person has a different but complementary ability/item to make it through the area. Not once in the entire game did I feel like anything got tiring, overused, or re-hashed. The variety of environments that you go through are extremely varied and detailed, too, and part of my exploration was just checking out the textures and details of my surroundings. I played on an Xbox Elite v2 controller and the movement was very tight and felt great. We also didn't run into any bugs at all during the entire experience.There are cheesy moments from the Book of Love character, but I enjoyed those too and my friend and I and the couple people in the stream enjoyed them. I feel like I could go on about each individual area for many more paragraphs, but I don't want any of the wonder to accidentally be spoiled.I'm sure there are technically some people who didn't/wouldn't enjoy this game, but it's genuinely tough to imagine not liking it for the most part. Hazelight Studio has improved drastically with every game they've released and I can't wait to see what they develop next."

Game.If you have a significant other, even if he/she isn't into gaming at all, this is a game built entirely around an experience for a couple.This game is whimsical, fantastical, and outright special. It is like playing a Pixar movie, an ORIGINAL Pixar movie, before they were bought by Disney to churn out Cars 5 and Toy Story 8. It has mature themes but still just makes you feel like a kid reading a magical children's book.The game is relatively easy. Proficient gamers will power through it, but there is so much love and care baked into every nook and cranny of this game. Stop and smell the roses. Enjoy it.I would put this game on the shelf of ""Games-I-Wish-I-Could-Forget"" along with Subnautica, Outer Wilds, A Way Out, and others. As I said, a truly special game I'm taking 15 minutes out of my day to promote as much as I can. This game more than deserves your money.Seriously, I can't sing Hazelight and Josef Fares praises enough. If you haven't played A Way Out. Go find a buddy and play that game. If you haven't played Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons, go buy and play that too.A truly endearing adventure. And yes you can replay it and swap roles, but like that Pixar movie, after the first time it isn't quite the same."

Firstly, the friend's pass is amazing, and more companies should offer this! (only one person needs to buy the game). I honestly can’t recommend this game enough, to couples especially. It truly is a masterpiece. I and my partner thoroughly enjoyed this throughout, we had an absolute blast. There are lots of hilarious moments throughout. The characters are likeable and relatable and it does a great job at pulling on your heartstrings, then plunging you into an adventure, to being in absolute awe at the environment, without it feeling too jarring.   There is so much variety from environments, to puzzles, and game mechanics. Nothing is ever the same which keeps it fresh but also makes you excited for the following chapters. The game continually introduces new mechanics, depending on your environment, which is a breath of fresh air. Even though the game teaches you about healthy collaboration, there are still some competitive aspects to it through the “mini-games” which I LOVE.Overall, this game blew me away. It’s incredibly fun and fluid, and the boss fights are VERY cool and seriously intense (I'm looking at you, space monkey). The cut scenes throughout are definitely needed, and I really enjoyed watching the story unravel. It combines adventure, relationships and collaboration exceptionally well. 10/10 would recommend it to everyone. This is the best co-operative game I’ve ever played without a doubt. Game of the year. Thank you for this incredible experience, Hazelight."

4812,Nygma,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198138452945/,1,2,1,17.6,April,"6,",84,0,1,"Contains spoilers!!!I completed the game feeling satisfied and with the feeling that my money was well spent on a high quality product. It's hard to find such clever, enjoyable game that makes you look forward to what's going to happen next. Especially a two player co-op which is a style that has been forgotten compared to the more larger multiplayer games that dominate the market today. I can whole-heatedly say that 'ITT' is breath of fresh air that never disappoints and leaves you and your friend excited to see what Josef Fares has next inline in the co-op world of games.Graphics: 10/10 Story: 6.5/10Game-play/Mechanics: 9.5/10The visual aesthetics of this game are truly amazing, beyond expectations and heartwarming at times to see everyday objects displayed in such a unique, large scale format. It showcases the imagination of Fares and reaches into our thoughts from when we were kids, imagining what objects would like like if they were personified and seeing the world from as if we were dolls in a child's playroom. This is what the game does best, making you appreciate and identify small things which we overlook in our everyday lives. Some highlights are... being inside a snow globe; walking around a playroom and playing as if we were toys; musical instruments looking huge etc...I can say that this game excels on this level and looks at every detail and highlights the small things making the game that bit more unique. It is truly the flagship of the game.The one thing the games really lacks is a unique story and dilemma that can really thrust us into the lives of these characters. The set up is generic (parents divorcing) and the finally being the daughter runs away from home to be brought back soon-after.The voice actors and characters are very simple and 2d. They seems to behave more silly and unrealistic most of the times with saying that they want a divorce over and over again. There are moments that show otherwise such as the snow globe section in which Cody suggests staying in the Cabin together in a moment of hope for May to quickly say we should get on with the mission. Moments like this make the game more memorable and let us see what each character is thinking but is completely lack-luster in the whole game.It is a great shame and lets the game down at times as everything is there for a great story but ends up playing the same old tunes we've seen in most media. Any fans of 'A way out' (also made by Fares) can see this glaring hole and reminding us of Fares storytelling and character building. It's quite a shame that it's missing here as it's got room for some great moments and storytelling.But, I would say that this game is really intended to be a platform, puzzle game with fantastic visuals and can tell that this is what the game was going for. For that reason alone i can forgive them and see what they were trying to make as the story was the backdrop for the more important 'game-play'. It was far more lighthearted than A way out and was intended as it's a story about dolls and family-children.Apart from the outstanding visuals; Game-play seems to never disappoint with some of the greatest moments of playing and imaginative sections and items ever seen. Each area has a unique ability for the characters which vary depending on the theme. It's a great bonus and lets you and you're friend have a unique task and skill. It also encourages cooperation and teamwork which is vital to these sorts of games being enjoyable and satisfying. There are so many twists of game play that break up routine and get you to think differently; such as changing camera, format, theme, style etc... These moments often bring death and failure as it's sudden change is startling but actually makes for fun moments and enjoyment with your partner. As well as that it makes the game stand out and become unique.It's hard to really describe all of the great game-play examples so i would encourage you to play it.It takes two is a rare game to come across, especially nowadays. it gives you a sense of hope for what games can be in the future as there is great journey to be found here. I can't complement Josef Fares enough as he has created something quite special yet again. I hope to see him make more games like this because it is at heart fun, which is what games should be."

I truly fell in love with these characters over the course of my 14 hour play through. When I was a kid this is what I thought video games were gonna be like, so much creativity, fun, style and unique charm within this seemingly small package. It's like a playable Pixar movie. Genuinely so much fun. Every level is its own little game with new mechanics, 1v1 minigames, areas and challenges. The story; although dealing with some serious stuff, is lighthearted and wholesome while also not being afraid to take itself more seriously from time to time. The dynamic chemistry between May and Cody is very believable and well written too. Really did not expect this much out of this but was extremely pleased with it.

For some reason it felt like there was no marketing for the game at all...? I guess that was a good thing, since there was no hype (hence no disappointments), and whatever they saved must have gone into the creators' budget.Really am enjoying playing it with my partner. Some of the boss battles are a little tricky, especially for her as she doesn't play games much. But they're very doable with a little trial and error. Some areas have a bit ""sluggish"" controls, but I see that it was probably by design to mimic the ""difficulty"" of controlling, for example, vacuum tubes that are blowing air, or flying an underpants plane.Overall, great lighthearted co-op puzzle platformer with some seriously creative level designs. Quite the gem for your game collection! I'd say wait for sale, but this studio deserves the full price purchase for their creativity!P.S. Game is especially great on an ultrawide monitor because both players get a little more screen."

I played through this in 11 hours with my best friend. We basically couldn't stop playing for longer than a few hours because it got us so hooked with all its mechanics and features. The story is moving and relatively interesting but what really gets me are the constantly new, never-ending abilities you get in each level. I recommend this to anyone that has a buddy to play and wants to basically have fun in any way, shape or form. It's worth every penny because that second player doesn't have to pay. I would have payed 60$ for this if I knew how good it was."

If I told you you could play Game of the Year 2021 in April, would you believe me?For me, where this game really shines is in so much of what they did in an effort to keep the experience fresh. The game actually has a very good, lengthy playtime, but even more impressive is that they're aware of how an experience like this can quickly grow stale over time, and they're just... on top of it. The. Whole. Time. Every single time you feel like you're getting the gist of things, or that you've done a certain thing enough times that it would become annoying and repetitive if you were to do it again, the game says ""yeah, I know, and that's why we're doing something completely different starting right now."" It is just absolutely masterfully paced.And I don't just mean that the levels themselves are compartmentalized nicely--while they are, it's so much more than that. This game is essentially a mish-mash of video game history--a sampling platter of all of the best things video games have done for us over the years from classic mechanics that are elevated and tested in new ways, to video game genre changes throughout every level throughout the entire game. One minute, you feel like you're playing a Ratchet and Clank game. The next? You're in an on-rails-shooter. The next? You're playing Street Fighter. The next? An ARPG. etc. The list just goes on and on and on as far as what this game does to keep you engaged and entertained.Without question this is the best 2-player coop game ever made. Quite possibly the best gaming experience I've ever had as well. Do not sleep on this game.Can we talk about the price as well? $40? AND THE OTHER PERSON PLAYS FOR FREE? YOU CAN GET THIS EXPERIENCE FOR $20 EACH WITH A FRIEND? Literally unreal, and quite possibly the biggest bang for your buck you're going to get for a very, very long time."

You really feel like these characters grow and develop over the game, and Dr. Hakim is beyond perfect - COLLABORATION!!!!- Gameplay. Puzzles ranged from simple to a bit tricky, and some fights took even a puzzle game veteran like me some time to work out. Platforming was by-and-large good, with some dodgy camera angles making it more difficult than it needed to be. I was always amazed by the amount of different game genres that were really cleanly woven into the standard run-of-the-mill puzzle/platformer. I won't spoil it but there were some moments I almost died laughing about how the hell they fit that in there.- Visuals and Art Style. Graphics are gorgeous and really perfect for the style of game, and the story itself, it wasnt too jarring when looking at the real life family and the dolls side by side which is impressive.- Game time. Solid 10 hours of game time, we took around 12-13 hours to complete but we took our time with some awesome minigames.What wasn't so great:- Some minigames felt underwhelming, and so we only played them once and moved on.- There were some visual issues when playing online when looking at my partners character. It was fine on theirs, but on mine the character glitched around when jumping on moving platforms. I assume this was some kind of lag, but we were playing in the same room :P______________________________________________Overall:Fantastic game, would highly recommend to anyone looking to play a game with a friend or their significant other.9.5/10"

The mini games that both people could play against each other was fantastic and they are all hidden across the entire game and levels.

Safe to say, they absolutely knocked it out of the park. This game has so much personality and charm. I couldn't stop smiling the entire time I was playing it. The visuals are breathtaking, the gameplay is constantly engaging with new mechanics on each level and the puzzles are fun as well! The story has good pacing and the voice acting really brings it all to life. Throughout the game you can slowly see May and Cody's relationship developing as they begin to understand one another more. There's funny moments, heartfelt ones and anything else between. Similar to A Way Out, there's fun little challenges for you and your co-op buddy to compete against too, which I feel is now a staple of Hazelight's design (which I abslutely love). It provides a nice pause between moments and brings forth it's own ones!So... Yeah. This game is fantastic and you won't be disappointed."

Every new places you visit brings new mechanics so the game does not feel repetitive at all. The game runs well and the graphics are really good. All the little details and easter eggs they added really completes the look of the game. I was a big fan of Hazelight previous game ( A Way Out ) and hoped this games would be at least as good.

Why? 1.: Changing Mechanics Mechanics are changing rapidly but keep intuitively simple. Sometimes you have a certain movement or ability only for a few minutes. Then, before you can grow tired of them, they are removed entirely. Never played a game like this before. 2.: Pure playtimeUsually games reuse mechanics over and over to get most playtime out of it. This can be tiresome. Here you are presented with the total opposite. The whole journey feels fresh and every moment exciting and we were always curious on how the game would suprise us next. 3. Great pricing 14h highest quality playtime for 2 Players for 40€(as the 2nd Player can play for free -> 20€ per Person). Modern games would have reused more mechanics and stretched gameplay to make you pay 30€ with 3 DLCs worth 15€ each and that for 1 Player only. Here you get highest bang for your buck. I would really love other companies to adapt that concept. 4. StoryIt is a romantic comedy. You might like parts of it, you might dislike others. My girlfriend enjoyed the whole story. The focused topics give oportunity to reflect and even grow as a person/couple. (Not taking things for granted) 5. WorldbuildingDamn those worlds look gorgeous! In every corner is something you can find, interact and have fun with. You really have to love your work to make it look that way. Totally stunning. What I don't like: -EA and mandatory Origin Account (-0.1 points)-Forced to harm poor things (-0.1 points)TLDR: Buy it and be happy you did so!"

There are a lot of hidden secrets and mini Easter eggs to look for which are really satisfying after completing. I forgot to talk about the 'mini-games' the competitive aspect of it makes you focused on the game and really makes you want to beat the other person you're playing with and gives you a good laugh out of it.

5018,Backyard Lawnmower,https://steamcommunity.com/id/macstar95/,1,,1,21.2,March,"29,",306,0,1,"This is by far, one of the best coop platforming experience I have taken part of. For some context: I LOVE me some platforming games. Portal, DK Country, Mario Maker on Switch, CupHead and more. Some of the great COOP platformers. IMO, this game is up there with all of them. YES, up there will Portal and DK Country.Now let me get into the game play.This game is not just coop integrated. It has been built from the ground up for a pure coop experience. Every challenge that you come across, will require the work of your partner and yourself to succeed. As you progress through the story, you are dropped into different ""Zones"". Each zone will have a different theme, set of challenges, it's own collectibles, puzzles and MECHANICS. (I use the term collectible lightly, as I think it's mainly achievement hunting, which is actually very enjoyable in this game) You have to use the new set of mechanics that has been given to you, to get through the zone. Once through, you will then go into a new zone, beating the zone with a different set of stuff listed above. That is essentially how you progress. What I Love: Practically everything -- seriously. - Animation and Voice Acting is nostalgic and so good. - The feel or ""vibe"" is absolutely fantastic. The game has a way of pulling your nostalgic strings, making you    feel like a kid again. Combining different inspirations...even from Shrek on PS2...YES there are similarities. - Challenges/Puzzles are interesting but fairly easy, they utilize the new ""zone"" mechanics and are great fun- Characters, you fall in love with. Whilst not a super in depth story, the main theme and moral of this story    will force you to not only love the in game character, but the IRL character you're playing with.  ;)- Story is VERY interesting imo (divorce and relationship building) -- for some context I am a single 25 y/old.    It talks about a heavy topic in a way that is quite beautiful. Even for someone who is nervous to commit to    a relationship, it shows that these things require work and the feelings we have for each other are    manageable. What I dislike: Not much- Exploration is lacking. While there are some hidden things to find in this game, secrets and collectibles are a    MUST in platforming and unless I'm bad, I can't find either of them. (I'm most likely bad)- Collectibles are missing from the game. It feels like something that is easily admissible, however the more I    progress, the more I miss the ability to explore and find a fake ""useless"" in game collectible. - Sprint forces you to roll first before sprinting. This isn't a huge problem and it might have been a ""feature"",    however I find that it interrupts flow and could make speed running a greater challenge. Final thoughts...the fact that I haven't even brought up one of the ""best"" selling points of this game is a testimony to how great it is. Only one person needs to purchase this game to play through with a friend, not just on screen share. But actually downloading and joining the game for a full play through. I would have bought it for a buddy if needed.Buy this game and give it a go, you will not regret it."

Having accidentally stumbled upon this game, I have to completely agree with the majority of reviews on steam. This game is great fun, with a variety of little puzzles that make you work together to achieve your goals while changing up the playing style regularly. The story itself is quite unique and definitely has us enthralled (still playing it through for the first time).For us this is another rare excellent find and I would encourage anyone who has a friend they live with, who's into games, to check this one out. Great couples game!"

A decent story, funny and more fleshed out characters. Also better graphics and game mechanics. Playing with my non gamer partner and still make it through (it just takes her more tries) but its  easy and forgiving enough that less coordinated ppl can play too. Hopefully she never sees this, I might get a slap if she does. Mini games were a great addition. Whack a mole best one thus far. But we both enjoy it and I really wish they made more games like this. Definitely worth picking up. Great work Devs."

5120,Gamer Gaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mlgpr0l33th4x/,1,,1,12.6,April,"7,",466,0,1,"It Takes Two is larger-than-life director Josef Fares' third outing, taking the co-op-focused adventure engine of his previous game, A Way Out, but ditching the po-faced action movie pretensions that made it unintentionally funny, in favour of hyperactive fantasy spectacle that players can easily engage with on the same emotional wavelength. As before, anyone can download It Takes Two for free, and play it with anyone who buys the full game and invites them.The game starts with the central duo, May and Cody, mentioning their upcoming divorce during an argument. Unfortunately, their daughter witnesses the whole thing, and her sadness kick-starts the ""magical 12-hour couples' therapy adventure"" stage, which will be familiar to anyone who has undergone divorce proceedings before. May and Cody spend most of the game as strange little voodoo dolls their daughter made, solving puzzles and fighting household objects while searching for a way back to their world. They're frankly bullied into this by a magical Hispanic marriage guidance book called Doctor Hakim, who won't leave them in peace until their relationship is fixed. His design and accent will be seared into your mind if you've seen the trailer, but I didn't find him quite as funny and engaging as the trailer promised. In fact, he can't outshine Josef Fares himself, who for our money would have been the best character for this role.May and Cody themselves are difficult characters to write, caught between being disillusioned former lovers and stand-ins for the presumably-friendly players. The writers resolve this by making them readily cooperative throughout, taking a little time to bicker during cutscenes, but working towards ""destructive"" objectives in the hope of just returning home quickly, before Hakim pushes them into more ""constructive"" activities that might actually repair their relationship. The drama peaks at an expertly executed, unbearable scene halfway through, even more powerful than A Way Out's grand twist. From there it's a fairly uncomplicated journey down to a simple but heartwarming ending, but the excellent art and gameplay pulled us all the way to the end even when the story didn't.May and Cody are likeable enough characters but It Takes Two will really be remembered for its level design. It's a whirlwind tour of beautiful, fun environments, including a perilous giant workshop, a grand cardboard fortress and a time-twisting clock tower. In every area you can expect some combination of chase sequences (Cody is pretty much always driving, if you like that), combat (with plenty of fun bosses), rail-grind sections, platforming sections, QTEs, well-hinted puzzles, 1v1 minigames, Easter eggs and smaller attractions where you can have a little break. There's often a section where gameplay will shift in reference to another game, but the default is acrobatic third-person platforming that heavily reminded us of NieR: Automata (by no means a complaint).Each location is a magical version of some area of May and Cody's home, so it holds some significance to their lives, though if you're expecting deep environmental storytelling you won't quite get that, as the characters tend to exposit the meaning behind everything. This is a good choice really, as you have two cameras on screen and are communicating with your partner, so we always got what was going on even when our attention was a bit divided.  Every location comes with its own pair of complementary abilities, which are fun enough to use for the game to be worth replaying later from the other character's point of view. You could make whole games out of each environment and pair of abilities, but I presume Fares gets bored and wants to move on every 90 minutes, so everything changes up again. The levels and abilities are so varied, and often so exotic that we weren't sure whether the artists or the programmers had more work to do, but the game is visually gorgeous and technically brilliant from start to finish.This is the kind of game you'd want to play with a friend or loved one, and it's likely one of you won't be a gamer. The game is relaxed and forgiving enough for non-gamers, though not a good first game - from the start, it assumes some gaming competency which might be best acquired without the pressure of your partner waiting for you to get your act together. The awkward design of some bosses and action sequences had us wipe out a few times even though we're pretty experienced, weakening some of the spectacle, but at least you can be sure you'll be challenged at points. It's also not for young children, despite looking like a Pixar movie.It's rare for EA to invest in something with this much heart; this much creativity; this pricing scheme. This triumph for Hazelight Studios gives me the impression that some part of EA is still motivated by games, not just money - surely if it can do that, it's worth checking out. Our average score for this game was 95%."

While the game looked fine, could this silly-looking co-op game really be a GOTY contender amidst the rest of the 2021 games? Well I'm here to say that the answer is a resounding YES. It Takes Two is one of the most creative, imaginative, and fun games I've played in recent memoryThe game really  what makes a good co-op game special and it caters it's entire experience to trying out as many fun and wild mechanics you could do with a co-op game. It Takes Two could not function as a single-player game nor with 4 players; the game says it takes two and .Luckily, this game literally never gets boring, it changes the structure of the gameplay every 30 minutes and yet somehow never feels rushed or exhausting to go through. It's always pushing the bar with how creative it can get with it's otherwise mundane settings and I can just tell so much love and care went into the game. I wish more games of this size were able to express themselves so openly and for that It Takes Two must be applauded."

(at least for me) play with a friend for free (friend pass) didn't work due to origins launcher popping up whenever you launch the game/accept the friend invite to play with them and saying ""You don't own the game"" despite me downloading it due to said Friend Pass thingy, had to buy (got gifted the game from the very same friend) and even then had to download it again (yeah the friend pass version is different than the normal version or so steam/origins say) and even then there was some trouble playing together.

I bought this game for console over a year ago, and have beat it four times since, each time with the same person. The game's replayability is unparalleled, with it offering some of the most engaging gameplay I have seen in a long time. This isn't even bringing up the cooperation required for the game, with every level introducing unique abilities, which will always work in tandem with your partner's abilities, making for one of the most fun experiences I've had on a game in a long while. All of this does not even bring up the story, which is genuinely one of my favorite stories told by a game in a long while. I'll be honest, even on my fourth playthrough, I still tear up at parts of it. To add onto this already very long list of pros, only one person has to own the game for both people to be able to play it, using the free friend pass. Also, it doesn't matter who you play this with. Romantic partner, friend, acquaintance, sworn enemy, it's still extremely fun.

Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve."

However.. the story felt lacking, both my husband and I did not like the parents. Im not sure who wrote their lines, but I think the story could have 100% been worked on better, I feel that's where it is lacking and falling short personally. (Of course at the end we did like them more as they grew to be more compassionate and have empathy.)BIG WARNING THERE ARE SPIDERS! I have Arachnophobia. I basically silently cried and disassociated the entire duration of that part and then had to take a break from the game.I do highly recommend this!

Gameplay is solid, and utilises the co-op element perfectly. The game is also gorgeous, and its environments suck you in and you lose yourself in this little world. The characters are lovable, and the development is great. The story is brilliant. It's not fighting for world peace. It's not a grand intergalactic conflict where the universe hangs in the balance. And yet, the stakes feel higher than all that, and in the end, maybe they are. Sometimes the small things are infinitely more important than the big."

Everything in the game is great, you can also have lots of fun while playing the game with your friend except when the crazy talking book ""Doctor Hakim"" appears out of thin air, that book is just a crazy Spanish, Portugal and Mexican guy that is always talking about love or how to fix your relationship with your wife. which is annoying. Sometimes I think that the crazy talking book is the magical book from Harry potter. Anyways the game is worth buying. #JusticeForTheElephantCutie"

Unlike A Way Out, the game as great, varied gameplay that takes more cooperation to get through than pressing E at the same time. The minigames were also all quite fun to play against each other in. I'd say my favorite minigames where in the snow globe section. The only negative thing is that sometimes I felt like the abilities each character got were not equally as fun to use but this is a minor issue considering this is mostly a puzzle game.

Игра проходится на удивление не быстро, что очень похвально, особенно если никуда не спешить, пытаясь найти все мини-игры и позалипать в них тоже некоторое время, а в игре, как мне кажется, найдется залипательная мини игра для каждого. Единственное что мне не хватило, так это ""любознательных"" ачивок, т.е. бегая по локации с часами сломать все часы и это например ачивка какая-то или же игрок просто наслаждается локацией, исследует её, так дайте таким игрокам пасхалочки, да, в игре они есть, но слишком мало, когда локации такие интересные :)Вернусь к игре через какое-то время и пройду сноваОценка: 10 из 10"

More familiar mechanics from other game genres such as shooters and RPGs are also present which was fun to experience as a long-time gamer. The game is fairly challenging, but all of it can be overcome with teamwork. Teamwork is the central theme of the game, and it is honestly impressive how well it is integrated into the core gameplay. Story-wise, the game follows a fairly linear plot about a couple trying to fix their marriage while being guided by the iconic Dr. Hakim. It is cute and well-written, and I thoroughly enjoyed playing through it. The voice acting is phenomenal, and there is always a good amount of friendly humor present at every level and cutscene. I played this game with my partner who is fairly new to gaming, and although they often made mistakes, the game was relatively forgiving and provided us with frequent checkpoints. This game is great for couples or friends who are looking for something to do together for about 10 hours. I highly recommend it for everyone - even people who don't game normally; everyone will have a good time with It Takes Two. Just remember... COLLABORATION!"

She used to despise video games - and still does, to some extent. However, she had only high praises to sing about this one after we were done. She was very impressed. The writing is witty and engaging. The world building is unique without rev-inventing the wheel. The gameplay constantly stays fresh through different powers being awarded to the heroes as they cross from one world to the next. We have also personally liked the theme. The ""easy love"" culture has ravaged the West, leaving many children crying in the shambles of its precarious edifice. It is good to remind people that love, marriage, is like most virtues or goods in life, it needs careful maintenance, a willingness to grow and learn, the desire to fix it when it breaks. Throwing it away because the other is ""too difficult,"" ""I have found someone I love more,"" et cetera is a cowardly and ultimately lazy way to deal with this. It is the vice of our modern age: if it doesn't work anymore, do not fix it, throw it away. And, believe me, my wife and I are no perfect examples. We do talk from experience here. So congratulations on the devs for communicating some universal truths which will no doubt be appreciated by many. This is without a doubt one of the best video games I have played."

Brought me back to playing the original Spyro games when i was a kid. I rarely right reviews and wanted to for this game.My wife and I rarely plays games together and we couldn't stop with this game. Really love that we only needed to buy one license to play online, friend pass is used for your partner, and could even local co-op via split screen which is rare these days.Gameplay is great, its not really difficult but challenging in a fun way. The jumping around for dear life yelling at your partner to JUST PUSH THE BUTTON kind of way. laughing at your failure... and laughing again when you finally get it right. It feels rewarding to understand and solve the puzzles, but also has fun things to interact with along the way. So the game really encourages you to explore the level.On that, the level are just gorgeous. If you just go to solve each puzzle you are missing out. There is a snow level, no spoilers, where you can literally just skate around, throw snowballs at each other and participate in other winter activities. Has no impact on the game, just fun to mes with.. and throw a snowball at your wife then pretend a penguin did it till on the 4th time she realizes it was you. Each level has its own little story, a story that you overly excited nephew would say ""happened to them today"" when they have literally been in eyesight of you all day. You will want to explore everything and interact with it just to see what happens.Overall it was a great experience and I really hope they make a second game to this or another game using the same formula."

The sheer amount of content, unique puzzles, beautiful environment, lovely music, and the many, MANY minigames for you to face-off with your game buddy. Believe me when I say you won't regret buying this. You can read on for my amateur take on It Takes Two!The most significant part of the game for me was  the mechanics you could play and try out! I was continually impressed by just how creative they were. It is literally different in every chapter, together with the puzzles that do not get boring. Even as I try to encapsulate and convey all of them into this review, I have difficulty doing so. Its best to experience them yourself! Another greatly appealing part of It Takes Two is that you get to play multiple games within one game! Like around 10 for the price of 1. There's so much heart put into that, and I feel that it really sets It Takes Two apart from the rest. A special mention to the environments: I really love the effort that Hazelight put into this!! There's so much to see and explore, all the little tidbits that you can activate; you might actually spend more time doing that than progressing the game :) I give hugee props to the team for making the game so beautiful.One gripe I had though, was the story. I admit, I did find myself a little stumped with it. I understand that Hazelight first comes up with the mechanics, before moulding the story around it, but I did get a bit confused how simply navigating something together fostered a closer relationship! Cody and May don't talk much to each other, other than some compliments and remarks. Are we supposed to fill that in ourselves? Hmm, this is especially when the initial issues that resulted in the divorce weren't cleared up and communicated away. Dr Hakim has a point about collaboration, but I don't know, I feel that communication should be a tenet as welll? More exposition and closure on their relationship could be provided in a cutscene. ALSO, if their doll selves could be better linked with their real selves, that'd be great. Cody and May can consider it just a fever dream but damn, talk about it.However, I suppose it would have been awkward for friends, siblings or family members playing for Cody and May's relationship fixed so obviously, so I kind of understand. At least their dialogue shed some light on their issues! That aside, 11/10 game.Other things:Especially loved the end scene with ""Hold Y"", felt like a bit of a call back to A Way Out's final scene as well! Though the contexts are very different.Music-wise, not sure if I caught part of ""River"" OST from A Way Out? It was very distinct! The two games share the same composer after all (Gustaf Grefberg)Josef Fares was the mocap actor for Dr. Hakim; everytime you see Dr Hakim shake his hips, its Josef.Thank you Hazelight for producing this masterpiece. Again, can't recommend this enough. When It Takes Two gets its awards, they are 100% deserved! <3"

And just when you mastered , the chapter is over and other gadgets are already waiting for you. But sometimes you just wished you could've used them just a little longer.The most important thing to cite, however, are the graphics. The landscapes, which range from green grass and blooming flowers over a snowy winter-wonderland up to a tree filled with militant squirrels, are animated so perfectly, you sometimes just sit there and look at the view, taking some epic screenshots.

I'm usually not a fan of obligatory driving sections in game that otherwise have nothing to do with driving, but even those parts didn't make me want to pull my hair out.> Great art and design.> Each player has a unique role in each chapter, so it truly takes two.> Lots of fun Easter eggs and small details to make the world come alive.> Extremely easy. The puzzles themselves aren't difficult, and there are no consequences to dying.> The vertical split screen can be limiting sometimes.> You have to have an Origin account.>  (Okay, this one isn't really a con about the game. Just an oof.)The entire game is well thought out and a lot of fun. One of the best coop games out there. Although this is the kind of game you only have to go through once (no alternate paths, etc. to explore and all the achievements can be done in one playthrough if you're a completionist), it really does take two."

Beautifully animated. Touching story. Surprisingly long play-time for it's concept and quality. Enough hidden things to make exploring always interesting. Oh, and NO MICRO-TRANSACTIONS?!? 100% worth it, even at a high price. Now the only problem is i am waiting for the other shoe to drop and EA to return to normal form with the next game."

The story is tragic, heartwarming and fun all at once, the gameplay is varied and stays fresh with new mechanics being constantly introduced and given enough time to be fleshed out without overstaying their welcome and the game looks runs exceptionally well. Being able to play online co-op even if only one player owns the game is just the icing on the cake that makes it hard to believe that this is even an EA published game.The only negatives I can think of are that you need origin to play the game and that when you're throwing as much ♥♥♥♥ at the wall as this game does not all of it will stick; even considering that, enough of it does stick for this not to be a real problem and the platform you play this game on is more of a mild inconvenience than a legitimate problem.I don't have much to say to be honest, just play this game, it's one of the greatest games I have ever played."

I only had one time a bug where I couldn't move but with a reset to the checkpoint did fixed it. The end was so good that it gave me goosebumps and I would want to play this game multiple times.Really well done to the developer and I hope I find more games like this in the future.

The gameplay is wonderful and responsive, with a lot of variety sprinkled throughout the entire game (though I recommend controllers for both players, as some small segments are tedious on mouse/keyboard).

5438,Weeabamboozled,https://steamcommunity.com/id/weeabamboozled/,1,,1,9.7,May,"31,",380,0,1,"My overall score for this game is a 4.6/5 I highly recommend it!!!Review Below:Thoughts:Overall coming into this game, I expected it to be kind of boring as it looked really goofy from the preview pictures. I would highly recommend this game for lovers and the best of friends to have as much as much fun as I did with my friend. I would in fact replay this game as Cody as through my first run I played as May. At first the main characters were obnoxious but in time you started to grow more and more attached to them. They correctly divided the game between its graphics, story, character development and minigames/puzzles. Graphics: (5/5)Not much to comment about how beautiful this game is in Ultra settings. There are a good number of portions in the game where you're able to sit back and enjoy the scenery such as the Clocktower and the Snow globe areas.Gameplay: (4.5)The gameplay was fantastic, for the most part of it. It had a lot of creativity in the mechanics of itself. You felt as you were playing completely different games at certain points in time which were all enjoyable. They had stressful situations as well as peaceful puzzle solving portions that had you rely on one another while completing the game. Each portion of the game was unique and well thought out. With this game I feel it is separated into sections or areas and within each area it has a certain amount of clear time with its objectives. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed that as we got closer to the end of the game that the areas were taking much less time to complete. Greenhouse and Musical area for example. That and a mixture of the hard control scheme for certain portions that lead to pointless deaths knock off a tiny bit of its score.Story: (4/5) Story was a bit basic, but the game-play kept it amusing. At first you were loathing the main characters and the book but as time progressed you start to invest into the characters keeping you focused on what is happening. Some funny moments such as how the daughter can clearly see that May is knocked out but acts as if she can hear her. Maybe I would have positioned Cody's body to be asleep laying the desk it would have made more sense. (*Cough* just makes him look like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ignoring his daughter sat up at his desk) Another issue with this story is how I was able to predict the ending after we got to the Squirrel portion of the game however was still thoroughly enjoying my time getting to the ending.Completion Time: (5/5)Wow for only $40 you get 9.5 hours. I was shocked by how much time we were playing the game for. No, we did not rush the finish line and no we did not take our time. However, we thoroughly enjoyed the mini games versing one another probably making up an hour of the game time. Boss fights only took about 20-30m in each area. Keep in mind this is how long my friend and I took but I probably would be willing to redo the story as Cody instead of May practically doubling our time, sure it would take a little less time. I would estimate 15 hours of playtime if you play both characters.Gave me enough laughs, sad moments and connected my friend and I to the characters having us pity them or calling them ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at points ha-ha.My overall score for this game is a 4.6/5 I highly recommend it!!!"

Super happy with the outcome.

5455,SpodeAce,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spode/,1,,1,20.6,May,"9,","1,064",0,1,"It's rare to find split-screen games these days, but this is a fantastic example of not only that, but as a game overall. The premise is ridiculous enough that it allows them to really flex some creative muscle and stops you from saying ""that's not particularly realistic"" and simply embrace the fact you are rolling around as a potato killing a plant that is spewing purple goop at you.The visuals are fantastic and it certainly taxed my machine but it was well worth it.I really enjoyed the fact that each section of the game was very different, right down to the way you interact with the world, with different weapons and kinds of puzzles to solve. It never felt stale and you were always excited when you were given a new toy to play with. At the core, the game is a 3D platformer and there are sections that require some tight timings and to make hard jumps. My partner suffered with these as she's not a regular gamer and found it a little stressful. In most cases, I could grab her controller and do it for her - but there were one or two where you also needed to keep in sync and those were particularly hard. I don't really see this as a failing of the game, but rather of my partner :P I guess it might have been nice to have had the option to skip a section if you've failed it more than a few times.As others have eluded to - there is a scene that is a little disturbing killing a character that really didn't deserve it, but I didn't find this any more upsetting that the overall topic of children suffering at the hand of divorce.From a replay perspective, I would be keen to play again as an alternative character, so if you take that into account you're looking at around 40 hours of play-time. Unless you get particularly enamoured by one of the (many) mini-games.The game does have Internet play as well, but I did not test this and judging by some of the negative reviews - I would not count on this working as it is done via EA's Origin. Overall, it would make my top 10 of co-op couch games and well worth taking a look."

5458,TheMagneticSeal,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198857911933/,1,,1,14.1,May,"4,",88,0,1,"10/10. One of the greatest games I've played in recent years, I played through the whole thing with my girlfriend and we both had an absolute blast for the roughly 12hr story and then even went back after completion to pick up the extra few competitive mini-games we missed.Visuals - The game is gorgeous from start to finish, the art direction, character designs, set pieces, world building, it's all impeccable and really helps the player immerse them self into the world. Vibrant colours and emotive facial expressions really sell the ""Pixar"" feeling to this game and it runs buttery smooth on High graphics settings on my RTX 2060 super with little to no frame dips.Plot - The story is really sweet and heart-warming, centering around a couple on the brink of divorce that are shrunk down to toys and must slowly restore their lost love throughout their epic quest to get back to their daughter. Along the way, little snippets of dialogue, items from their past and a... book of love (trust me it makes sense) remind them of what they once had and what they would miss if they were to divorce.Gameplay - Gameplay is NEVER stale, each new area gives a new ability or game mechanic to each of the playable characters such as the ability to manipulate time, to shrink and grow, or even create a clone of yourself. These abilities often pair together in unique and creative ways, creating the necessity for teamwork, not only strengthening the bond between you and your partner of choice, but the main characters too. Each new mechanic and item is fresh and engaging and never outstays it's welcome but is also fleshed out enough that it doesn't feel novel and gimicky. Additionally, along your journey there are fun little competitive minigames to be found. These range from chess, to whack-a-mole, even to guitar-hero style button pressing rhythm games which serve as a nice break from the main story and allow you and your partner to take a break from working together and go head-to-head! (These are particularly entertaining if you and your partner are quite competitive, which we most definitely are XD) Also it should be noted that although my girlfriend and I are rather experienced in gaming; the puzzling and platforming (while still being very engaging) never gets too difficult and should you get stuck there are pop-up hints if the game sees you spending a little too long on a particular section, making this game suitable for any age in my opinion!I could keep typing forever singing this games praises and I simply cannot recommend it enough. But the bottom line is that the magic of this game is experiencing it for yourself and me going on for any longer would only spoil and thus detract from your experience. So i urge you, buy this game, grab a loved one and just enjoy this absolute work of art together!"

Not only is this game very enjoyable to replay a second time because your experience is different depending on if you play Cody or May, but it also has minigames mixed in between the gameplay that you can always revisit later! The game might be a bit pricey at 40 euros but if you can split the money with a friend it's 100% worth your money! It's a pretty short game with around 10 hours of gameplay but if you decide to replay it while swapping characters you get your money out of it for sure!It's pretty refreshing to see all sorts of easter eggs and playstyles/genres mixed in between the game. You never expect what will happen next or what game styles are waiting for you. The game never gets boring and my friend and I finished the first play-through in 4 sessions spread over 3 days.I would rate this game 9/10 with the high price and short duration of the game taking away 1 point.

The graphic is very accurate in the details in each level and sometimes it's just a shame to rush into a zone without taking a good look to appreciate the efforts made by the devs. Plus you'll have a new power in every zone you'll enter which is cool. You could also try to beat the game playing with the other character once you've done with one of them, just to experience the other perspective and try some ""new"" powers.I also think the longevity of the game is just right, not too short and not too long.The cutscenes with the book, Hakim, are a bit annoying sometimes, but that's just for my taste. You may appreciate them. Still I hope I can beat his ass up at some point haha.I'll say this game is a must if you liked ""A way out"" and if you like puzzle games to play with a friend."

It takes two grounds everything as a 3D platformer (don't expect mario odyssey levels of controls here, but still very good) with different levels giving you different abilities depending on which character you are and what part of the level you're inIf you're playing this with someone who can operate a mouse and keyboard and can tell some funny jokes, you're in for 10+ hours of pure, unfiltered fun. Why can't more games be like this? this game is fun. why aren't more games just fun. I'm sure everyone's heard someone justifying a bad game by saying ""well it's fun with friends"" this is basically that but this game is actually fun, and you're playing it with a friend! this game is fun and hilarious.I love this game, I can't wait to see what Joseph Fares and Hazelight come out with nextAlso, Dr. Hakim one of the funniest characters in any game"

Playing this one currently with my Girlfriend and I'm awestruck by the amount of variety, original design, and the overall experience of it all!- characters are written really well and the acting is stellar, the characters feel so real in their expression & reactions to things going on around them- this game constantly changes things up at every major point, never keeping the gameplay feeling stale. Its constantly introducing a new cooperative mechanic in a section- each section of the game feels like an exciting roller coaster, each full of their own excitement while still being sincere to the overall story- It feels like a disney-esque adventure, full of love & passion into the art style. Whether its trying to stay realistic or imaginary, it nails the cross between realism and exaggerated art styles- the coop netcode works fantastic and we have only had to deal with one single disconnect in the last several hours of playing. We're playing across the Atlantic, and it still holds up great with nearly no latency in-between!- This game knows how to pull at your heart strings in one moment, while giving you a breath-taking adventure in the next without feeling jarring or too sudden. The game's pace is well-designed!Aside from split-screen coop, this game is miles different than their previous game 'A Way Out,' but it feels absolutely incredible - dare I say better? 'A Way Out' was a revolutionary way to tell a realistic story, but 'It Takes Two' is full of heart, super creative, and is a breath-taking adventure into the imaginary! I don't remember the last time I played a game with this much creativity before! This game is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to finish it soon!(Also, as stated in previous comments, you don't need to have both people buy the game - only one needs to buy it, and the other one downloads a Friends Pass to play for free with a Coop buddy. Highly recommend playing it with a loved-one!)"

We've been clocking sixteen hours over two days into this game and we have always looked forward to the next part or picking it up again when we took a break from playing. There's tons of mini-games to explore and while none of them are genius or unique, they bring back fond memories of your childhood or maybe are games that you've always wanted to play, but didn't. There's lots of game references in this as well and while the story might not be the most inspired, it is inspir. We haven't found any real bugs, just one moment where one of us slid under an obstacle, but that was easily resolved. This is something for feeling good with your friend or significant other. We'll definitely play this again sometime. 10/10"

The puzzles and the environments that contain them are thoughtfully made and creatively rendered, and new concepts and mechanics are constantly introduced before you can tire of the previous ones. The game truly makes it an absolute joy to cooperate with and compete against your partner - there is simply no shortage of positive things I can say about it, and it is in my view absolutely worth the somewhat intimidating $40 price tag, especially since it's really only $20 per person. The only caveat I would mention is that the vast majority of this game is played in split screen, whether you play local or network co-op. I don't personally think this is a detriment since it is relevant to the fundamental design of the puzzles, but this may still be a turn-off to some."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

However,  evokes ever-so-relatable relationship nuances by not shoving them in your face. Rather, it conveys some of the deep topics (egoism, cognitive biases, parentship, relationship dnamics, value projections, etc.) for those who are keen on details. However simple, the narrative managed to keep us on the edge of our seats by being amusing whilst also being realistic and serious when it should have been. Hence, Josef Fares and cool people at Hazelight Studios successfuly made a simple story with a strong message that gets stronger as you keep scratch the surface. Additionally, the cinematic presence of Fares' work is noticeable and immersive. However, where  shines the most is .Calling the gameplay innovative may be up for discussion for some since each chapter lends gameplay mechanics from a different video game genre. However, I am yet to find a video game with such a smooth and reasonable way of continuous mode switching that simply makes sense. When you add that upon the already amazing and astonishing level design that immerses you completely into the game world and evokes the right amount of nostalgia, you have a recipe for the GOTY.Based on these multi-genre mechanics,  steps it up by subtly breaking the fourth wall with minor adjustments -- making you the core of its gameplay and storyline itself. After we finished the game, both my girlfriend and I were left with hearwarming feeling and tears of joy. Moreover,   managed to break the usual stigma of video games as something one would do just to have fun without chiming a single brain cell on real-life issues.  Additionally, I found that she would kick ass in Diablo, but could not do any platforming for the life of her! It's been some time since I last felt this good about playing a cooperative game.The very emotional journey and experience encapsulated in the past two paragraphs witness how innovative, daring, and worth every damn penny  is. You can feel the devotiongame developers were trying to transmit upon their player base by making a game that has a purpose higer than sheer entertainment.A true spit in the face of today's industry stained by money-hungry corpos!"

Given all the pop culture references too, this game rewards you very well for paying attention to things you can explore, ultimately making playing this with a loved one very fun! Overall, this is a solid 10/10 for me, my ONLY constructive point of feedback, is some of the mini games don't feel as responsive as they should, but even so, the ones that work well, work REALLY well."

Designed for Coop experience would give it extra points for me, but level design, story, game mechanics, and volume of content, are all potentially the best I've seen in decades.Barely had to look up solutions (I think maybe twice?) so that speaks to the right balance of 'think about it for a bit and you should get it'. Played through with my 7yo son, a little intense at times, but worth it; memories were made.Sincerely, thank you to the devs, and for the leadership that let dreams come to life for once."

You can tell its not for the money and genuinely made by people who care. The friends pass is free allowing you to play with anybody who buys the game, and not only that, it has so much effort put into it. Even with its fictional nature, it makes incredibly realistic graphics, even at an incredibly large scale. The story is cheesy, but still enjoyable. Not to mention the mechanics. Each mechanic felt super fun to do, me and my friend kept going back to the ice skating because of how fun the mechanic was. The mini games are a interesting and fun way to add more content into the game while keeping it focused at all times. There wasnt a single moment in this game i felt like it was wasting time and i wanted it to get to story. Not to mention its layout. It reminds me of classic xbox 360 lego games i used to play, and that bit of nostalgia really put the cherry on top. 10/10 buy this game PLEASE"

The stages in the game are well thought out and graphics we nice too, not too demanding on the GPU either. The progression was there and the story hits a lot of good points about marriage, and it gives them a clever twist to get the message across. My only complaint is the British accents. The mix of accents is annoying. Especially when May say Priv-acy instead of Praivesy (both phonetically spelled), like a normal person. Then one of the frogs has a New York accent and the other one has a love language accent. why?!

The whole experience was awesome, with unique mechanics for both characters that kept changing to keep the game new and interesting. One of my favorite aspects specifically was the sound design of the game. Just finished playing through the main story (haven't found every minigame yet) so you're looking at roughly 9-12 hours depending on skill level and how many minigames you seek out. It was definitely weird, but in the best way, so don't let that scare you away. During the Musical Chairs minigame, the game got very buggy. Upon exiting that game and entering the next section of the chapter, the game crashed and one of the files was corrupted, so it had to be uninstalled and reinstalled. So probably just avoid that minigame but all else was great!"

I love this genre of games, another example being A Way Out, wich is of course from the same creators. The splitscreen/play-with-a-friend genre is one of the finest there is and can truly improve the relationship with he or she. I played this with a friend of mine and he also really enjoyed the game, every level is really different and they are at their finest when you can do something like skate on ice or swim underwater, those active things really improve the game, all the equipment you gain really change the game. At one time you are shooting wasps with a gun that shoots matches and the other minute you have magnets on your back or youi can change time with a clock or you can scream to explode glass! These things are game changers and the creators should be really proud of what they made here. I give this game a solid 10/10. I also love how there are no collectibles, but smal things to do like minigames, or jump on the back of a train. All those small things make the game so beautiful.

This really makes you work together and use your individual skills for the common good to progress, and it's just focused on fun 100% of the time. This should be in the 2021 GOTY conversation. Absolutely do not miss it. Play with a buddy, a significant other, a sibling, doesn't matter. You will have a great time. As a child of divorce (a particularly horrible divorce), I still found this story to be super endearing. Some people need to be apart, others need a push from a certain Spanish long-armed book to find their way back together. I have never seen a game push the theme of collaboration so well and so thoroughly. Every action must be supported by your partner's action, and vice versa. You bring different skill sets to the table, but ultimately the only way to get anything done is to learn to work together both through the narrative and the gameplay. This is a pinnacle of thematic consistency, which you know I love. Absolutely outstanding."

The Couch Co-Op genre is being brought back to life. Try to remember the days when there was no online gaming and just a 2-player Nintendo console hooked up to your TV. The retro games back then turned non-gamers in the household into gamers just by sitting beside you on the couch. This is the stuff this game is made of.

It is 1. incredibly charming, 2. brimming with smart and interesting gameplay ideas and mechanics, 3. looks gorgeous, 4. easy to pick up and put down, 5. a great choice for players of various skill level (saves are very generous, there are not real 'punishments').Point 2 is really where this game shines. At its core, It Takes Two is cooperative platformer. But each world you visit is premised on one or more styles of asymmetrical co-op gameplay, each player being granted a different power to traverse the world and assist their partner. Like in a Mario game, the difficulty isn't terribly high, but the gameplay is crisp and the sheer amount of ideas and mechanics at play means it never gets dull. This is an extremely fantastic value for the amount of fun you will get out of it."

Gameplay is very accessible and varies with each chapter, keeping the experience fun and fresh. The story and messages of the game are some we could all use in difficult times, not only making this game 2021's GOTY, but pretty much every year's GOTY until you played it.

Last chapters feel like something you have to get over with rather than something you truly want to play, and subpar main story definitely doesn't help.

It really impresses me how much the game looks like a movie. The soundtrack is also really great and it pulls everything together, from the gameplay to the story. Speaking of the story, its kind of like a Disney movie style, which in my opinion is great. The story ties in really well with the gameplay and the story also has some unexpected twists here and there. Lastly I would like to talk about the co-op. It's super nice of Hazelight to make it so only one person needs to own the game to play with another friend.

I was constantly impressed by the amount of fully detailed interactables and minigames (even if we skipped them, I was still impressed) that must have taken a lot to get polished just to entertain players for a few minutes before moving on, they really designed the gameplay for constant moment-to-moment fun.The storyline is not family friendly despite the appearance of the game, and focuses on a lot of darker themes especially towards the first third of the game. Joseph Fares shows here that it was no accident that A Way Out set the bar for a true no-compromises co-op experience, and I don't see how he can top this but I eagerly await his next project."

I really loved the winter one, it's so charming and beautiful. Controls are very responsive and it's feels really good playing it.

It adds mechanics that are intuitive but don't last too long, as so that you don't get bored. Some levels so this better than other undoubtedly. The use of real world physics reminded us of how much fun we had when we played Portal 2's Co-op mode. This game truly amplifies the co-op element. I guarantee if you play this with a long time friend like myself the puzzles were enjoyable and we could bounce ideas of each other. I will say some levels abilities require more teamwork that others.The visuals are amazing and fairly optimised which is unusual for an EA game. I managed to play at 1440p resolution staying above 60fps during chase sequences. The fantastic visuals just make the game even more worth exploring.The story was alright but it served as a decent enough foundation to the gameplay.The minigames are nice extra that allow you to take a break from the puzzles and have fun with your companion. I do have to say my favourite level definitely has to be the Snowglobe level. The visuals are fascinating and beautiful. The ability you get given as well nails home the point that you rely on each other both gameplay and communication wise. We finished in 10 hours or so, which I feel is perfect. The game didnt drag and we did play at least one round of all the mingames we found. For the price I would say its worth it. (I payed £20) considering only one of you has to have it to play it."

I needed a game for me and my gf that is- casual- not too easy not too hard- aesthetically pleasing- geared towards koop gameplayStuff like Mario Kart was too skill based and caused frustration. Puzzle games were too boring or too hard to control for a non-gamer. The developers previous game -A way out- was too boring at times and just lacked gameplay.It takes two now sits perfectly in the sweet spot of what we needed:The graphics are cute and beautiful. The different worlds are absolutely fantastic and creative, ranging from larger open spaces to tight tunnels. Most worlds have been crafted with an eye for details and love and I really loved the little Easter eggs.The gameplay is casual, fun and very diverse - every chapter gives the characters changing skills and therefore numerous different puzzles and fights that in turn are never hard but never boring too. One particular chapter just blew my mind because the game completely changed in a totally unexpected way for a moment (I would like a full game like that chapter tbh). Our very different skill levels regarding video games weren't a problem at all. The game manages to let both players help each other without ruining it for one of them.If there is one weak point it might be the story. I found it to be quite flat and stereotypical yet charming and funny at times. My impatient gf wanted to skip the cut scenes, but both players have to press b for 2 seconds or so 😈 but it's a cool feature and the story really is just as important as you want it to be.Summary: if you have a buddy, partner, family member or ANY person willing to play a great game then do it! It's so good. I want more."

It's fun, energetic, and the tone (generally) doesn't take itself too seriously. When it does take itself seriously, the change in tone makes it all the more impactful. It's a game that has the spirit of Psychonauts combined with pastiche's of all your favorite genres - sometimes its a shooter, sometimes a rhythm game, sometimes a top down Gauntlet clone. It does all of these well and with a difficulty challenge that even novices to video games can quickly learn. Frankly, I picked up the game just to have an excuse to have something to do with a friend. I wasn't expecting much, but It Takes Two blew me away.

One level Cody has a bandolier of nails to nail down moving platforms and to make a path for his partner May to swing through with her claw hammer, another level he can stop time while May can clone herself to trigger 2 buttons simultaneously and in another one becomes a barbarian and the other a wizard and the game turns into a top down hack n slash.And another thing, the voice actors ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ KILLED IT!Overall just a really good, well designed game with a story that takes itself semi seriously with memorable moments sprinkled in."

This is also the only game I've ever bothered to write a review for. Played it with my girlfriend and was having a wonderful time; the puzzles hit the spot of not being obvious but still only taking a minute to figure out, and the gameplay displays a surprising variety of styles. Seriously, there's a MOBA section in this 3D puzzle platformer. However, we both found the two playable characters very unlikable. Few redeeming qualities, no glimpses of what made them fall for each other before their relationship deteriorated, and most importantly a lack of concern for their daughter's emotional wellbeing. Then they hit you with an absolutely horrific scene out of nowhere in which you . Absolutely ruined the mood and I really have no desire to suffer through this section to continue playing as these awful people. The way this game is marketed really does not give an accurate impression of the emotional experience. It has lots of cute moments, and I believed it would be a perfect play-with-your-SO-on-the-couch-before-bed experience. So close, and yet so very far. What a shame."

But the impulsive, aggressive, diabolical killing spree followed through may and cody sadly wreaks havoc on the elephant and her soldiers. with may adapting fire powers and melting the poor guards rightfully defending the elephant, as their blood seeps through the carpet of her majesty's hallways. Dont even get me started on cody at this stage in the game. Next thing we see is May and cody crawling through the carcasses of whales and centipedes and finding.. enjoyment out of it? this game is a cover for a dark, twisted, psychopathic story following two serial killers doing everything to return to their human lives, forgetting that these poor souls which followed their path of bloodlust never had the choice of simply returning to a human self.

It Takes Two features a fun platforming co-op experience with many refernces to other game series and genres such as rouge-likes and fighting games. The fun of It Takes Two is playing with a friend or loved one and experiencing this game's story together, as after all there are moments throughout the game where it does indeed take two to complete certain tasks and objectives. The references in this game are also very nice and interesting as they keep the game feeling fresh with different gameplay types, I won't dive deeper into those gameplay differences because I feel those are best to be left a secret, all for the experience of discovering them! It Takes Two is a great game that revisits something that games of the past used to do much more often, which was co-op gameplay, this game not only features great gameplay as a co-op platformer, but it also incooporates a deep (by today's standards of bland stories in anything that isn't a JRPG) story that makes sense for the characters in this story that themselves incorporate into the game's setting very well. Overall, I would definitely say this game deserves all the praise it has been getting, and I highly recommend keeping an eye out for developer ""Hazelight"" as their future is looking bright and I personally can't wait to see what they create next."

You play as one of two members of a married couple who are getting a divorce, but a magical book of love intervenes, trying to force the two back together. As such, the entire game revolves around cooperative problem solving in a fantastical shrunken-down environment.The core cooperative gameplay of this game is quite decent. It is a 3D puzzle platformer at its core, with the main goal being to overcome various challenges to reach a destination, rather than exploration. The game is entirely linear, but it takes the player through a wide variety of environments, and does a good job of mixing things up.The main “gimmick” of the game is that you gain powers in each area of the game. In one area, one player might have a nail, and another a hammer head; this can be used to both nail stuff down, as well as to swing around from the nails using the hammer for the purposes of traversal. In another area, the characters are given silly guns by squirrels to go fight wasps, with one shooting globs of sap and the other being able to light them on fire and make them explode. Still later, you gain powers like the ability to shrink or grow, or walk on walls, or various other things.All of these are used to solve various environmental puzzles, usually revolving around traversal, but sometimes trying to make things line up or break something or accomplish some other task. These tasks vary considerably, and the game avoids repeating too much by changing up the gameplay not just between levels, but oftentimes within levels as well.This is a game that is afraid of the audience getting bored, and it generally does a good job of avoiding it; while a couple levels do linger a bit too long, generally speaking, it does keep things fresh.The fact that the players must work together constantly works really well; this isn’t a game where one player can just solve everything, both players have to work together to get stuff done. It’s a great coop game, and can be played both online and side by side. Interestingly, regardless of which way you play it, it is always played in split screen mode – the reason being that it is often necessary to see what your partner is doing, and often helpful for helping each other figure things out.Best of all, you don’t even both have to own the game to play it! Only one player actually needs to buy the game; the other player can join in via the friend’s pass version of the game, which makes it pretty ideal for sharing it with another person.If there is a complaint about the core gameplay, it is that while it mixes things up a fair bit, it is never really THAT great. It is always decent to good, but it never really reaches the point of greatness.On the flipside, however, the plot and story are rather weak. The protagonists actually have a good reason to split up, but their daughter doesn’t understand what is going on and is upset by it. The book is basically a product of their daughter’s distress, but unfortunately, it ends up not working out very well story-wise, as while the problems the characters have are brought up, they are never actually addressed.This is a huge lost opportunity, as while each area is supposedly addressing some sort of issue they have, none of these areas actually address the issue – playing inside a cuckoo clock is a cute way to represent that they never have enough time for each other or for doing the things they want to do, but the actual story never actually presents any sort of solution for the fact that one of the characters is working too much to spend any time with the family, while the other resents the lack of time they have with them (and frankly, does a rather poor job of being a house-husband).The problem is that the game sort of acts like there is some sort of progress here, even though none of it makes much sense as a means of actually overcoming their real issues with each other. I would have liked for the game to either resolve the issues in some way, or at least present a potential solution, or else have the characters be like “None of this has anything to do with actually solving our problems!” and have it all end with them being like “Nope, we’re getting divorced anyway.” The ending of the game isn’t particularly good or earned, and while it is a bit ambiguous, it’s not all that great.In all fairness to the writing, though, while the overall plot is lousy, the actual dialogue and situations are often amusing, and there are lots of funny moments where bad things happen to the characters and they jab at each other or lampshade funny things that are going on or make bad puns. There is a bit in the middle which is just pitch-black comedy as they try to “murder” one of their child’s toys in order to make them cry, thinking that their tears will help them break the spell, and the whole thing is really amusingly messed up.Overall, this is a great game to play together with someone; the puzzle-platforming works well, and there is some nice cooperative problem solving that isn’t overly difficult and gives you plenty of chances to chat while playing. But be aware that while the gameplay is competent enough, the story is not going to blow you away."

In many aspects, it's a great game, and it certainly deserve the best game of 2021. I like its level design, player tutorial, pathfinding, and so on. Especially for a two-player game, they really have to find a way to emphasize the importance of cooperation. This was a very difficult job and design because the two players' abilities had to be complementary (like a hammer and a nail). And, the level design has to be perfectly utilized in the design of the levels. I think all these things are reflected in the game wonderfully.Personally, I don't like the perspective the game offers about love and marriage. My parents got divorced a few years ago over something. And often two people decide to separate and it's not a momentary gamble. Even if there is mutual understanding and two people are TRYING to work out together, the core conflict is not resolved. Maybe I'm a little too subjective, but some of the views about love in there make me uncomfortable.Other than that, it's a good game."

Definitely do not get it to play with your kid. Cute graphics and clever puzzles in kids toy environment lure you in at first. Then things start to take a dark turn when one of the characters gets the idea to kill a favourite toy. You assume it's just some kind of tension that will get resolved before long. But no. It then goes way way off the rails and the puzzles become about dismembering a stuffed elephant while it cries and pleads to not be hurt. If you are the kind of person who got a kick out of pulling legs off living things when you were a kid, or you have kids locked up in your shed for kicks, maybe you could tolerate this. The game creator is clearly an example of this type of person except that you are the one being damaged for his kicks, and paying for it no less. The premise of playing as a struggling couple was neat and the programmers did a great job. But like all the worst Pixar movie moments, nobody stood up to the boss and said ""WTF? No."""

Takes the meaning of Co-op to the next level.Handcrafted visuals and amazing graphics with so much level of detail. Every single level was memorable and well done.  The clockwork level was my favorite visually with all the moving pieces and lights shining off them. Sounds, lighting etc everything top notch technically. No performance issues or anything ran so smoothly 2k maxed out with a 3070. Surprising how much they can achieve even without RTX.It's a lighthearted story about a broken marriage couple who start fixing their mistakes for their kid. Divorce is a serious issue, but the game isn't trying to explore it deep, it's just told in a breezy way which i liked very much. There are also some really fun side stories and characters that adds charm to the game.Gameplay is the star of the show.. There are total 7 chapters each with multiple levels and not a single moment felt boring. Every level is designed for coop , you discuss with the person you are playing with and solve puzzles. Every single level has some new mechanic/idea from the start till the end. It's not a challenging platformer , its more of experiencing cool things at same time some level of thinking together with buddy to solve the puzzles. Each character gets a different power in each level so we have to coordinate with the other to solve the challenges. All levels will make you go ""damn that's so cool"" with its design and mechanics. The controls, animations everything is just soo tight and snappy. My personal favorite was the Rose's room level full of cool toys with stuff like dungeon crawler wizard combat, shrinking power, gravity boots, ship combat , circus levels etc there is just so much.It's just so loving and perfect game that's fun throughout. There isn't a single flaw/issue i had with the game. Also thank's to devs for the Friends pass so if one person buys thats enough to play with their buddy. Kids or adults, even non-gaming audience can play this game and enjoy it, a great way to introduce them to gaming too. 10/10 GOTY contender . Sets the bar for platformers !"

Playing this with a friend, since you of course can't do it without one, is great and awesome. You gain the possibility to not only torture each other but also to help each other in unique and interesting ways. Solving puzzles is nice and not too complicated, especially with the included splitscreen which I personally really, really enjoy. But, of course, that is not all. The creativity the devs must've put in this game is impressive, since not only world design is awesome itself but also game mechanics are. The story itself is incredibly good and has a unique point of view by showing what our two lovely friends are going through and how they are changing on behalf their new presented environment. Coming back to the world design, I must admit that I can't really find the matching words to explain how generally impressed I am by it. It is - at some point - a childish world of course but on the other hand a sheer complex one with much puzzles to solve and many stories to discover. It is - I would say - a wonderful mix out of childhood memories and entertainment for everyone in  a matching age. Character design in connection with the world design is also incredibly well done and the overall ""cuteness"" of all these is awesome too - especially a few characters are still burned into my mind. However, even though the game seems funny and awesome at first, there are some dark sequences which I barely could pass because of their violent characteristics. A perfect example for such scene would be - everyone who played until here probably knows what I'll say now - the elephant scene, which I don't want to speak further about... This scene though really triggered my feelings of guilt and I was terribly disgusted by myself for passing such. But these specific scenes, however, are really giving the game a special turning point and character, since it is not only influencing you in a positive but also in a negative and sad way. So, regarding that I personally do not have anything to complain about it, since everything is basically matching up in a perfect way, I can totally recommend it! Your money will be spent right!"

If the server have a 1s issue, you get eject from the game and you have to restart from the last checkpoint. Luckily there is lots of checkpoints.Also we are forced to play online because the game doesn't support LAN which would have avoid me trouble with their network issue.

My only gripe is that the last two chapters were a bit lacking in terms of fresh gameplay mechanics and the ending seemed rushed.

We played with the friend-pass as we're long-distance and the controls were very responsive, hardly any lagging (provided you have good internet).The game is absolutely beautiful and so many times during a cut scene we would mention how this would make a fantastic movie and it'd be a great experience to even watch that alone.All in all 10/10 game and I look forward to replaying it to complete those extra achievements we fell short of through the first round :)"

But giving away or seling your information to anyone that asks for it is an unnecessary grab for more cash. OK, greed rules, but then to grab more information from your friend, and sell that too?

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

It's mind boggling how this game allows 1 person to purchase the full game for another to access the entire game. I would EASILY say this game is worth the full price PER PLAYER. Detail and game play:Each and every level is unique and detailed down to every pixel. Boss fights and mechanics are challenging but not tedious. You may wonder why the hell this game is 40GB in size, but when you play it for yourself you will understand why. Each chapter and mini chapter is like a whole new fantasy world, each new mini chapter is a genre of any famous genre of game. You have abit of Tekken, Crash Bandicoot, Little Nightmares, Dance dance revolution, Dungeon Crawling, Fantasy RPG etc.Character development:Dr Hakim, the book responsible for helping fix your relationship is an extremely lovable character played perfectly. You run into new characters in every chapter which the game does a fantastic job of creating a bond between you and them really pulling your emotions in and viewing life in their position. It does a great job in making you feel terrible about what has to be done, really displaying how much emotion it pulls from you.Overall this is the best Co-op Game puzzle game released till date and i would highly recommend purchasing it.

I would be willing to play through the entire thing again and again with every one of my friends who wants to play it and I would buy them the whole game as well instead of using the ""friend pass"" just so I could keep supporting the developers. This was an amazing ride from start to finish. We loved every single part of this game (except one sad part ...you'll know it when you get to it... we still feel horrible).I have one question for the developers though .......

The game itself is great fun. Getting it running? Not so much. I wasted probably half an hour trying to get it to be playable with a friend that I had on my steam friends list. Neither of us use origin much because of how bad it is, but we decided this game looked fun enough to play together to be worth it.Origin search for friends? Terrible. Only way they come up is through email. We tried name and (apparently case sensitive) Player ID both and they results in nothing. Tried email resulted in them showing up right away. Added, then they didn't appear on friends list. Restarted Origin, restarted It takes two, and they didn't appear. Had to Task Manager + End Process for both for friend to appear on friends list.Please EA, just stop using your DRM. It's horrid, and Origin is bad.EDIT: They just updated Origin and deleted it in order to give the EA App installed on my computer.It Takes Two now requires 95% of my GPU. My GPU is a Nvidia GTX 3050. The recommended for this is a GTX 980, for context. That's on the starting screen for It Takes Two. How? I can only presume the EA App and It Takes Two are so badly optimized (and/or have such poopy anti-piracy programs in them) that it's requirements are a GTX 4080."

The game would have benefited from being shorter. The insane variety of gameplay is both a lot of fun and very frustrating. The best mechanics are too often short lived, while long bouts of the game have little going on.  I would consider the story, characters, and dialogue to be mediocre and often cliche, though the dialogue did give me an occasional chuckle. Overall I thought the ""message"" and narrative were mismanaged, leaving me feeling nothing about the characters or story. The game is a lot more fun if you don't take it seriously.The graphics are top-notch and the environments are often very impressive, though I do wish they were more engaging. The game feels like an Unreal Engine showcase meant to impressive the general public. While overall a decent experience, not a gamer's game and not something I ever wish to revisit."

My girlfriend got it for me for my birthday so we could play together, and it was really fun!! However, given that we're in different continents, we had to rely on the online mode- which was downright unplayable an alarming amount of times. There was a constant lag in our games, but it especially made timing based mechanics a nightmare and certain bosses impossible to beat (I called in my sister to help me play these parts, as there doesn't seem to be issues with local mode). If there wasn't the timing issue, then the game was suddenly disconnecting her (may be related to the Friend Pass?). Unless you're playing together in local mode, I don't know if I can recommend this game because of the sheer number of issues we encountered- which is unfortunate because it was otherwise a delightful and fun experience."

Playing this was a soulless experience where every level felt like a chore and the plot remained unbearably predictable. Apart from the mini-games, most of the game was a linear grind towards more disappointment. If you both enjoy story/controller games, this could be really fun, but for us, this wasn't the case."
6437,Ogonsan,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023566441/,2,,0,14.6,August,"27,",67,0,1,"Honestly, considering all the positive reviews, I had to write this.First of all, the fact that you need Origin (the EA platform) to launch this was a very bad surprise. The gameplay and puzzles are extremely straightforward. There are lots of different things to do, but each sequence is awfully simplified. I would describe this game as ""an accumulation of very dumb mini games"".The story is about ""cooperating"", but if we're honest, there's barely any cooperation at all. You do the actions that they tell you on screen, and your friend does the same thing. As there's dual screen, I don't think I ever needed to say ""oh, could you give me that object next to you ?"" (even though my friend is not an English native and we really struggle to understand each other sometimes !). We knew exactly what to do almost all the time, because the game is designed to be a smoothless experience.The most fun moments were the platforming parts, that were well made. But the rest, in my opinion, doesn't have any flavor.I didn't enjoy the character designs either and most jokes are cringe. Maybe a fun game if you play with kids. But if you are two adults that want a coop puzzle game, I would not buy this game. Instead, I would recommend playing Portal 2 coop. There is no comparison possible between those two games."
6438,Gametrap,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198139078020/,6,3,0,0.2,November,"23,",122,0,1,"I played the game with my friend through friend pass, and have purchased it solely to review it because i do not understand how it won game of the year or has so many positive reviews.                                                                                                                          Both of the parents are terrible, selfish people that the game makes me care less and less about as the story progresses. Neither of them have much character besides being horrible parents, the mom is the breadwinner and the dad likes plants and is forgetful. That's pretty much it for character development. The book is an annoyance that tries to solve their relationship by making them do things together(with unskippable cutscenes that I really want to skip) instead of talking about their problems and possible solutions like how normal people solve their differences. The child I feel sorry for, but her character is not very developed, so I don't really feel for her besides increasingly sorry that she has such parents as the story progresses. This game made me feel sad, for the girl and that such self centered people are lauded as good parents.                                                                                                          All the mechanics are variations on click this or you click and I click, they are a pretty cool at first but the game never delves deeper into them, it just switches into a new one and resets the difficulty on the puzzles, never to bring that mechanic back.    The difficulty would start at the right level, telling you how to use a new thing, and then teaching you a couple new ways to do it but would then plateau there until it started from the easier difficulty with a new mechanic. Some of the mechanics were very fun(the goo gun) but none ever carried over to another level and they always got boring as the difficulty stopped increasing. Usually in a game they introduce new mechanics as a way to solve puzzles in different ways, or once there are several tools to use they have different ones in different parts of the level to mix it up. This game was a straight path all the way through, there was one right way to progress and the game made it pretty easy to see. That's not an inherently bad thing, as the squirrel level showed, but for the rest of the levels it got very monotonous as the the rooms stopped increasing in difficulty and just made you show that you knew how to solve the same problem just with a couple things changed.    The bosses were one of the few high points of the game, they were decently hard and were actually fun. They took the basic mechanic and made it a harder to execute or had new things to deal with. The toolbox was the one time me and my friend died this game. When playing this it made me a little sad though, cause if the boss was this fun and had a twist on the basic gameplay they know that people like it when they mix up how a mechanic can be used to do something, but did not include any of these concepts on the rest of the level design.                                In short: this game told a terrible story about horrible parents that should indeed divorce as it was holding my hand through puzzles and then made me torture an innocent creature in order to progress(literally the only reason I didn't quit there was because this won game of the year so I wanted to see why). The few high points did not make up for the rest of the monotonous game. It make me question my worldview that this won game of the year and so many positive reviews and the only negative ones are about the client.    If anyone wants to play a real puzzle for two people play We Were Here(the first one is free) there is a real two player puzzle, with actual communication needed to solve puzzles, which in my opinion is the reason two player puzzles exist."

6490,chowder,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raredeeznutspepe/,No,,1,15.8,July,"18,",210,0,1,This game contains a lot of charm and passion. Each new stage brings a completely new environment and new mechanics. The environment is always fun to explore there are cool details everywhere. Whoever did the environment design in this game put a lot of effort. This is a rare example of a triple AAA game actually being fun and charming. Even though I did not care for the story I still had a blast playing this. The game keeps things fresh by moving you from one cool environment to another and is always building on the mechanics. This is at the same level of quality as any Mario game. I cannot recommend this game enough.

Underneath the cute art, it just felt long and repetitive. I thought playing for ~6hr would be a little over half of a story game and, if it wasn't, there would be some sort of character development, but it really drags out with the same thing-different level concept: get item, work together, master challenge, reset with different items in a different level and start again. The characters also just kind of annoyed me. While my game partner and I didn't enjoy it, two other of our friends did, so I guess it really depends on what sort of things you like. As they say, to each their own.The game overall quality wise is well made, but I guess just not for me. The biggest advice I can give is to watch a video of the gameplay first before you buy it to make sure it matches your tastes/expectations."

The overall score is .We've managed to make 100% progress, but on the clock it takes hours. Be sure to research each step if you wish to do so.In the beginning, the game is really sad and terrible. In some of the opening chapters there is an elephant, that has been damaged so much ... This game reminds me of a ""Toy Story"" movie in which we look at the world from the perspective of a toy.- gameplay,- graphics and level design,- plot and personalities,- puzzles and boss fights, can look like ""souls-like"" genres if you're out of luck.- strange bookman, which we called ""pablo""; he is very annoying- huge fps drops in some areas."

When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.STEP 3While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. You can use a food processor to do this, but make sure you pulse-chop the mushrooms so they don’t become a slurry.STEP 4Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.STEP 5Season the mushroom mixture, pour over 100ml dry white wine and cook for about 10 mins until all the wine has been absorbed. The mixture should hold its shape when stirred.STEP 6Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.STEP 7Overlap two pieces of cling film over a large chopping board. Lay 12 slices prosciutto on the cling film, slightly overlapping, in a double row.STEP 8Spread half the duxelles over the prosciutto, then sit the fillet on it and spread the remaining duxelles over.STEP 9Use the cling film’s edges to draw the prosciutto around the fillet, then roll it into a sausage shape, twisting the ends of cling film to tighten it as you go.STEP 10Chill the fillet while you roll out the pastry.STEP 11Dust your work surface with a little flour. Roll out a third of the 500g pack of puff pastry to a 18 x 30cm strip and place on a non-stick baking sheet.STEP 12Roll out the remainder of the 500g pack of puff pastry to about 28 x 36cm.STEP 13Unravel the fillet from the cling film and sit it in the centre of the smaller strip of pastry.STEP 14Beat the 2 egg yolks with 1 tsp water and brush the pastry’s edges, and the top and sides of the wrapped fillet.STEP 15Using a rolling pin, carefully lift and drape the larger piece of pastry over the fillet, pressing well into the sides.STEP 16Trim the joins to about a 4cm rim. Seal the rim with the edge of a fork or spoon handle.STEP 17Glaze all over with more egg yolk and, using the back of a knife, mark the beef Wellington with long diagonal lines taking care not to cut into the pastry.STEP 18Chill for at least 30 mins and up to 24 hrs. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6.STEP 19Brush the Wellington with a little more egg yolk and cook until golden and crisp – 20-25 mins for medium-rare beef, 30 mins for medium. Allow to stand for 10 mins before serving in thick slices."

It may seem like a childish game with its setting and the main events but there is a certain grimness behind that naïve world (you can check the negative reviews for that part). Even though frame of the story isn’t spectacular, enjoyable dialogues and story elements make it more than fine. Unexpectedly, game has some great songs and these songs have a great harmony with the levels. The most well-made part of the game is level design. None of the levels have the same mechanics with each other, other than a tiny platforming mechanic. Every level offers you a different experience and each of them is different for different characters. Because of that, you can finish the game twice without getting bored. Plus, game length isn’t short for sure (it took us 16 to finish). Sadly, game requires Origin account for at least one person but you can play with Remote Play too. Our problem with Friend’s Pass, which is the system to play with only one purchased game, was the only problem with the game which we were able to fix it. Obviously, I definitely recommend this game to everyone (maybe not for the people who want to play with their children)."

This and the distribution model when only one person have to buy the game is a perfect combination that makes this game really good.Players will encounter lots of well-designed scenes(levels) and easy versions of various genres e.g. platformer, various race versions, TPS, flight, slasher, puzzle, bullet hell, etc and a million ways to die by the hand of your teammate. Most of the time game is in split-screen mode which seems to have no synchronization problems,There are some negative things:1. It is hard to say what is the target age of players - the game has a story which is too dumb for adults and too hard to be understood by children. To me all the cutscenes were annoying and we did not found a way to skip it(maybe there is one). However the story is sometimes so absurdly dumb that makes it laughable, but that's rare.2. Controls are made by a sadist. Have you seen somewhere else walk/run switch binded to CAPS? Well, at some parts of the game it changes to shift. There is autoaim auto camera focus things that you CAN NOT!!! turn off. When you need to press buttons for notes it is not buttons that are nearby - it is Q, E, and a Spacebar. Movements in top-down mode is just ♥♥♥♥ up as much as it could - good luck on not dying after dash. Most of the game beating the poor controls design is times harder than beating the location (EA - Challenge everything!).3. Game launches through origin which is bad an inconvenient, you have to own an account there and your friends have to be added there too, It sometimes drops the connection for no reason, but the saves are made locally so there will be no problem in resuming the game when the server is back, Overall ingame bugs are rare and insignificant. Twelve hours of gameplay ends exactly when it exceeds the fun part,At least movement keys are not random and they don't rotate too often.Good except for the dialogues.Game is easy and it is meant to be that.Very nice, in fact that is the strongest part of the game implementation,High quality.Most times everything is very good, but there are things like wrong animation direction for swinging, reflections which does not represent original objects and lots of other minor physics fckups. (People who had no childhood AND skipped physics classes should not design swinging!)Ok, nothing to mention.Ok, nothing to mention.Ok, nothing to mention.Story is poor, dumb and absurd.27 different minigames including chess - would've been a perfect addition if not fckdup controls which ruinsa third of the total count. Still very good.Big scenes has a lot of interesting interactive objects."

It is both bombastic and subtle in certain moments.A very story-driven game that takes its time to tell its story, pays attention to the importance of environmental storytelling and not be super melodrama in telling a ""divorce"" kind of story. It Takes Two is arguably Josef Farez' masterstroke, a remarkable achievement from the director and team who made Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons only 9 years ago."

I don't even have anything bad to say about this because everything is just so beautiful and carefully done by the developers from animation to story to level designs. Even the soundtrack is outstanding.I played this before via the Friend's Pass and finished the game with my boyfriend. This kind of saved our relationship the same way  From start to end, I find myself falling in love with the story and its characters and falling more in love with my partner as the story progresses.So what was the best thing to do? Buy the game for myself and play it again with him just so we could experience the adventure once again.Some of the things that made me love this game:In general, I think this game really deserved winning GOTY. This was too well-made. With a game length of more than 12 hours (our first playthrough was roughly 17 hours) and only worth $39.99 (PHP 1799)—I got this at 63% off sale while my boyfriend bought it for its full price—this is unexpectedly  a cash grab despite being published under EA. Not to mention the FREE Friend's Pass.TL;DR Buy it. Play with your loved one, a friend, or just anyone you want to enjoy a wonderful experience with. Definitely a great bang for one's buck."

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

6652,Pogi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gugicachan/,2,1,0,18.3,January,26,177,0,1,"It takes two is an ambitious game. It really wants to do a lot. There is no doubt that the art style is absolutely its highest point. There are so many interesting environments with different themes that are absolutely a joy to experience. However, all other game components of It Takes Two were rather poorly executed and made the game, despite its great presentation, a very mediocre experience. Let’s explore why.The story of It Takes Two is something that most of people recognise as a low point of the game. Therefore I do not intend to spend too many words on this topic. To me the quality of the story wasn’t really that important as the game is primarily a co-op platformer - a genre in which the gameplay is an absolute king and the story is just a nice bonus.Though I must mention that I do not remember a game where the story would so actively ruin my enjoyment of the game as It Takes Two did. The two characters that you control are just horrible. They are toxic and one dimensional. The game has many cutscenes where you basically just watch these two characters arguing in intense and less intense situations. One throwing really bad jokes and cringe punchlines, while the other bitterly reacts to everything. Virtually all the dialog is delivered in shouting so everything hits even worse. But what really ruins the experience is that characters’ shouting comments continue into the gameplay.For me, a big reason why couch multiplayer is awesome is because you can share great moments instantly with someone next to you. You solve problems together and share the joy of beating a boss or figuring a difficult puzzle out. You discover new environments and feel mutual thrill in doing so. But it is hard to form your own experience and opinion when in-game characters just interpret everything you see, before you can even process it yourself. Characters in It Takes Two just wouldn’t shut up. They keep telling you how you should feel about stuff and that aspect alone ruined a big portion of the game. It truly took away most of the wonder that game has otherwise visually successfully created.Luckily I discovered that there is a setting, that lets you mute all the in-game dialogue. I can’t describe you how big of a difference that made. We still played with the subtitles on, but I think it wouldn’t hurt to also turn these off as you will have much more interesting experience interpreting everything that is going on the screen.Next let’s talk about the gameplay. It Takes Two is a 3D platformer. The character movement feels nice - it is fluid and responsive. Although I think that the move set is too powerful. Right from the beginning you get dash, wall jump and double jump. Although thats fine, the powerful movement set pretty much makes the platforming challenge obsolete. Timing and making precise jumps is almost never a challenge. You just fly through stages and ultimately fail to appreciate all the visual spectacle that the game throws at you.The other aspect of the gameplay is cooperation mechanics. Each level introduces new tools that our characters use. One has ability A and the other ability B. Together you combine these abilities to get through the stage. But no matter the provided tools, the task is always a version of one character moving / placing platforms, so the other can then jump across. After that the other opens some kind of doors so the players meet and together move to another stage. This kind of gameplay is repeated thorough the game, but with different coat of paint. And by the end of the game it really felt rather stale.Another problem is that the game keeps introducing new mechanics and abandoning old ones. As a result, you don’t really feel any kind of progression in terms of feeling more powerful and skilled compared to the beginning of the game. Maybe they should make double jump and dash as permanent upgrade that you acquire after beating a certain boss. And maybe they should let you keep the tools you acquire thoroughout the game. This way the puzzles and obstacles could be more open ended and you could use a combination of tools.Some of the tools were definitely better than other. For example, I really liked the snow globe magnets, collaborative garden fights, Space level mechanics, and fight with boats. But all these cool concepts get replaced instead of being built upon. Some of them get abandoned so quickly that they just feel off and out of place for such game. For example the biggest offender was the lame castle wizard section.Because of the hectic gameplay, intrusive story and lack of any meaningful progression, the game felt rather boring despite beautiful environments. In fact all the environments were changing so quickly that I always felt somewhat rushed to experience them. And because of that, I failed to connect with the game. I understand that there is the market for such games. In fact I think it’s a great game for casual gamers and kids. But it really lacks depth. It’s mostly just a visual spectacle.I invite you to check my Best local coop games shelf if you want some more couch multiplayer fun. I am always looking for new and exciting titles."

I felt like I was playing a mix of well polished Mario Party mini-games that helped drive a narrative story about a married couple who are going to get a divorce. Their weird ass daughter uses voodoo and turns them into the figurines she made of them that she plays with. Asking Dr Hakim (A Love Book) to fix her parents broken marriage you embark on an epic journey of grand proportions. Together with your coop partner and lots of ""COL-LAB-ERR-A-TION!"" you just might help save May & Cody's marriage from collapse and reunite  a family on the brink of a catastrophe.  The graphics were nice 8.5 out of 10. The gameplay was excellent 10 out of 10. The music was okay 8 out of 10. The story was good 8.5 out of 10. It took us about 12 hours start to finish with no rush. 9 out of 10 game! A must play experience at least once! One of the best coop game experiences to date for me. I really enjoyed working together with my friend who played on friend pass. He gifted me the game for my birthday and he played it for free right along side with me! He loved it just as much!*** Cannot be played alone! Must have a coop partner. Must use the Origin launcher to invite your friends. This allows for a multiplatform crossplay experience. You can be on PC and your coop partner can be on another platform and you can play together. This does not affect the score of the game in any way in my opinion. ***"

The gameplay and minigames are fun though and for a coop game it is very enjoyable.See the problem we run into is that the Devs don't want us to hate the characters, but at the same time they need to have SOMETHING wrong to justify the whole main issue of divorce. The reason they are divorcing? Petty issues like May being too busy with work. Honestly their relationship seems pretty normal and in fact has very little in the way of any real problem. Their daughter is perfect, Cody and May are typical parents who aren't dealing with financial or any real hardship in general. So they decide they need to divorce, a serious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ decision and one that can ♥♥♥♥ up a child's growth for no real good reason.So the daughter who is reasonably bothered by this sudden decision to dismantle the family makes a wish that oddly ends up being granted magically. So now were in a magical world filled with challenges that require May and Cody to work together to get through. Most of these reveal just how petty and shallow May and Cody are and their relationship drama is really just a lot of nothing."

It will take you on a tour of various genre of video game, from ARPG to Ace-Combat dogfighting, to street-fighter 2D brawling. The game looks gorgeous, and takes you through beautiful miniature setpieces.However, three levels in, it becomes apparent that the story and the writing is... weird. At the heart of it is these two characters, which are just profoundly unlikable for most of the story. They are childish and nasty with each other and do cruel things to the creatures they encounter, largely without justification. I wasn't rooting for them. I didn't want them to get their happy ending. And the way their relationship does heal in the final act seems really shallow, focusing on things like being supportive of gardening or singing, as opposed to more fundamental- real flaws- in their relationship. But despite how shallow the identified causes are, they get back together, probably? It really seems like the people who wrote this game didn't want to engage with the real questions of divorce and parenthood here, and when they came close, decided to brush the hard topics under the rug, instead of grappling with it. It definitely soured the experience."

At least 30 minutes of my recorded playtime was purely dealing with the loading time, lag, and crashes this game had. I'm not running this on a low-quality computer, so I know it wasn't the fault of my hardware.It took a few minutes for the game to load each time I'd open it, and a few times it wouldn't open at all. My half of the screen went black a couple of times, and the audio was about 10 seconds behind the visuals for several parts of the game. The controls were buggy, and combined with lag, it was difficult to accomplish anything.On to my main issue. There is a part in this game where you spend around an hour and a half working towards killing the daughter's favorite stuffed elephant. I did not enjoy playing through knowing that killing the poor elephant was the end goal, but I kept going through in hopes that the player characters would change their minds and realize how messed up their plan is. However, they did not. You have to rip that poor elephant apart as it actively begs you to stop and if you'd like a hug. The characters feel no remorse for what they've done, and have no regret for what they've done and how upset their daughter is over this.That entire thing ruined the game for me, and was absolutely unnecessary. I got this game under the impression that it would be a fun co-op game to play with my boyfriend, but we both left this disappointed and feeling like it was a waste of time. The graphics are pretty when they're fully loaded and not suffering from frame drops, and the gameplay prior to the unfair killing of the elephant was nice; but overall this is a game of bugs, unjustified horror, and complete lack of comprehensive storytelling and progression overshadows that.I want justice for Cutie."

Both players have different powers throughout the game so there is no possibility to do something completely alone. Minigames add some extra fun where you have to compete.

Way more voice acting than i expected there to be. Only real negative from me is i didn't love the story of the game. The main plot is fine i guess, although cliche,  but the way its acted out by the two characters throughout the game was pretty cheesy and didn't feel super authentic to me.

Not just because it's a decent game, but I am playing it with a really awesome girl.  The puzzles aren't easy, but also not irritatingly hard.  The boss fights are challenging but don't distract from what this game is really about... spending time with the person you are playing with.  I do feel like the game is pushing the wrong message: ""Stay in an unhealthy relationship because it will make the kids happy.""  If you are in an unhealthy relationship it's creating an atmosphere of toxicity for the kids.  But I get what the game is trying to do, and it works.  At $40, it's worth it because your partner doesn't have to buy their own copy... really nice of the devs.Edit:  Oh, and the hardest boss in the entire game is the Camera...

And the characters you are playing with are absolutely despicable, it is really hard to have sympathy to them. This issue is sugar coated with fun and engaging gameplay for two people. Solving puzzles and riding all the roller-coasters is indeed well executed. But this cannot out-weight the unacceptable actions that you have to do while playing this game. The storytelling is psychopathic which makes you play psychopathic characters without any options to choose their actions. Culmination of this is an infamous elephant scene, we stopped playing because of that. Killing puppies is not something that people should be forced to experience in a game, especially when the game pretends to be family-friendly. Absolutely unacceptable."

Both of us have good internet connections and decent PC's Here are some of the issues we ran into:1. One of us losing connection to EA servers ending the game (loosing lots of progress since checkpoints can be rather far apart).2. The game goes out of sync every now and then interestingly the game treats both versions as true which is really problematic in situation where both players have to control things together. E.g. trying to avoid a rock that one player sees on the left and the other on the right will be like a rock on the left and on the right. When running into those sync problems some boss fights get impossible3. Poor testing (bugs and design problems). We had several occasion where the game bugged out  (e.g. get stuck in a wall) and we had to restart, again loosing a lot of progress depending on where the last checkpoint was. In one level one player has to move a wall for the other player to jump on multiple times. While the wall is moving it does not ""exists"" tying to jump on it will lead to falling through it."

Spent 30 minutes logging in and out trying to get it to work so I can play w/ my GF using the Friend Pass.

6850,RUSні PEACEда,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkajenaSobaka/,3,,0,11.3,January,"11,",62,0,1,"I received this game as a gift. Before I heard lots of pleasant reviews and recommendations about this game. So I couldn’t wait to play it. After 10 hours spent in this game I understood why it took so many GOTY awards. It is perfectly designed, sound is incredible, lots of interesting mechanics, it doesn’t have story gaps. So I sincerely understand people who gave this game lots of appreciation. It surely would be an 11/10 game for me too, except one thing. (Spoilers ahead) All of it was unfairly ruined by the moment with an elephant. It was pointless, rude and cruel part, that leads to…nothing. It didn’t help to solve the problem of the main characters, it wasn’t fun or entertaining, it was just horribly disgusting scene of killing the most attractive toy in game. Which message or experience me as a player I should’ve received? Or it was just cruelty for cruelty? Just because? And it is so unfair that I was forced to do it. Why wouldn’t give player a choice at least? Or someone in gamedev team just thought that I will be a brilliant idea to actually tear apart one of the helpless and kind toy in game? (And what about vacuum cleaner eyes?) What’s wrong with you guys? How it got PEGI 12 rate? No gory details? Hello? I would like to watch how would react 12 yo child to it? When you are reaching family divorce and child’s trauma topic and then putting this pointlessly rude part that cannot be avoided. How many people will end up their evening crying and cursing everyone who created this game? I cannot refund money for it and I cannot finish it, though it was really great adventure ‘till the moment. What a beautiful move. Thank you a lot Hazelnut studio for absolutely torn to pieces, spoiled and meaninglessly destroyed experience.---Игра была получена в подарок. Наслаждались в коопе, действительно игра заслуживала то внимание и награды, о  которых трубят во всех игровых сми. Мне тоже она заходила до тех пор, пока мы не дошли до момента со слонихой. Только один вопрос: зачем? То, что с ней происходило не решило проблемы главных героев, не привнесло новых механик, не было ни смешным, ни забавным. Это было просто отвратительно неприятно. Я не могу продолжить игру, как и не могу рефанднуть за нее деньги. Хотя она была весьма достойной до этого момента и мы бы с радостью её закончили, от этого еще более обидно, что весь мой приятный опыт и наслаждение игрой было бессмысленно разрушено ненужным моментом, который не несет абсолютно ни-че-го."

I naturally assumed you could play by yourself if you wanted to and the other character would be controlled by an AI (a simple enough concept, right?), but unfortunately this isn't the case. I don't like the fact that I can only play with a non-imaginary sentient life-form who likes me (partly because I have no human friends and partly because my guinea pig has no opposable thumbs), and that's why I've decided to request a refund.Beats me why they couldn't incorporate a single-player mode for the more, shall we say, socially challenged gamer (last time I checked, most genuine gamers weren't the most socially viable humans anyway: that's why we became videogame addicts in the first place, isn't it?!), but never mind! If you're given both options on similar titles such as  why not this? I really don't appreciate being left without that option, and this whole ""Friend's Pass"" thing seems pretty suspect to me; I mean, since when did game publishers (ESPECIALLY EA!) want to actively encourage a whole horde of life-sized ragdolls to play their game without paying for it? If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is.Anyway, lesson learned. I guess I should've paid more attention to the title because it really does take two [humans] to play!"

Finishing at 13 hours, this game was the right length for what it was.Also, thanks to the publisher/developer for the whole ""you only buy one copy"" thing. Way easier to do that and tell your friend to download the free game and get going then either having to convince them to buy their own or gifting them one and making them feel like they have to play or they wasted your money. This was a good system that I appreciated."

This game has a ridiculous story, with terrible pacing, terrible characters that are extremely unlikeable, no development whatsoever, and massive continuity issues. But it literally doesn't matter. Because Hazelight makes the best gameplay mechanics, levels, and environments that I've ever seen in a co-op oriented adventure video game. Not to mention just how awesome it is to have adventure games that are two player. As I said in my A Way Out review, this game is so mechanically sound and fun that I really have no choice but to highly recommend it. It can be frustrating to coordinate with your partner, but this game is great. Just as a mechanic gets old, it is replaced by a fresh mechanic and a new environment. There is plenty to explore and everything just feels so big and so open, despite being linear. It has very tight platforming and controls and I only ran into two glitches in the entire 13 hour playthrough. This is a fun game. Not to mention how much I love the fact that you only need one copy of the game, which is always great. Such a great experience."

It's beautiful, has a good long story-line, and there's a lot of content for the money. The only problem I had with the game was that it was WAY too easy. I feel like the game would be so much better if they added difficulties to pick from, for each player. You don't really get to figure things out by yourself, you don't get to solve anything, it's all just laid out for you and that took away tons of potential fun and time in game.3 things that I think should be incorporated into making difficulties are: Less or no hints for how to use your powers, limited lives on boss fights, reduced or no aim assist.In conclusion, this game is perfect unless you are an experienced gamer or like a little challenge."

I would not play this with a stranger or someone that you're just beginning to see.  To elaborate on that last comment; if you're looking for an escape from feelings of the real world, this isn't it. It's a very emotionally heavy game with relationship concepts like divorce and self blame tied in. On that same token, it's one of the most beautiful stories ever told in a video game once it fully unfolds and it's a story that's focused on character development. It's honestly really nice to see a great game where the theme is healthy relationships. It made me and the girlfriend cry at the end. From a gameplay perspective, it offers a great variety of different play styles from chapter to chapter and gives each character unique abilities - that require teamwork to accomplish the goal. It's not immediately obvious what needs done, so it forces you and your significant other to communicate and use ""CO-LLA-BO-RATION"" to accomplish objectives. It's also a very fine balance that it's easy enough for inexperienced gamers to pick it up quickly (and difficulty can be adjusted in the settings for each character if someone is really struggling), but difficult enough that it's still fun and interesting for the more experienced. The boss fights are also quite fun.If you're looking for a great time with the significant other, but also a game that truly is as fun as old video games were (before the age of microtransactions), buy this. It's for you two."

The non-host player always has too much lag to get timing correct.  The ""Play local"" feature is NOT to play over the LAN, it's to play on the PC with a controller hooked up.  We don't have or use controllers, we're mouse and keyboard all the way.  So, games like FarCry can be played on the LAN, like many other games, with no or little lag.  But the EA servers don't seem to be up to playing this when playing online.  We have 500MB fiber connections on Alienware R7s, so it's not our end.  Other games work great, but this one is too laggy to play.  Otherwise, it seems pretty fun."

It is literally difficult to fail. deaths dont reset your progress apart from in certain areas where it puts you back a very small difference. it definitely loses some excitement/fun by not having any progress lost when you die. like in the tree area when you ride the big wale and it spins around, you dont have to move at all. you can just slide off, die and instantly respawn with no penalty which just ruined that whole area. They definitely shouldve considered good players (not just beginners) by not forcing you into an easy mode. When there is a challenge, the fun part is losing for a while and finally beating the area which feels great as you both put in effort to beat the area and both performed well. The puzzles are also easy to solve.In my opinion, operation tango was a much more fun two player game. it also has so much more replayability as the two characters have a completely different play style compared to it takes two which is relatively similar.That being said. I love how the creators had almost no limits creating this game and chucked in the most random things just making the game so much fun to explore.That being said, all two player games are fun and a great laugh."

What is a wonderful animation and amazing game development is completely overshadowed by the halfassed concept of content it presents. What was an entirely original idea for the first 4 hours, quickly turns into a derogatory manipulation of previously successful ideas for games throughout the 90's and early 2000's. This game should have ended within the first 6 hours and been a cute but wonderful story with amazing animation and great nostalgia mixed with modern day graphics and animation. That being said it went on for hours and hours with no real character development or interest/connection towards the life experiences of the main protagonists which led to it being a drag to finish the game and by the end just being glad it was over and genuinely hoping they ended up unhappy instead of wishing them the best. Next time don't sell a game based off of how much money you can make and instead make a game based off of how much you genuinely want to make the content involved. 1/30"

They're closer to a series of interactables that move your character through the world in interesting ways. And that process is very slow; All of the animations and cut-scenes are drawn out; If the game tasks you with dodging some projectiles, it will ask you to do so for 3 minutes instead of 30 seconds. It was more of an interactive movie.The narrative created through cut-scenes and banter is both pallid and disconcerting. The game as a whole seems to be geared toward children but I don't think it serves as a interesting or wholesome parable. The relationship of the divorcing couple is pretty toxic and the game seems to charge the daughter with the responsibility to restore their love. The voice acting is vivid but I genuinely disliked all of the characters. I don't know who the target audience is.Without puzzles and without story there's no reason to play the game."

It had a lot of tools to make the cooperative aspect novel but the moment to moment gameplay was just not interesting enough to carry it unless you were interested in the story. I was dubious over the accolades surrounding It Takes Two as it was by the same team but was blown away once I finally got my hands on it. Cinematic experience games are good fun but tend to never live up to the same adventurous feel their movie counterparts hold due to their constraints on how the characters can handle a situation. Everything needs to firmly lock into place to make sense with the engine the developers created after all. Not It Takes Two. This game is throwing idea after idea after idea. New chapters appear with new powers which lead to even more new powers and modes of transport and visuals. It actually captures the spirit of the family friendly adventure moves exceedingly well. With such an overwhelming amount of mechanics, I kept waiting for the inevitable wonkiness that comes with underdeveloped or untested moments. Instead the game was exceedingly well done. It accomplishes this by never dwelling too long on one aspect which can be praise or criticism depending on your point of view. None of the challenges ever really escape that honeymoon phase of just figuring out how the game wants you to think. Considering the pacing of the story, it works out favorably but don't go in expecting to be pushed back too hard. There are a few lows for me that might be highlights for you but overall I'd say the experience managed to stay so positive by feeling generally good most of the time. Which again, could be seen as negative since it never really goes into a section that feels absolutely fantastic. It's a different kind of game though. With how many ideas it tries, being positive for nearly its entirely runtime is more than enough to make the whole experience feel amazing overall."

The ONLY bad thing was EA servers (IKR? SHOCK!). We played online and getting kicked from our playthrough all the time was extremely infuriating to the point we dropped the game for a month or so. Luckily Hazelight are generous in regards to checkpoints so we when we did get kicked not much progress was lost. Definitely recommend but only on local co-op."

So I decided to purchase this game on sale since I seen the reviews. As soon as I started the game, she love the story, also, we end up playing the game for two hours straight together. Mind you my girl has never even played a game with me for more than 5 mins even if it's her own game. The graphics is nice, love the puzzle solving together, controls are good, only problem is the camera with me. After that, love it.

HAZELIGHT studio really put their best in this and it really shows.The gameplay mechanics are the main focus here and they nailed it, very good level design and fun puzzles that all require you to think and work with your partner, it really shines when it comes to gameplay and design as this is the best part of the game.Other things to talk about it the story , which has a great pacing and a satisfying ending, it's not the strongest part of the game but it is certainly enough to keep you going.Music is another part of the game that may not be anything special at first but will show it's best at the later chapters of the game which gets much better.The game also has some replayability for atleast 2 times to try out both characters , also maybe trying to play with other friends/partners you might have. Don't forget your friend/partner doesn't need to own the game and can download the friend's pass version to play online with someone who own the game for free.Overall this game did really earn the game of the year title and worth the money spent on."

A large issue with co-op games is when a puzzle is presented and one player ends up solving the puzzle for the group. Though this is more prevalent in turn-based games it can occur in real-time ones too.This game mitigates that factor by giving each player different abilities and different puzzles to solve. Normally this would eliminate the co-op feel of the experience, but this game solves that by entangling the puzzles with one another fairly seamlessly.But this game can only be played with Origin. It being listed on Steam doesn't seem like an honest marketing practice by Steam, so I recommend you buy it through Origin instead of here."

Not to mention on the first boss when either of us tried to man the cannon it just wouldn't do it. Push E, and the character is just floating above the cannon for a few seconds, nothing happens. Also horrendously unoptimized. I've played plenty of AAA games on ultra and never had cpu problems.

7137,Ririx,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076483200/,No,,0,19.5,January,"19,",597,0,1,"After playing through the entire game I can honestly say that it's probably best if you spend your time elsewhere.The game itself has amazing graphics, great sound effects, some super fun puzzles and stuff, but after about the 5th act, it falls off super hard. The puzzles get stupidly easy / basic, the story takes a turn for the dumb, and it's just monotonous. The little girl is the absolute WORST character in the game, along with Dr. Hakim. They're both so annoying and full of cringe that it makes me sad. I get that Rose is a child who doesn't understand the situation, but they've made her flat out stupid. The parents are both very cookie cutter. The mom is a workaholic made to be a raging b---- every 5-10 minutes of gameplay, and the dad is a moron who doesn't work, and of course doesn't support his wife.The ending is absolute GARBAGE. It honestly would have been better if they just killed all the characters instead of pushing a half-arsed story about ""collaboration"" and divorce. You can tell at some point they didn't know what they wanted to do with the story or how to progress the game, so they stuffed in some cliche bs:  In the first 3-4 acts, you fight a boss, or multiple bosses, but after that, you kinda don't. There are a few other action packed things sprinkled in afterwards, but nothing challenging. Some fights are straight up annoying and tedious rather than challenging, but the most infuriating part is that the minigames are easy to miss. I don't mind looking around or exploring, but if you're not checking every single corner or climbing to the top of every shelf, you'll miss a good bit of them. Some are super basic, not worth doing, or very one sided (mostly the ones a the beginning).Although the game is $20, you can't play it alone and you have to play it with someone else. This is kinda remedied by the fact that the friend pass is free, however there is only one save file and you have to go through tedious folder swapping if you want to play through it with different people. I suppose it's not meant to be played more than once, or with more than one person. Once you've played it through, you'll basically have to sit there and do nothing if you play with another person, otherwise it's just too easy and they don't get to experience the fun aspects of screwing up and killing each other over and over lol. There's no way to save the game which is absolutely UNBEARABLE if whoever you're playing with DC's or has to leave mid-level. Despite the game saying that it is ""saving"" at the shorter cutscenes, it actually doesn't! So if you quit the game and pick it up later, you'll have to start the entire level over again. It's even more annoying because cutscene skipping doesn't exist. I also found it odd that the game lagged quite a bit for me and the other person playing it, regardless of who was hosting, at certain spots. It was never unplayable and didn't persist for more than 20-30 seconds, but I'd expect no lag, especially on a game that is less graphically intense than most other high-end games.There are some GOOD things with the game. If you explore and play the minigames, I think it has maybe 8 to 10 hours of gameplay. The game is beautiful, has some funny moments, some cute moments, and you'll definitely have fun with whoever you play it with. Unfortunately, at the full price, crappy ending, and mediocre gameplay past the 1/3rd mark, I would suggest getting this on a deep discount, if at all."

We had a good time getting through the platforming and solving the puzzles together. Overall we enjoyed the experience. I would say it made our relationship stronger, but it was already perfect coming into the game ;) The one critique I would have is that the game seemed to drag on longer than it needed to. All chapters were entertaining and independent of one another however, some stages didn't need to be as long as they were. All in all, this game is good for testing your teamwork and patience with somebody. The length of the game keeps it so both players need to stay committed to beat it."

I know most people would disagree, because it doesn't offer groundbreaking visuals, and it is 'made for kids' (Whatever that means...), but it does offer a whole new experience that I have never seen from another game! I think the best way to describe it is 'a series of smaller games that all come together to tell one big story'. Speaking of 'story'; You're playing as either Cody or Mae, a young couple that lost the spark of their relationship and are contemplating getting a divorce. After being turned into dolls by the hands of their daughter and an anthropomorphic book named Dr. Hakim (Yes, it's a wild ride!), the couple travels through several awe-inspiring and breathtaking worlds to try to rekindle the flame of their relationship and stay together. Couples' therapy through cOlLaBoRaTiOn!1!!11! In each world, Cody and Mae get a new special power that only works in said world, and they're gonna have to work together to overcome obstacles and move on. Each world also focuses on a unique gameplay style. There is flight simulation, melee combat, third-person shooting, and much more! It Takes Two really is a game you need to try, especially with a friend (Who can play for free remotely, using the game's Friend pass, by the way)! At a lower price point than your average triple A game, It Takes Two offers so much more than Call of Duty, FIFA, and all the others!"

Can't ask more for a game.Her: Yeah, for real though.Story hit home for both of us in a way that moved both of us to tears. We both absolutely recommend this gem of a game.

7251,mai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shapimai/,No,1,1,13.4,June,"27,",445,0,1,和尼宝把双人成行打通了主要是我够懒 3月26发售6月27打通 整整用了三个月的时间 但其实游戏时间也就只有15小时但是确实是继逃出生天(A WAY OUT)之后最棒的双人游戏，制作人Fares(逃出生天其实也是他做的)说的不好玩退一千刀确实是有底气说的出口的15个小时里做进去了大概20个左右的大场景，每个场景都有自己的特色，玩法上一脉相承逃出生天的co-op双人合作模式，并且这一作还加入了各式的道具，每种类型的道具也有特定的用处，两个玩家要互相配合，并且使用道具才能推进剧情，所以十几个小时下来也并不觉得枯燥。并且在推进游戏的过程当中一路会遇到各种双人友尽对战小游戏，并且中间还加了一段固定视角RPG，甚至还可以下国际象棋，按内容上来说塞得足够满，确实做得足够诚意，也足够用心，这一点就真的值回票价。美中不足的是剧情有点拉稀，并且游戏的定位有点摸不着头脑spoil warning剧情讲的是形同陌路的夫妻在两个玩家的操控下，进入了一个缩小的世界经历一连串的冒险，然后在冒险当中被对方感动得无以复加，再然后相互啵嘴破镜重圆（至少结局是和好）的故事，我玩得时候其实一直在挠头。一个是像我这种悲观人很难去想象即将要离婚的夫妻会因为一个十小时的冒险经历而复合，另外一个就是游戏很侧重去描写他们的女儿不忍心自己父母离婚的场面，甚至在最后还要尝试离家出走(我觉得是以一种小孩式的威胁)的方式来让父母撤回决定，然后从冒险里回来的父母就为了女儿，决定不再离婚——宣扬的观念有问题，这我觉得就是赤裸的绑架两个人合不合是性格和三观决定的，如果本身性格不合，那经历了十个小时的冒险我觉得也没有多少意义，激情过后还是要生活的，但是冒险并没有消除矛盾，就如同国内千万家庭一样，形婚十几年之后就如同陌路人，如果为了女儿而强行留在一起就是延长了这份痛苦而已，以后的不和的时候真的只会更多——要离的早晚都会离的，没离的要不是一方麻木了，就是拿刀把对方给捅了所以我真的很难想象一个美国团队能做出这种有着中国传统家庭观的游戏，真的觉得高院和民政部也别搞什么离婚冷静期了，引进这个给离婚的人玩就够了 所以我觉得剧情上要做到无懈可击，还得要从化解矛盾至少在对话上要剖析不和入手，但是这对于一款游戏来说确实有点苛刻了是吧。定位上，刚开始我看着像童话一样的风格觉得应该是给年轻朋友至少是适合8+的小鹏宇游戏的，如果是什么父子玩我都承认是款卟错的亲子作品；结果越到后面越儿童邪典了吧？直接分尸小象我一个成年人都感到不适，什么打到一半内脏炸裂的机械蜜蜂，为了洗地板狂揍会哭的云，还有什么没有头的管弦乐队，确 确实不是给小鹏宇玩的..9/10不过总体还是瑕不掩瑜，今年还是3A小年，如果没有什么强力的竞争者我觉得GOTY甚至都可以。并且前作逃出生天我觉得也很棒，强烈安利，但是能爽玩这一类coop游戏前提是还是得有一个跟你玩的固定朋友

The variety in this game is crazy; each part of the game is unique to the point that each chapter could be a different game. Characters can seem pretty dumb at times but they work well with the overall tone of the game and both main characters become much better as the game progresses. The pacing is also great, and is made so that the changes in the characters as the story progresses is believable. Visually stunning; great mix of pixar-like cartoony characters and realistic environments, and some areas that are just beautiful. As an added bonus, there are lots of little details, a lot of optional exploring and mini-games that can be done, and a lot of references to other games. 10/10 made me laugh a lot."

7339,Zache,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zacheh/,No,,1,13.5,April,"10,",263,0,1,"This review will contain ZERO spoilers for It Takes Two, this is a review for players who are thinking about buything It Takes Two.It Takes Two is a action adventure platform game with split-screen cooperative mulitplayer, singleplayer mode is not an optionin this game. The game is developed by Hazelights Studios based in Stockholm Sweden and they gave us Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and A Way Out.-So much passion and love was put into this game and you can really feel it, feeling such a passion for a game is rare which is why it has such an unique charm.-Only one person need to buy the game, that person can then invite the other one with a friend's pass. This just proves that they didn't make A Way Out for money.-Immersive and engaging story from beginning through end.-A good soundtrack and an fantastic theme song.-It Takes Two always gives you new tools, powers and it lets you explore completly new, different and unique environments after every chapter. This makes the game fun from beginning to end and it never gets repetitive.-It Takes Two is extremly long, roughly around 11-13 hours long even if you decide to play it quick. Based out of the content in this game, 11-13 hours is a lot more that I ever expected.-It Takes Two is based of Cody and May, the character development within these two is written extremely well.-It Takes Two has fun small mini games that you can find throughout your playthrough, you can play these with your partner.-Amazing graphics with an unique, special but good style to it.-The voice actors in this game did an excellent job portraying the characters.-Without spoiling the ending, it was really hyped up and a good ending to this beautiful game.-This is sadly one of those games that you finish one or twice and never play it again.-Although I personally loved this game, I can still definitely see that this game has a special style of it that isn't for everyone.-Unlike Hazelight Studios big hit A Way Out, It Takes Two misses the opportunity to make choices together with your partner. It's understandable why they decided to not add this feature but it would've added something extra to this masterpiece.Although it's rare every once in a while you play a game that is so fantastistic that you simply can't get your mind out of it, It Takes Two is one of those games. I am sure I will think back to when I played this game in 20 years, the experience me and my partner had when playing this masterpiece was a fantastic once in a lifetime feeling. I have close to no bad things to say about this game, the only big and sad thing with this game is that you only play it once before leaving it and never touching it again but that really shouldn't stop you from trying this out. As a person who spends 8-10 hours per day on my computer just playing games, as a person who have played hundreds and hundred of difference games I can proudly say that this game is without any doubt my top 10 games. There's no chance I won't give this game a 10/10, thank you Hazelights Studios."

I have only played for 5 hours so far but I have found nothing to critique. Each section feels creative and unique with new ideas and abilities to master. The mini games throughout help keep things competitive although you are trying to work cooperatively. There is so much to explore without feeling overwhelmed by large collection logs or huge discoverable areas. The gameplay and puzzles throughout throw you challenges but allows for people newer to video games to be able to learn quickly as to not be discouraged. The story is magnificent and you quickly will feel immersed after no time at all. Long have my buddy and I been searching for a coop game that can satisfy all the qualities that ""It Takes Two"" provides. This is truly an all-around coop experience for all levels of friendship or relationship that will put your team-work to the test. For $40 both you and whoever you want can play and explore the many hours of  visually-appealing gameplay. Do not forget to work with CO-LLA-BO-RATION! Enjoy!"

7360,Clarridge42,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Clarridge42/,No,,1,15.9,April,"2,",187,0,1,"Played this game with my wife and we had and absolute blast. The gameplay itself is varied enough to keep staying fresh throughout, the mini games littered in each level gave a little break to relax and have less puzzle solving fun, and the levels were brilliantly thought up designed and put together. We bought two copies and played it that way together because I assumed that would remove the screen from being split, which it didn't...and at first I thought I didn't really like that design choice but as levels progressed it made it really easy to see what the other person is doing or looking at and in some puzzles almost a necessity to make it through without being an absolute headache. Maps were large enough in some places to feel like you had a solid free roam area to explore and the transitions were great. Even though the levels vary so much in design and look, I never felt like I was in a weird place for no reason or that it was a level just chopped in to cover any tropes. The humor was great, the banter between the two felt really good and I've always been a sucker for a game that can make you feel something without it being forced or contrived. I will admit *no spoilers* that the ending didn't quite feel as earned as it could have, and there was at least one major instance I felt like I might not be rooting for the main characters and it kind of stuck with me through the remainder of the gameplay, but I'm no writer, so who am I to tell anyone it wasn't to character. Loved the game from start to finish and look forward to any game these great people com,e out with in the future."

This is hands down Game of the Year, and I wish more developers made games with a fraction of the creativity that this game has.

7389,gertaarl,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995336982/,1,,0,10.2,January,12,185,0,1,"I love cooperative games.  Be they Action Role-Playing Games, team shooters, escape rooms, or strategy board games-- cooperative gaming is my jam.  I like a game to have clever puzzles, or intense battles where you can barely eke out a victory through coordination and teamwork.I am critical of the stories we tell and receive in our media/art.  I appreciate subtle storytelling, well-crafted worlds, dynamic characters, and drama.  Biting commentary?  Wild sarcasm?  Slapstick comedy?  Pop culture references?  They all have their place, and I adore them when used properly.So how does It Takes Two fall flat at almost every hurdle?  It's almost an accomplishment in itself.  I loaded up the Game of the Year 2021 expecting at the very least to be entertained by dynamic characters, environments, cooperative challenges.  Instead, the prevailing emotion I felt playing through with my friend was boredom, aspiring occasionally to frustration or annoyance.  The protagonists are introduced and they are not likable.  That's fine-- this can be fertile ground for drama, right?  Tension and resolution?  You learn to appreciate their foibles, and they grow together, and eventually overcome their differences?  Not exactly.  The resolution, when it comes, feels unearned.  The characters don't so much grow as they are body-snatched in the last chapter.  These are pod-people of the characters as they were even ten minutes earlier.  In the end, player agency is utterly stripped, and one cannot help but feel that these two just rummaged around in their attic until they got thirsty enough to stick it out for another six months before getting divorced.When not ""advancing"" the ""story"", they are abusing one another, shouting the answers to ""puzzles"" at one another within moments of arriving at a given situation (meanwhile the UI is also shouting at you which button you should press to pursue this goal).  They mock one another for their performance and shortcomings relentlessly.  The disbelief to be suspended to accept the resolution of the plot arc is... unreasonable.The writing for the protagonists is poetry compared to that of the antagonist, Dr. Hakim, about whom the less said, the better.So the characters aren't great.  The comedy falls flat and drama feels... bad.  The writing isn't great, is the gist.  There's still a lot of great cooperative gameplay, right?Well, no.  The game tries to be ten or so different types of game, but none of them (good or bad) is given room to breathe and develop into an experience.  As a result of the shifting genres, the game's UI has to broadcast your controls pretty much constantly.  There are no fewer than four vehicle sections-- I know I am of a particular PTSD type group still suffering from Half Life 2.  I recognize my bias against vehicle levels.  But some poor bastards spent hours and hours of their lives animating and coding frogs, spiders, an airplane made of garbage.  And then writing dialogue and jokes(?) about them, all for two minutes of gameplay that is somehow both fleeting and interminable.While there were precious few instances of fun to be had (I am remembering moments of the ARPG and rhythm game sections), they are terribly brief, and far outnumbered by worse.  Tedious and/or obvious puzzles, clunky platforming, and quicktime events are followed by cutscenes that feel like they ought to have been player actions.All of this innovative gameplay sits atop an often beautiful world that begs to be explored while simultaneously refusing to reward the players for doing so.  Maybe the real rewards was the divorce we made along the way.I openly applaud the accessibility of the game.  Had there been any consequences for death, the sometimes baffling control decisions or badly designed platforming combined with performance issues would have been unforgiveable.  I wouldn't recommend it to gamers looking for a challenge of any type.The game is quite pretty.  At its best it is a weird intersection of garry's mod and Little Big Planet.  At its worst, it is boring, poorly-written, and creepy."

Played this game with my wife (non-gamer) and would not recommend for anyone else in the same situation. I thought this would be a fun co-op with the wife, but it caused more frustration than anything. First level was nice, second level ramped way up, and third level was rage quit. The camera control was too difficult for her and there is no enemy indication so when she came back to life she would die spinning around trying to find the mid level boss just to die again as soon as she saw him. So if you plan to play with someone and introduce them to gaming I would not recommend this one. If they are already a gamer then I can see this as a fun co-op. There is no game play difficulty to help ease them in... save your marriage and steer clear."

I'd rate it a C+But with ~95% positive ratings on steam, I can't say it's that good.PROS: the visuals, art, world and game design are top notch AAA quality. There are some truly beautiful levels. The gameplay is so varied it's like 30 games in one. It's very well polished with not a single noticable bug or glitch when I played. And there is a TON of content. My 16 hour playtime was 1 playthrough, and I skipped most of the optional minigames.So why not recommended? Why not say it's good? Because the flaws of the game run so deep through the entire experience, tainting it all.CONS1) The writing. The entire story makes you feel like you're trapped and being punished into playing the game. It's all pretty one-note from start to finish, there are no twists, no turns Just 15 hours of a story that could be summarized in 1 sentence. You can guess the entire plotline 15 seconds into the intro cutscene. The main characters and their child are wholly unlikable. I hated spending time with them, hated listening to them whine about their trivial problems ""you didn't compliment my gardening, waahh"". I had no sympathy for them at all, and couldn't get invested in their journeys or the stakes of the story. Cody is a contemptible loser, and May only seems OK in comparison to him.2) The gameplay: Yes, it's one of the ""PROS"" too. Because the variety of gameplay is the only thing that makes it bearable. Every time I was bored out of my mind and wishing the game would be over, there was a complete change in gameplay that gave it a little more life to keep going. It's a mishmash of gameplay from every other game out there. There's puzzles, platformers, shooters, action-adventure, etc. If it's been in an old arcadey console game before, then you'll get a chance to play it here.Between 1 & 2, I just kept wanting the game to be over already. But we'd committed too deep already and just wanted to finish the damn thing.Just to give an example of how hateable the main characters are, I'll have to spoiler:I truly wanted these two to lose, die, fail, get divorced. They are both awful and toxic, and the kid probably would have been better if she had run away from the two monsters who danced and laughed in her tears.So why still a C+ rating? Well look at the PROS again.  The visuals, art and world are beautiful. And the fact that there was so much variety of gameplay that I still played 16 hours instead of uninstalling is a testament to how fun the gameplay can be."

But we went into this game under the impression that it was a fun, happy-go-lucky co-op game to snuggle up on the couch with. We did not sign up for forced torture of screaming innocents. (Shoutout to the game being Rated T for Teen by the way). So that one scene completely soured the majority of our playthrough when the game expects us to sympathize with and cheer on these characters afterwards.On the plus side, the gameplay itself is fun, most of the ideas in the game feel innovative and fresh. The controls are smooth and the gameplay transitions are impeccable. But on the other hand, the story itself felt weak, the character development was practically non-existent, and the game offered little insights on what it really means to be a parent / spouse. Unfortunately for my fiancee and I, the pretty graphics and imaginative world weren’t enough to drown out the apathy created by poor storytelling and unnecessary dark humour."

Everything just worked, playing with two controllers in local co-op. The graphics are nice, the physics are very nice right from the beginning. The cons: The game didn't have any sort of skill progression in the 61 minutes I played. Doesn't seem to be a part of it. Also, this game is purely co-operative, there is no individual competition between the characters (as far as I can tell from the short time I played).The real negative is this: Between the chapters, there appears this book character which teaches actual lessons abort relationship, about love, cooperation and so on. I understand that this is part of the story and I play a character that is planning to go through divorce and so on ... BUT. My SO and I like couch co-op and we loved Trine 2, despite it being a bit childish and cheesy. This book character was just too much for us. The game has pretty good review statistics, so I seem to be the only one. But we can't help it. For us, it is Impossible to enjoy the game like this.

It has a ton of games from other games within it from sunset overdrive rail grinding,to some arpg.  Highly recommend this.

Probably around 11.5 hours if we stop killing each other.

(one moment ur zipping through an underwater world using magnets as propulsion, the next your crawling through a top down RPG as a wizard hurling frost bombs.)It take's Two is a GEM, the devs put some heart and soul into this one, and ive enjoyed every bit of it.With the friends pass i do recommend this game at full price its worth every penny.One side note to the dev, what in the cheek grabbing sam heck were yall THINKING with the elephant scene, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was so cringe and fricked up, i know dudes its just a cartoon but daaaymn."

When playing online and not local there are multiple parts in the game where it's extremely frustrating due to latency issues (or perhaps just horrible controls), and there's at least one point where I've been flat out soft-locked by some dumb programming that disabled all my controls until I restarted at ""last checkpoint"" and had to re-do five minutes of stuff to get back there. Additionally there are tons of mini ""PVP"" games and so far almost every one has been horrible.The story is quite abysmal as well with an extremely idiotic couple of main characters and a story that goes from ""Sure, that's alright"" to ""You're kidding, right?"" quite quickly. I'll be utterly baffled if this can somehow pull itself together by the end, but as it is I've been finding that both the gameplay and story have been taking a nose-dive as I get further. I'm pretty baffled by how much people enjoy this game. If this were a single player game I would've quit it an hour or two ago playtime-wise."

Action, adventure, comedy, romance, heartbreak, you name it and it has it. I never leave reviews but after completing this game (14 hours of game-play btw) I felt an obligation to give this game what it deserves. I didn't discover a single issue with this game, no audio/visual bugs, no glitches, no issues with connection for my gf who played the game via friend's pass (also an insanely good idea, the fact one person can buy the game and another plays for free is just... ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ great). If this game was £60 it's worth it, I'd even say as good as £70, so the £30 something I paid is a steal. Now we've completed the game, we are going to replay it as the other character, as it's essentially a different game (for Cody/May). Support the dev's as these dev's actually have fantastic ideas and know how to make a game. A good game. A very, very good game. Can't wait for their next one. Also, credit to the actor's, both voice and motion capture's as every level had new/newer animations and nothing felt reused or boring. Not a single dull moment to be had. The comedy timing and delivery throughout this game was spot-on perfect. If any dev's/actor's/anyone who participated in the development/making of this game sees this, hat's off to you.

I get that it is trying to be cutesy by having a kid try to make her parents stay together, but in reality it's not necessarily a bad thing for parents to get divorced. Some people find out that they don't work as a married couple, and they shouldn't stay together. The game continues to force the main characters to stay together, despite their obvious issues. Any ""resolution"" at the end is completely contrived and doesn't feel earned in the least. They're just together because.....well because the game needs them to be because it's the end of the game. Not because they earned it and not because it made sense. This forcing of a relationship is super gross and completely discounts the agency of the characters. Also, a big part of the game involves doing a lot of work to set up a certain situation for one character to do something, despite that character stating REPEATEDLY that they DO NOT WANT TO DO IT. The other characters just laugh it off with comments like ""it'll be fine!"" It clearly is not fine....Beyond the issues with the framing of the game, I have problems with how it controls. For a platformer that relies on jumping from one place/thing to another, the mechanics of this game are very sloppy and not tight in the least. I continually struggled to make a character perform a simple action, simply because of how the character controlled and how floaty the jumping was.This game is good to play with someone who doesn't really game (if you can get over the problematic story), but if you and the person you are planning on playing with are both gamers, I highly suggest you play a better game like Portal 2."

The best aspect of the game in my opinion is how welcoming it is to people who aren't used to playing a lot of games. It cycles through a lot of different genres, at times even fighting and topdown action. The boss fights are the best example of being welcoming to newcomers, as most have all the attacks you'd expect (expanding ring you need to jump over, shadows on the ground indicating an attack from above, heavily telegraphed swipes to jump over etc) so it's a nice training exercise for the newbie. This game excels I think with one experienced and one non-experienced player. That being said, the story in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and the cutscenes take up a shockingly large amount of your playtime. The characters are annoying as hell, and the premise itself is beyond childish, bordering on problematic. Sometimes adults should get divorced. The game itself is also just way too ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long. It starts off really well, putting you into environments that are clearly a part of your house/yard. All of the garage/attic(I think?) bits were great, the tree was pretty good, and as was Rose's room. Everything afterwards just gets ridiculous, and it just feels like padding after a while. I can only take so much of the samge puzzle platforming gameplay with a new gimmick. The clock and snowglobe, I mean, cmon now. If this was half the length, I may have wanted to replay the game with someone else, but as it is now, I'll be lucky to even finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing. Also that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ book is a piece of ♥♥♥♥."

Not cooperative games based on shooting things together, and not ""cooperative"" games where you're forced to fight each other. Cooperative games where you actually, you know, work together. And this game? This game has that. Boy does it have that. You really do have to cooperate, and it's executed amazingly. Superbly. Artfully.The level designs and puzzles are stunning. ""Eureka"" moments in video games are what give me life, and there are many of them in this game. It looks and plays beautifully, and though there were a few moments that frustrated me, and even some puzzles or mechanics I don't think I quite got, on the whole, I would say that, gameplay wise, this cooperative platformer/puzzler is executed wonderfully.What's even better is that you do not have to buy this game twice. You buy it once, and then anyone who has the entirely free friend's pass can play the entire game with you. How amazing is this?But I can't and I won't recommend it. Ever.(Spoilers ahead.)************I lived my life in an abusive family. I am on the spectrum, so I see the world a little differently. My only friends were the dolls and toys I had, because I just didn't know how to connect with people. And even those rare times where I was able to let people past my shell, my family's absurd and shocking habits would eventually scare these friends away.Cody and May are abusive parents. Full stop. They are cruel, mean, little people, and I had to spend the entire game playing one of them when, frankly, I didn't want to. They are terrible people, and they never get better. They never realize that what they are doing is ultimately harmful to themselves and their daughter. They never take strides towards being better people. They. Never. Apologize. For one thing they do.It may seem strange, even childish, for me to say that I wanted to stop after what they did to Cutie. I wanted to stop and never play again. I forged ahead, tense, angry, confused. Desperately hoping they would make this up to their daughter. Because while it is not outright stated, I believe their daughter is on the spectrum, and as such her toys may be her only friends. As mine were.They didn't. I don't assume they had anything to do with the band-aids keeping Cutie together in the ending credits.I am not a mother. My own scared me off from the prospect. But if I was, I can damn well tell you that I'd never willingly want to make my child cry to help myself. There is very little in the world that would get me to try and make my child cry, especially in such a heartless, terrible way.It's really a shame, because this game has some amazing sequences. Some outstanding puzzles. The controls are tight. I was left breathless in the music levels - as the song I and my husband composed was integrated into the soundtrack, and at the very end where we were using our controls for that awesome club party in a very Warioware-esque way. (Even though I found the ending to that level - and the game - lackluster. They wrote amazing music and we're left with a lyricless ""la la"" song for May to ""sing""? Talk about dropping the ball...)I had high hopes that I may replay this game with my best friend, but I don't think I can bring myself to do that. Because I don't want to help Cody and May. They don't seem to want to help themselves. If they had an ounce of recognition and contrition for what they had done... but they don't. And it left a sour taste in my mouth, and a pit in my stomach that returns whenever I think about this game."

I suspect my partner would give a thumbs up for this game due to graphics and some small delightful gameplay here and there, but other than that, perhaps we both dislike it.First of all, Do not play this game if you have poor tolerance of bad accents. There are two characters (out of the four main ones) who have really really bad and seemingly fake accents. Having to put up with them is painful. You'd be enjoying gameplay and once you hit a cutscene you just want to mute the game.The puzzles are largely about ninja-roping here and there and gliding. It's quite Trine-esque, except half the characters are annoying. If you're an adult, you'd probably dislike that the characters give you zero time to figure out the puzzle yourself. They'd be talking out loud to each other on what you need to do, so you don't exactly have to think... for a puzzle game.Some parts of the game has delightful paths . But sometimes you'd like to think you can venture elsewhere on the map but it's just not possible.It feels like a kids' game.. and yet it isn't. There are some parts which can be pretty scary and inhumane .But, if you want a no-brainer, two-player, adult-required-finesse, and annoying voice-acting game, perhaps this is for you.

It's not-so-subtle undertones are distracting. There were many parts where the story just feels so fake because she is just an awful character and it doesn't feel natural.

Eg: easy/normal/hard => if you just want to play game because of storyline (not because you're gamer) - you will be disappointed.Now we stuck on episode ""fight with toolbox"", because there isn't enough saves before you reach toolbox.This game looks like a waste of money for me."

Half the time the interaction is basically just opening doors. There was always one solution to everything, and it was typically an extremely straight forward use of the ~2 powers you had. Some of the boss fights were actually pretty good, and there were occasional moments of fun gameplay, but they passed quickly and left you back on the slog of you and your friend running to the next interactable, pressing the button, and then running to the next interactable again. As for the story, there was one part that I was surprised in a good way by, but aside from that it was really not that interesting, and the characters annoyed us quite a bit.It's beautiful, there's clearly a lot of artistic work put into it, but I can't say that I was having fun for the majority of my playtime."

Abilities that you get at a frequent pace, with each new section offering new mechanics to learn in order to succeed on to another new section, with another new ability. The story was better than I probably give credit for.

Had no problems at first BUT ONLY UNTIL the first boss (vacuum cleaner). My gf with the Friend's Pass experience unbelievably long lags thus we can only poorly respond to the boss (she tried lowering all graphics settings to the lowest but to no avail). We could not attack the boss fast enough due to her lags.I also often could not mount the vacuum cleaner weapon. Even after pressing E repeatedly, what happens afterwards is only an animation of my character about to mount the weapon, but then slipping from the weapon back to the ground. Then the time is up and we could not attack the boss.After a considerable amount of time (due to the errors above), the vacuum cleaner boss does not stop stomping the ground at all. Thus we could not even progress as we did not get the opportunity to attack with the vacuum cleaner weapon anyway.My laptop is a gaming laptop with i7 11th gen, 16GB RAM, RTX 3060. My internet connection is fairly fast.My gf's laptop also has i7 and 16GB RAM. Her internet is much faster and better than mine.Seeing that many other people in Reddit has similar problems with glitch, I believe this is either the game's fault or Origin's fault or EA server's fault.Unbelievably unplayable. Me and my gf had great expectations and was looking for so many fun date nights playing this game. Now it's only disappointment. I requested a refund immediately.Two thumbs down."

It's extremely linear for the first 2/3 of the game and doesn't get much better towards the end. the entire point of the game is to solve incredibly easy puzzles. It's essentially a mashup of several different video games rolled in a shiny looking game. It's extremely boring if you're any kind of a gamer. If you've never picked up a video game before this may be the game for you though.  I've been playing this with my gf and we both can't stand turning it on.

Graphics aren't everything to me. What makes a game great is what's below the surface, and this had little. So the goal is about trying to keep two parents together that are planning on getting a divorce- by forcing the mom and dad to use teamwork to get out of a pickle. Right there we didn't need any of that. Let them get a damn divorce if they're miserable. It's weird that the kid seems written as responsible for their parents' happiness, and becomes in charge of saving their marriage. Just red flags everywhere. That just seems really weird to put that on a kid character, I don't understand the target audience with that at all. And don't get me started about that book character. Oh god, anytime that character appeared my friend and I were just like, ""oh god not this again"". The game would be great if it weren't for the poor story, the cringey stereotypes and unbearable dialogue and one-liners. We couldn't even finish the game, couldn't take any more.One last thing I'd like to add: To compare this game to Portal is absolute blasphemy, I tell ya! Portal had so many more dimensions and integrated much more clever writing and creative storytelling than this dim-witted, predictable, codependent, marriage counseling deprived, weird abomination This game is NOT like Portal."

But there's a lot for me not to like here. The game is really a wide collection of small games, except none of them are really polished... because that's what you get when you don't dedicate enough time to make the game be good at one thing.But what is just horrible, and I hope few people complain about because they are just too young, is the story and the characters. The elevator pitch is very good, but once we get into the details, it's as if they had left the writing to the programmers. The two main characters are neither likable nor interesting. Another character that shows up all the time is the most annoying thing since Jar Jar Binks, and a horrible stereotype that makes Speedy Gonzalez look progressive and modern. If anything, just based on the characters, it'd make sense for the couple to join together in their hate for this hateful caricature that appears to be some form of psychopath. But no, they are going along with this, and reach the ending for... no actual reason. I guess it's time to end the game, let's make them want to stay together! There are no story beats that change any character, or that make anything work.I am perfectly happy to play games with no story at all. Or even a forgettable story that is in the background. But this game dedicates a lot of time to a terrible story. The game would be better without dialogue. I would have told you that this is the worst story I have played in my decades of gaming.... except 12 minutes also came out in the same year. This is ending of Game Of Thrones level of nonsense: I was half way expecting David Benioff to have writing credits here. Hell, David Cage might do a better job."

It is too easy and holds your hand the whole way through. If my friend and I had known - we would not have purchased the game. But all the reviews praised it and almost everywhere the game received a high score - So we've bought it and I then felt that I had been set up.In addition, the game requires you to install Origin. In order to play - you need to open both Steam and Origin. Feels very unnecessary and inefficient. In addition, the connection in Origin was almost never smooth and always summed up to a few minutes of waiting. Sometimes we couldn't find each other, and one of us had to exit and re-enter Origin.The levels are very diverse and the music is excellent. There were two or three stages that my friend and I enjoyed, but most of the time the challenges weren't real challenges, and we felt like we were playing a child's game.The lines were very cheesy and unpolished, and the characters felt really stupid and ignorant.to sum up: this game is excellent for children and for couples where at least one of them is not a gamer.Otherwise, I would recommend looking for another game.I am very uncomfortable giving a dislike, since I can recommend this game to some of the people.

I have over a hundred games on my steam account and, for full transparency, am writing this on my girlfriend's account since she got the game. I'm not on some high horse, I just have some things about this game I find important to say.A lot of people I've seen leaving negative reviews here bring up the scene with the elephant, so I thought I'd address that first. If you haven't played the game, and don't want spoilers, I'll stay general here, but the gist is that it is an unnecessarily traumatic scene that is glossed over and is one of the worst feeling moments in any game I have ever played. I don't mean that in a good way, either, I mean it in the way that this game to me was brought down by the inclusion of this part of the game.The rest of the story itself is rather harmless, where the game really shines is the gameplay and how fun it is to play with two people. That's the main selling point, right? And it is, to be fair, reasonably fun. However, the largest and most unavoidable problem in this game, and the one that's the other most complained about issue in the reviews section, is EA and the Origin launcher. Our experience with this (me and my grilfriend) was absolutely horrendous. Today, we completely lost the ability to even launch the game, and so we have ended our time with it. I find this a fitting end to our time with the game, as we got about 2/3 through before the hassle of the launcher became no longer worth it.Finally, glitches run rampant in this game. The game breaking ones are rare, but ones that completely shatter your immersion are commonplace. I find this important because of the lack of transparency EA has with this issue, a common issue with most EA games. Overall, bearable. 5/10"

One better player can definitely carry a lower skilled player thanks to the way life respawns and checkpoints work.The story was horrible. Slow, boring, annoying accents... we kept yelling ""BBQ"" at each other anytime a cutscene would start.(Because controller players need to hold B and keyboard players Q to skip them).The voice actors were good, but some of the accents were hit or miss. For us, we found both Hakim and May to be unbearable to listen to, but this is a very subjective opinion. YMMV.The variety and fun of the gameplay was great.Two things I hope they improve in their next game:1- Let us switch which character is on which side of the screen.2- The ""free-roaming"" areas where we can just run/skate/swim around large areas and discover all kinds of cool little things were easily the best parts of the game.

Each themed segment gives a theoretically unique additional mechanic for solving puzzles, but the game treats them more or less identically. All in all, the only reason this game didn't immediately fail is the marketing team's tireless efforts.The game seems to derive its difficulty from interface issues rather than skill challenges. Most of the time, when the player dies its because the camera got shoved somewhere weird, or the game took away a core movement ability. The length is similarly artificial, with each of the ""innovative"" segments being repeated far too many times.All in all, the game is neither interesting nor fun.

Every time I tried to launch it, I accumulate one or two minutes of ""play time"" in steam -- what a joke. I don't know why a third-party app is necessary for players to play this game on steam.

The entire game seemed to lose steam as it went on, with end of the game being a load of ""references"" and what felt like rushed game play.The main redeeming factor was the design of some of the levels, making them fun to explore, but once we exhausted these areas there wasn't much more going for it.Chess was 10/10, I kicked my friends buttOverall 5.5/10, it does A LOT of things somewhat ok, but nothing very well."

Many games operate by introducing a mechanic and then going deeper and deeper into the uses of that mechanic or introducing new ones on top of the old ones, progressively getting harder and forcing you to learn and master the mechanics to proceed.In It Takes Two, the bar is constantly being set back to the beginning, with very few mechanics carrying over. While this by itself isn't a bad thing, and I think the rapid changes in mechanics works especially well in the first two chapters, the way the rest of the game is designed made it feel very flat by the end.Most of the abilities you gain end up just being a different flavor of clicking on something when the game tells you to click on it, without much thought or creativity being required. All the other abilities and mechanics seem to stay surface level, so when I did find one I liked, it never pushed the boundaries of what was possible before the next chapter began and I was back to square one."

This confusion is frustrating because it wastes so much time for the two. While one is downloading, the other does nothing but waiting, not to mention that the game is 50G, not something you can just buy and play without a fuss.Second, is the complexity of EA-Steam bundle. The EA's origin requires ""the platform client overlay enabled"", which is to say that you should not only acquire the Origin's account, not only for you but also your partner, who don't know much about software and have to depend on you. Also, it requires that you must launch the game from Origin, instead of from Steam, where you bought it in the first place, so as to allow Origin in-game service, which is also a prerequisite for online gaming. Complicated and frustrating. It's like you queue up for a whole day just to see a show that lasts for 5 minutes, which might not be interesting at all. All these software settings and account setting just kills all the fun.Why didn't I just bought it from Origin in the first place? And why there is not any clear clue what should I do regarding this special two-character game?Most importantly, is the unfriendly design of autosaving points. The saving points are mostly located at crucial story points, such as after a boss fight or after ending a long journey to somewhere. However, this type of autosaving point is rather disturbing when the two players are located in different countries or regions, in my case, one in Hong Kong and the other in mainland China. Whenever one's network condition got poor, the whole gaming session is automatically terminated and we had to play the whole part of the game all over again from the previous saving point, which might account for at least 15-minute work. Imagine all the 15 minutes' hard work suddenly vanishes, and how it might irritate us. Not to mention that the story-telling animations in the game CANNOT BE SKIPPED. We had to watch the animations all over again, which is totally a turn-off. If both got perfect network condition then it's totally fine, but the design of the gaming is downright inconsiderate towards many of us who do not enjoy an all-time stable connection, but it can be solved by allowing manual saving at most points of the game, such as in the game “Death Stranding”, one could save the game whenever you want as long as there is no threat nearby. This makes players feel so secure that they wouldn't worry about their efforts going in vain.Frankly speaking, if your time is really limited and is on long-distance relationship, stay away from the game. There are far better things you can do with your partner than trying to even launch it. Thanks for reading."

Barely functional.Update: After literally 5+ hours of troubleshooting to make this game work, I can review the actual gameplay. That doesn't change the fact that the EA / Origin platform is awful, buyer beware.The story is a bit predictable but pleasant. As far as a narrative-driven game goes, it moves along pretty well with decent pacing. The gameplay is pretty simplistic, and excessively forgiving. If you mess up it barely punishes you at all, in either combat or platforming. But to keep it fresh, you are frequently getting different special abilities that fit the narrative. The cycle of learning and using new abilities keeps it from getting stale, since there isn't really any challenging gameplay to keep up the intensity. This game is very friendly to people who aren't into games that much.Based on the pure gameplay, I'm not so sure about ""game of the year"" kind of accolades. However, a co-op only, 3D platformer is a really unique idea, and one I would love to see more of.

However, if you're an adult and your marriage needs fixing then I doubt you'd be playing video games together. If you're thinking of buying this game to play with your other half, then watch some videos or something. Make sure it's for you (I didn't because I didn't want spoilers). Both me and my significant other decided to refund after an hour or so because we just couldn't relate to it. It's hard to ignore all the above and focus on the game play (I am aware I haven't mentioned the game play) because they are inseparable.PS. It's ok to divorce, people grow in different directions. Staying together for the kids is, and always was, a terrible idea."

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

But mostly, I can't recommend for anyone to play this because seven hours in,there is a point in the story where you torture another character, then have a celebratory dance in the tears of your own daughter and there is no way to choose to not do any of this.  The game has no discussion about this afterward about how maybe they did the wrong thing.  The characters do not feel remorse about it, only stuck on themselves and they move on to the next point of the story to ""get their bodies back.""  At this point, their daughter would be better off with them in an eternal coma and sent off to another person to live with than to have to stay with either of this self-centered narcissistic deadbeats.  I regret this scene being seven hours in so that I can no longer refund the game.The gameplay is fine, but the story just makes you feel like ♥♥♥♥.

The story line is one meant for a kids game- while yes it is about a more serious topic- in the sense of divorce affecting a child- it doesn't mean this game is for adults.

There is no difficultly settings either.This game is not worth the $30 some dollars I got it for- waste of money. Maybe for 15 that would be better. Lets just say I have played better kids games than this- which were more interesting and challenging. It also doesn't even provide much game time- i'm half way through the game at 4 hours.However good quality of the game is the ability to do remote play (only one person needs to get the game), and the art style is quiet pretty.

I am dumbfounded by how terrible it was. I thought the ridiculous understanding of love and companionship of the Book character was satirical, and the characters would somehow emerge with a mature resolution to their situation. But no. Instead, it embraces this wholesale. With an added stupidity of ""oh no the child blames herself and ran away"". WHAT??? I can't remember when I had a piece of media pull the rug on me this hard. I mean, everything else in the game was so beautifully made. The stunning world design, the fresh gameplay mechanics. Even the close detailing of the script, the little dialogues, the acting. It is as if you took a disinterested middle schooler's writing assignment and produced it with the best team of professional artists. You think: ""surely, something good is coming at the end"". And then the ending is just. abrupt. and stupid. And tarnishes the whole experience.Anyway, I still have to recommend it, since the parts that make up this disappointing story are still brilliant. Just brace yourself: there is no payoff at the end. The plot really is that stupid. edit: I am changing the review to ""not recommended"" just to give it some contrast from all the adulation."

The only problem is that you have to kill an elephant who offers you hugs, will listen to your problems, and calls everyone their friend. You rip off the elephants leg and tear off her ear then push her off a cliff to her death. I like dark humor but I think this was a poor attempt at trying to make a dark joke. They make her cry for help and make you feel evil. The game also plays distorted music in the background and the main characters seem to be unphased after killing the elephant. Once you are done killing the elephant you find out you killed her for nothing. Everything else about this game is fantastic but this terrible scene deserved a bad review."

The writing in this game was so awful I was yelling at the characters half the time. Some levels were fun to play, others were frustrating.

The daughter casts a spell on a book of love that turns the parents into dolls on the premise that they need to learn to be friends again - The book of love becomes a creepy, sexually aggressive guide through this endeavour.The whole start of the game we were thinking (hoping?) that this was going the only sensible way - the divorcing couple realises that even if they aren't in love any more, they can still respect each other and take care of their daughter. And the book of love, who is SO awful and pushy and obviously bad, is wrong about what they need and the couple rejects its simplistic, degrading view of relationships.But nope. The book is actually a good guy the whole time, and the simplistic and degrading view is presented by the game as correct. It's childish, pointless, unnaunced and insulting. If you've had experiences in your life with going through divorce, I would imagine this game could be genuinely upsetting with how pathetically it tackles the topic.---Gameplay is a lot more positive. Couch co-op is a bit of a lost art and this game nails it - In each act the two players get different, complementary powerups and use them in clever and creative ways to tackle the obstacles presented. It's challenging enough to be engaging, and yet still not so hard that you're likely to get stuck for ages. You can play this with a partner who isn't as into gaming as you are, and you'll both have a great time. That's hard to do.Controls are tight, mechanics are varied and the pace is kept brisk enough that ideas don't overstay their welcome. Playing through the acts is a fun jaunt and it is well suited to occasional play sessions of a couple of hours - perfect for date night.UNTIL the last third of the game. Very, very abruptly the game adopts a crawling pace. Acts take way longer, with less variety and way more repetition. It is so bad that in the final act of the game, one of the characters comments to the book of love about how endless and repetitive the task list is.---Unfortunately between the horrendous conclusion to the story and the dive in quality of the gameplay in the last third, the game leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. It may still be worth it to many because before that point, it's genuinely great - Certainly if you love co-op games then you may be delighted to see that there's a developer putting so much good work in to create a great co-op experience. Just don't expect it to last."

The only reason i bought this game was because i thought i could play with my friend who has it on the xbox one. After we both install it, we come to find out that even though i have her added on EA and she's on my friends list and in my xbox party through my xbox game bar, we're unable to invite each other in-game. I tried getting the xbox game pass and re-installing the game through the xbox app rather than steam, i thought that if i did that then i could invite her since we're friends through xbox and it would work better than steam but that didn't work either. I finally did some research and found out that this game simply just doesn't have cross platform functionality.I know you're probably thinking i'm stupid for not doing research before buying the game, but i was under the impression that it's no longer 2015 and the developers of a game like this that strongly advertises the whole ""Play anywhere with your friends with the friends pass"" aspect would by default know that there are way too many different gaming devices now a days and the chances of everyone and all their friends having the same console are very low which is why a beautiful thing called CROSS PLATFORM FUNCTIONALITY was invented. Yet the devs decided this isn't necessary to implement into the game upon release or update it to have cross platform functionality in the 2 whole years since this game has been released.The game itself is amazing, i played it for hours and had a blast on split screen on my friends xbox one, which is why i was so disappointed to find out that the only way to play it again with my friend is if i either buy an xbox solely for this game, or physically be at my friends house. It's an amazing and very fun game and surprisingly challenging in some parts, but until the devs decide to put in the work to make it function with other consoles as is expected of every co-op game in 2023, it's unplayable for me and will just be collecting dust in my library unfortunately. Please update for cross platform functionality"

It doesn't really bring anything new to the table gameplay wise. It's story is predictable and the dialog is pretty cheesy at times.

Winning awards, let alone game of the year at multiple outlets. It's almost hilarious how it won family game of the year. It's at most fine. I imagine this game runs and operates fine in local play but online I experienced constant rubber-banding with my co-op partner's character. I've seen the characters go into the walls of wall-jumping platforms. Even if this game was fully functional online I couldn't recommend it. A game with okay mechanics is ruined by some of the worst writing I've ever seen in a game.I'll say the game is very beautiful, the platforming is serviceable and the mechanics are interesting at times. I never found them very challenging or stimulating and never found myself getting stuck but, I get it, it's a game that kids can play so it's not gonna have the hardest puzzles in the world. Really, they made a janky Mario game and put it in co-op. That's all I can say that's positive for me.To fully explain why this game is getting a negative review, it's entirely the writing. While the characters are well-performed, I hate them both. The beginning of the game details how the two primary characters are going through a divorce. The magic of their daughter's tears turn them into a couple of dolls that have to go on a journey to figure out how to turn themselves back. Basic stuff. Except for the fact these characters clearly hate each other. They cannot stop insulting one another and barraging eachother with baggage. Constantly whining, crying and bickering. I don't care about these characters. So much so I didn't even want to finish this game even though there's no challenge to it. For more details about this, I'm going to go a bit into the plot so censored spoilers ahead to read at your discretion.  If the game had given me the option to completely ignore the characters and the story... Maybe I'd recommend it. But I have no idea how this game got this much praise. It made me laugh maybe once.  But the fact that the game is just okay with a bunch of little stuff to do that doesn't get incorporated into actual gameplay but instead just a little side thing to mess around with makes this whole experience feel shallow and rushed. Also, how'd this game get a family-focused award when there's a scene of a character repeatedly shouting expletives? If the story was better, I'd say it'd be worth a brainless playthrough, but honestly, the plot and characters drag this whole game down. I bought this on sale and still feel grifted by the reviews. If this sounds like your thing, go for it, but this one was a gigantic disappointment for me after seeing all the praise it gets."

I can totally see why people really like it: it's very creative, and they really do put the multiplayer to good use. For those who enjoy the game, it 100% has replayability, whether you or the other player trade characters, or if you want to trade on what tasks you do the second time around. It also has fun, little mini games all throughout that are fun to go back to sometimes. I also really enjoyed the boss fights, the different creatures you fought with their special abilities was for sure my favorite part.All of that aside, I thought the game was WAY too long for what it is. I played with a friend, and both her and I were dragging our feet at points to try and finish.

That, however, does not translate into this being a good game.I can only describe this as being something between amazing and appalling on nearly every axis. Character animations are fluid and high detail, yet are often repetitive and un-engaging. Controls are consistent and responsive, yet somehow sluggish and awkward. The world is filled with amazing intricacy with optional areas to enjoy, but transitions within the world feel jarring and moving throughout it is unsatisfying. What this ends up resulting in is a very high focus on the negatives without a sound ability to identify specific portions to criticise. Couple this with a decent number of references to other classic games and this is a fun game for experienced game players to burn, but otherwise a lacking experience gameplay-wise.We found during our nine hours of play time (mostly focused on progression rather than side-activities) that the game lingered on for far too long with both of us agreeing that it probably should have ended four or five hours in. This is odd given game expectations nowadays. Gameplay is quite varied with a number of genres explored that keep the experience fresh. However, most sections have mechanics that last much longer and outlive their initial welcome. This is not helped when mechanics between the two players are often asymmetric (by intention) but are biased in variety and enjoyment towards one of the players. I often felt as though my partner got the better end of the stick, especially when puzzles usually involve taking turns in platforming rather than full cooperation. There are exceptions, but they were few and fair between.Probably the most ludicrous and often berated by the two of us was the story of this game. In concept, the idea of a slowly splitting couple slowly reconnecting after being turned into miniature dolls is an interesting take on cooperation. However, this quickly turned into characters continuously blaming each other for one half of the game before heel turning into loving one another in a manner that seems jarring and forced at a shallow level and mentally concerning the deeper we explored this relationship. This is not helped by a B plot in the story following their daughter exploring the house alone which, combined with the aforementioned animations being simultaneously good quality but lacking direction, nullify any kind of sympathy felt for that character throughout the story.It feels tough for me to be so harsh on this game. I can see the time and effort placed into this. I love some of the innovation and concepts that could have been explored in such a game. But it fails in execution and left me wondering something that no game should leave me feeling: If we enjoyed parts of this game so much, wouldn't we be better off playing separate games that executed on those well instead of this which only brushes upon it? For that, I do not recommend this game for those who wish to enjoy a game with their friend. However, those who are critical and like to examine games as they play them will definitely find fun in It Takes Two."

The enemy faction, so to say, are wasps - and this goes along with lines by the main characters like ""why have you not ""cleaned out"" (aka burned) the hive before"" and it sets a tone as it would be totally okay to burn wasp nests in real life. I know it is a game - but still, promoting that it is okay or ""normal"" to just destroy and kill social insects en masse is such a bad tone. Wasps among other social insects are often endangered, and furthermore they support and help us humans by reducing agricultural pests and, hey, the even hunt mosquitos. Dont get me wrong - the issue is not that you fight wasps, it is this casually set tone of portraying social insects beside bees as something that we should kill and exterminate. Especially in a ""family game"" that is even further out of place.We live in times of biodiversity decline and dramatically shrinking insect populations. Having a fun game setting such a tone is a big let down and a quite saddening approach.Oh yeah - and it forces Origin DRM on you."

(with the notable exception of the very last biome of the game and its weird dancers)After a dozen hours of play, you might end up saying to yourself ""What a great moment I just lived with my best friend, and it was also super cute"" (playing with someone you're not divorcing makes the game more enjoyable), as you're approaching the final cutscene.HOWEVER.It is only at this very moment that you're able to realize the truth depicted by this game's story.Once you wrapped everything up, after hearing 167 times by any of the characters that the divorce is done, after seeing both of them acting despicably in consequence, you end up (spoiler) NOT divorcing. They keep being married and live happily ever after.But at what cost ?Your main foe is that bloody gaddem trouble-generating Book of Love and its sadistic avatar, the infamous Doctor Hakim. You keep on overcoming every challenge the Book places in front of you, and yet HE makes you face more trials, more objects to gather, HE forces you into coming back to a relationship both of you heavily want to end ; basically, HE is making your puppet life as distressful as it can be.And yet, after being ridiculed by the bloody gaddem nerve-racking Book of Love and its enraging avatar, the script ends up making everything HE desires, not both of you. You do not divorce. You do not hear any of the arguments from any of the characters. You're being forced into loving each other after an endless ordeal, and you praise the scumbag for this achievement in the final cutscene. Hakim blesses you.So yes, it was fun, it was creative, I enjoyed several gameplay sequences which were truly entertaining and captivated me until far in the game.But when I think of this game, the one and only memory that comes crystal-clear to my mind is that depressing end.Please consider making both characters burn the book, happily divorce and get Rose at their respective new homes one week out of two, it will also make ground for the writing of a sequel, for which I'm sure lots of couples would gladly pay.If not, you can always avoid finishing the game, it's still quite entertaining between the beginning and the end."

But couples usualy mean people with different skills, platforming experience that look for relaxing game to spend the evening - rather than repeating same moves over and over and having monkey dexterity. Additionaly the camera moves are flawed and makes the platforming part even more tiresome.But above is not the main problem. My wife lost the interest in the game in first two hours, because of unlikable characters and PC bs. She was tired of another PC story showing another man as a clown and pannicking house-husband that jammed the vacum cleaner and couldnt repair it or even carry it to repair..... and his family-sustaining ""stronk and succesful"" wife being unpleasant bi**ch all the time because that somehow makes female characters ""stronk"" in XXI century. Oh yeah and she is ""engineer"" as well (I mean - whatever - but game reminds us that couple of times so lets repeat that again...) and that obviously makes her the only person able to fix the vacum cleaner because..... I dont know - all engineers do that? And thats just the beginning of the story.And no, its not the point that me and my wife are some ""traditional roles"" lunatics or that woman cannot sustain family, be engineer etc. Its hard to explain but both characters are just so unlikable that you dont want to follow their story. Their conversations are not serious, not funny, not even funly-absurd. Just iritating.

The mom and dad are both horrible people who go out of their way to insult and demean each other at every turn. Even when they're in what's essentially a life and death situation they can't even hold back their insults for even a single cutscene. The kid is clearly the most adult person in the room when these two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are around.So playing this with another adult is cringe because you can't get into the story and characters and playing this with a kid feels questionable to me. I've watched the infamous ""elephant cutscene"" and I agree with everyone thumbing this game down for this.

This game will remind you of all your favorite 3D platformers, it has some serious Sonic adventure 2 vibes with rail sliding, its got gravity bending mechanics that will give you mario galaxy vibes,   its got references. The movement mechanics feel fast and smooth and I cant wait to watch speed runs. There is a good amount of content, I'm 5 hours in, and we've been moving pretty quickly, but when i watch the trailer i see we still have quite a bit left. Difficulty is pretty low and so long as you don't both die you'll respawn. Mechanics are mind bending at times, with looping rails, flipping gravity, and at times has a very cinematic feel. Caution if you dizzy easily. so..the bad? As I mentioned before this game will give you fond memories of your favorite games until you realize......there's nothing to collect. Its completely missing the ""collectathon"" aspect normally found in 3D platformers.  You ""find"" minigames that are basically on your linear path and hard to miss. But there are no coins, rings, jigsaw puzzles, stars, moons, feathers, music notes, Gold Bolts, apples, bananas, orbs, charms, or anything else for that matter. and thats really...really sad. I would have had no issues paying full AAA price for this game if it had those mechanics. The story maybe difficult for some people considering it covers a sensitive topic, divorce. This might be painful for some that dont want to relive those memories. Games like these almost dont need a story at all, honestly. The entire story could have been modified as brother and sister, or best friends, and some other event shrunk them down while keeping all the core gameplay mechanics. lastly, EA is the worst publisher for this game. Sony, or Nintendo would have been so much better. at least if you would have went with one of those publishers, you'd actually have a real IP that would last decades. Look at Sony with crash bandicoot, sly cooper, spyro, ratchet and clank, jak and dexter. this would have fit nice. Nintendo, would have been great it has a nintendo feel to it. Look at what EA has done to medal of honor, starwars battlefront, need for speed, command and conquer, SSX, burnout, sims, battlefield...etc etc... EA destroys everything it touches. EA will abandoned this and never look at it again like they do most of their IPs. I really feel bad for the devs."

It is designed to introduce your girlfriend who has never gamed to the medium, and does a good job at it. It has a little bit of everything: platforming, puzzles, shooting, flying, minigamesCONS: if you have any experience with games at all it will be very easy and it can get boring, as the challenge is non-existent. The story is also really childish and not  important, so the plot won't make up for it.The game is in forced split-screen, even though you are playing online. This makes absolutely zero sense because you don't really need it (voice chat is enough), and it should just have been a toggle. I'm on a laptop with a small screen, so this hurts the enjoyment a lot, and it's even worse because it would be such a simple fix.For me this is the deal breaker that made me leave a negative review, I'll be happy to change it if the devs decide to remove split screen."

For starters the developers have never had a girlfriend sit down to play a game with them if they think that fighting with origin, and watching long drawn out non-skippable cut-scenes about divorce is a great way to spend a date night.  I get that you want a theme for the game and all of your puzzles, that's awesome, but the acting and cut-scenes are not ""That"" great and they are quite cringy - just let me skip them.  Lastly, while trying to skip them I started the first chapter over again which is 90% cut scenes, and well - yup GF/Wife was done, Please give this game to a few couples and they will help you fix the beginning experience to allow for quick start - date night style activities.  Camera control was also a bit challenging for a non-gamer and required a bit of patience.Next week, I'll give it a try again, will update review if I can get to the wonderful looking action shown in the trailiers.

Child abuse, torture, and a general broad meanness between the ""protagonists"". Don't play it with your young children unless you've given it a run though. Seriously.I sat down for a quiet night with my partner over a well reviewed award winning game about a couple on the rocks, and working though it in a fantastical setting. I ended at 7 hours having listened to hours of the most servile and mean spirited bickering (somewhat expected, but gods these 2 are petty), several beautiful vistas, and charming art sets, a handful of literal eye sores (I suppose flashing warning should have made the list) a dozen different play styles across ""hit and miss"" and some fun to ""simple but annoying to execute"" puzzles. We ended play shortly after dismembering our daughters living and talking and screaming and pleading stuffed elephant over a couple of minutes of scenes and ""mini-games"". This ending in our daughter weeping over its parts, while we cheer the scene. We promptly run off disinterested when it turns out making her warm tears fall on her stuffed toy we destroyed while she is reeling from her parents talking divorce doesn't magically solve their magical problem. I get the bickering, setting characters, sure. I can almost forgive the literal eye sore levels. But I do not want these 2 parents to get out of this, I definitely do not want them somehow fixing their ""relationship"" - whatever that may have been or will look like, and I certainly got blindsided by the extended fantasy torture and overt child abuse. These 2 narcissists need to split, and their child be raised by someone who does not see them as a piece in a game of one-up-manship. We're probably going to finish it, and I may edit this review it it blows me away how they turn it around. But I can't picture it.As a 2 player platformer: pretty good, solid portal 2 vibes everywhere. Mostly intuitive controls. Pretty zany, almost all fun.As a story presentation: Do I think there should be games that seriously tackle being in a mutually traumatic relationship, child abuse, reconciliation, forgiveness, hope against darkness, the nature of love in the family, and all this great literary *stuff*? Hell yes. But that is not what was on this games box, and its not here at all except in a deeply dreadful way. ""Mummy and daddy must be together for the children"" is the only leg its story is trying to stand on, and its pretty obvious 10 minutes in that is a bad leg, and short while later its pretty clear that the rot has set in."
8020,ZalSC,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018558283/,3,1,0,10.2,December,"27,",169,0,1,"Where do I even get started?My husband and I beat this game in ten hours. I have never approved of a game under 20 hours being sold for so much money. I realize a lot of successful franchises do this (I'm looking at you, Uncharted), but that doesn't mean it's good practice.For that reason alone, I would not recommend this game at full price. While there were a couple of really fun levels in there, I didn't actually like the game. Here's why, without plot spoilers. Only gameplay spoilers.1. You have to install Origin in order to play. For those of you who don't know, Origin is a more intrusive, less intuitive, and less popular game platform similar to Steam. I already had it, but my husband had to install it. (For a game he only played for 10 hours)2. The characters are completely unlikable. May, the wife, and Cody, the husband, are both annoying, petty, selfish and shallow people. There are points in the game where they demonstrate that they're actually bad people. Like, borderline psychopaths. But there are no consequences. And the damned book character is the reason I will uninstall this game and never look back.3. The story has a really, really unhealthy idea of what good relationships are made of. It tries to sell the idea that love solves all problems, and that collaboration can repair broken marriages. The following mentalities are encouraged by the game: - It's fine to blame your spouse when you fail to pursue your passions, because apparently it's your spouse's responsibility to push you toward the things you enjoy. - It's fine to blame your spouse for spending too much time working, even though that's the only thing enabling you to be a stay-at-home parent. - It's fine to pressure your spouse into doing something they don't want to do, because you think they should, and they used to like it so they should obviously still like it.[11:12 PM]4. The gameplay is very linear. Some people like this style of game, but I don't. Every level is basically running in a straight or even curved line, jumping over obstacles, and figuring out puzzles. There are a few more open environments thrown in, but since you are not rewarded for exploration, you tend to ignore it.5. Cutscenes, cutscenes everywhere! There are even cutscenes for your cutscenes. Any time you could have actually been introduced to a cool new environment through exploration, instead you get a cutscene showing it to you right before you get there. This completely nukes the game's overall swift pacing. Your camera is even stolen for three-second cutscenes to show you an objective you were already aiming for.6. It's really hard for me to figure out who this game is actually for. The ""humorous"" dialog was punny at best and juvenile at worst. If you like minion memes made by your grandparents, I'm sure it was hilarious. That's not my genre of humor, and this game was full of that. Yet there was also swearing thrown in at random, and at least two scenes that were shockingly f-ed up. The sudden tonal shift from ""ha-ha fart joke"" to ""holy crap, that's literally murder"" was completely unexpected, and while I enjoy some very dark and shamefully edgy jokes, it felt wholly unwelcome in this context.I won't fault the game for how easy it was, because I think more of a challenge in this type of co-op game can actually cause fights that ruin the experience. It really tried to spice up the level variety too. And a few of the puzzles were great fun. I'm glad my husband and I played, but I would not recommend this game for anyone with emotional sensitivities, immature mindsets (children), or vulnerability to very bad relationship advice."

The story and character writing are honestly just bad. There are levels that are fun, but there's not much of an overarching story, buildup, mystery, or suspense, with the two characters constantly bickering. Other than the first and last levels, you could randomly rearrange them all and it wouldn't have any effect on the story. It's always ""We finished the level but oh, now we have to go do that first"" and ""Ok, we did that but oh, now we have to do this first"", without any real story or character development. This makes the game feel like a chore that drags on for way too long. The gameplay loop only contributes to this feeling. Each level revolves around using different tools/weapons, but as they get taken away and replaced after each level there's no feeling of progression, no increasing difficulty, nothing to master. Just ""use this to solve everything in this level and then never use it again"". I much prefer games where you get to grow an arsenal of tools/weapons and get to combine them somehow.I know the game is supposed to be about how teamwork is important and overcoming hurdles together and whatnot, but it felt more like the theme of the game was ""not growing or progressing"". It made it seem like a divorce is this bad thing that can be overcome by just trying harder, while in many cases a breakup or divorce is the best option for everyone, including any children. Sometimes people grow apart and that's OK. Trying to keep a disfunctional relationship together is mentally draining for everyone involved, and fixing it isn't always feasable or even possible because things and people simply change. Sure, for the characters in the game it worked out, but often times it's better to go your separate ways and live on differently, meet someone else or even enjoy solitude. Separation is not a bad thing, especially if staying together prevents you from growing."

Multiple times I had to start again because time ran out. Who designed this captcha?Then we started playing and it turned out that controls suck. Even in a main menu.... When you press a button your character does some action only after ~0.5 sec. Which made timed jumps difficult even for me, who played all sorts of games for two decades. Also It's quite difficult to move a character accurately, because they always run. (Witcher 3 had the same problem with movement BTW). So when it comes to actions, character feels too heavy, but when it comes to movement they feel too light.Now imagine someone with a skill of a game journalist playing alongside you...We pretty much gave up after a room with wiring.I guess It could be fun if you both have skill, otherwise it might end up in tears.

It's not an outright ""bad"" game I suppose, and it has a lot going for it.  However, I do have a few complaints, and depending on who you are, these are not minor.  The game has an unbelievable amount of foul language, and this really took me by surprise considering the fact that the art and characters seem geared toward kids.  The game also has a few major flaws (such as places in the scenery to get physically stuck without dying) that may seriously ruin the experience for you.  Most of the time, the game is a lot of fun, but when that experience is interrupted, it feels the whole game has gone sour.  If none of those things bothers you, then this is a great game with excellent interactivity for teens or adults to play together.  I misunderstood the target audience, because the game is about a small child whose parents are experiencing marital turmoil.  As a result, I let my kids play.  Bad idea.  This game is not for kids.  There is even a dystopian holocaust-themed squirrel war that probably looks cute on the surface, but as you probe deeper becomes too dark for kids.  There are a lot of things like that in this game."

Yes, the game is beautifully created and there are lots of details in it, great storyline and you can see that the team loved to create a beautiful piece of work. And they did. But still, I don't recommend this game for everyone.1. The game is too easy, especially the puzzles. It just gets boring if you're anything above the casual gamer or little kid. We experienced that already in the first playthrough.2. Replay value is zero. It's about 12-14 hours of gameplay max, and if you decide to replay with the other character it's a dissapointment too: not enough variation in playing style so we quit around 40% in the storyline the second playthrough.3. The payment model is quite stupid. Why not charge everyone €15,00 instead of €39,99 for one copy. This way, if friends A, B and C like the game, A has to buy the game, and HAS to play with B or C but B and C can't play together. That's €45 for the developer instead of 40 and more happy games too (I guess a lot of people would have bought the game, considering the ""€1 per hour of gameplay when buying games"" rule)."

I often had to relaunch multiple times, and it was a crapshoot if the game would actually start, or get stuck behind the big picture window, or have origin suddenly forget my saved login credentials (only to remember them on next launch). Launching the game but not pressing any inputs fast enough seemed to frequently result in the game terminating itself due to some issue with origin. Very frustrating having to keep putting the controller down and fiddle with the keyboard and mouse multiple times when trying to launch.2) Horrible controls lag. Even playing splitscreen locally on my monitor with a high framerate, there was a very noticeable delay between controller input and movement on screen. It felt almost like trying to play a game on a big TV that hasn't been set to gaming mode... except this was a 144hz gaming monitor. I suspect this may be the source of a lot of the other reviewers complaints of motion sickness.3) I get that it's got a nice story and people worked hard on it, but the animations for the cutscenes with the human parts of the story were stiff and really dipped heavily into uncanny valley territory, at least for me."

As is, it's 2021 and I promise, this game invented nothing. You have options. Please, go play them instead and give this game a pass.If you're looking for a solid narrative, look elsewhere. I can't even recommend this game's writing on a ""so bad, it's good"" basis; it's bad comedy, so it's just annoying and boring. All of the one-liners were basically just observations, the banter is atrocious, and the game clearly thinks being mean-spirited is the same thing as having a dark sense of humor. The main characters are completely unlikable, which is unfortunate because we're saddled with them for the whole game. Oh, and the characters will solve the puzzles for you sometimes, by the way; there were several instances where my partner would make an observation at the same time as the character did.Honestly the game feels like it's a long series of ideas for other games. It's like a demo reel, except it's 12 hours long. I suspect that it's meant to parody or reference other properties (I saw some steampunk birds that strongly resembled the Songbird from Bioshock: Infinite???) but the game rarely found anywhere interesting to take the references and it mostly ended up being clutter in an already bloated game.The difficulty curve is all over the place. The puzzles themselves never really get more complicated than the first chapter and the co-op is generally very simple. There are a lot of puzzles that require one person to look at and relay a sequence to another player, but the constant split-screen makes it very easy to just...look over at the other player's screen for the code. Meanwhile, the platforming can spike to absurd difficulty levels without warning.My advice, save your money and your time. Don't waste either of them on this."

The controls were too hard and it is not fun failing  constantly without the game stepping in to help (and yes we googled walk-throughs ). The mini games were also too hard. It was frustrating and hubby and I both hated it as it brought out the worst in our personalities. We had a happy marriage before we played this game. We gave it 3 hours and barely got anywhere in the game. The camera angles were also horrible and locked in bad ways so you couldn't see what you were doing easily. I didn't know I knew so many curse words or could get so angry at a game. Was so annoyed I asked for my money back.

8100,BetHer2Game,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BetHer2Game/,3,,0,4.5,April,"25,",633,0,1,"It Takes Two is very much a game I would consider as an early access game. This is not for bugs, but a seeming lack of consistent thought.This inconsistent thought happens on a multitude of fronts: the story and the game play and is a prime example of a failing in one aspect: transitions.Part 1: The StoryWhen introduced into this game, there is a consistent theme for a good few hour of the game, that the game is told from a kid's point of view, that they are re-enacting as a coping mechanism for divorce. This inherently comes with the assumption that this game is tailored to a kid’s point of view, and is sort of a coming-of-age story about understanding divorce. The graphics in this game provide a warm and alluring feel of something like Toy Story, in which it is a kid’s movie. It Takes Two contrasts this with graphic death scenes of a vacuum ripping out its own eyes, a very sexual love book that air humps and of course has a foreign accent for more sex appeal. The main characters plot to murder a child toy at one point at you play as you rip it apart. The parents of this kid go into a comatose, where… the kid somehow does not even notice or care to check in. However, the problems with this are that the plot does not make sense at all... If we are to take an adult’s approach, then while there can be a suspension of disbelief at talking animals, as this is a main mechanic of many story lines, you then must entertain a weird psychedelic trip inside a tree where there are space catfish. It is after this that our main characters have a space themed level in which they are in shock because a baboon can talk. The plot does not make much sense, as the main caretakers of the child go on a crusade to make her cry, to make themselves be turned back into humans. The story demonizes divorce as if it is a mechanic intended to harm the child, and that the parents should not get divorced, no matter how incompatible they are, or whether they have grown to no longer love each other. It has a surface understanding of divorce but wants the depth of an adult game.Part 2: The Game playMuch like the inconsistent story line, the game play suffers a similar fate. With a new mechanic being introduced every level or so, the ideas are not very fleshed out or directed to any purpose. The controls are not explained since the transitions happen so abruptly, and often the only queue for how something has changed is a camera angle (such as a fight with a squirrel) this could be easily remedied with more instructional pauses, like at the mini-games? However, for some reason this is not the case, as such right as you are about to learn the controls the game rips away that element of the game. Since none of these ideas are fleshed out either, the camera. gets weird, like when flying a machine on a turret out of a tree in one of the stages, the camera is based not only on your movements, but your partners. So, you do not really have control of what you see and must look at how your partners maneuvering and your own. There is a weird sense of vertigo and finnicky controls, and while I can applaud the fact that I haven’t found any bugsit isn’t a product I would seek out on my own.Part 4: ConclusionThis game is written like a improv drama, where everyone thinks they have a great idea. Much like an improv drama, not everyone has a great idea. It does not excel in any of the areas that it covers and cannot really recommend it to much of anyone. The storyline does not make sense, if this is for new gamers, this would be great as an introduction except for the fact that the game past the 2nd boss (toolbox)becomes wildly inconsistent with controls. As a gamer myself the queues are sometimes subtle and would not make sense to someone who has no understanding of game lingo. Such as firing nails at yellow painted objects. If it is someone who has gamed before there are better games with more fleshed out mechanics to understand in a clearer standalone context. It has an interesting aesthetic, but that is about it."

The progression was terrible. There was no progression of love throughout the entirety of the missions until the last 3 where it felt rushed and out of nowhere. The book was so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying and the child was ugly too. The game was very enjoyable at certain parts but majority was quite jarring. Despite all of this, all of the puzzles were cool and quite rewarding but I'm not a fan of the ending at all. She didn't even sing a single word in the song.

8109,Not A Sandwich,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aburritoisnotasandwich/,8,7,0,13.6,December,"10,",591,0,1,"A very upsetting story that forces you to spend a huge amount of time with characters that you hate, lead around by another character that you hate. Pretty fun gameplay elements, if you can get past the other stuff. I don't recommend that you try. Would have refunded if I wasn't having fun hanging out with my friend.Cons:- If you have any sort of motion sickness, you will not be able to play this game (the first person I played with had to quit very quickly).- The characters you play are immediately unlikable, and become progressively less likable over time.- Story beats feel unearned, because your characters never display they've learned anything, and continue to be bad people throughout the experience.- When you are forced to do something awful, the mood and state of the game/characters doesn't reflect that you just did something terrible. I felt like I was on an alien planet playing through this.- Your foil for moving forward in the story is a (maybe racist) caricature whose master plan is to manipulate and torture you until you kiss.- Moral of the story appears to be that if you get a divorce, you are selfish, and you must stay together or your kid will think it's their fault.- Some sexist stuff going on with male player character and another male character forcing the female player character to sing because they know what is best for her, as she asks them to stop and says 'no'.- Felt about twice as long to get through as it should be. Repeatedly, the person I was playing with and I found ourselves hoping that after this level it would be over. This could be because we didn't like the player characters and their foil. After finishing however, the first half of the game didn't seem necessary. Nothing happens that would impact the ending, just more hours of gameplay.Pros:- Some of the co-op puzzles were fun.- Pretty and interesting-looking set pieces.- Lots of opportunities to goof around and have fun with a co-op buddy.- Some MMO-style AoE dodging sections that were good.Spoilers ahoy! This section will contain all the terrible things your characters and the book man do that I can remember."

8113,SmartassCody,https://steamcommunity.com/id/smartasscody/,2,2,0,10.6,April,"30,",214,0,1,"First off, I streamed this game.My co-op partner was my younger brother. I would say we did enjoy moments during this game, but we had some issues as well. The biggest issue for me was that it was hard to place what the game was. As in, who was its target audience. If the game was more difficult, perhaps it would have been a better product overall. But it was very simple and played fast-paced, without much challenge.The caveat, as my twitch audience pointed out, is that the game WOULD be better suited, maybe, for a gamer and a significant other— instead of two experienced gamers. For us, as gamers, it would have felt punchier if it was a bit shorter. Full playthrough was 10.5 hours, and 6 would have been the sweetspot.If you want something to play with your girlfriend/wife/boyfriend/husband, that isn't an experienced gamer, then you might actually enjoy this game a bit more, and based on that I WOULD recommend it. There are moments you won't forget, either way. 4.75/10"
