And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law."

5,christr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TaBaScO77/,685,7,1,127.7,November,"14,",180,17,1,"I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online."

I walked over and greeted him and he said ""Who the hell you talking to?"" then stood up and punched my hat right off of my head.We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like ""You can no longer use the barber"".Turns out i just beat the crap out of the local barber.The sheriff came, i surrendered and spent the night in a cell. I had to pay $4.I went back to the saloon for another beer and a random guy walks up and talks about the fight i had the night before and how crazy it was.This is just one of many small immersive things which have happened so far outside of the main story.What a crazy game."

Replayablity is there with being able to explore the open world, random encounters, hunting and side missions etcRecommend.EDIT: I'm about to complete my 2nd playthrough, I've done all side missions and optionals, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10 once you become accustomed to the general slowness of the game compared to fast paced games.EDIT 2: Finished 2nd playthrough, done most side content - summary - BEST GAME EVEREDIT 3: I have borrowed my managers xbox 360 at work and red dead 1 disc so I can play rdr1.. will update again with my review.EDIT 4: Finished RDR1, great game, playing RDR2 before RDR1 has made me appreciate both games more than I would have playing RDR1 10 years ago...

You really care for the characters, the gang ""family"" becomes like your family, and when things go bad.. you really want to help. Of course in the meantime you can hunt, rob, kill and do whatever nasty or good thing you prefer, but you know someone is waiting for you. And the ending will bring tears to your eyes for different things in multiple occasions. Add to this an incredible, very realistic environment, a perfect western setting that would make Sergio Leone proud and you have an absolute masterpiece.

20,KING-X®,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kingx69/,780,56,1,154.5,January,"20,","9,270",27,1,"This review is for the single player, spent 150 hours to reach 91% completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100% it. I didn't try the online yet, i'll add the review for that after i try it.I wont review the story to avoid spoilers, but it's a long game with some excellent missions, as usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot on, characters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemption.The game is not easy if you want to master everything, nothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to another, but it'll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can do, especially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.For the visuals, even while not at the ultra settings, this game is insanely beautiful, i never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2, Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it's a huge payoff for the players, you really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s. And with photo mode, whatever you are doing and wherever you are on the map, be sure that you'll end up with a nice photo. I'll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the region.Shooting is pretty satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and the slow motion Even the crafting is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics, also loved the weapon modifications, to make each weapon customized to a different look.Map is pretty big for a game that uses a horse as the primary travelling method, you can fast travel easily using camp, train or stagecoach, but i dont advise that, you'll miss a lot of nice things like that, a lot of random events. Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them all, add to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i'm sure that you'll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this game.It's an amazing game and to me one of the best games ever made, so it's highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offer. Thank you Rockstar for all the amazing moments i had playing this game!Edit: I couldn't play online, each 5 or 10 minutes i receive this error: ""You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services.

28,Araripe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/araripebr/,561,7,1,177.7,November,"28,","1,729",22,1,"Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date, without a doubt. Unquestionably beautiful, vast and detailed. It breathes life. From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear, everything feels alive and convincing. It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer. Non-playable characters have their own lives, with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do. Some do hard work, some drink all day, some mourn their loss(es). It's hard to believe it's just a video game. I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was. Imagine that, but twice as convincing. That's RDR 2 for you. They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponry. Evidently, a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies. That's where the story mode comes in. And, as many of you may know by now, either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news, it's a masterpiece. Storytelling is not an easy craft, but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be. They make it seem easy, almost as if anyone could do it. Memorable characters, insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions. As linear as it may be, forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission, it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character, therefore leading it to a specific outcome. Games don't often get the whole moral debate right, understandably so, because they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you. But Arthur Morgan is different. It's a rather captivating individual, that feels real. Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone, or if you should or not help that person in need. And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies ahead. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns. An adventure you can dive in yourself, and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life. A novel-like main character that is a criminal, killer, cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us. And humanity wins, in the end. Arthur learns what it is to be human, and there is no better teacher than life itself. Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2? It would be a crime not to. As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay, the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode, the story is something out of this world. It truly outstands. Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling. It's something you've got to experience to understand. A must-play for every gamer out there."

This title will remain in my heart forever. the world is the most alive and coherent in ALL of open world games. This is open world mastered and perfected by the best. The very best on doing so. You can spend an infinite amount of time in the world.The animals who live in this giant, MASSIVE open world map, are the stars of making it alive. Accordingly with Red Dead 2 wiki, there is 80 animal species with lots of subspecies to spice it up. You will find 170+ different animals in this game.Currently hovering over 147 hours of having the game open on steam, I have not seen everything this world has to offer yet. It is a GIANT behemoth of a game. It is to die for. My god, it is a roller coaster and so well written in the human sense. I have never connected to a protagonist as I have in this. No game has ever made me tear up. The soundtrack, the voice acting, the setting... everything. It is so well done.The most detailed world you can have in games. Compare this to their own GTA, Cyberpunk 2077, any other open world. The amount of realism put into this is not of this world. So many organic interactions with npcs, the physics and with the nature makes this an intoxicating journey with great immersion.As usual, it is not perfect. The game suffers GREATLY from Ludonarrative dissonance. Meanwhile in the story human life has a great weight, you'll find yourself killing hundreds throughout the game and story when outside a cut scene. It is very common in games and it is a shame, because Arthur story is monumental: it is very human.One other thing this game does amazingly and it is a shame that the current culture in gaming does not appreciate is the taste for a journey and not a pure min-max that you focus solely on numbers and efficiency on whatever you are doing.Have a moment and  This is what the game structure tries to teach but not in a obvious way. When I purchased RED DEAD 2 early last year, I gravitated to a min-max state of mind later on the story (around hour 40) and it made me annoyed for the animations, length of travel, punishing physics. Sadly so, because I was losing the point of it all.This month in 2021 I reinstalled it and jumped on the story and it clicked me. When you're skinning a hunt, when you're taking care of your horse, when you are in a shop or interacting in a saloon. Everything is made methodically to be the most realistic possible and to tell a story.You'll find yourself out in the wilderness alone, maybe passing 5 whole minutes crafting split point bullets that are free (you make an X with your knife on a bullet's tip) but it takes an animation. All of this tells a story. Time passes. Sun rises, sun sets.From the state of mind of enjoying the journey, even more precious in these times we are living in, I found myself enjoying 1000% more the game. I stopped making my horse run for minutes straight from point A to point B and began enjoying the view while trotting, and stopped riding when the view was just right to appreciate how gorgeous this game is.The views, the animals, the story, the characters, the world...Even with so many flaws, this goes straight up to my favorites quite possibly number 1.This changed the way I think about life and the world, even though it was in my heart before. It refined further what I believed in. No game has EVER done that to me.I recommend watching the many essays on youtube about red dead 2, including one from Real Pixels.It is a masterpiece."

After a failed robbery, you and your companions are trying to find a new place where all of you will be safe. You will travel across a beautiful country, doing robberies, helping people or not - it depends on you. I don't want to spoil anything so I will not talk about details. The beginning of the game can be boring for some players but later it will change. Some parts contain really emotionally-strong moments. There are only a few games that can compete with RDR 2's story. I can imagine some players will dislike long travels between missions, but it was fine for me. I enjoyed the nice-looking country.In every open-world game, it's important for the world to feel alive. You can have a big map, but if it's empty and dead then it's pointless. It's not case of Red Dead Redemption 2. The map is massive, and everything lives here. Every NPC has its own purpose. They don't just stand somewhere, but they are there for a reason. Some work on a ranch, some do daily chores, others relax after a job, repair something and so forth. You can try to follow NPCs and you will see they have their own life. This applies to animals as well. When you are hunting, you feel like you are playing some kind of a hunting simulator, not an open-world story game. There is a huge amount of side activities. Everything is well made, tasks are nicely hand-crafted, random events are superb. There exist in GTA V but hey, Red Dead Redemption 2 is different and events are much more fun. For example, I saved the life of one guy and later he let me buy anything on his account in a gunshop. You can spend many hours in free roam doing all this stuff. The game offers a superb photo mode where you pick a shot of a rock, and I can guarantee it will look nice. The game has so many details. For example, when you take a piece of paper from the table, it will look and feel like real paper, not just a rectangle with texture. Animations like placing a cable for dynamite, skinning animals, taking things and so on, are a masterpiece and everything looks realistic. Only clothes could have better physics. I can clearly say this is the most detailed game I ever played. Long story short, the visuals are outstanding.Shooting guns is a story in itself. Guns feel realistic, you must maintain them / don't shoot like in Call of Duty. Weapons in the wild west had long reload times. In RDR 2, reloading is not as fast as in PvP games but not too slow to be frustrating either. The devs perfectly hit a balance between fun and realism. The game offers a big selection of guns. You can personalize them to your preferences. You can enjoy shootouts in 3rd person or 1st person view and use the dead-eye ability like a true gunslinger. There is a cover system, but it could be better. Many times my character didn't take cover or left cover after a short time and stayed in a crouch behind an obstacle. Your character has some needs that you need to maintain. He needs to eat, heal, sleep, and keep his energy full if you want success in fights. There are plenty of food types, herbs and drinks that will help with it. Also, you can craft many items that will give bonuses to the protagonist. Don't forget to take warm clothing when you go visit the snowy mountains. You need to watch honour as well. You can raise it by helping random people - encounters and making the right decisions during the story. Honour has an impact on cutscenes and the ending.Your protagonist's best friend will be a horse. You must take care of it if you want it in good condition. You don't want to be kicked down during an escape from robbery. So don't forget to feed and brush the horse from time to time. Upgrades and customization are available too. You can buy a new horse or try to tame any wild ones that you will find.The game offers multiplayer as well. To be honest, I didn't try it. I'm primarily a solo player and I don't have the energy for long grinding to buy something. With friends, I can imagine it can be fun. Maybe I will try it someday just for fun."

Gameplay, shooting, graphics, emotions, diversity of animals, characters impressed me deeply. This is the first game in which I saw how the character takes things with his hands, not just raises his hand and things end up in his pocket. Nails really get hammered into the boards. The more often you hit with a hammer, the deeper it gets hammered. Even such trifles are thought out here, it's unbelievable.The plot is built in such a way that we can see how slowly the relationship between people changes throughout the game, like in real life. We don't understand that we were betrayed at once, do we? We need time to realize it. So we have a lot of time to understand who is who in RDR2. Admiration, misunderstanding, doubt, disappointment, loathing— we can feel such emotions with Arthur Morgan. I have experienced such warm feelings as for Arthur in no game. The ending encouraged me to mull my life over. It's really made me think how I want to live my life. It's so emotional, strong and powerful. I would never regret playing this game, though I used to think that Wild West is not my cup of tea.I guess, I won't run into better game than RDR2. Only if Rockstar releases a sequel, but I'm afraid that will never happen. I can do nothing but admire."
60,quasimodo1957,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014000003/,303,8,1,224.4,December,"6,",112,4,1,"Probably the best Rockstar game by far. GTA V was eye candy but this leaves it in the dust. The scenery and vistas are beautiful. From prairies of weeds and plateaus to mountains with forests and knee deep snow. Lovely waterfalls and lakes. Rivers teeming with fish and a world full of various breeds of reptiles, rabbits, squirrels, deer, elk, wild horses, birds and water fowl and the highly dangerous grizzly and brown bears and cougars and mountain lions. All can be hunted or like me you find your puny firearms early in the game are no match for an angry grizzly or cougar.The story is scripted but only to a small degree. During or in between quests you can wander, hunt, fish rob, murder or just interact with the people in your surroundings. Visit the good sized city of Saint Denis, the smaller towns or wander the bayous (watch out for alligators). Speaking with people can get you a friendly 'hello friend' or 'you better keep moving if you know what's good for you' response. Bumping into people (especially if you're on your faithful steed) will get you yanked from the saddle and beaten to death so keep that in mind. I found stabling your horse and walking saves you this from happening in most cases.There is so much to do and see in this game that to cheat or rush it is a crime. Enjoy the game for what the devs made it for. A fun and exciting adventure. Finally there are well over 100 Easter Eggs in the game. Just check it out on Youtube and watch a couple of videos to get an idea of what you'll see and find. Towns continue to grow, houses you observe being constructed are complete 6 or 7 years later and railroad track crews building a line complete it to add another line to the already long established lines.Right now at $19 is a deal. If you ever wanted to be a character in the West during the turn of the century this game is for you. Frankly this game is terrifically addictive and immersive."

First of all the game is a masterpiece and is easily the best story rockstar have produced yet.Story: the story seems simple enough from the outside but when you play the game you will find yourself immersed in the games amazing storyline and character, as the main protagonist Arthur starts as a brash, arrogant outlaw to an honourable character, and the side story of other missions are phenomenal.Graphics: This game has easily the best graphics of any game rockstar has produced and arguably some of the best graphics in history.Combat: the combat is amazingly balanced, as you can take the stealthier approach with knives and tomahawks and a range of melee and throwable weapons, or you can blow up everything in sight, the gun mechanics are amazing, the shooting feels very comfortable and has been polished brilliantly.NPCs: this is one of the best parts of the game. The npcs generally act in a normal fashion and live out the days of those who lived in that time, it creates an amazing environment that fits the given time period it was set in, you can interact with anyone on the street and create conversations and build a reputation with individuals in the town.Honour system: This system ranks how honourable you are among citizens and different levels unlock new equipment and perks. My favourite part about this is how cutscenes and the actual finale will change in regard to how honourable you are and even in game characters talk differently about you if you’re more honourable or a lot less honourable.Conclusion: this game is a must have, it is the perfect game for anyone who loves any type of game because it is so diverse, it doesn’t matter if you like learning about your character or just shooting people, I guarantee you will enjoy this game!"

Ok the first hour or so I spent tuning the settings and controls to make everything run optimally but once I got through all that, I got lost in the world of Red Dead all over again. Firstly, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I find myself having to stop my adventuring constantly to take photos of the landscape or an animal caught doing something cool. Whether you're up in the snowy mountains or riding through the desert or dense lush forests, everything feels incredibly genuine, with the upheaval of snow or mud as you wade through and realistic water physics and immersive ecosystems. Luckily I manage high-ultra settings and maintain a solid 80-100 FPS (except in busy towns, where it can drop to 60ish), a very rare treat for modern graphically demanding games.Gameplay-wise Rockstar also knocked it out of the park. Sure, the gun fights could be a little easier for QoL, but that's my one and only 'gripe' with the mechanics and it's a minor irritation at its worst. Some say that the survival and maintenance mechanics are tedious but I think it adds to that 'lone wanderer' feel this game gives. You're on your own most of the time with just your horse and I find myself taking pride in taking care of myself and my animal. Aside from being alone, you can stumble across a ton of random encounters all with a choice you can make and it just makes the world feel alive. The towns and NPCs all feel alive and real, offering jobs, vending, haircuts (for that awesome 'real time' hair and beard growth) and much more. And omg was it a breath of fresh air after Cyberpunk to see how intelligent the AI and crime systems are.Finally, story-wise, I cannot fault it. It's a masterpiece of writing and character development. Arthur Morgan has become one of my favourite characters of all time, not just in video games. The rest of the gang all have their own personalities which adapt as the story progresses and you really come to fall in love with (some of) them. Once I finished the epilogues I just wanted to erase my memory, go back, and do it all again.Overall RDR2 has become one of, if not, my favourite game of all time and now it's on PC I fully believe it to be the best video game ever made, with Witcher 3 being a close second (even though I prefer fantasy and RPG, RDR2 just constantly has me in awe). If you have a decent enough rig to run it well, I highly recommend picking it up. It's worth full price and more, but if you're lucky you can get it for a steal in a sale.Forgot to mention - the music, score and all audio in general are also absolutely incredible."

That being said, once I got the game working it was a masterpiece. This game has a story that choked me up at certain points but it still delivers on its promise horse ridin, gun shootin, cowboy action.

86,† Dead Like Me †,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DantesBabyGirl/,477,18,1,609.1,April,"18,","3,240",0,1,"The game was an extraordinary experience for me. Particularly the Story Mode. From the very beginning, I was drawn right into the game. It was like being in an interactive cinematic film. You felt so involved, it was one of the best fun I have had in quite a long time as far as how a game can leave a lasting impact. The graphics are beautiful, and very picturesque. The voice acting was brilliant and the cast was very believable. While playing it, I didn't want to leave and wanted to keep on playing, because for me, it was THAT good.Luckily, I didn't have too many issues with crashes. I got them a handful of times while playing through the Story Mode. The game comes with STEAM achievements too which gives you even more focus of activities to do in-game as a challenge.The game also has an online side of it. But the online, as much as it was fun playing it with a good friend, lacked content. Understandably, its still in early stages. The Online, has many many issues. Lots of ""disconnections from session"" and I have run into some modders. The infinite loading screens are a real nuisance, that for months, I have much difficulty joining into some games, like Racing for example. Some trade missions and Moonshiner missions will fail for no reason, and you lose your stock. The infinite loading screen will not load the mission, resulting in many 'RE-LAUNCHING THE GAME.' The camp setup is so glitchy that most of the time you cannot get the camp to spawn. * Overall, for the story mode, I will give this game a 9.5/10.* The Graphics I will give it a 9/10.* Music I will rate it as an 8/10* Cast/Characters in the game a 8.5/10* Realism like Hunting, skinning animals etc I will give that a 7/10 for the animation cutscene.* Online Mode is a bit more tricky to give a rating, though its packed with lots of fun aspects, it is very broken with so many issues for example -  the many disconnections, glitches, infinite loading screens, modders in some sessions forcing you to relaunch to change your session due to infinite loading screen preventing you to switch while already in-game. However, the Online aspect for me personally, is simply a BONUS to an awesome single-player game. This rating can change if and when Rockstar Games fixes the problems the game is currently experiencing in Online Mode.Note: Story Missions in Online Mode were fun to do as well as the Bounty Hunter jobs, Hunting animals for Trader Business, crafting, cooking, treasure hunting (Collector Business), mini activities (when working) were stacks of fun, and the fishing was realistic and enjoyable also. So in saying that, I will give these a 6.0/10."

88,Karen's Baked Ziti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adre4u/,266,6,1,120.9,April,"10,","1,004",11,1,"In the 120 hours it took me to finish the game, I didn't use the fast travel even once. The world is beautifully crafted, there's so much attention to detail and its so full of life, that I feared I'll miss something if I'd use it.Riding, fishing, hunting, just exploring this world can take so many hours of fun. I never enjoyed riding and exploring so much like in this game. Witcher 3 comes close in that regard, but the world in RDR2 feels way more alive. There's always something going on and you're not solely a spectator, you're part of it. People travelling and camping, bandits robbing a wagon or kidnapping someone, hunters mauled by predators, fishermans, animals lurking in the woods, wild horses running in open praires. Whole ecosystems with a fidelity in their representation that is really impressive, from the damp swamps of Lemoyne to the cold mountains of the Grizzlies, breathtaking sights in each and every one of these lands.The towns and cities follow the same design quality as the rest of the game, extremely detailed, with their own routines, people coming and going, living their life. Saint Denis might be one of the most beautiful and detailed cities I ever saw in a game, the moment you step on it you'll understand what I mean.The physics engine that made IV the ultimate GTA experience (for me at least) has come back to bring this game to life. Simply shooting at someone can have so many different outcomes it never feels like you're watching the same animation over and over. Enemies will fall off the horse to get trampled to death, they will get tangled in the stirrups, their corpses getting dragged until the horse calms down eventually falling dead on the ground. They'll get shot down like a sack of potatoes from the impact of a shotgun, face blown out in half. And more.The way animals move, interact with each other, get wounded and slowly die when you hunt them, how it feels to fall from your horse or crash into a wagon, every single one of these things has a weight of its own, is not just a couple of ragdolls colliding with each other without a sense of impact, it feels genuine.The chase sequences, shootouts, robbing trains and stores, shooting up a gang hideout, bounty hunting, I really enjoyed all of the different activities, there's not a lack of things to do and action is a plenty. Every one of these is fun to play and feel different each time thanks to the physics engine and its unique interactions.Although I would've loved to see some more guns, there's quite a good amount, but they all seem pretty similar to one another in how they feel. Once you've used a repeater rifle, you used them all. Same with shotguns, and revolvers. The only guns that really differentiate from other categories where the semi auto pistols, which were also way too powerful when used in dead-eye mode.I did not experience a single frame rate drop or a crash to desktop in the entirety of my 120 hours playthrough. Not. Even. Once.Bear in mind I'm playing on a fairly decent setup so your results may vary, but the consistency of the frame rate was really impressive considering the scope of the game and how good it looks.I only experienced a half a second freeze/stutter sometimes when entering Saint Denis, as if the game was loading the city, but it happened only when entering for the first time of each game session, and no more after that.And something that I hate about open world games, which is texture, grass, or NPC pop-in, is not present in this game, at all. That was another technical aspect that really impressed me.Other Rockstar games, Kingdom Come, Skyrim, you name it, almost every open world game has some degree of pop-in issues, sometimes is subtle, other times is unbereable (KCD, I'm looking at you), well Red Dead Redemption 2 got rid of that, completely.That's commendable, it looks wonderful, runs smooth, and doesn't suffer from common technical issues other games do, even games with much more smaller and less detailed worlds than this one.Some stuff that could've been better, Rockstar needs to address their mission design which feels a bit outdated, linear, it doesn't cut it anymore. Sometimes it holds on your hand too much to the point of feeling that it treats you as an idiot who would get lost if a big prompt isn't telling you what to do next every 5 minutes. The honour system doesn't make much sense. You get penalized for petty stuff like looting a corpse on the side of the road, starting a fight with a person who threatens you (and even if they start shooting at you) or accepting a reward after saving someone from a wild animal or a robbery.Some side missions often show another side of Arthur, who's a good hearted fellow, someone who, despite being a bandit, still retains some humanity. He's clearly not a murdering sociopath like some of the fellers he hangs around with. But then you go into another mission, that have you go beat the sh1t out of a working man just because he cannot repay a debt, or steal money from innocent people, then kill half a town to escape. Doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't matter how you play outside of missions, it won't change anything, if you want to be good, you'll still be dragged to do stupid stuff and kill people for no reason other than ""we're outlaws"" and ""I have a plan, just blindly follow and trust me, dont ask any questions..."".The pacing of the story feels weird, it tries to give a sense of urgency but then it drags you doing errands and stuff that takes time and isn't really important nor urgent. Also, I would've loved to see what happened in Blackwater, since its the main reason the band is on the run, but you never really know what happened, you only get told that ""something went really bad and we had to leave"". A first mission similar to the GTA V bank robbery where you could play what happened in Blackwater to experience first hand the event that actually kickstarted the whole story, would've been a much better introduction to the game than the rather confusing one we got.But despite all that, the overall quality of the game was enough to outshine any negative aspects of it in my experience. This is truly a gem of a gem, worth a try even of you don't like open world games much, or just don't like games from Rockstar in general.Give this one a chance, you won't regret it. 10/10."

Of course, in the meantime, you can hunt, rob, kill and do whatever bad or dec you want, but you know that someone is waiting for you. And the finish will bring tears to your eyes for different things in many cases.

For example, your characters pupils will dilate in darker environment. Horses balls shrinks in cold weather. Walking in snow or mud make footprints. If you hit someone, you may see them with a bandage around their head the day after. That kind of attention to details shines through the whole game.• The environment is living and breathing of life. This is not only the NPC's. You can even see birds picking up fish, dogs playing in the mud, and even eagles hunting rabbits. The environment and the people are different depending on which state you're in.• The story is extremely well-written. There is indeed a few underdeveloped characters. But overall it's just amazing: it's long, it's complex, and there are many ways to interact with the people in the story outside of the story itself. You really get to KNOW all the characters. The game's ending was very emotional and made me shred a tear.• There is lot's to do outside of the storyline.• I was afraid that this game would become another ''responsive, accessible, fast-paced dumbed-down action game. Well it was not. The shooting mechanics and the animations are great. Not everyone's cup of tea though: this game is not the typical AA-title with fast-paced action and accessible gameplay. Shooting and movement is slower and more deliberate. You have to shave, and clean yourself if you want to look respectable. You have to clean your guns from time to time to keep them in shape. There is a lot of animations. If you have short attention span this game might not be for you.• The soundtracks are amazing.Summary: If this game does not deserve 10/10 I don't know which game that would. No game is perfect. 10/10 cannot therefore refer to perfection. There is simply NO OTHER GAME like Red Dead Redemption 2. It is innovative. It cannot be replaced.

103,Reanimate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/reanimateee/,376,26,1,71.0,February,"24,","1,268",18,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is one of Rockstar’s best games ever. It vastly improves upon the first game, and has the quality you expect from a Rockstar game, and AAA games in general.Red Dead 2’s greatest strengths is its story and voice acting, along with the very strong world that always feels alive, bustling, and immersive. This is complemented by its deep and solid gameplay, along with a vast amount of customization in the game that you can use to make the playthrough unique to you.The gameplay in RDR2 is fantastic. While some argue that it’s too realistic and tedious, it didn’t bother me at all. In fact, I like the gameplay’s realism a lot. I liked pulling guns off your horse, looting dead bodies by digging their pockets individually, having to feed yourself and your horse to keep your cores filled up, and more. It’s a nice change of pace that fits the gloomy western atmosphere really well. Controls can be a bit overwhelming at first, but you can get a grasp of them fairly quickly. Sometimes you do stuff you don’t want to do by accident if you are not careful. I played through the game with controller just because I always find open world Rockstar games to be easier with controller, but the game is definitely playable on keyboard and mouse. Besides the horse riding requiring too much button tapping, I didn’t have many complaints with the controls. All keyboard controls are re-bindable which is a great touch.There is a lot of ways to get money, from honorable ways like bounty hunting, to dishonorable ways like train robberies. Once you get all this cash, there is a lot of stuff to spend it on! There is a lot of clothing items, guns, horses, accessories for those horses, food and drinks at the general store, and more! One big complaint I have to mention is that some guns are locked off until you unlock them in the story, which is annoying. You can be flush with cash but cannot spend it on new guns simply because you have not gotten to that part of the story, which is a goofy game design choice.You can also make Arthur yours by how you play the game. Included in the game is an honor system that will rise or fall depending on your choices in the game. Depending on your honor, you will talk to people differently, and people will react to your presence positively or negatively. I always played Arthur with high honor, but he can definitely work as a low honor character too, and I am considering a low honor playthrough soon!The story of Red Dead 2 is based around the Van der Linde gang running across the American frontier from government agents and lawman, after a failed heist in Blackwater. The gang’s relationship gets more strained as the law gets closer and closer to wiping the gang out, and this all happens in a world where the wild west era is getting swept by the oil refineries and cities. I personally loved the story from start to finish, and the setting it is based in complements the story. The story is written very well and always has you on the edge of your seat. It’s worth noting that RDR 2 is actually a prequel to the first game. The idea of making this game a prequel to RDR was pretty smart, as it sets up for the events of the first game, and makes the story of the first game that much more high stakes.Arthur Morgan, the game’s protagonist, is a joy to play as for the lengthy story. The other significant characters, such as Dutch, John, and Sadie are all well written. Dutch, in particular, has probably the best character development out of everyone in the game, as he leads the gang on the run from the law, and starts to go more insane as the game progresses. It’s also great to go out and do missions with various members of your gang, as you can bond with them and see how they work and react with Arthur. I didn’t have anyone in the game that I did not like when I saw them (besides the antagonists, of course).This game is absolutely beautiful, with some of the best graphics I’ve seen yet in any video game. The tradeoff is that RDR2 can be pretty taxing on your system. On my system, I ran the game at 1440p with a mix of Medium-High settings, and only managed to pull about 40-50 FPS. Seeing as I played through the game on Xbox One at 30 FPS, I wasn’t too annoyed about this. I preferred to see the game at its beauty in 1440p, and with it being so demanding, I just embraced the low FPS to experience the game at such a high graphical fidelity.The game is not bug/glitch free, as is typical from open-world games of this caliber. I ran into a few odd quirks and bugs, including a few softlocks and one game crash. One softlock included Arthur getting locked in place after getting out of bed. The other softlock was due to the crash mentioned earlier, which actually corrupted about 30 GBs of game files. I’m assuming the game didn’t know what to do when trying to access corrupted game files so it would lock up every time I would start a story mission. It was very annoying using up internet on my data cap redownloading game files to get my game working again. People have also reported issues with the Rockstar Launcher, but I never ran into any problems with it personally, although it is an inconvenience to have two layers of DRM keeping me from playing my $60 game.As of this review, the standard edition of RDR2 is priced at $59.99, with subsequent editions of this game being $79.99 and $99.99, with each edition adding small cosmetic DLC and Red Dead Online bonuses. In my opinion, the game is worth it even at $99. The amount of content on offer is mindblowing, complemented by very good writing and a lengthy story. Red Dead Online (RDO) is an extra to me compared to the singleplayer content.Speaking of Red Dead Online, it is included with the game for free, but there are some sections of it locked off behind a paywall. You can easily get past these paywalls if you shell out some money on the premium currency of RDO, Gold. Although you can earn gold in-game via stranger missions, it’s extremely slow, so I went ahead and shelled out money to buy access to all the Specialist roles, which was about $20. While it does add a lot of extra content, it was extra money I had to spend on top of the initial $52 I paid on the game. Keep that in mind if you want to get into RDO.Despite any setbacks of this game, it is worth every penny. Rockstar created such a vast, deep, and beautiful game that is dripping with love and passion. It has been worth the 50+ hours I spent in the world so far. I don’t know where Rockstar is going to take Red Dead now, but I’m excited to see!"

Such detail, gameplay, and feeling, is that great that I could play easily 4h without even noticing.The music is not a strong point but it sure makes everything more serious, and it puts more deep into the story.This game runs fine even on lower PC's, I had the privilege to play it on ultra settings & I was just happy. You can do a lot of things, poker, domino...If you have not try this game yet, then I suggest you to do it, my second favorite game of all time."

The game has it all: It's gorgeous, well-written, well-animated, the quests and side quests are all polished and interesing. The attention to detail is astonishing and the lasting appeal is phenomenal. This is not only one of these games that establish a bridge between the video game media and the cinematic world (think of it like a 80-hour long interactive tarantino movie), but it is also the best of them in my humble opinion.I bought the game around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released (I really wanted this game to be my favourite game...the setting, the developper, the possibilities....exactly what I wanted.)Result: Played RDR2 around 20 hours then came Cyberpunk. Played Cyberpunk for about 15/20 hours across 4 or 5 play sessions.....I was forcing myself to go back to it.After a while I gave up entirely and went back to RD2. No regret. Best AAA game I've seen in years.BTW I work as a professional pilot and I don't have much time to play nowadays. What I really want from a game is to escape and relax for a couple hours here and there.With RDR2, I feel like i'm teleported to early 20th century south-western USA in a blink. My name is Arthur for a couple hours, I ride my horse, contemplate the beauty of the appalaches, hunt the bounty I picked at the local sheriff office, blow his hand in a gun duel, hogtie him to the back of my horse, stop by the river on the way back to do a little sunset fishing while my prisoner insults me in the background. Drop him in jail, collect the bounty, go back to Valentine to rest at the hotel, take a bath in good company, play a couple rounds of poker, punch a drunk on the thoroughfare on the way back to the hotel. And go back to sleep. End of play session. 2 hours well spent...."
114,Mischief,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,205,4,1,278.6,August,"24,",486,0,1,"First of all, English is not my native language but for practice I'm going to write this review in this lovely language, sorry if you see any mistakes.I'll try to don't ramble too much even if it's going to be difficult but this game has a lot to talk. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best game I've played in a long time, even one of the best I've ever played in my short life. It's not perfect, it has faults but it's a really good experience. I think Rockstar is the best making open worlds or at least making worlds that feel alive, not just look nice. The world is full of details, you are able to do a lot of things like hunting and fishing and those tasks feel really well made, even if I personally think fishing is boring like look a brick, this accompanied by a technique section really impressive, the textures, animations, lights, smoke, sand, and fog among others just look gorgeous and help the world looks much better. There are landscapes really beautiful out there, getting lost in the forest/dessert/mountains contemplating the nature is a delightful, even the city of Saint Denis in its industrial ""apogee"" it's beautiful, the light effects and fog at night ... are simply speechless. The animation of animals, people, everything help to feel that world alive. Unfortunately, I can pin one of the problems of the game here, the game is poorly optimized. Even if I have the recommended requirements and more, I can't make the game works at a stable 60 fps ( I don't feel many fps drops and it's totally playable ), some graphics option simply doesn't work or work badly. If you have a system that has problems with the minimum requirements I'm not sure if you are going to be able to enjoy properly the game. The Story, I think this is the best writing game of Rockstar so far, it's not excellent but really good, maybe a bit rushed in the development of the game, I say that because there are many part of the world that you don't see or experiment with Arthur. It shows a cruel and beautiful world of the pre 19th century. Arthur is such a good protagonist, his develop of character is ... personally one of the best things of the game, He changes like the world around him but, he is not alone, the other characters in the gang are so good writing, other better than other, but you can make a good feeling with those people. Even the secondary characters are good wrote, those you find in secondaries quest or strangers out there. There are decisions in the game but don't change so much at the end, even if there are 4 different finals available.The gameplay is good, it feels good, the game is full of options, weapons, and stuff, the missions are the big point but, like a good video that I saw on youtube, it seems like Rockstars always wants to take you by the hand, nothing of improvising, we don't do that thing here, don't misinterpret me, the missions are super fun but maybe a bit of player control can help to be more fun.  I feel curious about some control riding the horse, I'm not sure if it is a bug or just a realistic mechanic, it's annoying though, when suddenly the horse run in circles.  Now I'll talk a bit about the online, if you are going to buy this game thinking this is a Western GTA online, yeah it's something like that but nope. I played some hours it's fun with friends, I personally don't like the pvp component, I think the pve is more fun but that's my opinion. The online feels a bit empty, there are things to do but, not much, also there are many cheaters/modders than it seems Rockstar don't care a bit. The Strongpoint in this game is the campaign, that's all. In synthesis or something like that RDR2 is, in my opinion, the best Western open world over there, it's has a delightful world, an adult, cruel and sad  well made story, and an online not so good but fun with a lack of content. I hope Rockstar bet more games like this one. Thank you!"

It actually HAS that confidence. And it delivers. This is the greatest video game narrative ever written. The choice to make it a prequel and tie it back to John Marston’s old days in the Dutch Van Der Linde Gang is hands down the BEST aspect of this game. It harkens back to characters you love, so you instantly have that connection and uses that context to establish new characters you’ll know and love as well. Arthur Morgan’s struggle with morality and the inevitable outcome of his actions is one of the most engaging gaming stories ever told and is a great successor to John Marston’s story which was also brilliant."

Going through the game and seeing the misadventures the gang gets up to and how Arthur's perception of the world around him changes made me fall in love with this game. It's the most I have been emotionally invested in a game in a long time. The gun mechanics of the game are also top notch. Every shot feels like it has an impact and all the guns feel like actual weapons. Rockstar truly made a world that truly feels alive. It feels like I'm riding through late 19th century America. I can't really talk about the online experience because I haven't played enough of it to give a fair review.If you're considering buying this game I HIGHLY recommend it and hope that you can enjoy the story as much as I did. Even if the online is mediocre, the story makes this game worth every penny."

Is Red Dead Redemption 2 Worth It?In terms of bang for your buck, it's well worth the money, even at $60. In fact, games like Red Dead Redemption 2 make the argument that games could be a lot more expensive and justify the price simply due to the sheer amount of content it has.2. Can you play Red Dead Redemption offline?That's right: you can't play even the story mode of Red Dead Redemption 2 if you're not online. The game uses the Rockstar Game Launcher no matter where you've purchase the game from. And if you launch the game without being connected to the internet, you'll be told you don't have the rights to play it. For now can't be fixed, maybe it will be like that forever.3. How Long Does Red Dead Redemption 2 take to beat?Most estimates put the game's length at about 40 to 60 hours, with HowLongtoBeat reporting an aggregated length of 47.5 hours in simply completing the main campaign. If you decide to complete the game's side quests, that will add about 30 hours to the game.4. Is RDR2 a hard game?It won't be very hard as far as game play goes. Play on easy. You don't really even need to aim, if that's what you're worried about.5. How old is Arthur Morgan?"

The sheer amount of dialogue and character building in this game is just incredible. Everything from the graphics, combat, soundtrack, mission design and writing are top-notch and that's what makes Rockstar so special. I've never gotten so attached to a character as much as I did with Arthur Morgan, he's one of the best video game protagonists ever. There's just so much to see and do in this wonderful open world and it never gets old. Also, it is very well optimised and I never really had any issues with bugs or crashes. The only con for me was that the pacing got a bit slow and off direction about midway through the game, but  it does pick up soon after. Also, I felt that the game restricts player freedom and movement in some missions and camps which is a bit annoying. Other than these, the game is just near perfect. If the huge campaign wasn't enough, there's Red Dead Online too which has a lot of fun content to be had and is frequently updated. Red Dead Redemption 2 is worth every single penny, definitely recommended."

The map isn't that big and while it is full of content, you won't feel overwhelmed by it. Going for a 100% was a difficult task but with a PLAN, you can get it done quite fast and without getting bored, though there are some birds that won’t appear when you want them to and will become a headache for a couple of days, but you'll get it done. RDO is full of mod menu users and gets annoying at times, (there are a few guides on how to avoid this), there are bugs here and there, and personally I didn't enjoy it quite much, so I did not spend much time playing online like I did on single player.In conclusion, the single player experience is one, if not the best out there, great mechanics and excellent story.

Being able to grow out Arthur's Beard and hair, and even styling it at given length is incredible!The story telling is also a big part of it. It is truly a sad story with excellent writing, though I understand the story being strictly scripted and there is always one outcome. There are also tons of content like side missions which I equally enjoyed. My most memorable immersive experience was to sit by the campfire with the gang and a bottle of Whiskey in my hand. Everyone was jolly singing together for a hot minute. And then there was Javier who played with his amazing guitar. It was quiet, peaceful, I took my time and appreciate the moment. This is a slow-paced game that not a minute I ever regret spending.No such game has made me so attached to a fictional character like RDR2.

It tells the story about the struggles of people whose old way of living is confronted with a new and rapidly ever changing society of the US during the end of the 19th Century. A Story about thieves in a world that does not want them anymore. The World is absolutely gorgeous and lively and there is always something to do may it be hunting, fishing, committing crimes, strangers you encounter or just relaxing during a ride with your horse companion. Everyone in this game has a personality. I would not be able to kill or rob NPCs just for fun as i did in many other games. I would greet every single one of them and talk to them. Engage in games with people at the local saloon and just hang out there. Your gang members feel alive and have a deep character to them. They react to changes you make and feel like a family you care about (except Micah). The level of detail in this game is absolutely insane. Arthur Morgan is an amazing Protagonist and my favourite by far. I absolutely love him and formed a strong bond to him throughout the story. His journey to redemption is what this game is truly about and makes the Story beautiful. It can be slow at times but it will come back with a bang and gets more exciting. Every major loss is a loss you experience on an emotional level even for random strangers you made friends with. This game made me cry. Thank you Rockstar and everyone who worked on it. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to immerse himself/herself and experience an astonishing story. It changed how i view certain things in life. 10/10"

148,BlacKy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blacky-inc/,160,10,1,168.2,August,"31,",181,1,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is not a game, but an experience.You are experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan, a member of a group that wants to live by their own rules and try to make their own future in 1899's USA. Their story serves as a prequel to the first RDR game.Story wise, the game progresses similar to any typical GTA game, slowly climbing the ranks of crime and doing jobs with increasingly dangerous gang members, but the difference between RDR2 and most of the GTA games is that here, the story is the focus of the game, instead of the action.Gameplay wise, the game progresses very slowly and you will need to make sure you have a lot of free time per sitting to play this game, as one hour a day wont be enough to fully experience the game as intended. Every animation takes its time, at some points, you would feel like its somewhat of an RPG grind, but thats the charm of RDR2, as it forces you to embrace the nature of the game and take it all in, instead of rushing between different jobs. Personally it took me 100 hours to finish the story mode and i've barely scratched the surface when it comes to completing all the side stuff, and boy oh boy, there are plenty of those.UPDATED PART - RDR ONLINE:RDRO wants to give a very similar experience to GTA V Online but it fails to do so in a few ways.First of all, expect to have no real help with getting around the game mode as you'll have little sense of whats going on and where to go. Its going to be really helpful to play at least 10-20 hours in single player mode before jumping into online, so you can understand how RDR mechanics even work.2nd, expect the game world to be empty of actual players, because the game mode is dying and also because Rockstar is hiding most players from the map due to past griefing problems (can google about this).And lastly, the last nail in the coffin is how they push pay-2-win mechanics and grinding into the game. Basically, instead of just doing jobs for money so you can upgrade your gear and buy new outfits, the game tells you to first grind gold bars by a broken awards system so you can assign yourself to a 'role', by which you will do normal jobs to earn more money and gold. Online mode tries to be as unwelcoming as possible to new players who just want to play some jobs with friends, as in most cases you will find a lacking online experience that puts you on an 'empty' server as a new character. If you search 'fastest ways to earn gold' on youtube, you will see what i mean about how the grind works. Personally i gave up with Online at level ~20 when i realised its going to be a really unwelcoming experience to just get started with the game.As for loading times, they seem much shorter than in GTA V Online, so thats one positive i can say here, tho expect similar Rockstar server hiccups.Performance and optimization is where the game lacks a bit (used to be much worse when it launched tho). Rockstar didnt do a fine job porting this game into the PC platform and it can be sensed mostly when riding horses, navigating on foot, and doing certain actions with certain key buttons. Nothing out of the ordinary, but know these things exist.When it comes to performace, the game is really demanding. Personally i own an AMD RX 5700xt GPU with a Ryzen 5 2600x CPU and i get solid 75FPS on mid settings at 1440p (cranking the settings to ultra brings down the fps to around 30, again, at 1440p). Gameplay can stutter when entering towns and cities. There are 2 ways to solve this stuttering issue:1) Lower the overall settings of the game2) Change the API from Vulkan to Directx12 (this may cause other problems of its own tho).Make sure you have a beastly PC as this game is not a game that you'd want to play on low detail. Also check optimization videos on youtube and guides on steam community about which setting to set to which value for optimized FPS and detail.Both the special edition and the ultimate edition add some xp bonuses, cosmetics, practical gear and fast horses, and some money in online mode. You can google the full list.So, which game version should you buy?In most cases i would advise to go for the cheapest version as everything else feels like useless cosmetics and pay-to-win mechanics with no real added DLC content, however, when this game goes on sale, Rockstar deliberatedly gives higher sale value on the higher tier versions (20% for base game, 33% on special, and 40% on ultimate), thus leaving the actual price margins to be only a few dollars, so with that in mind, it will make little sense to buy the base game, so wait for a sale and then get the ultimate edition, unless you have no interest what so ever about the things that are added."
149,🍁キ⃣ツ⃣ネ⃣🍁,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AshFox/,193,1,1,316.6,September,"20,",398,4,1,"Storyline: The story mode is a very slow burning candle, it's really slow paced and people are either gonna love it or hate it. I personally like to take my time while playing games so that was a plus for me. The main plot takes its time introducing characters, building up tension and stirring drama, so that the player would actually feel a connection to each character, that connection can be either be negative or positive. : While on the subject of being slow paced, it doesn't  end with the storyline, most elements of this game are made in such a way to be realistic, for better or worse, for example, everything that the main character does is fully animated, skinning an animal, picking up hats from the ground, looting dead corpses, opening individual drawers, picking up items from said drawers etc, now that makes for some good immersion and RP experience, but some people might hate it as it might lose its charm quite early on. : The world in RDR2 might not be the biggest or the most populated out there, but it looks absolutely amazing, especially on higher settings. You're gonna notice the wildlife is quite sophisticated in this game, you're gonna witness crows picking dead bits off dead people, eagles picking rabbits off the ground or seagulls diving for fish. There's always something to do in the game, either it being hunting animals, chasing bounties, robbing trains, starting a bar fight, playing poker or some relaxing fishing, there's almost not a single moment where you're all out of things to do. This brings me to my next subject, Encounters.: There's a lotta side missions in this game, but other than that, there's the smaller, less significant random encounters. Almost everytime you're travelling from point A to point B, you're gonna encounter one. Either it being saving a random girl from a kidnapper, saving some random guy from wolves, getting ambushed by rival gangs, coming across people robbing others, the world always feels alive which is amazing.: The game features a whole lot of talented voice actors for this game, the one you're gonna hear the most would be Roger Clark, the voice actor for the main character Arthur Morgan, he's always gonna have something to say about the situations you find yourself in the game, whether it being in a mission or just randomly roaming about. You'd see the main character singing to himself, or blaming his temper after killing someone innocent, or talking to his horse while cleaning it.  The soundtrack is amazing as well, you'd hear some great calm ,serene tracks during scenes like riding out a snowy mountains or some epic western music when in a huge gun fight. The music doesn't overstay its welcome and it leaves you to your normal gameplay when there's no need for it to be there.: The game looks absolutely amazing, you'd ride around breathtaking vistas, gorgeous snowy mountains, smoke surrounded cities, foggy swamplands or barren deserts, and the game manages to look amazing throughout every landscape you come across.TLTR, the game is quite slowpaced but it can be a great experience for those who appreciate such game designs:It can be fun when played with real friends, but that's personally as far as I'm personally going to go with praising the online part. It may be just my opinion, but the online part absolutely throws everything good about the singleplayer campaign out the window and indroduces some lackluster and barebone system to either get players grinding, or get them to buy gold bars to avoid the grind.Most of the things you do in online aren't that fun, I often found myself TRYING to enjoy it. It greatly suffers from lack of content as everything it currently has is quite barebone and often buggy.It can clearly use some love from R* team for it to be more enjoyable. But right now, it's a meh experience.All in all, the single player campaign is absolutely worth every penny for those who like the points I've mentioned. But I'd do a bit of research before buying the game just for the ONLINE aspect of it."

The Rockstar launcher simply prevented me from launching the game or it crashed. I updated everything and tried many of the fixes suggested by the community but no luck. For a NEW and FULL PRICE game, users shouldn't have to fight with it to make it work on their systems. For 80$ and a 110GB download I should be able to press play and not worry about it launching or crashing.

I don't like giving them my email, creating an account so they can sell me stuff or the extra layer of DRM on top of Steam which treats paying customers like potential criminals.I hate the always online BS (on an offline, single player game) that requires validation every time I launch it, insinuating that their $20 is somehow more important than my time. I hate the fact that I can't play the game right now because their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little servers are down. It basically means I don't own the game because I can only play it when they so graciously allow a mere peasant like myself to play it.It also pisses me off that while their crappy launcher is jerking off in the background, it may be harming performance and I could potentially increase some settings and get the experience I paid for.Putting a small warning about 3rd party DRM on the store front isn't enough. It should be outright banned from Steam and it's a practice which shouldn't be tolerated."

HOWEVER, I've seen lots of people complaining about performance, so be warned, you may have to do some tweaking in the settings before you get performance you're happy with, but I think it is well worth the 10 minutes tops of effort.     This game is a pretty standard R* Affair. Overly linear mission structure, simplistic combat, excessive aim assist (when using a controller), if you've played GTA V, you know what to expect. However, the writing, full of likeable (and unlikable) and interesting characters, with understandable motivations and actions. Story is a major plus for the game, so far. The online experience of Red Dead Redemption 2 has many of the same qualities that GTA Online had, which comes with some pros and cons. The grind is real, it takes a while to level up, and things can feel a bit limited at first, but joining posses with randoms is a great way to try out some of the later content before you've unlocked it, (as well as earning yourself some cash and gold) I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I gained gold, which is the premium currency of the the Online mode. Playing with friends will be a guaranteed good time, just like with GTA Online.All in all, this game runs pretty damn well on my outdated system, while still looking far better than I expected. The gameplay is less-than superb, but the immersion and story is enough for me to foresee myself dumping hundreds of hours into the game. The story has already sunk its claws of intrigue into me, and I doubt it will be long before I've completed it."

159,Saint Aaron,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011965365/,211,4,1,39.8,July,"12,","2,352",7,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its aim to create a immersive and realistic world in which to play out its Western drama. The game is intentionally slow paced, which some may find off-putting, but this pacing is designed to make you explore, take in the natural world, and discover the various secrets and encounters that are out in that wilderness.This is not a game full of high-energy action every few minutes, but a slow, and often lonely, experience which captures the pathos of the decline of the frontier and the old west. Personally I have spent hours simply cantering around the world, greeting strangers, interacting with random events, and observing the wildlife, nothing more than me, my horse (named roach in reference to the Witcher 3) and the wild. It is visually stunning and weather effects and lighting can give even familiar areas a different atmosphere.In the critical reviews there’s a lot of negative remarks about “spending most of the time riding” or “no fast travel”; I just don’t understand this criticism – Why would you not want to ride through remarkable scenery, encountering random things on the way, while heading to your mission? The hours spent riding through the world were probably the most immersive, most enjoyable experiences I’ve had in an open world game for many years. Without that riding, I would never have been ambushed by the O’Driscolls on my way back to valentine, never met a crazy old man who tried to steal my horse, never camped in the wilderness and been threatened by a couple of crazy rednecks, never found out about the secret history of a certain abandoned saloon.If games are only about action for you, then avoid this; If they are about the experience then this game will provide you hundreds of hours of entertainment."

But the funny thing is that this ‘’previous gen game’’ is the best example of what a next gen game is supposed to be. The world, the graphics, the NPC interactions, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the characters, the amount of content, the story (and the list goes on) are insanely good, I have never experienced something like this. The game is years ahead of its time and to be honest, I am scared and also excited to see what the next game of Rockstar will be like."
167,lexilogo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lexilogo/,"1,494",72,0,311.6,May,"9,",442,86,1,"Okay, so to get the elephant in the room out of the way, the singleplayer campaign is REALLY, REALLY good. It absolutely deserved its status as a popular Game of the Year contender/choice. A few highlights I want to make are:Re. Performance errors, I did encounter the dreaded NVIDIA stutter, but after tweaking with options and trying the Rockstar-approved fix, I was able to solve it and everything else was smooth for me. The game's never crashed on me in my time playing it, but my PC is on the higher end of the spectrum and I don't speak for everyone.So, why the negative review?  (either for moral reasons or because you're actually interested)I honestly think Red Dead Online is a better experience than GTA Online, as you can walk for more than a minute without getting killed by the dozens upon dozens of ludicrously overpowered vehicles that roam that abomination- This is partially due to RDO's more grounded setting/feel, and because the open-world is better designed and doesn't cluster damn near everyone in one tiny tenth of the map. (though Saint Denis is usually pretty populated if that's what you're looking for) Plus, the playerbase is generally less interested in senseless murder and 9/10 people you meet won't kill you on sight.And, quite critically, instead of most people spending their time in scripted missions, RDO does a better job juggling between missions and openworld gameplay for moneymaking. It ACTUALLY feels like an open-world game gone online. Admittedly, these missions are largely ruined by forced public matchmaking with no option to solo, so the ""mission"" is more you running around killing things being constantly pressured by the level 200 hardcore grinders to move faster, skip every cutscene, ecetera, but hey, the open-world gameplay is okay enough.And, here's the BUT... Take Two are a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who are certainly not even remotely happy with making some of the best-selling games of all time with ludicrously profitable microtransactions. Nope, the in-game economy needs to either get people dedicated and invested in the game (and therefore willing to spend money on it), OR for whales who want to actually have fun without hours upon hours of grinding for basic necessities, the spending of as much $ as possible.Many items cost several times more than they do in the base campaign (especially cosmetics, 100 RD$ is relatively cheap for a single hat, and hanging up a small picture in your moonshine shack can cost quadruple that), money is much harder to make, and most insidiously, the secondary Gold Bar currency that's extremely tough to earn outside of doing Daily Challenges every single day to keep up a Streak is used not only for things like exclusive cosmetic items, but to bypass level gate requirements and the Roles, which are the primary moneymaking methods and to be frank CONTENT the mode has to offer, are gated behind extorbitant amounts of Gold.Each of the four Roles costs 15 Gold Bars (except for Moonshiner, which costs 25 AND requires the Trader Role to be unlocked and levelled, so you need a total of  Gold Bars to unlock every Role and actually experience what the full game has to offer), and to put that into perspective, completing a Daily Challenge earns you  Gold Bars. You do get multiple Daily Challenges a day, the aforementioned Streaks can help, and you can get around 0.08 Gold Bars per open-world Stranger Mission you do, but it's REALLY horrible, blatant content-gating behind huge paywalls designed to psychologically manipulate people, and there's also the ""Outlaw Pass"" (guess what that is) if all that wasn't enough money lining Take Two's pockets.I'm not sure which system between GTAO or RDO is worse, GTAO's inflated currency resulting in unbelievably excessive money burning pits like the Yachts, or RDO's incredibly stingy economy that has created a system where its players are deathly terrified of investing money in anything they won't make regular use out of, but I seriously dislike both and Look, I'm not against grindy games, I'm not even wholly against microtransactions, and I actually would LIKE the appeal of a world in which every dollar felt precious and like an achievement and where I have to work my way up from a broke cowpoke to an untouchable gunslinger badass- But the presence of a BUY GOLD BARS button immediately obliterates that and is a complete breakdown of player trust. I can no longer assume stupidity when such a massive motivation for malice is present, and I can't go ten minutes in Red Dead Online without being reminded once again that I'm playing a psychologically manipulative scam. to buy this game for its single-player mode, but I  recommend it when it's attached by the hip to Red Dead Online."
168,Geekydeval,https://steamcommunity.com/id/morwull/,250,9,1,50.1,June,"26,","1,260",0,1,"1890, it’s the end of the millennia and with it, the end of an era, the era of outlaws as industrialization reaches all the corners of the United States, it’s the arrival of modern civilization.Let’s get the cat out of the bag as soon as possible, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite games of all time but no game is exempt of things that could be changed so let’s see what’s going on with this game, shall we? Main story is made up of three acts that I will call “from blindly following to breaking free” in which all our characters will evolve in a very surprisingly deep way that we don’t usually see in other Rockstar games. The structure of the story is actually simple: the gang arrives at a new place running away from an old trouble -> gang gets in trouble and needs to move to a new location while the gang has internal frictions that slowly breaks the group. Make no mistake, this is not an endless cycle of running away, it is clearly visible how the group is slowly getting worse both internally and externally, not only their camps get worse overtime with declining living conditions and a very thin brotherhood that it’s getting thinner day after day but also problems get bigger and bigger until everything collapses. The story is superb and completely destroys it’s characters by exposing the true nature of an outlaw life, a decadent and obscure life of escapism, violence and death. This story wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for the so well constructed characters such as Arthur Morgan, the main character. Arthur is a Dutch’s blind follower but at the same time is a co-leader for the band as he’s one of the most trustful members of the group. His personal background is what makes him the ideal main character for this game, since young he has known poverty, violence, pain and crime, another lost boy that gets into Dutch hands, this is why his lifestyle is surrounded by the same violence he experienced and makes impossible for Arthur to establish a relationship or keep a family, the gang is his family now and that’s the dynamic of the game, how his family and his vision of everything that surrounds him will change.The Evolution of Arthur is really well done, all his perception changes are made by subtle situations that will escalate over time from day-to-day situations to really challenging ones, Arthur has a heart inside him, a sad story behind and a not so bright future in front of him but it’s remarkable how we can empathize with him at certain points to the point when we might even care about him.  Not only the story is really well done, the representation of the South-East of the United States of late 1800’s, a nation of contrast, still healing from a not so far war and a country that it’s experiencing numerous changes not only in technological terms but also when it comes to bureaucracy and law, the old world is dying as the new millennia approaches and you can clearly see that in the different regions of the map, from the little rural communities, the untouched natural landscapes overflowing with wildlife to the complete industrialization of the big cities. The differences between the old and the new ways are also visible through the citizens, how they interact with each other, their talking, everything is so amazingly well crafted to give differential elementos to each region and NPCs. This couldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for the enormous amount of technology and fidelity inside this game, it’s possibly one of the most impressive games out there and I’m not only referring to visual elements which are stunning but also depth in terms of interaction, animation and reactive moments. Let’s talk about this, visually this game is a juggernaut, the beauty of a more natural US, the fidelity of the buildings, the different regions, it’s absolutely incredible. In terms of animations and reactivity of the characters with the elements of their surroundings is top notch, I know this element might be divisive due to the slow pace of each interaction however it feels really natural and for me while not necessary it really helps to build this feeling of immersion on this digital world, in general every element of this game is built to make you feel immersed and create the illusion of realism, it does an stunning job, seriously.This game is very demanding so please keep in mind that, I would say my experience in terms of performance was really great with a very consistent performance of 60fps aside of certain extra demanding areas such as Saint Denis but in general, consistent performance and a great quality, a mix of mid and ultra with tons of trial and error until getting the desired performance, I seriously recommend to toy a bit with the options until you get the experience you want. Visually impressive, animations are top notch, what about the music and sound design? Of course it keeps a very high level, sound is in general really good, nature feels natural and industry feels industrial (redundant, I know hehe) but it fits really well on their respective zones, but the important part here is the soundtrack, is it any good? Yes, the soundtrack is good, very noticeable tracks here and there, scripted moments with an specific mood that really changes the feeling of the scene completely and a good variety of styles, the most noticeable, the Spaghetti western music style with those distinct tones, for example, it’s indeed a good soundtrack. So, if everything is good why did I say at the very beginning of this review that there were some things that could be changed in order to make a better product? Well, this is a very personal opinion but, game focuses too much on John Marston and I feel like at times this game is more about John than about Arthur at times, plus, the epilogue feels unnecessary after Chapter five, I feel like they could have done it differently to make it feel important however, for me, it feels like something that shouldn’t be there or should be a completely separated thing from the main campaign but even then it was good and the content was well written with very special moments.Also, please, take in mind that the pace of this game goes from slower to quicker the further you go in the story, brace yourselves and be patient, while the first two chapters are really slow from chapter three up to the end of the game is a roller-coaster of key moments. Is this a bad thing? Absolutely no but I think it’s important as a lot of people will feel like this game is really slow and will probably drop it before it gets really interesting. In conclusion, after all I have said here it is clear that I will recommend you to play this game, however, I must ask you to please let you go and dive into this deep and marvelous world that is the US of late 1800’s, explore the map, meet the numerous people that live in there and enjoy the life of the outlaws and the story of Arthur Morgan, this experience might be one of the best I had playing and I sure hope that yours is as amazing as mine. Absolutely recommended."
169,thkara,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thkara/,92,,1,225.8,January,"30,",902,5,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an extraordinary game in every way. There is immense detail in everything. From start to finish you are immersed in the 19th century of the US following an outlaw gang. You will end up caring for almost each one of the gang members. The story keeps a high standard throughout the game without losing focus or becoming tedious. The epilogue is a love letter to the previous game and ties up the storyline nicely. The protagonist is very relatable. He tried his best. The World is astonishing. NPCs, wildlife, Cities, biomes are all exceptionally crafted. Sent Denis at night is easily one of the most beautiful period cities ever created. The music reinforces the narrative delivering some of the best pieces in video games. Everything in the game is meticulously well placed. The bar is too high for every other open-world game out there.One of the best games I have ever played."

Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.Just remember.Be rootin'be tootin'and above allAlso RDO is kinda So many cheaters.RDR2 = 9/10"

177,✦$@MPH0€N!X✦™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Samphoenix79/,108,8,1,248.3,February,"25,",260,0,1,"I'd like to preface this review by saying few things. This is gonna be a SPOILER FREE review and it will be based entirely on the story mode of the game. The review is my personal take on the game as a whole. So it is quite natural that some of the multitude of other players who have played/been playing this game may differ with what I am gonna write. Opinions are subjective and I am sure everyone understands that. Last but not the least I am writing a review after a long time. So bear with me. Having said all that, let's dive right into it. OPEN WORLDRed Dead Redemption 2's open world is arguably the best open world I have ever been a part of. It is a dynamic world teeming with life in every nook and cranny. From livestock towns to marshy swamps to hustling and bustling metropolis to snowclad mountains to barren desolate deserts the game presents you with amazing and varied environments and vistas to explore. The seamless blending of all these diverse locations as you traverse through the sprawling open world is truly impressive. There are no annoying loading screens which makes it all the more immersive.GRAPHICSThe visual fidelity of the game is absolutely gorgeous. Not only the game presents you with breathtaking vistas but also the subtle effects as in the ears glowing red when sunlight falls on it is something I have never seen in a video game before. It is mind boggling how Rockstar have meticulously put such details into the game. The PC version truly shines in this regard.Here are some screenshots:-STORYI'd just like to give a general overview here. The story spans across a prologue, six chapters and a two part epilogue. It is well and truly one of the most memorable stories I have seen in a video game making the players go through a rollercoaster ride and experience a wide range of emotions. The characters are all fleshed out, the voice acting is impeccable and you really feel the bond growing with almost all of the gang members as you progress through the game. Overall it feels like a really well directed movie with an engrossing plot complimented by excellent writing. You just have to experience it for yourself.GAMEPLAY The gameplay is fairly simple but has some certain nuances about it. It is essentially a shooter as you gun down a large number of enemies in majority of the missions. There's the dead eye system which basically slows down time to take out multiple enemies in one go. Initially you start off with a very basic form of it but as you keep progressing you'll eventually unlock more advanced forms of it. There is also a cover system which is appreciated but imo it felt kind of clunky albeit it works fairly well. Stealth at times is a viable option with bows, arrows and throwing knives. However the inventory management is atrocious. It feels clumsy and dated. The horse AI is awful in this game as well. It is very poorly implemented. Talking about nuances since you'll be exploring the aforementioned diverse locations throughout your playthrough you'll have to dress up accordingly. For instance if you're high up in the mountains you'll have to wear warm clothing in order to prevent your health core from draining out and vice versa. Again the fact that you have to periodically clean the weapons in order to keep them functional is very cool as well. The game also offers extensive gun customization too. Having said all that, the most important part of your entire playthrough will be the gang's camp. As much as one would love to go out exploring and do missions, I was so hooked to just stay in the camp talking to all the gang members, listening to the conversations, their thoughts and the stories they had to share. There'll be times when the gang will be celebrating on some occasions and boy were those times so gratifying. It all felt so organic, spontaneous and natural. Last but not the least there's an honour system in game which basically is a scale to measure the good deeds (like helping people, offering alms etc) and bad deeds (stealing, killing innocents etc) and depending on your honour in game you'll be able to unlock various outfits, interesting encounters and even missions. SIDE MISSIONS, ACTIVITIES AND EXPLORATIONThere are a plethora of things to engage yourself with in this world. The best part about Red Dead Redemption 2 is the unforced exploration. The map is full of unmarked locations and Easter eggs that the players are free to explore at their own pace and it is rewarding especially the treasure hunts. Secondly, the side missions in game are so good. They are funny, well written and feature a wide range of diverse and memorable characters. However some side missions revolve around collectables and I am pretty sure those wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. Apart from those few tedious collectables all the side missions are genuinely good and all worth doing and there are quite a few of them. Lastly the random encounters in the game are equally brilliant and they are so varied and satisfying. For instance I helped a guy by giving him medicine who was dying in the forest after being bitten by a snake and later I met the same guy calling me out in a town and talking to his friend about how I helped him. As for reward, I got to buy a gun from the gunsmith for free. Very rewarding indeed! There are so many different types of these encounters scattered throughout the world and each and every one of them is rewarding in its own way. There are also theatre shows that you can watch and I was literally spellbound by the sheer quality of what I got to see. It is mind boggling to see the amount of effort that has gone into making this game. There are also mini games like Blackjack, Poker, Dominoes etc to partake in.HUNTINGNow Hunting in this game is entirely optional but it is actually a full fledged side activity in itself that requires patience but it is extremely rewarding and satisfying. There are 178 different species of animals and birds in this game and a large number of them resides in their own natural habitat. Not only is hunting required to amass food for yourself but also providing the same to the gang. It is also required to craft satchels, outfits and even some of the aesthetic camp upgrades. The subtlety of hunting different species of animals with different weapons and ammo gives it a somewhat realistic touch. There are a large number of legendary animals to hunt too and each provides a unique perk after successfully hunting one. Same goes for fishing too.CONCLUSIONI'd like to point out some things that has actually hindered my overall experience. The performance and optimization of the game is not good. Although there are many options to tinker with in the graphics settings, overall it just is a sub-par port in my opinion. Secondly the Rockstar launcher is a bad piece of software. Now I personally crashed only once to desktop while playing in my 200 plus hours of gameplay but the most annoying thing I have encountered is the bug where the game would crash right between the transition from loading screen to loading into the open world. Rockstar's official solution to that problem didn't work for me. However fortunately I did manage to work my way around it. Moreover connection issue kept bugging me too. It all stems from that travesty of a launcher. This is completely unacceptable for a AAA game. All the criticism and flak that the PC port has received are completely valid. Despite all that this is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed every minute that I was able to play and it was a journey that will forever be etched in my memory. I recommend it to everyone to try it out and see if it works for them."

The hero of the story, Arthur, meets his mate John in the midst of a crashing world rife with decadence. The two friends get along with each other like two brothers. With the rest of the gang, they must escape from pursuit. Here the story begins and events accelerate rapidly.Can Arthur keep pace with the pace of events amid storms of adversity? This is what you see in the story.The story begins in 1889 and ends in 1908, and during these years you see many changes in the world around you.Fate decided to make the gang members meet with individuals who join them while they are being chased by the authorities. Each member of the gang has a special skill and each individual has a story that has both positive and negative sides. The story gives you a lesson on how to deal with those around you and not to be naive by being a fast judging on people around you. Appearances can be deceptiveArthur is an example of a hero who is loyal to his friends with all what he has.  John is an example of a loyal person who keeps his promises. The world of red dead redemption is a diverse world based on a fictional simulation of the United States during the decline of the Wild West era. You have 5 fictional states based on real life states of the Midwest   southern and west coast parts of the United States. In harmony with this diversity of landscapes, the fauna and the ecological life of the world around you varies from one state to another. As well as the customs and habits of people vary in each state. Simply the game gives you the impression that you are living in that period. When you travel north, you need heavy clothes while in the south you need light clothes and so on. In summary It's a game that leaves its mark on your life.

186,🥀cyb̾eяgơȶhiкa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybergothika/,227,2,1,90.8,May,"24,",204,30,1,"I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because after being overloaded by it. The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why I believe you should reserve this game a special place.I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to pretend they aren't there.I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). I had a sellout discount then it was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to it, this is a survival hybrid game. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already. When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it's everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don't believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can't fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what  once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;If you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.Now while that mode preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. It jeopardizes most of the immersion, starting by the ""Online"" title. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice, like GTAO because of cutscenes with other players, thus it has no substance (still got some story progression) but things are less dense. In order to maintain the sync, some open-world details and features were removed. It lacks new content, it has microtransaction for gold ingots, unpredictable players are annoying and messes with hunting, because chaos rules. Overral; It is a different driving force that requires a mood I don't always have.I like to criticize and I finally managed to nitpick irrelevant things no one gives a xith about, but may be visible to vagabonds, so here I come;Please, If you like my content, would you Devs of the world; shouldn’t you start doing it like R* does? Quit with all the singleplayer manipulation for the love of god. It is your job to avoid breaking it, not mine to accept or pretend. This game just proves it right."
187,Mr.Ora[N]ge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_orange13/,277,8,1,138.2,December,"28,","1,241",20,1,"is by far the best game of all time. It's one of the biggest, most elaborate, most impressive games ever made. It's hard not to agree that this is a masterpiece in the gaming industry (but not for everyone, obviously).The story of the protagonist at the beginning seems simple enough. A bad man, in a gang that is engaged in robberies, sometimes murders. The player can line up Arthur in a slightly different way. You can become a better person, do good deeds and get on the right path. In the middle of the game, Arthur learns about the disease, which will make him repent of what he is doing and why he is doing it. The plot is told slowly, but it is exciting, interesting, thoughtful. I want to go through each mission, watch cutscenes and see what will happen next with the main character and his gang. After all, the gang is also changing and not for the best (but see for yourself).Additional tasks are inferior to the plot in interestingness, some tasks act as teaching something. For example, how to rob a cart, to whom to drive it to get a reward. There are many short tasks, funny and even scary. Some of the quests are connected with the heroes from Dutch's gang.You can once again take a break from the storyline or learn something new and interesting. Almost all tasks are quite simple, so why not go through them.Next, we will talk about gaming activities and the liveliness of the world.There are a lot of them in the game, you will hardly find a more filled world than in Red Dead Redemption 2.Random encounters happen everywhere, whether to help people depends only on you.Unexpected attacks of hostile gangs on you, of which there are only 6 in the game, and all over the world you can meet people from different gangs or their camps.Many small tasks, random encounters, as well as the opportunity to explore the world- Cigarette cards of which there are more than a hundred in the game and each card belongs to a separate collection, they can be collected and sold to a collector.- Dinosaur bones, there are 30 bones in the game, after you collect all, an additional quest will open.- Hunting and fishing, a total of 14 legendary fish and 16 legendary animals that require bait to catch- Dreamcatchers, 20 locations in total. They are one of the types of collectibles that hang from trees.- Treasure maps, caches, cave paintings, board games and much more you can find just by exploring the world.Whether you do this or not is up to you.The gameplay is very meditative, slow, but at the same time exciting and quite interesting. The game has excellent movement on a horse around the big world, excellent battles with enemy gangs, there is a hunting and fishing system, a resource management system.The game has a gorgeous picture, there is no doubt about it.I really liked the play of the rays of the sun. Well done change of weather, time of day.Rain / thunderstorm is generally a separate topic for admiration.In a word, not a game, but a real paradise for those who like to take beautiful screenshots.The music score also fits in very well with the game.One can feel the attention to every little thing, in the same collection of herbs, bottles, cans, opening cabinets, doors, and so on. Even the process of collecting trophies from opponents.Of course, the speed of collecting items suffered from this, and for many, I think, for the entire time of the game, all this will have time to get bored with order. Moreover, the animations of all this are the sameThe horse riding is also excellent (as is the care of the filly). It's so good that I've never used fast travel during my entire playthrough.What for? - if there is so much to see around. And in general, it allowed me to fully feel the atmosphere of the game :)This is one of the best story games. If you want to get a great story for 80+ hours and delve into the world of the Wild West, you should definitely try this game if you haven't already. The game has a lot of cool activities, various secrets, very serious detailing and elaboration of small details that no one ever thinks about, but they are in the game. I want to erase my memory in order to go through this game again and get a lot of fun and enjoyment. I definitely recommend at least trying this game, even if it's not your genre."

I'm sure those people are legitimately having issues, but those issues do not affect everyone.Red Dead Redemption 2 was already practically my favorite game after playing it on PS4 and being blown away by the story, gameplay, and amazing environment in which it takes place. Leading up to the release on Steam I was little worried after hearing about some of the issues with the PC launch, but I'm very happy that I have had zero issues with the game now that my wife bought it for me as an early Christmas gift. No launcher issues, no crashing, and it runs beautifully.FRAME RATE TIP: Turning down graphics settings related to water makes a huge difference. I was only getting about 35 FPS near the river in the first area of the game. I turned water physics down to the second highest notch and gained 20+ frames per second. Now about 5 hours in and the frame rate has remained at a smooth 55-60 FPS at minimum (quite a bit more in some scenes), with everything set to ultra aside from turning water physics down one notch.As long as you're not one of the unfortunate souls with launcher issues and crashing, you're in for one of the most amazing video game experiences of this generation."

The open world is stunning and inviting, the story is captivating and addictive, the characters are lovable and interesting, and the combat is satisfying and entrancing. Sure, the controls and some of the missions aren’t perfect, but the game’s positives far outweigh the negatives. This is one of those games that are genuinely worth their high Triple A price tag, so if you’re in the market for a long game that you can sink hours and hours into with an amazing story, then look no further than Red Dead Redemption 2."

It's criminal that this game is overshadowed by God of War in 2018 for the GOTY award, but that doesn't matter. Red Dead Redemption 2 is unbeatable in every aspect, so much so, it feels like they developed the game in 2030 and sent it back to 2018 to please us.Its technicality, the graphics, the main story, the side missions, the random events, the characters, the voice acting, the world, the animals, the guns, the sound design and nearly the whole game are so so so top notch, only another Rockstar game can surpass this level of quality. I always thought The Witcher 3 is the best game in terms of storytelling and side missions, but I think I will have a very very hard time to like any other open world game after Red Dead Redemption 2.This game is so amazingly good that it will make most of the other games as it's been developed by kindergarten students for a very long time.

The single player story is well developed, with excellent character development and an interesting storyline. The world is beautiful and the gameplay is immersive. There is much to do and you infrequently become bored while playing the story mode.Red Dead Redemption online (a RDR version of GTA Online) lacks substance and is a clear cash-grab by Rockstar. The developers make money when players purchase ""Gold Bars""- purchasing in game currency with real money (AKA Microtransactions or ""Pay-to-win""). With this is mind, the developers have modified the game to make it difficult to earn money, while raising the prices of items and upgrades available to the player.  Many of the ""money-making"" activities that make single player so exciting (robbing trains, banks, stagecoaches, etc) have been removed from the online version. The value of items gained through hunting/fishing have been /repeatedly/ reduced, making these activities less profitable.  NPCs drop very small amounts of cash, and rarely drop sell-able loot. The prices of weapons and horses have increased significantly from the levels in the Story mode. If you would like to hunt bounties to earn money (like in singleplayer), you need to buy ""Gold Bars"" and purchase a ""Bounty Hunting License"". Much of the content is locked behind DLC and in-game currency purchases. These modifications are a thinly-veiled attempt to increase the earnings of the developers, at the expense of a game with great potential. RECOMMENDATION: Buy RDR2 on sale and enjoy the excellent singleplayer side, avoid it if you are primarily looking for an online experience."

215,Solaire Bro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/constantdiversion/,117,5,1,68.7,November,"21,",349,5,1,"The video games I’ve always been the most interested in are the ones that cared the most about their narrative. From classic SNES RPGs to Red Dead Redemption II, it’s always been the most reliable separator from the pack, despite perceived mechanical shortcomings. Ignoring recent trends across the industry most-assuredly disagreeing with my supposition, RDR II is a bolded example of a game making the story the priority.    This is, of course, not to say that there haven’t been examples of recent games caring about their narrative (Metro: Exodus, Cyberpunk 2077), it’s just to say that an additional emphasis this generation has been more about creating imaginative ways of squeezing as much money out of the game and player as to make the company's time and financial investment worthwhile. And I’m not suggesting that RDR II’s creators weren’t concerned about their bottom line, but considering the financial success of another Rockstar IP you might have heard about; I think it’s fair to say they were allowed to create the game they wanted to make.  And what they made was Read Dead Redemption II.   RDR II is an odd Rockstar game in many ways. Even when comparing it to its predecessor. It’s less juvenile in its presentation, much more serious in its manner, mature in its execution, and frankly much more melodramatic. The results of which end up manifesting themselves in the oddest ways. You end up with the best Rockstar game – but perhaps, not the most fun one.  And I don’t mean that negatively. Melodrama in RDRII, or otherwise, can be extraordinarily affective in storytelling. As a rule, if you care about the characters then the melodrama is working. The key is that the story itself remains consistent in its approach. There can’t be any camera winking, or horseplay, once the drama kicks in because it must stylistically hold you in place until it makes its point. It’s not what it’s about, it’s how it’s about it. But we’re jumping ahead a little bit here. RDR II is the sequel/prequel to Red Dead Redemption that genuinely serves as both. The chronology places it before the events of RDR, but the game’s tradition of “redemption” center around a new protagonist named Arthur Morgan. In the absence of retracing story beats from a game over a decade old, this story is about the gang we heard so much about in the progenitor. Meaning that plenty of familiar faces return, and the game’s creators do an excellent job of manipulating the player’s own sense of nostalgia against themselves.  This does make playing the original more necessary, because the story makes the chronologies’ roots grow in importance. Provided the player is willing to lower their guard and allow for the immersion to suck them in. And they will be sucked in. RDR II’s narrative doubles down on the series’ thesis about the death and rebirth of America the was previously made in the original. The only difference is that RDR was about lingering after the rebirth. RDR II is about standing face-to-face with its death.   Like most of Rockstar’s IPs, RDR II is a third-person open world shooter complete with all the trimmings we’ve come to expect from their titles. There is a mini-map embedded in the UI which sends the player to alternating quest hubs in order to receive story candy. This is classically delivered via violent shootouts or emotional character quiet time. But unlike most of Rockstar’s works, RDR II layers more customized nuance based upon player choice (albeit limited).    To increase immersion, Rockstar actually changed their formula. Very quickly the action genre begins to fade away, and you would be forgiven for mistaking RDR II for something more akin to a western-themed RPG. Player choice, while limited in its options that don't involve outfit and equipment shopping (because there’s like a million options there), is paramount here.  Do the new options of progression offer more variety? Mechanically, not a ton. Story-wise, perhaps more. The choices the player selects decide the accounting for how much more, or less, “redemption” Arthur requires.  Because RDR II allows the player to interact with everyone they meet, there will always be a positive or negative interaction left in Arthur’s wake. Additionally, there also exist binary choices manifested within the story that hold an even greater effect in its overall outcome. And this is extremely powerful in the game’s many sad moments. Arthur’s fear of perdition is what makes him vulnerable, and the story threads provided by an excellent mid-game twist can have a major impact on how the player plays the game.  That is how you make player choice meaningful. It’s no longer enough to simply have it exist.   Rockstar understands its genre wholly. Westerns are very rarely ever about the setting.  Instead, they almost universally break down into two main categories: 1) The celebration of the American cowboy archetype mythos. 2) The complete deconstruction of that same archetype.  RDR II manages both.  The first half of the game has you playing poker hands, robbing trains, and having gun fights. The second half is about giving up control, making amends, and the expectation of damnation. This isn’t to say the second half ceases being a game, there’s still plenty of bombast and third-person action. But once the bullets stop flying the game is always there to subtly remind you, the player, that hell awaits our protagonist. This moves center stage around the midway point because the game productively begins leveraging Arthur's life choices against his life’s regrets, invoking an earnest sense of empathy from the player because they’re essentially being indicted too. Because the person holding the controller is the one making his choices.    Every choice the player makes paints the world in effective shades of gray because there’s no black and white way of looking at the situations the game displays. There are just too many characters, too many different play styles (via weapons or internal mission choices) the player might utilize for a one-size-fits-all representation of RDR II. Mileage varies. It feels good to shoot people that deserve it, sure, but the body count begins to feel like a liability when events in the narrative cause our protagonist's life to fall apart. This is an excellent western. And an excellent video game.  In RDR II, Arthur’s “redemption” is evasive. Too high a mountain to climb. For the player, it’s whatever they want it to be - hell or heaven, wickedness or kindness, redemption or perdition.  The game suggests that it’s never too late to change. But, indeed, Rockstar did change. Because what you’re left with at the end of Arthur’s journey is one of the finer video game story arcs in recent years.  At one point during a mission Arthur says, “We’re thieves in a world that don’t want us no more.”  How wrong you were Arthur Morgan. How wrong you were."

It’s pretty cool when mainstream resources come together with talented game designers (who actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about quality). Rockstar games have been the coolest game making company for a long time now, like since the 1990’s even.

The realization that something this good will probably never come your way for a long time, is both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent example in the medium of video games. It's basically a 40-hour long western cinematic experience that puts almost every other AAA title to shame because of how unbelievably brilliant it is. That being said, this game isn't really meant for players who just want to have fun and don't care about how the story goes. If you're one of those players, then I'd advise against buying this game, because in my opinion, although the side activities and various other missions are extremely well done, you're eventually going to get bored. However, if you're like me and you love excellent stories that take their time to develop, building up to a satisfying payoff, then Red Dead Redemption 2, is beyond a doubt, one of, if not the greatest video games to ever exist.For a game released in 2018, RDR2 raises the bar quite high in terms of graphical excellence and fidelity. Everything (literally) in the game is hyper-detailed and realistic to such an extent that many other games seem unpolished after playing this one. Even some AAA games three years after RDR2 seem lacking in detail some way or the other. The weather patterns, environments, animals, people, buildings and objects are incredibly detailed and when combined together, create a world that's just stunning. Coupled with the (once again) highly detailed and impressive animations for each and everything, starting from the way trees move all the way to the muscles around a horse's nose and ears, it all seems so immersive it makes you forget you're playing a video game on your computer. Additionally, the lighting engine is just magnificent. The full resolution ambient occlusion around people's faces and the way light sources react around the world is frighteningly realistic. There's no texture popping or weird glitches whatsoever in the graphics department, and it raises your immersion levels by several notches. This game is truly the definition of “next-gen” for its time of release.However, it's worth knowing that RDR2 is a demanding game and the graphics optimization may or may not please you, depending on the hardware you have and the settings you play in. I played it on high settings (PC specs at the end of this review) and averaged around 30 frames per second, which is good enough for a breathtaking cinematic experience like this.RDR2's gameplay is vast and diverse, the majority of which involves you riding horses and shooting people. There’s an almost overwhelming amount of stuff that you can do in this game apart from the above. For instance, you can hunt animals, play poker, get drunk, buy new clothes, get a haircut, buy food and drink, make potions and tonics, craft arrows and bullets of various types, rob coaches and trains, help strangers, and so much more. The huge open world is something that explorers are going to enjoy quite a lot, with no pointless or nonsensical side missions. It’s just at the verge of being “too much”; however, grinding for money and exploring much isn’t necessary, as the story missions provide you with just enough materials to progress. In short, you can choose whether to enjoy only the story or go full-on role-playing whenever you want, and the game doesn’t restrict you in any way. The controls and animations feel weighty and realistic. This game is obviously better suited for a gamepad, but the PC controls are just about right, and I have nothing to complain about. Although there’s no permanent fast-travel system, which can be tedious at times, while riding your horse from one end of the map to another, it’s no big deal, because the atmosphere and amazing graphics make up for it. The variety and immersion in RDR2's gameplay is straight-up superb.RDR2's story can be summed up as one of those awesome one-time experiences that you have in life. One that becomes a fond memory, with the disappointing assumption that you'll never get to experience something like this for the first time ever again. It's a long story consisting of six chapters and two epilogues but doesn't get boring (it never did for me). It takes its time to let you slowly know your people and get attached to them, and it does that through the use of dialogue, writing and cinematography so astronomically excellent for a video game that it hardly gets your eyes off-screen. Many people regard RDR2's story as a ""slow burn"", but in my opinion, it's that particular demographic which expects some sort of dramatic excellence in a story, and it isn't their fault. This game won't necessarily blow your mind with twists and turns, nor will it necessarily leave you emotionally traumatized (like the intro to The Last of Us); but rather, it will tell a tale about the outlaws who come to terms with their lives and deeds, as modern civilization begins to flourish. It's a story about redemption (duh), and by the end of it, you'll feel like you've completed a journey like never before. RDR2 is one of the best examples in a video game where the emotions you feel in game are strangely similar to how you'd actually feel in real life. It's not too dramatic or overwhelming, it's just perfect. It glues you to your screen, not because of a gripping, edge-of-your-seat story, but with  Yes, you read that right. Hats off to the writers for crafting so many brilliant characters. Arthur Morgan is, without a doubt, one of the greatest video game protagonists ever. The way he's voice-acted, presented and developed throughout the story is nothing short of sheer excellence. And this goes to literally every other character in the game as well (I'm not kidding. Every character is pure excellence.), but for the sake of this review, I'm going to keep it short. RDR2's story might just the best video game story to have ever been crafted and executed this well in the medium. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and although it's not meant to be enjoyed by everyone, it does what it has to do, and easily destroys every competition there is.Overall, RDR2 is definitely, without hesitation, the greatest game of 2018, and maybe even the last generation. It has one the best executed stories in gaming history, brilliant characters, rich and diverse open-world gameplay, unbelievably good dialogue, and insane, realistic graphics. I mean, what more could a game need? Go play it. It’s a masterpiece.Processor: Intel Core i7-9750HRAM: 16 GB dual channel DDR4Graphics: Nvidia RTX 2060 Mobile (90W)"

While the plot does drag a bit around chapter 5, and some of the late-game sideplots could be cut in my opinion, I was still moved and in love with Arthur Morgan's story, as well as how his story meshed well into that of John Marston. The acting and the writing were all exemplary, the kind of quality I would expect out of a big-budget production like a movie.The gameplay can be hit or miss, as the missions all have a very uniform structure and are the exact opposite of guided by player choice, but that doesn't mean that there weren't plenty of fast-paced, exciting ones to he experienced.

Another known issue I encounter is a weird smudging effect with objects in the distance, and with hair/beards. After a bit of searching online, I've deduced this could well be an issue with the Anti-aliasing (TAA in particular). It's not as noticable on higher resolutions, but it's still something that should be addressed.While the game is now ""serviceable"", it still runs like ♥♥♥♥ for a lot of others, even after several patches with R* insisting the game is fixed.Is this really the acceptable standard for AAA titles on PC? Surely not.To add insult to injury, a week after it released on Steam, the game is now on sale @ -20% for the standard edition & -25% for the Special and Ultimate editions.Apparently this is how R* treats the Steam user base. If it wasn't for the fact I'm over the 2hr mark, I'd consider getting a refund, and waiting for some optimisation and a more appropriate price tag.Like I said, it's a great game, but I would hold off until they resolve the current issues, and perhaps wait for a big sale."

So here it goes...Red Dead Redemption 2 is personally for me one of the greatest games I have ever played. The level of graphics, attention to detail, richness of the vast open world makes it a truly unique playing experience.On highest details the game looks a lot like the real world. With your headphones on you can hear the nature around you, when you hunt or when you just pass by on your mission.You can profile yourself as the good gangster with heart or the bad gangster without mercy. Or also something inbetween, depending on the choices you make.Prepare to travel the world of wild wild west and participate in a wide variety of rich quests that fit in really well. From robbing and killing to helping and hunting, the choice is yours.More detailed review laters :)"

Rockstar told me to rename my settings folder to whatever I wanted under documents files and reverify the integrity of the files through the Steam launcher. It did not work, they told me to reinstall the game and not change the graphics settings, even though they were lower graphical settings and it would not start to begin with.

Pun intended!Rarely do I buy games  but this was the case, and the name of the accident was Summer Sale. I’m scared of long games. All three  bought but still untouched, shame on me as a Pole I know. Somehow I decided to give this one a go, and I was hooked immediately.What I love about RDR2, and why for me it’s been a gaming experience like no other?First, the vastness of the world. When you gallop on your horse hearing all the ambient sounds and watching various animals running around, you really feel like you are actually there. The care for detail is almost unnatural, and all is designed in a way that lets you experience that world without loading screens. You’re just there. Someone wrote that it’s , and I think they were on point.All missions, from main ones to random encounters with strangers mix together perfectly and play well into the overall story arc. You can always  just to go hunting or fishing. Everything’s there, from bears to the smallest fish in the pond. Same variety can be observed in main missions – from stealth action to robbing a bank or a train on the move.Gang’s camp is very lively thanks to your everyday chores and duties there, the characters (including yours), their stories, voice acting (those accents!). Also because of what goes around every time you come back after one or more days on the road when you were spending nights in the wilderness. Several hours in and you start to feel like the camp is your home and your family.The dynamic weather and day/night cycle work great no matter where you decide to spend the night. The  is yet another nice touch. It’s based on your character’s behaviour which influences the overall gameplay – dialogues, product prices, number of available outfits or even the amount of loot you find on corpses. The story is in sync with what kind of Arthur  decide to become. I’ve read that the ending you’ll deserve will be just as synced, although I don’t know yet if that’s true. Redemption, anyone?This game is also a great compendium of animals and plants. For me, a non-native English speaker, also a fantastic way to learn cowboy English – , , , , , ,  – these are just a few examples of the many new words I learnt.There are several flaws but they can be lived with. Clunky controls. My horse switching from female to male and losing its name on a regular basis. The abundance of what can be done in this game sometimes plays to its disadvantage – in-game tutorials presented briefly simply won’t do. You’re better off watching some clips and reading tips and tricks on the web just to be sure you’re getting as much from this product as you’d really want.And, of course, this is a long game. For some this can be a negative as well. I strongly recommend not to  to the finale as you’ll be missing a lot, but it’s your choice here, and the availability of such choice to make is yet another good thing.It’s a masterpiece. Go buy right now. I ain’t working for Rockstar but surely love me some RDR2. 10/10"

Now, you might ask, ""Well why didn't you tell Rockstar?"" Well apparently you can't submit tickets for suspension or banning, their staff saying the decisions are final. The modder who did it also happened to blow me up, interrupt missions I was in and kill all the NPC's around me, and a plethora of other issues.Ever been surrounded by like six people and then get teleported while they all watch you? Well it's all the more infuriating when the person who teleports you starts yelling in Korean, and then laughs. It's even more irritating when Rockstar still hasn't patched the nonsense where people can make themselves look like other people, and change their display name in a server where you can't report them.I get caught in the crossfire, and some idiocy happens. Rockstar doesn't care. I got blammed for getting cougars spawned at me, and then I'm the bad guy cause I managed to kill them despite the hacker constantly hitting me. Hell, at one point I just ran to Blackwater, started blasting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then selling the pelts. Before anyone decides to tell me, ""Well you were cheating then!"" have you ever had dozens of cougars try and rip you apart, and then have to kill your way through them all?

FOR BEGINNERS: Long press start will bring up the map skipping the menu. Also first person mode is very immerse please try! Take care of your horse, make sure to have horse revival or two!Story: (9.5/10) The story telling in this game is near perfect. World: (9/10) The open world in this game was again one of the best I’ve had the pleasure of exploring. So much detail on such a big map. Flowing rivers with dynamic weather. It’s hard not to feel like you’re actually there. The big disappointment here is that the enemy/animal spawns are ♥♥♥♥. There are almost no predators and the ones that do exist always spawn in the exact same spot. I have over 20 hours in the game and I’ve only seen 1 brown bear outside of a scripted event. Same can be said about enemy spawns. The camps are always in the same spot, and outside of scripted events you are safe to explore everywhere else.Gameplay/Mechanics: (6/10) You can’t rob banks, and the bounty system is broken. There is no bullet drop, and the shooting feels like a lateral move (maybe even a step down) from the first game. Also there are no underwater or above ground components. Swimming is pretty standard in most other open world games, but I guess they felt that wasn’t necessary either. Most buildings are closed off. Makes sense in Saint-Denis, but even in the rest of the world only like 10% of buildings are accessible. It feels like a big tease. interface is tidies and looting is not pleasant nor feels rewarding.Immediately went on sale a week after launch. Slap in the face to initial adopters like me who got it on day one. Absolutely no respect for PC gamers. Overall I’ll give it a 8.5/10. Great, but left a lot to be desired. But... still the best way to kill time till Biomutant and Cyberpunk 2077 are out!P.S. There is a hidden setting in the system.xml file (my doc\rockstar\...) that everybody should adjust. Find deepsurfacequality and change it to ultra. This gets set to lower with these settings and causes the ground tracks,footprints, mud etc to render at very short draw distance. Changing this has no noticeable impact on fps but fixes the terrible draw distance"

It reaches level of immersion I never felt with any other game.This game made me so sad…  It’s heartbreaking. A tale of survival, family, loyalty and relentless brutality. Never in recent memory has a game impacted me so hard on an emotional level. The only two examples I can think of in which the loss of fictional characters affected me this much was when Dumbledore died in the HP books and when Sora and Kairi separate at the end of the original Kingdom Hearts game. I miss Arthur’s voice, his drawings, his interactions with the people of the camp… I hate and love this game and it’s characters. I don’t know what to make of it. This has genuinely been a beautifully epic and harrowing experience for me. It’s like… watching Breaking Bad or Braveheart for the first time, being filled with so much emotion.

I can't remember the last time i've gotten this much genuine enjoyment from a game before. First of all, i won't be talking about the online mode as i have yet to experience it firsthand but aside from that, the graphics are absolutely phenomenal in this game. The sound design truly makes me feel like i'm IN the game. You can hear birds chirping, flowing water, the creaks in floorboards. It's really something. Don't even get me started on the amazing story. Each character has their own unique personality that makes you grow attached to the character and make you feel like you're talking to an old friend or a relative. i showed genuine emotion throughout my playthrough with the amount of twists and turns that the story has. I won't spoil much of the story but just know that it is one of the best story modes i have played in a game. There is an abundance of content to play around with. Apart from the main story, there are many side activites you can do like fishing and hunting, playing poker in a bar, or doing side missions. I'm not usually fond of huge open world games but with Red Dead Redemption 2, i loved just hopping onto my horse and riding around for hours on end just taking in the beauty of the game. I loved exploring and finding hidden secrets like a chest full of gold hidden by a tree or a unique weapon in a cave.All in all, i absolutely enjoyed my experience with Red Dead Redemption 2. It is still one of my personal favorites and an all around good game. (P.S. this game is very intensive with its graphics so i recommend checking whether or not your graphics can handle this game on its high or medium settings before purchasing.)"

A game in which the creators paid attention to even the smallest details, and I think you will agree with me that small details are actually the most important segment of any project.To really mention any mistake or bug in this game can be considered as a sin, because no matter what mistake or bug existed, if we put it on the scales with all the positive features, the weight of it will not even be noticed.I’m really thrilled with every segment of the game, and my favorite is hunting. So you can spend hours hunting different animals, learning new things about them and simply enjoying it.The scenery is simply enchanting and indescribable in words. Indeed, so far no game has thrilled me like this one.Although I am only in Chapter 3 I can say that the main story, characters, events and everything else are really really damn fascinating.I would write for hours but I know no one will read that much so I will stop here with the words: if I had to choose just one game to play it for the rest of my life, I would choose Red Dead Redemption 2."

It's one of the absolute best looking games ever to be released; its huge, varied world is rendered in an impressive, almost photo-real way. It's filled to the brim with life, from birds circling in the sky overhead to fish swimming in the river beneath your feet to strangers stuck by the side of the road. The open-world is probably the most detailed and lived-in I've ever experienced. It feels markedly real. That's a good thing, too, considering the amount of time you'll spend traversing it. Riding to and from your main objectives will often take longer than the missions themselves. The lack of comprehensive fast travel means you'll be doing this long after you've seen every beautiful location the map has to offer. Thankfully, then, no two journeys are ever the same. The amount of ways you can interact with the people you meet out in the world is amazing, and the small encounters you directly control are incredibly satisfying to play. They're possibly the best aspects of the game. That's because the main missions, which can often feel restrictive when compared to the free-roaming stuff, are as often utterly thrilling as they are frustratingly slow. The piece has a deliberate pace which unfortunately means that it takes a while to truly get going. However, it very much adds to the overall experience. It's supposed to be long, ebbing and flowing as its seasons and circumstances change. Its extended epilogue does take the wind out of the sails of its ending, but it's arguably vital in achieving the effect the finale is meant to have. Regardless of its issues, the narrative is straight-up phenomenal.It tells an at once personal and sweeping tale, crafting characters that seem so human you could swear they were real. Something that the piece does a phenomenal job with is the development of its side-characters. The people who don't get much play in the cut-scenes can be spoken to around camp, or even taken on small adventures, which is somehow enough for you to form almost as close a connection with them as you do with any other. When one of your companions inevitably dies, it's genuinely heartbreaking. That can be said of the overall thing, too. It's heartbreaking. Yet, it's also exciting, funny, hopeful, tragic, beautiful and, even, poignant. It strikes the perfect balance between sincere and satirical. It's generally more serious than its predecessor and, as such, it's more impactful. Most of the silliness is reserved for its entertaining side-missions, which suits them well. It's often genuinely affecting and it has a strong underlying theme that lives up to its title. The writing is just wonderful. It's consistently good across each and every character you meet. The morality system actually changes some small things about the story, too. For the best result, you should get all of your dastardly doings out of the way to begin with; the most fitting ending, thematically, is the 'high honour' one. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and varied, with satisfying shooting and surprisingly deep mini-games. The animation, which is superb, does sometimes get in the way, causing some slight chunkiness that can be cumbersome to begin with. However, this is easy to adjust to and it simply adds to the overall slower pace of the game. It's a measured affair, never as unrelentingly fast as some of its peers but nearly always more satisfying. In the end, this is an engaging, entertaining and affecting experience. It's a massive, thematically rich ride that stands out as one of the best games of all time.rest in peace Arthur."

If you want to play this game you have to use the social club launcher.  I have 2 different social club accounts. One works just fine, the other one doesn't. I lost the email for that account six years ago. But this is fine, right? You should just log in your social club account that works and start the game, right?WRONGYou don't even get to CHOOSE the account that gets linked to steam. I tried to start the game, and it just randomly chose the old account. The game just tells you it sent a verification email to an e-mail adress that doesn't work without giving you any choice or options at all. Think about that; I have a functioning steam account and a functioning social club account and I still can't start the bloody game. I logged in to the social club account to try and link it to steam. But the option isn't even there. You can link your account to  Xbox live, playstation network, games for windows live, twitter, twitch and even facebook. But steam isn't there? why the ♥♥♥♥ is steam not there?How a triple a developer managed to pull that off is just mind-blowing to me.  Can't recommend until Rockstar gets their ♥♥♥♥ together. Will be getting a refund"

The views are incredible, pretty waterfalls, great landscapes & I enjoy the variety of weathers. Even the ambience is good. My favourite map parts are Ambarino, West Elizabeth & New Hanover. ✅ Quests were fun, easy to follow and I did every single one! I enjoyed both the story and the online tremendously. I did not *connect* with the characters much, but I really liked some of the side quests characters. The story was really fun to play regardless. The online has fun events too, the photography one where you run around & take pictures of animals is my favourite (and I win a lot!) 🐴 The multiple horse breeds in this game is definitely a huge plus from me, horse girls will definitely love this game! You can ride, pet, brush, lead & feed them! Simply riding the horse throughout the map is fun for me, I hardly ever use the fast travel option. A great plus too is you can PET the dogs!😀 The fighting is fun, there are multiple guns & I really enjoyed the Dead Eye which slows down time in the story mode. It highlights herbs, collectables & animals which is really useful too. I like how you can fool around in the map by lassoing your friends in the online or innocent passerby's in the story mode. There's a lot of nice details in this game like picking up herbs & selling them to a doctor, going to a photography booth, play poker, or get drunk in The Saloon etc. The online is a lot of fun to mess around with some friends, 🎣 Hunting & fishing in this game are really fun, and the hunting wagon in the online is super helpful! I loved finding all the legendary fishes & animals, as well as just regular hunting. If you do not like hunting, you can now also sedate them in the online and bring a sample to Harriet. There are also online events where you can either protect legendary animals, kill poachers, or hunt animals.I'm probably forgetting something, but I simply can not recommend this game enough! Absolutely amazing 12/10 💖(The only bad thing about it however is in the online there are some people who will ruin the experience by blowing you up or something similar in the online. I would also like to be able to pick a specific spot to place my camp in the online, instead of it being randomised)"

285,Luriam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/,860,66,1,705.8,December,"22,",247,72,1,"I wholeheartedly recommend Red Dead Redemption 2, and here's why.It is a mature, story driven, open world game. And it touches on some profound subjects like loyalty, sacrifice, loss and redemption. And as such, you have to respect the pacing and the time necessary for character and story development. Things take time, and good things take even longer. But in the end it will all be worth it.If you expect this game to behave like a battle royale, guns blazing, non-stop action clownfiesta - you'll be sorely disappointed. This game is the complete opposite of that. It's about character growth, meaningful choices and living with the consequences. Not gonna lie, a combination of all the things I'm about to mention, mixed with personal feelings made me tear up at a certain point in the game. And that's the magic that inspired me to write this review. The prologue serves as a short introductory tutorial, which in turn also shows off some of the game's innovative technology. Gorgeous graphics, volumetric lighting, polished animations, incredible weather effects and biomes, all of that wrapped nicely in a very well crafted soundtrack suite.I was lucky enough to be able to run the game on a combination of Ultra and High settings. And it is ridiculously beautiful. And I'm not talking only about the textures and shadows. But also how the world itself looks and works. All the big things like three dimensional looking clouds, vast gaping canyons, perilous mountains and treacherous swamps. And all the small details like different tracks and imprints in the snow, a million different animations for skinning animals, collecting plants or interacting with your horse. Clothes getting dirty, dusty, snowy, muddy or bloody depending on where you are and what you're doing.I've never seen a game have this many animations for literally everything in the game. Every little action has it's own animation, mesh and sound. Even after 150 hours played I am still amazed by how detailed everything is. The game's story immediately gripped me and also gave me a lot to think about. It's not every day that you play as an experienced outlaw cowboy, that's also a part of a very homely gang of criminals. The writing is on point, the characters are all interesting and have a role to play. And you will find yourself inevitably caring for these crooks and felons. All the cutscenes are masterfully executed with a touch of Hollywood type of production. Lots of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. I also found myself comparing Red Dead to The Sopranos a little bit. As in there's some similarities when it comes to personality clashes, dialogues, escalations, conflicts and that shocking realization that no one is safe. And even major characters can be killed off at any moment, especially when you least expect it. I really liked that, and I enjoyed that feeling of unpredictability.My favorite feature by far is the ability to make choices. And choices always have repercussions. Some sooner, and some later, but they always do. And I love that. I love that I can choose what kind of man my protagonist is gonna turn into. Most missions will offer you a choice one way or the other. And these choices will define your character's personality and alignment, mission outcome, and even the game's very ending.I honestly didn't expect the game's music to be this pleasant and memorable. Rockstar games always end up having a good, solid score. But I never actually wanted to listen to it outside of the game. Until Red Dead. Because this game not only has this very charming fusion of western and ambient music. But also a unique soundtrack that has been specifically written and composed for different moments in the game. Very impressive and I admit that I must have listened to  on repeat at least 50 times. The world feels alive and lush with sounds. This game makes watching your character light up and smoke a cigarette look entertaining. And it's in no small part due to the amazing audio design. Animals and forests, cities and towns, high octane firefights and relaxing nights in your camp. They're all so immersive and well put together. The little comfy parties that sometimes occur, have in-game characters actually sing and perform all kinds of folk songs. That's lip sync, face and body motion, as well as actually singing and jesting. That detail alone had me in awe of the game's excellent cast. Some characters sing well, some sing poorly, but when put together it all sounds so real, so lifelike. You could swear that the developers just put all the voice actors in one room and told them to improvise and interact with each other. So many lines of dialogue, so much variation, so much talent. Even the characters that you despise, you kind almost like because of how real they seem.I played a good 40 hours of Red Dead Online and I have to say I love it. You have a decent character creator, tons of customization options later on and a morality system. The interactions you have with the world and other players are extremely fun all around. Hell just beating your friends to a pulp and running away from wild wolves together is an experience I recommend to everyone. Oh and the Online's even got it's own brand new story mode. A bunch of really fun and varied missions, which can be all be fully played in co-op! But that's not even close to all there is to do. As you progress through Online, you'll gain the ability to unlock new roles. Such as Trader, Bounty Hunter, Collector or (new) Moonshiner. These roles not only grant access to new missions and ways of making money. But also unlock exclusive rewards, perks and items that can only be gained from advancing these roles.There are also many different NPCs scattered around the game world. You can talk to them and accept all manner of missions. Some of them are good, law abiding people. And some are outcasts and outlaws looking for accomplices. In addition to all of that, there are also different PvP game modes such as: racing, team battles, deathmatches and many others. You can also hunt and fish together, or murder and rob everyone. There's really no boring activity in this game. And unlike GTA5O it has no stupid flying rocket bikes who spawn camp you the moment you leave a shop.My favorite thing about RDO is how there's so much new content that's not available in single-player. New animations, models, activities and items. All the cool cutscenes where you can see yourself and your friends. There's even choices to be made at the end of some story quests. I was very pleasantly surprised by just how fun it is to play it."
286,CARTMAN_021p,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CARTMAN_021p/,59,2,1,209.4,August,"8,",679,0,1,"R* has made another masterpiece in this game. A true cult-classic piece and pure work of art by passionated & talented developers. Such a fantastic western adventure to be apart of, with a very big & detailed gameworld with many missions to complete with a well written story to remember, with characters to love and hate. There is a extreme amount of thoughtful & well design content to explore and stumble upon out there in the dangerous wild. The big map & world is a very enjoyable place to be in. Breath, live and work as you explore more and more of the gigantic world you find treassures hidden around the world. So much magic is there for you to see & carefully watch with your eyes making ever-lasting memories. With several different counties & areas connecting the world you find smaller dirty western towns, a big fancy & technological city, deep swamps crawling with aligators, big hot dry deserts, big beautiful green fields, deep forests & high steep mountins with snow & cold hard weather to endure. Many more things hidden makes this an extraordinary experience out of the normal and delivers a perfect playground for you to be apart of. Fantastic to ride around with your horse just watching people living & working and see how they behave in their own special way where sometime special things happen to the inhibitants which affects them differently. About the control of the protagonist (Arthur Morgan) i think it is very well implemented and riding horses feels nice and responsive. Weapon handling feels good but could be better i believe. I finished it @ PlayStation 4 in 2018 and this time i'm on my 1st (2nd total) playthrough @ Steam. There is so much content & stuff to do in this work. I only play single player mode so i have not tested the online component. The port feels ok. It demands a pretty good gaming rig to max out the graphics which is stunning. So much details in the visuals. It's hard to maintain 60 fps but it doesn't bother me much. This is a MUST own in every library on Steam. One of the best games ever made. No question..!/// Score: 10 of 10                    ----(MASTERPiECE)----"

Literally, all your actions have a consequence and you'll see it sooner or later! when you help someone and they find you in another city and buy you sth, when you see the execution of an outlaw  you captured before, the amount of dialogues between NPCs, the realistic reactions of people due to the weather, time of day and such things just makes you feel like living in that world.This review wasn't about the RDR online tho, I just don't wanna talk about it!"

Whether it's the music, characters, story, game play or graphics, it is hard to find any flaws which is why it's arguably called a ""masterpiece"". Single-player story is approximately 60-hours if you skip most of the side missions. I rushed my play-through as I wanted to see how it all ended and was left depressed for a week (worth it though).Most of the negative reviews are regarding technical issues - the Rockstar social club, the game not launching or graphic stutters - or about online multiplayer which is not Rockstar's forte or the reason to buy this game. Albeit ported from a console for PC, I encountered no crashes. A little tweaking will be needed based on the specs you are running - I ran it on GTX 1060 - and encountered only a bit of performance issues which were fixed after tweaking the settings.Online multiplayer is pretty much like GTA V, the players are there but most are either toxic, inactive or non-existent. It wouldn't be advised to purchase this hoping for a worthwhile multiplayer experience.Salient features Until Rockstar comes up with another GTA or a sequel RDR2, this one will be my favorite.

It feels like a cowboy simulator but made by real devs and not in some dudes basement in the middle of Moscow. You have to eat, drink, bath, shave your beard if you like from time to time. you have to build a bond with your horse and also take care of it. But nothing is overdone to the point where it can feel tedious or annoying. The shooting in this game feels so good! You click to shoot and have to click again to pull the hammer back to prep the next shot. Now if I was someone who never played this game and heard that I would think that would suck but you really have to try it to understand what I’m talking about. I don’t know how to explain it other then that it feels so good and satisfying!---{PC Requirements} ---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☐ Fast☑ Rich boiiiiii☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer- Not going to lie, this is a heavy game to run. I have a gtx 1070ti, intel i7-7700k, 16gb of ram and I can’t run it with everything on high-ultra. When I first got the game, I put everything to ultra-just to see how it would run and got 20 frames ☹. I then found a steam guide, which I believe is the current top-rated guide for the game that I used as a baseline (will link at bottom). With the exact same settings as guide I was able to get 60-70 frames, settings are like medium-high. Games already looked way better than it did from my ps4, plus having 60-70 frames just feels amazing (ps4 locked at 30 and would still dip under sometimes). I was able to change some settings after using guide as base, made some things ultra and raised other things and now get 60-65. Have only played for 3 hours with no drastic dips just yet 😉. ---{Story}---☐ Story?☐ Text or Audio floating around☐ Average☐ Good☐ Lovely☑ It‘ll replace your life-The main story itself is so much fun and interesting. It keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole way through! But you don’t only play this game for the main story (If you do, you’ll still get plenty of hours and it would be worth the $60, but you shouldn’t). The side mission are also so much fun! Each side mission seems to be unique and more fun than the previous! Not like other games where it seems like it’s just copy and paste of the same thing over and over (kill this, protect that, steal blank, follow blah) Each side mission feels like its own mini main story line, extremely well written and fun.  ---{Game Time} ---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyond-The main story itself is incredible with so much to do on the side. The world is full of side missions, encounters, challenges, animals to hunt, treasures to find, people to lasso, etc. etc. like I said earlier, I have over 200 hours on PlayStation, I completed the main story line and did a bunch (not all) side mission, and there is still a lot left to do!---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your moneySide notes- Some users are having problems with the Rockstar launcher. I have not had a single problem. I installed the game opened it, the Rockstar launcher opened up for a second and closed and game launched. I didn’t even have to log in to my Rockstar account.Link to graphic setting guide i used- Make sure you can RUN THE GAME before buying, as I said earlier this game is a heavy one.If you never played this game when it came out, you definitely should buy this and give it a try, I will be worth it! if it’s just not your thing refund before 2 hours XD, but I honestly think that wont happen. Rate~ 10/10 will pay 60 again. EDIT~~ I have not played online on pc or Playstation, So I really don't know what the difference is between single and online.

301,Skipper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceskipper1/,86,1,1,345.4,August,"22,",161,0,1,"Put simply, Red Dead Redemption 2 might well be *the* greatest game I have ever played. For a tl;dr, I recommend skipping to the end of this review.I very rarely purchase full-priced games. I tend to wait until games are on sale, and even then I hesitate if the game is £20 or more. Whilst at home for Christmas, I saw that RDR2 had been released on PC. I hadn't played the console version but had heard that the game was good, so decided to take a risk and purchased the game full priced. I don't regret it.To give some context, I don't usually like buying AAA single-player games with a heavy story-driven narrative. I like to play strategy games, I like to play sandbox or loose multiplayer games (like Mount & Blade) and I like to play open world games without being forced to complete the main quest. I have many hours on Skyrim over the years, for instance, but only very recently completed the main quest for the first time - I spent most of my time on that game just messing around in the open world. I didn't enjoy The Witcher 3 (quite a controversial opinion I know) because even that game failed to make me feel anything other than boredom during the story.And so, with this in mind, you might think that I rate RDR2 highly due to it's accessible open-world... but that's not the case. I rate this game so highly because it actually made me fall in-love with it's story.Now, don't get me wrong, the other aspects of the game are wonderful. The graphics are mind-blowing. The open world has been crafted to a near perfect level - it feels alive and natural, extremely large and yet diverse. Everything from the macro to the micro level has been considered and these facts alone should make the game near perfect. Those who have read my Assassin's Creed Odyssey review will note that I rate that game highly due to simply the quality of the open-world. Furthermore, the gameplay mechanics - the movement, weight, the feeling you get firing weapons or riding a horse - it's all top notch (this being an area where The Witcher failed).But the story, oh my, the story.I don't think I've ever been so captivated.I'll estimate and say it took me about 100 hours to complete the main story, give-or-take, so it's not short. However, this isn't a problem at all. Every single character is given perfect weight, the pacing is superb, the ending is simultaneously heart-breaking and wonderful, the voice acting is excellent. I don't really know how much more I can describe without spoiling anything (and this is NOT a game you want spoiled), but trust me, it is worth the time dedicated.*The simple fact is, Rockstar have raised the standard for video-game story telling.*Every game that comes before RDR2 now feels outdated and hollow. Every game to come after will have to reach the bar. This is a new generation of gaming and RDR2 is the landmark game.- The graphics are excellent.- The open-world is expertly crafted.- The mechanics are great.- The narrative is absolutely unbelievable.But, what are the negatives, if any?Well, I think the biggest negative - and it's a shame because it really does put a stain on an otherwise perfect game - would be the online gameplay.As I'm sure many of you know, one of the biggest appeals (and biggest moneymaking successes) of Grand Theft Auto 5 was GTA Online. Rockstar have attempted to do something similar in RDR2, calling it 'Red Dead Online'. Unfortunately, it is pretty clear that entire function of the game is purely made for microtransactions and to net Rockstar extra profits.The economy in Red Dead Online is (purposely) broken - it takes an unrealistically long amount of time to grind for money (obviously in an attempt to encourage microtransactions). On top of this, it's pretty boring. I could elaborate, but there are many, many videos on YouTube that explain the problems with Red Dead Online in more detail.So, unfortunately, the multiplayer does ruin RDR2 a bit. However, given that Red Dead Online is separated from the single-player aspect of the game, it isn't too damaging.Ultimately, whilst I may spend longer playing Mount & Blade: Warband or other such games (with high replayability), Red Dead Redemption 2 may well be the best made game I've ever played, and the story is a true benchmark for games to come.Final verdict: 9.5/10. I highly recommend. It isn't 10/10 because of the multiplayer 'scam' by Rockstar (don't buy if you want to play online and don't care about singleplayer)."

That does not include Red Dead Online. At all. So from a value perspective, it's a pretty good deal.You've probably heard people gush over this game more often than not — This game commits one of the cardinal sins of game development in my eyes—Placing the beginning of the game in an environment that is abnormally slow paced and not representative of the main game or gameplay loop. I say abnormally slow paced as the game is slow paced to begin with, but traversing the snow is even worse. Almost languid. The first 8-12 hours of the game is essentially a TellTale game that acts as a sort of tutorial that ultimately did not teach me much as to how the game actually operated. The events were far too scripted to have any sense of how they'd behave elsewhere. I almost stopped playing multiple times during this period. This is a large reason why I feel first impressions need to not be counted into the overall score. I don't know how they'd do it, really. Maybe a check box the user can click and just go on the honor system, on top of the systems already in place.The game is extremely character driven. And I feel as though many of the choices you make are superficial and have no real impact.  How you play and the small, minor details are what, I feel, dictate the most change. It's a much more subtle change—in the end. But the minute-to-minute details of Arthur's character are what change. Early on, when money was much harder to come by and I would go out on hunting trips without any mission prompts. Just hunting and taming horses for money. Selling pelts to the butcher and selling horses to the stable. The Butcher in Valentine remembered me 60 hours in when I went back exploring briefly. He even started  me about going to see other butchers. That NPC is my favorite NPC. The main campaign simply goes on for too long. It's not a terribly unique story. And I found it rather difficult to get through at times. The whole premise is that you, Arthur, and the Van der linde gang are on the run from deeds done in Blackwater, something you don't actually participate in, in the game. There's money you had to leave there and now you need to stay low and away from the law — [Insert Title Card] — But here's my problem: This is Arthur's story. And you're just along for the ride, more or less. , I haven't launched a game since Skyrim or Witcher 3 to simply roam around and see what happens. I feel the game really shines when you're just hunting and running into strangers and going down seemingly random quest lines. The main story is good, don't get me wrong.  The way the cities feel clustered, making your horse more of a nuisance to ride due to the amount of people that get in your way as you try to make your way through, juxtaposed to the open air of the wild and how the sound changes of your horse digging into the mud from the pavement. I started to feel similarly to Arthur not caring much for the “new world”. From RPG and survival elements seemingly spilling over into every other genre, it's no real surprise to see them here. Pet/horse bonding, eating and sleeping to recover your “cores” making your meters refill faster.  that would fortify the meters from being depleted for a brief period. Not to mention your horse being needed to carry more inventory.You're able to fast travel in the game. Though, not before significantly upgrading the camp. You're able to fast travel from campsites made out in the wild as well, provided you have a horse. However, the game actively discourages this as riding your horse will increase its bond and therefore its stamina and health. As well as its value on the market. You'd also miss out on stranger missions and “honor opportunities” as I called them. Random events that made the world feel more alive. Though, clearly very scripted for you to see. Often leading to rewards down the line.Red Harlow theory in the comments: Text limit."

Unfortunately Rockstar has pretty much left Red Dead Online for Dead. Although the Online can be fun and enjoyable with friends it has barebones content compared to its counterpart Grand Theft Auto Online. Both games are plagued by cheaters on their online mode due to Rockstar not adding an anti-cheat of any kind though so if you do play online be careful.

Waited a few minutes, no email, hit the send email again button, no email - did this a few times - no email.  Gave up went to bed with the launcher running.Get up 8 hours later - no email and now when I try it says you have tried too many times in 24 hours.I know they haven't even tried to send me the email because the email address they said they sent it to is a private server and I can see all the logs - rock star games doesn't even show up in any log.  How they got this private server email automatically I do not know - but its not my steam account email.So I send the following to Steam SupportMessage from you on Aug 12 @ 6:46am I less than a minute ago*It requires you to sign up for their social club, and wants to verify your email before you can play. It does this automatically when you hit play from steam library and somehow already knows your email address.I waited 8 hours for the verification email and they never even tried to send one -1 know because I can see the logs of the email server were never even touched by rock star games - at least they said they were sending to my private server.So while I would love to play it. I'm not too hot on joining some club I want nothing to do with and still further turned off by having to verify my email - yet they won’t send me the verify email after several attempts and 8 hours of waitingIf it just linked to my steam account like most other games do it, that would be fine - but this extra and broken process they have is unacceptable - especially when it means you can't even play the game in single player mode on my local PC.Steam recorded me as 8 hours playing - no its 8 hours waiting to play.

Now I can't even respond to the ticket to discuss it with them.  So this is how I'll respond - via a review."
315,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,80,1,1,139.6,March,"15,","1,973",7,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2. A game Developed and Published by Rockstar Games.From an early age, sitting couch side watching classic westerns with my family i have been fascinated with the wild west. With the outlaw lifestyle and everything entailed. Travelling a vast nation on horseback, with nothing to call your own but a revolver and your determination. There have been few games that capture this...GUN back on Playstation 2 did an amazing job, Red Dead Redemption 1 was a great step forward and now Red Dead Redemption 2, nearly perfectly capturing the feeling. And what a journey it is to experience.Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel to the first game, you play as Arthur Morgan, an outlaw just barely surviving being hunted by the authorities. You make it free of their grasp for the moment and you begin to unravel the person that Arthur is, or more precisely you get to control the type of person Arthur is. The history of the gang is hidden behind secrecy as is the history of Arthur and how he came to be involved in the Van Der Linde gang (Dutch Van Der Linde is the leader of the gang and players of Red Dead Redemption 1 will remember this name). You begin to traipse your way across the country side, living the life of a rugged outlaw and watching as the story unfolds before your eyes. It is a well written tale but falters in the later chapters as the same cliche dialogue is seemingly reused over and over to drag the story forward. The story as a whole though encompassing both main story and the stranger events is extremely captivating and should be experienced as a full entity instead of just as a portion. Red Dead Redemption does a lot of things really well, one of these things is the gun play. There has been considerable dedication and effort afforded to making sure this feels realistic and gritty, which are both important in my opinion in this era of game. The guns weren't sophisticated but were elegant in their own way and thus demanded a level of respect. Which RDR2 captures seemingly perfect. Keyboard and mouse does aiming justice, as Controller makes click targeting seem tacky and ""cheaty"". Dead Eye significantly amplifies the overall gun experience though, Helping you dominate large groups of enemies extremely quickly should the need arise. RDR2 offers a truly unique experience, in not only its large open world but also in how you traverse and interact with it. This is exceptionally true of its equipment, with a large range of weapons and utility items to assist you in nearly any and all situations that might arise. From hand guns and rifles to the lasso and lantern. Probably one of my favourite parts of the game, Horse riding. It felt so originally and real. That it almost alone made me rate this game 10/10. I loved it. It brought so much authenticity to the game and made me really care about the animal i'm riding around, Feeding it and brushing it constantly to make sure it stayed healthy. You become committed to its health because it defined how good you managed to traverse the world. I'm not sure if this is even the right word for it because there aren't really segregated ""biomes"" in the world, its just a naturally transformation of regions, from snow capped mountains and green open pastures, to dank and misty swamps. But the game has a vast quantity of locations to visit, and does an amazing job capturing the essence of each of them so you almost get completely captivated in it. With a huge open world, there is one thing you need almost above anything. A map. And a good map to compliment the whole experience. Red Dead Redemption 2 does just this, it offers a rustic looking map that helps denote almost everything you need, and updating you whenever something new becomes available. Extremely helpful but also completely immersive and assistant in making you feel like Arthur is using the map instead of you. Red Dead Redemption 2 has a huge amount of content to experience, the chances of you experiencing EVERYTHING the game has to offer in 1 play through is almost 0%. One thing you can complete to fruition is the collecting, even though there are still a monstrous amount of collecting to do, From hunting and fishing trophies, to dinosaur bones and stone carvings. This game will have you exploring every nook and cranny of this world to uncover its secrets. A returning gameplay mechanic from the original game, that helps guide your decisions in some small way is the Honour system. Doing good things gives you an honour boost, Doing bad things cuts it down. You gain certain things by being either and miss out on things the same way. I found this mechanic to be extremely crucial to my decision making, as i didn't want Arthur to be a villain, more of a vigilante. The movement...where do i begin. With Keyboard and Mouse the game was unbearable in terms of movement and traversing the world. It was sluggish and slow and felt like Arthur was always confused as to where he was. With a controller, the movement felt more controlled and manageable even though at times still extremely janky.: Although the writing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is exceptional on a larger stage. A lot of its internal dialogue feels confusing and contradictory to immersion. Arthur wouldn't adapt his dialogue to people, he would out of nowhere scream at passersby or vice versa passersby will scream at you seemingly for no reason. Its not a huge loss but still was immersion breaking. I have nothing bad to say here at all. This game is a visual masterpiece. So beautifully designed that i can barely put to words what experiencing it was like. Easily and without a doubt one of the best graphical experiences anyone can have in a game. From watching the rain pour down and experiencing every droplet fall from the brim of your hat, to seeing your footprints persist for kilometres as you ride through the snow or mud is such an exception touch of detail that it becomes almost breathtaking. I couldn't run this game at its max settings without my computer turning into an inferno however (Specs on my profile). But i think this should be considered a compliment as i played it below its maximum and was still dumbfounded at times looking at the wilderness or overlooking the ocean.Another portion of this game experience that completely revolutionised it in totality. The audio. The music and sound effects in the game have been so masterfully crafted that you become completely entranced in it. If you close your eyes in the middle of a scenic wood, the sound of the birds and rustling trees as the wind brushes past them is beyond contemplation. It's almost meditative in its development. The way the world is just alive around you is what makes this game phenomenal.Not many games are given this by me. This game is exceptional, a few short paces from a masterpiece. In fact if i had started and stayed on controller from the very beginning this probably would have rated ""Perfect"". This game is everything a game should be, Beautifully designed world, Exceptional audio and soundtrack that captivates the senses, A story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and game play that astoundingly supports it all to a crescendo that is almost beyond words entirely. You'd be mad to pass on this game as its not just that. Its far more than just a game its a journey and an experience. And one you have to live at least once."

As an open world adventure game, it's good but flawed. The graphics and voice acting are impeccable, but the plot has pacing issues. The open world lets you explore and do whatever you want much of the time, but the choices you can make are severely limited in the moment-to-moment gameplay during missions (a Rockstar staple, sadly). The shooting is simple and not particularly great. There are survival and light RPG mechanics, but they're superficial and not particularly necessary. None of that matters - why not? This is a game about mourning, and a great one precisely as that. Let me repeat that: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a simulation of mourning.You're role-playing as an outlaw cowboy in an America that doesn't tolerate them anymore, and everything from the open world design to the soundtrack and characters will make you confront a sense of grief for those better days now gone (much like all of us now living in a post-pandemic world). The long open stretches of desolation where you'll ride your horse only to see nothing but nature or burned-down abandoned towns make you reflect on what the characters have lost. The minimalist soundtrack too invites reflection and adds a pervasive sense of melancholy. The characters constantly embarking on heists in an attempt to reclaim glory adds a tragic sense of fatalism to the plot, and without any spoilers you already know this is not a game that comes with trite happy endings. It's a slow, somber tale; a long, protracted goodbye; a way of making the player come to terms with what's lost and irrecuperable.As an open-world cowboy adventure game, it's a 7.5/10 for how beautiful but basic it can be. As an existential tale that confronts and makes the player internalize a sense of grief, it's a masterpiece."

Its choice, more art than a game. 10/10.Publisher sucks immeasurably though. -10/10"

You CANNOT play the story mode offline. That's right, a game this amazing that costs upwards of 40$ to 60$ dollars of your hard earned money, CANNOT be played without an internet connection. Rockstar...Why do you do this?! Haven't you learned this lesson already from other franchises. GIVE US THE OPTION TO PLAY THE STORY MODE OFFLINE. That is all  that i am asking of you. Otherwise this game is pretty much perfect. And it will stand the test of time. But ONLY if you give us the ability to play the story mode without an internet connection. Rockstar, get to it!"
327,Gorre,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorre/,79,2,1,211.8,June,"28,",609,4,1,"One of the most promising wild west open world games heavily promoted as such by Rockstar Games it did indeed deliver as a whole. You'll find yourself in a slant when you first view the looming life through Arthur Morgan - one rough gunslinger patching the outlaw squad you wake up along, as your first player experience. I absolutely loved the slow pace of your outset as the protagonist getting to know each and every lost soul in your gang, possibly even get attached to some through their first lines of dialogue. The characters are likeable and structured in a way for each to have their own charisma, lower or higher, they'll always convey something meaningful in the lessons, stories and actions they're going to be sharing throughout journey. Atmosphere has been nailed with near perfection in my opinion, random activities in your camp from quarrels between egos to melancholic depressing or joyful mexican songs; every town, house and room you will stumble upon will have its own mood inducer. I'm not joking when I say that the wild life is the best I've seen: you can easily get lost within the forests, huge open fields chasing from smallest mice to menacing bears. And by the way, I'm talking enjoyment wise, not realism even though it probably imitates life-like enough. Being able to interact  with every NPC you're coming across is one of the points which makes this title shine like a bright supernova in the dumpster of nowadays' gaming market, you can greet or absolutely antagonize the hell out of them so they'll snap or run away tail tucked between legs. Horse behavior boosts the immersion a lot when traveling the lands, take care of your companion and it will take care of you in need. Be hesitant with your decisions of murdering innocent folk, unruly impulsive deeds as it affects the karma system implemented and clearly shown each time you take a positive or negative action. Without exception every act you conclude will rebound in the most unexpected moments, karma always delivers.Graphics - holy moly you can't avert your gaze from the screen once you're in, there's too much eye candy for one to handle. Heavy cowboy boots leaving prints in the deep snow, horses trotting setting ablaze dirt particles as you rush through the lands. The attention to detail will leave even the most pretentious player completely satisfied, trees dropping the snow off its leaves, mud sticking to your clothes and skin like glue after a drunken brawl and so on. This is one of those games that feel like they're filled with a ton of gfx mods yet it's all vanilla, landscapes are beautifully crafted to make you put down the controls, sit and watch simultaneously with Arthur the astonishing views. Gameplay is well polished to fit any kind of player who wants a challenge or simply plays for the story, there's enough mechanics to have fun and mess around with entire outlaw gangs while you haven't been scratched once if skilled enough. There's plenty of guns to have your desired arsenal ready at will, golden plated shotgun for stylish brain splattering. Customization feels very authentic to fit the wild west theme, there's too many clothes to try at once, it'll draw you back until you fully complete your wardrobe. I personally spent hours shaping my outfits, which I'm very proud how they turned out, I'll post my favorite creation at the end of the review. Prepare yourself for emotional moments during roughest departures that happen within or outside the gang, music quality and diversity is a huge positive as well as nature sounds, you know like real nature would. The story surpasses anything related to wild west I've seen in a movie or played in a game, every character has the same attention given equally developing all of them, nothing will feel second hand material. Don't be in a hurry to rush story missions, there's enough side content to keep you busy for long sessions; hunting for secret treasures with only clues being some poorly drawn maps, helping fellers along the roadside, doing most insane challenges which drain your mental health fortitude and maybe the craziest goal of all tracking every single objective in your compendium. For me it's been an incredible journey clocked 200+ hours of highs and lows, all worthy of the time spent.[]- graphics & artwork keep you staring forever- character design & interactions - attention to detail on extreme levels- OST & voice acting- very rich adventure & open world- varied customization all around[]- online is not worth touching"
328,Jon Umber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jon-umber/,118,13,1,116.3,April,"21,",408,8,1,"I'll start off by saying that, although I do consider this game worth playing, and though it has had clear effort and care put into its development, it is certainly no masterpiece, and I fought regular frustration with it. I was surprised to see so many gaming publications and fans alike score it a perfect 10 because, in my opinion, it is severely flawed. It's a good open world game with stunning detail, it tells one of the best, most emotionally devastating and bittersweet stories in gaming history with great characters, but outside of that, I actually found it frustrating and shallow.The open world is incredible and full of remarkable depth. From random events to NPC encounters, a staggering amount of detail has been injected into this world by the developers who really did a fantastic job. There's a stunning amount of handcrafted detail to stumble over that will more than satisfy most fans of open world games, so if that's your thing, go ahead and buy Red Dead Redemption 2 without regret.I've seen plenty of praise for the graphics, which I think this is mostly due to the fantastic lighting engine. Volumetric lighting and how it reacts with fog and geometry looks incredible, god rays are marvelous, and the glow that permeates the setting from light sources serves to do a lot of heavy graphical lifting here. It's really something to behold, and combined with the fantastic soundtrack it serves to add a lot of atmospheric heft to the experience. This feeds into the high quality and immersive nature of the open world, one of this game's strengths.I enjoyed how the game gave me hidden side quests to find in the form of Stranger encounters littered through the world. Many of these grow to add detail to the setting and its people and have lots of writing depth to them, despite being little more than random encounters triggered by the player entering a certain area. Despite the strong open world, this experience is at its best during its thrilling, affecting main story missions and when you're getting to know the very well-written side characters in the Van Der Linde Gang via taking on camp side quests, usually in the form of coach robbery, hunting, or fishing with them. However many of the main story missions—although they're often very compelling narratively—are so on-rails that deviating from the set mission path will often lead you to a fail state outright and push you back to a checkpoint, and the checkpointing system is often poor. For one stealthy mission in Chapter 4 I was forced repeatedly to view the same full minute-long wagon ride into the camp over and over, as the game failed me for trying to sneak into a roof window. I later realized the game fails you if you go off the 1st floor, and you're expected to sneak through the ground level. This kind of railroading stifles player agency regularly and pulls you right out of the experience.Despite these flaws, single player is a strong narrative with good characters, twists and turns that mostly feel earned and are emotionally impactful, well-written dialogue, and fantastic voice acting and performance capture. Dan Houser and the writing team at Rockstar are at the peak of their abilities. This is a well-told story which makes important points about American exceptionalism, frontier expansion, human civilization, and morality. It's all helped along by the fantastic performance of the cast, particularly the player character's actor, Roger Clark. A fair amount of the side content is also quite compelling, but a lot of it does unfortunately fall into typical open world game territory, which leaves you feeling like you're doing tedious busywork for NPCs whom you just met and don't care about. Although I admittedly loved some side quests, I began skipping side content later in the game after one too many ""collect 5 bounty posters"" type missions, which was very disappointing.The slow, laggy way that both the player character and horses control is awful, unfortunately. There were several extremely frustrating moments during combat in which my character would become stuck either on a piece of in-game geometry, or running in a loop, which led to some frustrating deaths. Additionally, inventory management is an unintuitive chore, and you're never quite sure which weapon Arthur considers his default, as you're constantly drowning in dozens of them since the game doesn't allow to equip a main, nor sell those you aren't using. There's something very wrong about a game in which you're a wild west gunslinger, yet half the time you attempting to draw your pistol quickly (by holding right mouse button, then clicking left mouse button), the game fails to respond at all and you stand there like an idiot as you get shot to death. These clunky bugaboos ensured I never felt fully in control of the player character, and some of the game's fantastic immersive quality was lost as a result. I regularly felt frustrated from moment-to-moment while playing this game.Despite the compelling main quests and companion quests, this game also features some of the typical open world bloat that I've come to despise in games of this sort. I never want to hunt animals for crafting components, for example. Not out of any sort of animal-rights motivation, but because it's never been compelling for me to go out into the woods and spend hours trying to find the right damn animal to obtain materials from. I've also long despised hunting for treasure using only hand-drawn maps—another sin this game commits. I had a particularly poor experience finally finding a treasure location, only to open the hidden compartment and receive another map to decipher: What a kick in the groin it was spending 15 minutes trying to scale Caliban's Seat to complete the first treasure map I purchased, battling bad platform jumping and awkward walk/run controls and falling a couple of times only to finally find it and realize it was ANOTHER TREASURE MAP. This is the kind of boring, time-wasting side content I can't stand, and I was disappointed to see it in yet another open world game which is an otherwise fantastic experience.Additionally, the camp upgrade options are little more than window dressing. Beyond gaining fast travel capabilities and gaining new satchels, there's almost nothing of value to be gained by upgrading your camp, which is a huge missed opportunity. Because the characters are so compelling, the acting is so great, and the dialogue is so carefully crafted, I found myself wishing for an opportunity to impact the lives of the gang around me by putting some of my hard-earned wealth into the camp. It's prohibitively expensive to do so, and you gain little in-game reward for it other than certain cosmetic flourishes. If I could do it again I'd have instead poured that money into my own clothing and horses. It's simply not worth it, and before long I began ignoring the feature entirely.There are also several sorts of minigames available, such as poker or five finger fillet, but most of these—although they received obvious care in development in the form of unique animations and lines for the NPCs against whom you play—ended up feeling obviously rigged to me. The worst of this is during the poker game in Saint Denis, which one player always just stomps and led me to think he was cheating in-game. But no further explanation is available, so it instead feels just like he was programmed to take all of your money by winning lucky hands constantly. I gave up on most of the minigames after experiencing this.This game lives or dies on its being a great story and a deep, atmospheric world. If you love immersive, engulfing video game worlds or want an amazing story, you're going to love it. If you want great shooting or compelling gameplay in general, you're likely to end up frustrated.Feel free to follow  if you like this review."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. the hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, also 4 years old. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you, Red Dead Redemption 2.And thank you, for allowing me to post this cringy ass copypasta."
336,Yaerveth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yaerveth/,58,,1,287.9,March,10,"1,332",2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is possibly the best AAA game I've ever played in my life. Rockstar Games have managed to create the perfect open world experience from almost every aspect. From gameplay to storytelling, it delivers the best experience I have personally witnessed in a triple-A title. Before starting my review properly, I'd like to warn everyone that this review is going to be for those who have played the first Red Dead Redemption; thus, it will contain lots of spoilers including a major twist that could be considered as a huge spoiler for those who never played the first game!  I'd like to start my review by praising the perfect writing of Dan Houser and other writers involved in crafting this wonderful story. Arthur Morgan could easily be the best video game protagonist out there due to his character development. He is the right hand of Dutch van der Linde, a name that you're familiar with from the first title. It's been made clear by John Marston and Strange Man that Dutch was not always the way he was, not until the Blackwater Massacre anyway and the game starts off with Van der Linde gang making their escape from Blackwater to cold mountains of Colter due to a ferry heist gone wrong. If you'd paid attention to newspapers in the first game, they clearly state that Blackwater ferry job was pretty much a massacre but further details were not known except for lots of dead bodies, a girl Dutch killed in cold blood, and Landon Ricketts' involvement in it. While these details are not mentioned a lot, whole story is based on this event and how Van der Linde gang has been affected by it, especially Dutch since it marks the turning point for his character development that will evolve him to man you're familiar with from the first game: an opportunistic narcissist who uses anarchist and partially socialist principals to cultivate a loyal base. And yes, despite having ""2"" in its title, it's actually a prequel, not a sequel. Throughout the duration of the game you will witness John Marston's doubts about Dutch while no one even dares to say a word against him, Arthur Morgan's evolution from a dishonorable and an extremely loyal outlaw to a man with moral principles, and Dutch van der Linde's evolution into a delusional madman. The whole story is beautifully crafted by meaningful metaphors of Arthur's character, shocking turning points, and a perfect storytelling. When it comes to gameplay, it delves deep into realism with RPG elements and stat cores that you need to keep up by eating and sleeping otherwise your health, stamina, and dead eye meters replenish slowly. Previous statement is also valid when it comes to your horse's stats so, you need to keep it fed and clean otherwise you won't get the most out of it. While I understand that these aspects of the game can be considered as a chore and unenjoyable by many players, I personally didn't have any problems with them since they work as intended and I'm someone who prefers arcade over realism. On the other hand, shooting mechanics are quite good and they feel good. Despite having wide-open areas as you would expect from a Frontier Western game, there is no shortage of covers and should you need to get yourself out of a tough situation, chug a bottle of snake oil and use dead eye to your advantage. Believe me, you'll be using dead eye a lot for various reasons, one of them being the AI is quite advanced and they're sometimes very hard to deal with with their unbelievably good accuracy. Leaving combat behind, the map of Red Dead Redemption 2 is nearly four times bigger than the first game's map and the amount of detail in every corner of it is insane! When I said that it delves deep into realism, it wasn't a strict statement that only covers game mechanics, it was meant for the whole game. I won't go into detail, though. Instead I'll give you two examples and you figure out the rest: You'll often hear horses and people fart and you'll witness that the horses' balls shrink when they're in a cold area. It's finally time for my personal complaints about the game. There isn't much but I'll write them down regardless. I've realized my first issue when I decided to go for 100% in-game completion rate and I felt exhausted while going after the every single collectible because there was literally no end to them! Just when I thought I've been through the worst of it, I've faced the very thing that made me almost pull my hair out: Gambler Challenges. Why couldn't they come up with actual challenges rather than RNG based ones? Why did they have to add so many collectibles? I'm fine with bounty hunting, stranger missions and other stuff but collectibles and gambler challenges made the game feel like a chore for a few weeks for me. I don't even want to start with Red Dead Online. My sole purpose of playing it was for the achievements. It's bad. Very bad. Like GTA Online bad. Even worse. Speaking of stranger missions, I feel like I should point out that some of them are missable and they tie into the main plot quite well. So I'd suggest doing all of them without exceptions.Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the best game I've ever played in my life. It's nearly perfect in every aspect. However, its strongest point would be its carefully crafted plot that consists full of complex characters placed upon the foundations of the famous Blackwater Massacre. If you're expecting a Spaghetti Western, I hate to break it to you but you'll be severely disappointed. Unlike the first title, it's a Frontier Western that delves deep into realism in both gameplay and story. It's basically a triple-A game that should be experienced by every human being who's into video games."

339,SHEWOLF,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198318084284/,79,6,1,"1,098.1",June,"12,",124,0,1,"Let me see.    I am pretty sure everyone knows Rockstar studio. GTA and all that macho stuff around it. We know what they are capable of when creating a game. So when Red Dead Redemption 2 came out for consoles I was stunned. I honestly never thought I´d want game more than that. I am a PC gamer, (honestly I suck at playing on consoles) but I wanted this game so much I even thought of getting one. So I bet you can say how excited I was when RDR2 was announced for PC. And all the waiting was worthy. I am aware that so much has been said about RDR2 that I can't possibly add anything new, but I just wanted to share my experience with this beautiful game.   The story is a prequel to the 2010 game (Red Dead Redemption). When you start as , outlaw, underdog, you start a story you wish you'd never finish. In front of you, there is capitalism, the end of the wild west as we know, indigenous Americans are pushed away, just so another rich man can have his way. And there´s Arthur and his family. Van der Linde gang. Or just Dutch's Boys going by the mantra:  The very firsts steps in the game make you feel like this (Arthur) is just another lost man. Man who can not be changed. Who is rough, harsh, brute, relentless, yet you can't just give up on him and you see him go through massive change.     I think if you rush really fast through the game, you can finish the story in about 60 hours, but considering how huge and alive this whole world feels, it's a terrible way to play this game. It deserves so much more. Go into that far west corner of the map, and enjoy what's awaiting. It can be an easter egg (there are sooo many of them) abandoned house, or simply nothing but breathtaking nature. Sometimes I found myself in the middle of nowhere on my horse, galloping towards the sunset. And you know what?    The story itself isn't anything ""oscar worthy"". But I dare to say that  For the people who love completing games all the way to 100% - this is the game for you. All those animals you have to ""study"", challenges, plants, medicine based on crafting, collectables. Tracking a scent to find your prey. Cooking your meal and giving it a bit of a touch of herbs and improving its quality.    Many times, you find yourself jumping into unexpected adventures by random strangers. Some have multiple chapters, some ends really quickly. If anything it only breathes more life into the world of Red Dead Redemption 2. As you go by, trying to get enough money for your gang  you really find yourself loving so many characters and you never know who you stumble upon.    On my way to sell my pelts I was almost robbed, while defending myself the train robbery was in progress nearby and when I finally thought I could breath and get drunk ( to finish my compendium of course ehm ... >.> ), the fight over a poker game started. On my way to the east part of the map I was drugged and robbed and bit further people kept warning me about creepy Night Folks killing innocents and begging for help. (and boy did I find them.. RIP my first horse Pototo :< )   Crafting system is super easy and mid game special recipes keep the fighting fun. The tiny details make it more fascinating. After you kill an enemy, or even animal, skin it, you can see their body decomposing over time. The horses will sweat after you gallop for too long. Certain parts of the map are deforested over time and you can see the progress. And once it's done, workers move to different locations. You see houses being built in front of your eyes. ( Now I can't just stop thinking about the unfinished buildings in GTA V lol ). And nothing makes it more real than your horse taking a massive.. and I mean massive dump while you're talking to a stranger and getting new mission.    I am on my third play through. Part on epic, part here on steam. And I keep discovering new things I missed before. I laugh with Arthur and I cry      Now that was the story tho. Same as GTA V we were given an online world full of fun and endless possibilities.  well yes but.. no.  You manage to create such a unique masterpiece like RDR 2 and then you dump Red Dead online to be a side milking cow for your favourite kid GTA V. What a shame. The bugs, the endless loading screens, CHEATERS, lack of content for veteran players. The Outlaw Pass 3 is nowhere to be seen and absolutely no communication with players as well. While GTA V has many new cars, events, here - take a million bucks just for logging in. And the RDRO community? Ah, here's a 20% sale for stuff most of you already own. Peace out.   Horses! I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love horses in this game. The difference in breeds, their stamina, health, coats. Turkoman  - always my favourite one in story and Missouri Fox Trotter in RDRonline for his speed. If they ever plan on adding more horses I'd be so happy, or even possibly own more than 5. To have a ranch maybe - would seem as fine new business since we got a moonshine business as well. The animation of horses and their behaviour is spectacular. Do you fight a lot and prefer horses that won't buck you off when the first bullet flies by? Go for Turkoman or Andalusian.

It's no surprise that Rockstar went into the development of this game 8-9 years prior to its release.Exploration: Unlike most open world games where NPCs are just walking as a fill-in, almost every NPC in this game is given a small story or a task. This takes immersion to next level. The random encounters, mysteries and Easter Eggs are heart and soul of this game. You'd often find yourself exploring the world, chatting with random people, robbing homesteads, interacting with mysterious entities and in the process, forgetting for a short while the amazing Main Story this game offers. Gameplay :Top notch. Plenty of weapons to chose from. Very satisfying combat and realistic sounds adds to the feel of the combat.Graphics : One of the best you'd ever see in a video game. Detailing has been done on every major and minor level.Story :All the aspects above contribute in making the Story of the game an unforgettable one. Arthur Morgan, the protagonist is member of a Gang which is on the run and in search of money, peace. Arthur is accompanied by people who are some amazing characters of this game each having their own intentions aside from the intentions of the Gang as a whole.A worthy competitor of God of War (2018) GOTY for sure."

The whole game does not feel mechanic, but organic and you can completely lose yourself in just riding a horse and admiring the environment around you. It will also make you feel emotions. Just like when I found dying wolf that I've injured a while ago after he attacked me and had to put him down. Felt incredibly sad about it. About digital wolf made out of polygons.This game is a work of art. Enough said."

350,Shin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/44shin44/,46,3,1,103.5,November,"26,",468,5,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western themed open world singleplayer+multiplayer action game. This game is one of the best singleplayer games I've ever played, however I didn't like the multiplayer version that much. Here is my pro-con list about the game:Pros:-Exceptional story-Outstanding visuals-Great soundtrack-The best character development I've ever seen in a game/film/TV show-Riding a horse is satisfying-Great physics-Interactions with the NPCs are highly effective in the game-Towns and cities are greatly decorated-Choices really matter, both affects the game and the player-Board games are fun-Plot twists <3-You can talk with your horse-Atmosphere is perfect-Weapons and customization-Optimization is great-Game is well executed-Play time is long enough-You're alright my boahCons-There is no vocalization in multiplayer-Game is a bit slowly paced at the beginning, so it might lose players who aren't patient enough-You cannot go back to the older save file after you die, it randomizes the place, and you cannot get your old horse if your horse is dead. This can be counted as a good realistic feature, but I lost legendary bear fur, so I didn't like it.Overall: This game is a greatly executed game with a perfect story, physics, sound, visuals, atmosphere, gameplay, and choices. I would give 9.8/10 for single player and 5.4/10 for multiplayer"

353,aviggo77,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aviggo77/,228,23,1,87.0,December,"28,","1,853",0,1,"Firstly, yes, the game requires a demanding PC. But the amount of graphical details justify the requirements. The optimization isn't poor, just that the current generation hardwares can't bring out its full potential.The highlight of RDR2 is its realistic aspect. The immense level of detail, coupled with a near perfect physics system makes this game a truly immersive experience. For added immersion, the entire game can be beaten with HUD disabled. The sun, street signs and land marks can be utilized to reach destinations.Overwhelming use of realistic elements in a game turns it into a tedious experience. In RDR2, there are some mechanics like: gun wear, feeding and cleaning your horse, maintaining your health, stamina and deadeye core with food and drinks etc. Unless sprint and deadeye is overused, or too much damage is taken, these mechanics don't get in the way of the gameplay.Once, after serving time, I was released from jail and the sheriff told me to scram. In other games, it would only be a mere threat. But in RDR2, I received another bounty and was apprehended AGAIN for not listening to him. This much attention to detail is rare in the medium of video games.One of the few annoying aspects of this game is the horse. Many a times early in the game, I strayed too far from the horse just to realize that the horse was no Roach that will magically appear in front of me from the other side of the map. So, making the horse follow you everywhere is a must. And, the horse can actually die if it falls from even a moderate height. Losing your horse in the middle of nowhere leaves you to a painful trek to the nearest town. Still, this is but merely a punishment for making a stupid mistake.However, there is still a limit to how realistic a open world game can be. In RDR2, there are medicines that heal you back to full health in mere seconds and save dying persons or horses; An ability that slows down time, and so on that makes me realize ""Ahh.. this is a game afterall"". But this much is necessary to not make the game too boring.The combat in RDR2 is pretty good, but not fantastic. Headshot is lethal for both enemies and the player (unless the health core is full). Luckily, the enemy AI can't land headshots constantly. The more dangerous wild animals like bears or crocodiles can kill you with a single attack, which has a realistic feel to it. All in all, the combat is on the harder end of the scale, especially on horseback. Moreso, the game doesn't have any difficulty sliders. So, to make the game more accessible and a less daunting experience, there is the iconic deadeye ability. Everything besides you will go into slow motion while you tag and kill enemies like a badass. Though deadeye breaks realism, its a cool core gameplay element. Without it, RDR2 would not have been the same.The vast world of RDR2 is mainly traversed on horseback. The horse movements are quite Witcher 3-like. However, in RDR2, the horse feels more ""alive"". As your bond with the horse increases, you unlock some cool tricks it can perform. If riding the horse becomes too repetitive, traveling to a certain destination can be automated. But the autopilot on twisty roads isn't very reliable. Also, any major location can be fast traveled to.When not riding on the horse, I climbed various mountains in my search for collectibles. It felt as if the mountains could only be climbed in one set way. If you could climb a steeper one, you might not be able to climb a less steep one because it was a ""shortcut"" to the summit. This is when the game punishes you for just trying to save some time. Swimming is not used much, and you cannot dive underwater or swim long distance.The side quests and random encounters were quite varied. However, besides some humor missions, the main missions were all very similar:1. Go to X location2. Kill all enemy in said location in a big shootout and rob them.3. Get back to hideout while having another shootout on horseback.There are some quests that start with stealth but ends up in a shootout anyway. Moreover, the movie-esque main missions have a great contrast to the RPG-like free roam activities and side quests- to the point where they almost feel like two entirely different games.There are also some minor glitches in this game. Objects sometimes clip through each other; objects or characters sometimes fail to spawn, requiring a reload of the save file. Lastly, sometimes, the horse movement becomes clunky. Getting off and back on it fixes this issue. Overall, there is no game-breaking bug in this game- just few minor setbacks which can be resolved.RDR2 on consoles looked great. But on PC with ultra settings, it might just be the best looking video game of all time. Even the smallest of things, unnoticed by many, are created with a high level of detail. The animations of player and NPC movements, explosions, fires and other minor movements in the enviroment are all very smooth. Bonus props for the lighting work.The world of RDR2 is quite vast and filled with many activities. You can watch shows, play games at a saloon, catch fish, track down unique animals and birds in swamps, tundras, deserts, grasslands and many more areas. Saint Denis is gorgeous at night. The game encourages exploration- part of RDR1's map opens up after the campaign solely for exploration. This area feels like the last remnants of the wild west. The setting truly makes you feel like you are in America at the turn of the 19th century.A merry band of misfits are unable to accept the rapid civilization of the country at the end of the wild west era. Their objective is to gather enough money and move to a yet uncivilized area to live in. The gang leader makes many plans to gather said money. His plans end up causing a huge disturbance in that region and they are forced to move on to the next. In reality, the story is about accepting change and Arthur's character development from a puppet to someone who thinks about consequences of actions and tries to not make the wrong move. After a certain point, the focus shifts from ""just making some money"" to opposing America itself. This takes the story to a generic direction, but Arthur's later character developments greatly overshadow this.The characters, named or not, everyone has their own life to live. They have interactions fitting for them. The gang members have random chit-chat amongst each other, they drink and sing all night after overcoming hardships. In most games, the NPCs' actions are centered around the protagonist. But here, not only the protagonist's, but each member's actions have consequences on the gang as a whole. They all are like a big family.The protagonist, Arthur Morgan and the gang leader, Dutch are the main characters of this story. Dutch's character regresses from an idealistic person who makes choices with no better alternatives to an indecisive assh*le who makes the wrong choices INTENTIONALLY. His character just changes somewhere in the middle without really showing reason for the change. Arthur, on the other hand, is the star of the game. He was, by no means, a good guy. But he tries to change- tries to oppose Dutch's dangerous plans. Arthur grows a heart and learns to do the right things.RDR2 is a huge game packed with content that will last one with over a hundred hour of gameplay. The game is not finished after completing the campaign. There are numerous side quests, and a lot of collectibles and challenges that emphasize exploration. The online mode is an added bonus. This is what a AAA game should offer at 60 dollars. With RDR2, Rockstar went out of their comfort zone to create a truly immersive, realistic yet an enjoyable and emotional experience. They have raised the bar for open world games and made something that can represent the progression of video games in this decade."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am a close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."
358,𝕱𝖔𝖝,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104637990/,67,,1,266.7,May,"27,",309,0,1,"Honestly, I do believe that the Red Dead Redemption games are the best work of Rockstar studios. The story is amazing, the gameplay is great and the choices you can make are great too. I'm not a GTA fan because somewhat in video games I tend to like doing the good guy and what turned me off with GTA is that 1. You cannot escape having to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. The world is so immoral and a complete parody that it does not feel realistic for a second. However, none of those things are the case in my own opinion with Red dead redemption. Sure you start up as a villain but you may redeem yourself and change. At some point, there are very sad moments where you will feel like crying and empathizing with the characters. They really stepped up on the realism of how characters behave although some are just crazy, the way that they are introduced makes sense.Rockstar really managed to make this sequel a piece of art. Although this game is very popular for the online side of it, I honestly believe that the popularity overall comes more from the gameplay and storyline of the solo campaign. My hope and I dare say that i'm not alone in this after speaking with many people really is that Rockstar would make more games like these and possibly a third one or DLC's about solo campaign. I really think they would draw a lot of people and make a lot of profit.But heh, buy it, it's worth the full price and definitely should be considered if on sold. I recommend 100%"

360,J6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/6561198054548261/,133,17,1,120.4,December,"21,",216,0,1,"Bought the game on Xbox One day one, and decided to buy it again on Steam recently.Completed the game on PC as I did not complete it on Xbox.This was due to burn out just because of the sheer amount of time you will spend on this game, take that as what you will as some will take that as a good thing, and others a bad thing.So what are the positives and the negatives.The Positives Single Player:1). You will never find an RPG open world game that pulls you in so much that by the end of the game you will feel as if you actually know the characters that you meet within this game. What I mean by this is, if you have friends real life, you will develop the same feelings to the people in this game, and that is because of the amount of time you spend interacting with these characters. That is because of the slow pacing that is this game, you can not just rush through the missions and expect to complete it in a day, you just physically can't. Do not let the 22 hours of my game time fool you, (I still have not completed everything) as I started with a save game that I got online that starts you at Chapter 3, and that was only because that is where I got up to on my Xbox game version.There are 6 Chapters in total in this game, with 2 Epilogue Chapters as well.2). The amount of world building, exploration, interaction that you will be doing in this game, would be described as a second life experience, in the understanding that, you will be taken away by not only the scenery, but by how the NPC's in this game, especially by the NPC's in camp. I know this word has been butchered to death, but that is only because it keeps being erroneously used for games that use gimmicks that give the impression of a real living world *cough* *cough* Skyrim. But this game, by it's very definition is an art form, because when you step away, especially once you have completed the main quest lines, and you take a step back and have a deep think on everything that you have been on and been through, it would have been one hell of a journey and you will be thinking about all that you have seen and done for many days to come.3). This is not a small or quick game to get through. From what I would state, if you was to do nothing but the main story quests, 100+ hours. If you want to try and complete everything in this game, (I do not want to just state a small number), but a mate of mine is still going at 800+ hours so, a £50, or $50 investment is a bargain for what you will be getting out of this game.4). With the coming mod support with this game, just like any game Rockstar put's out, this game will have longevity that will see no end, so take note that if you do buy this game, I can safely say you will not find yourself with becoming bored as you will be able to satiate your weirdest and wildest desires for many months and years to come.5). The game looks amazing, and is the closest you will come to seeing a Bob Ross art piece in game form, visualised in its entirety from your computer screen.6). You can customize almost all aspects of your character, weapons and horses, with some real depth to how your character looks as well. Growing facial and head hair over a period of time will also give you a sense that this game is a living breathing representation that you are quite literally playing real-life people. After a while you will forget that you are playing a game.7). There are many positives to this game, and I could go on for ages but I think these are the main points that should catch your eye. Now on to the Negatives.The Negatives: (From what I would expect people to complain about):(I like the game no matter what, I am just putting down what I think people will moan about).1). Not a negative for me, but some people may or will see it as one, but, if I am going to be honest, this one is on you. If you have a computer that does not have a GTX 1060 or higher, with 16GB of 3600 DDR4 RAM, and a decent CUP, an 8th Gen Intel I7 8600, basically a fairly modern high end PC, do not buy this game and wonder why it won't run well or chugs, then cry and moan about it, it's your fault.I have a GTX 1080TI 11GB Graphics Card, An 8th Gen Intel i7 8600, 36GB DDR4 3600 and everything at Ultra and it can still struggle with FPS when near lost's of Water. You will not be able to play this game like you could with GTA V. If your computer can barely run GTA V, you will not be able to run this game or play it in a decent visual form. Make sure you have the minimum specs as exactly stated, if you do not have them as they are written, do NOT buy this game, period. Most of the people that are moaning and complaining is because they do not read before they buy.2). For people that have a low attention span or do not have or want to put the time and effort into a game that requires you to focus, pay attention and to listen to the characters and to the world around them without you getting distracted by family and friends, this game is not for you.You need to spend a good amount of alone time playing this game. This is not Call of Duty where you can play it, put the controller down to do the dishes, come back, then put it down again 20 minutes later. You need to invest your time into this game to get the most out of it. If you buy this game, and you complete the main story missions and feel nothing, that's your personal problem, and the problem is with you, not the game. It just means that you are incapable of listening and investing a real understanding of what it is that you are doing in this game.TL;DR: If you can't stay quiet and sit still and listen for a good amount of time, do not buy this game, it's not for you.3). Very similar to the top reason but shorter. The game is very slow to start with, and I mean very slow. There will not be fast paced action scenes and combat all of the time, and things will not be interesting Michael Bay style, this is not a game for you.It's not a Farmville simulator kind of investment, as you can do a hell of a lot of things, but you do need to invest yourself to get the most out of this game.4). The game is going through updates and patches on the regular, so if you use mods expect to be waiting on Scripthook updates, so I would suggest you creating a backup copy of your current game version just in case you want to downgrade (Make sure you have 250GB in total of free space for both your normal version and you backup.Now for the Multiplayer side.The Positives:1). Some good Multiplayer exclusive stuff that will be ported to Single Player by the use of mods.The Negatives:1). Don't bother, it's GTA Online in a nutshell with all of the Microtransaction goodness that flows into this game. Certain things are locked behind Gold Bars which, let's face it, you will have to spend real money on because completing online missions gives you so little it's not worth it. The same goes for cash, you will be making a buck at best at the end of Multiplayer missions.Stick with Single player and play with mods."

Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens. Now I don't feel bad about the price at all!Looking for a game rich in story, long playing with great replay value, excellent graphics, entertaining as all get out? Here it is...................... you're welcome! :-)"

Gameplay is also a lot of fun, and I'm just after 7 hours of almost none stop playing.My laptop is not even super hot, and not a single crash all that way.It was also very easy to start the game, although many here are griping on the Rockstar launcher.

I know it's been said by a thousand critics, but yeah, this game really is a masterpiece.  It's truly a marvel that so many people from all over the world were able to focus on this project and pull it off flawlessly.  The first thing everyone notices are the spectacular and life-like graphics, but every single aspect of the game is close to perfection; animations, physics, music, characters - it all comes together and makes for an amazing experience.  I can't see myself playing too many other games for quite awhile.  Absolutely worth full price, the wealth of content and overall quality are more than worth it."

Then version 1.20 was just released. It’s bugged to the point it crashes on starting story mode or going to settings, because of what looks like some coding stupidity with null pointers looking at the crash dumps and diagnostics. I’ve tried every single fix on the Rockstar support site, which in itself is buggy and seldom loads on a lot of browsers, on multiple devices on completely different networks.I’ve tried re-installing the game, re-installing drivers, beta graphics drivers, blanket OS resets and re-builds, updating to Windows 2004 from 1909, re-creating settings files, removing profiles, verifying game caches, registry bodging, making use of the onboard graphics instead of the graphics card. Disabling and uninstalling anti virus software. Running it directly from Rockstars awful social app bypassing Steam. A whole host of other things and none of it works because the game is inherently bugged, there is no fix. Curiously I’ve been unable to identify any differences there is with people where it’s working for them, and the many, many people who can’t play the game whatsoever right now. My rig goes well beyond the recommended specs and was handling ultra settings perfectly before this patch. (I have of course tried to amend and regenerate settings files to basic levels, flipping to Vulkan, back to DX etc)I’ve never had such a poor experience with a game in 16 years of having a Steam account, or on any console. Or with any Rockstar game and I think I’ve played most or all of them over the years, going back to the original GTA and the mythical GTA London. Nowhere near this much trouble with a game before. To the point this is the first review I’ve ever left. Don’t waste your time right now, don’t waste your money. Until they fix their ridiculous QA processes and their own sloppy coding this isn’t worth it. You’re rouletting on whether it works from first install, or works for a time until they release another horrendously tested forced patch. Ridiculous."

Then entire Rockstar launcher debacle has been a headache.  They wanted to mine our data, I get it, but I just wish I had the option to pay more and not have to be online to play the game for the first time.  I would happily pay $120 to get a DVD or USB and load the game on a computer which is not connected to the internet, and just play.  Despite all of the ridiculous, invasive, bureaucratic, spyware that we are required to install on our personal computers, just to play the game, it is incredible.The game is beautiful, and a joy to behold.  The developers really put in a ton of work and it shows.  But alas, I cannot recommend this game as the Rockstar launcher is so buggy that it gets in the way of playing.  Please, fix the launcher.  The game is a work of art, and it is such a shame that greed has gotten in the way of our opportunity to enjoy it."

I've bought it on a discount, but tbh now, after playing this game i would have bought it even without an discount. Its totally worth the money, the story, the guns and other stuff, especially the views (landscapes). You are called Arthur Morgan, and you can create your own story, are you going to be a good guy? or a bad guy? its totally up to you. Choose carefully tho, it is gonna matter believe me. If you are ever going to buy it, be sure to make your character they way you like it, make peace with your own mind and his mind aswell, dont hastitate, just be yourself, take your time exploring and ""horsing around"". Because all of that is gonna end eventually, like our lives man. 9.5/10- there should be a bit more music during riding a horse imo, other than that, its just fu*king awesomeI deeply love Arthur."

This game is highly eventful and high quality and has multi-layered dimensions of art, music, design. , Lighting, high quality animations and many other things. One of the story stages of the game and the sub-stages and various activities in this game is made with arithmetic and accuracy and thinking. The wildlife of this game is as much as 10 story games. It has a wide range and can be one of the important factors in the quality of this game. The story of the game in the stages along with the epic and listening music will delight you. The game world is very carefully and realistically designed and for each behavior. You will answer. For example, if you hold a gun and look around the city, people will tell you that you don't need to use a gun, or if you harass a town butcher or a gun dealer or discover their secret, the next time. See them, they'll tell you you came back? And I have nothing to hide, or they say you bothered me a lot last time and things like that. There is a lot in the game from finding hidden gold bars or treasure trove of criminal gangs and stealing horses and carriages and selling them and hunting legendary animals and turning them into special clothes. Your popularity line in the game It plays an important role and makes people treat you well or get into fights with you. Your weapons get dirty over time and you need to clean them to get them back to their original strength. Taming horses in the game is one of the most enjoyable activities of the game. Arthur has the ability to personalize everything from clothes to weapons. The artistic design and graphics of the game are excellently designed and make you wait from time to time and take photos. Take it and the photo mode of the game is also great. The release of this game for personal computers initially had problems, but after various updates published by Rockstar, it was completely solved, but the system is still there. It requires a strong compiler to play. Anyone who wants to understand the grandeur and breadth and depth of the game must experience it, and the origins of the game in the story section. That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.سلام به شما دوستان عزیز:بعد از بازی کردن آخرین محصول راکستار به مدت ۵۳ ساعت باید بگم با یکی از بهترین بازی های این نسل در صنعت بازی های رایانه ای طرف هستیم.این بازی به شدت واقعه گرا و با کیفیت و دارای ابعاد چند لایه از هنر،موسیقی،طراحی،نورپردازی،انیمیشن های به شدت باکیفیت و خیلی چیز های دیگر داره.تک تک مراحل داستانی بازی و مراحل فرعی و انواع فعالیت های مختلف در این گیم با حساب و دقت و تفکر ساخته شده است.حیات وحش این بازی به اندازه ۱۰ بازی داستانی وسعت دارد و می تواند یکی از فاکتور های مهم کیفیت این بازی باشد.روایت داستان بازی در مراحل به همراه موسیقی های حماسی و گوش نواز شما رو به وجد می آورد.جهان بازی بسیار بادقت و واقعی طراحی شده است و به تک تک رفتار های شما پاسخ می دهند.مثلا اگر سلاح رو در دست بگیرید و در شهر بگردید مردم به شما خواهند گفت که نیازی به استفاده از سلاح نیست،یا اگر قصاب شهر یا فروشنده اسلحه رو اذیت کنید یا راز آن ها رو کشف کنید،دفعه بعدی که آن هارو ببینید،به شما خواهند گفت تو باز پیدات شد؟و چیزی برای مخفی کردن ندارم،یا می گویند دفعه پیش خیلی برام مزاحمت پیش آوردی و از این قبیل کارها.فعالیت فرعی زیادی در بازی وجود دارد از پیدا کردن شمش های طلای مخفی گرفته یا گنج گروه های خلافکار بازی و دزدیدن اسب و کالسکه و فروختن آن ها و شکار های حیوان های افسانه ای و تبدیل آن ها به لباس های خاص.خط محبوبیت شما در بازی نقش مهمی را ایفا می کند و باعث می شود که افراد با شما خوب برخورد کنند یا با شما وارد اختلاف و درگیری بشوند.سلاح های شما به مرور زمان کثیف می شوند و باید آن ها را تمیز کنید تا به حالت قدرمند اولیه خویش برگردنند.رام کردن اسب ها در بازی یکی از فعالیت های  بسیار لذت بخش بازی است.آرتور قابلیت شخصی سازی دارد از لباس ها بگیرید تا سلاح هاش.طراحی هنری و گرافیک بازی بسیار عالی طراحی شده و باعث می شود شما هر از گاهی صبر کنید و عکس بگیرید و حالت عکاسی(photo mod ) بازی نیز بسیار عالی عمل کرده.انتشار این بازی برای کامپیوتر های شخصی در ابتدا مشکلاتی رو به همراه داشت،ولی بعد از به روز رسان های مختلفی که کمپانی راکستار منتشر کرد،کاملا حل شده ولی هنوز سیستم کامپویتر قوی برای بازی کردن می طلبد.هر کسی که بخواهد عظمت و وسعت و عمق بازی رو درک کند باید آن را تجربه کند،و ریشه و اصل بازی در بخش داستانی آن نهفته است.موفق و پیروز باشید."

I have yet to try the online mode, so I will not include a review of that in this post.I won't go into detail about the story, so as not to spoil it for anyone, but I will say that the game features excellent missions, typical of a Rockstar game. The humor is spot-on, the characters are great, and the overall story is a fantastic prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption.While the game isn't too difficult if you want to jump from one mission to another, mastering everything will take some time. You need to get familiar with all the activities available, especially hunting, which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.The visuals are stunning, even on lower settings. I have never played a game with a world so full of life as Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar went to great lengths to create an immersive world of the last days of the Wild West, and it's a huge payoff for players. You really feel like you're riding with a gang in the early 1900s. With the photo mode, no matter where you are on the map, you can take a beautiful photo. The dynamic weather and different environments not only change the look but also the fauna and flora of the region.Shooting is satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and slow motion, and the crafting system is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics. I also appreciated the weapon modifications, which allow you to customize each weapon with a different look.The map is vast, and you primarily travel using a horse. While you can fast travel easily using camp, train, or stagecoach, I do not advise doing so. You'll miss out on random events, and there are way too many things to collect that will take hours to find. Additionally, there are around 100 challenges, so there's over 300 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game. Even after dedicating all that time, I'm sure I still missed a few easter eggs or interesting places in the game.In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing game and one of the best games ever made. It's highly recommended for anyone who has the patience to learn everything the game has to offer. Thank you, Rockstar, for all the amazing moments I had playing this game!"

One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west."

This games takes a games graphics to a new level. In terms of graphics i gotta say that Red Dead Redemption is one among of the best games in the graphics category.☐ Bad☐ Alright☐ Good☐ Beautiful☑ FantasticThe audio is really well made. I love the sounds that are in the game, there is not much to say since the sounds are prefect.☐ Easy☐ Average☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☑ Hard☐ UnfairNow the difficulty is another thing. The game overall was pretty difficult, the most difficult part was the missions but I'm pretty sure every rockstar game is difficult when playing for the first time. When replaying the mission it isn't as difficult then. It's mostly hard to learn at first but then after a few times of replaying the mission it's pretty easy to master.☐ Bugs destroy the game☐ Lots of bugs☑ Few Bugs☐ You can use them for speedrun☐ Nothing encounteredThere are quite a few bugs that i have experienced like the character dissapearing meaning i would have to restart the game and the preformance being really bad at times. But i think they have fixed those bugs already. Otherwise the bugs aren't really so game breaking.☐ There is none☐ Bad☐ Alright☐ Good☑ FantasticThe story was probably one of the best stories i have experienced in any game. The story is just so overwhelmingly good that i think it would still be fun to play the story over again a hundred times. The story has so many unexpected events which makes the player go really amazed and so many fun and intressting missions. Although the epilouge was a bit boring the story was fully okay.☐ Frustrating☐ Sleepy☐ Boring☑ Fun☑ ChallengingThe gameplay section has kinda the same points i made in the Story section and the Difficulty section, but one thing i didn't mention is that there are still a lot of things to do even after fully completing the story like completing the game to 100%, there is also the Red Dead Online which is the multiplayer version of Red Dead Redemption 2. There is also a story in multiplayer like the singleplayer one, there are a lot of things to do in multiplayer like the stranger mission or fully completing the roles etc.☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours)☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)☐  Few hours (10 - 20 hours)☐  Long (40-60 hours)☑ Very Long (61-100 hours)☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)The game lenght is really long, you could also just say that it never ends since you can still play after the story mission but it isn't as fun as doing the story mission though. There is also Red Dead Online but i think only the story counts as the game lenght. If Red Dead Online counts then it would easily be put in the Extremely Long thing.☑ Full price☐ Wait for Sale☐ Don't buy☐ Refund it if you canNow taking everything i said right now about the game i think it's worth the whole 59.99 euros that it's priced on. Although you can get the game for a bit cheaper during sales if you think the price is too high."
393,thöni,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036788427/,62,3,1,105.1,January,"14,",627,7,1,"There is a reason why Rockstar Games is the only videogame company that can consistently make competent great open world games and Red Dead Redemption 2 is their Magnum Opus. While others ruined their franchises with quick uninspired cash grabs or buggy messes they created the highest grossing game of all time (GTA V) with GTA Online, and even when Red Dead Online didn’t really work that didn’t diminish the insane quality put behind RDR2.Rockstar mastered the open world game formula and instead of finding the classic boring problems of your yearly open world games (useless filler missions, retarded npcs, low level acting and forced microtransactions that sh1t on the game’s lore), red dead is a believable historically accurate, fun and emotional moving world.Arthur’s gang and him are probably one of the best singleplayer video game stories ever, a long catching journey (50+ hours) where you will not feel like you are forced to do optional quests but you will want to do them, every mission (main or not) flows without you even having the feel like you are filling a checklist, missions are chained one with another with such fluidity that you won’t even notice.Everything is so perfect in this game it is hard to find something negative, the soundtrack is phenomenal, perfectly timed with the vibe of each scene, beautifully crafted world, tens of memorable characters and an iconic main character.If you like the Wild West and feel like being a cool cowboy in the start of the 20th century don’t doubt it, buy it.You might get tired of hearing about “The Plan” (xD) but don’t worry"

That being said, I've nearly logged 800 hours and have played since early December 2019. So in turn this is not a short experience review... this is what I feel other's should know before buying this sub-par Build of a game.Again, 797.2 hours as of writing this. The devs and Rockstar only consider this as a means of revenue. If you have issues with disconnects whether it be on occasion or regular basis... it's your fault. Not because they use p2p servers. Any hackers or griefers? There is an in-game report system they claim catches hackers on the spot (though hackers have died down some). Camp won't spawn, neither will moonshine shack? Well it's likely your fault too.I have dozens of e-mails back and forth regarding in-game issues or mechanics not working and Rockstars' Support team is only good at telling you ""Try verifying your game"" or ""Try restarting your router"" or some other BS despite there being thousands of players that experience the same issues, videos on youtube describing said issues, subreddits, etc...I literally was the last one in my group of friends to stick by this game as long as I have hoping for improvements. Much like a fool, I see now this is a repeat of Fallout 76, only it's a different franchise and publisher. Once you complete or get tired of single player, the online nightmare begins. Now I have 100% completion on the online story. And the game is great... WHEN and IF it works as intended. This to me feels like another early access mess. Many people say they should have waited a year to release the online mode, and I have to agree. Issues that were in beta are still present. And in a western game, there is NO WAY to rob NPC's, No passenger or cargo trains to rob and perhaps the worst part... No Bank Robberies either. Except out of your wallet (if you're foolish enough to buy GOLD BARS).The support isn't sub-par, it's next-level amateur hour. This game in my opinion deserves a seat next to FO76 for multiplayer experience. As I said before, Single player is fantastic. But it only lasts so long. Everything else about this ""game"" becomes a second job. So if you have tons of spare time, and the patience akin to a rock or moss... sure, give it a go. Otherwise, Do not go in expecting anything. If they fix the issues all players across all platforms face then maybe I would consider giving it a go. But I am waiting on a ""reply"" from support now. Depending how they handle my situation, I may just uninstall. As of now this ""game"" is only a source of more stress for me, and I don't need or want that in a game.Buyer Beware. Game is not finished. Has several issues. Needs fixing.However; Rockstar is only concerned with profits.And before you say ""Well they are limited by the quarantine,"" These issues and others have been around since BETA.Again, if it is your cup of tea, go for it. If you were waiting to see if it improved... it hasn't.Great concept, Excellent Franchise... POOR, Mismanaged execution."
396,Kosmozuikis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/,118,3,1,92.2,July,"6,","2,657",16,1,"Oh where to even start with this one? Is this a masterpiece? No, but very close to it. TL;DR it's one of the best open world games ever made.I didn't like it at first. Actually I hated it in the first 5-10h but since I paid a lot of money for it, i wanted to finish it. It felt too slow, too boring but when I started to look at this game in the same way I looked at Death Stranding it became almost as good as the latter. You need to accept the fact that you live in RDR2, not play it. When you realize that it becomes so fun that it's hard to stop playing.First the story. It's good, really good. Although there's one downside and it's the main character Arthur. Game tries to make you like him, but he's a disgusting character. Although towards the end of the game you might start having a bit warmer feelings towards him, he's still just a disgusting criminal. The story in general is very good and extremely long. Unlike for example AC odyssey where you need over 100h to finish the game but only 20h is actual gameplay (everything else is clearing camps and other pointless, mindless filler content), RDR2 is around 100h long without doing any colectathlon, only the story. And it never gets boring, the story is engaging, the missions constantly change, the game constantly surprises you with something new. And even after all those hours you want more. The pacing, the variety, the depth, the cut-scenes, it's just amazing.Gameplay is simple yet extremely fun. You are a gang member who tortures and murders innocent people. You rob people, trains, banks, slaughter everyone on your way (this is why the main character is disgusting). But the way you do it never gets old because it's always something different, something new.You'll be riding your horse a lot. It's like GTA in wild west only RDR2 is good and fun. Besides perfectly paced and fleshed out main and side story missions you can hunt, fish, help strangers, craft stuff, cook food, take care of your horse and so much more. You just live in this game, you live your life. To rest you set up a camp where you can sleep, fast travel, cook food and make potions. You can brush your horse, feed it to restore its health. Your can even take care of your beard which is growing, you can use beard oils or you can shave it. Hunting is also fun. You track animals with your Witcher sense and kill them. You get a lovely skinning animation and then you can sell it or craft some stuff for you.You can buy clothes, your character could get cold and clothes matter. There's even your weight which could increase or decrease. The depth is insane and even though the game is published by a terrible company, you can see that developers put a lot of work into this game and they made it with love and passion. Often on the way somewhere you will meet some strangers or witness some weird events. The game is filled with those, it's also filled with hilarious side stories which will make you laugh. I haven't used fast travel just for this reason – there's something happens on your way somewhere.On top of that you have plenty of side activities like hunting, fishing, shooting competitions, mini-games, collectibles which probably will add another 100h to your time if you don't want to put the game aside.Or maybe you're into multiplayer? Oh well, then I guess you're never uninstalling this.One annoying thing is the controls. Like in other Rockstar games the controls are weird. You can't run and rotate the camera which is very annoying. Sometimes you unintentionally bump into people and they get mad which leads into them attacking you and the whole town trying to kill you. But this small issue is one of the biggest flaws of the game which doesn't happen that often after you adapt to the controls.This game is probably the best looking game on the market today (besides MSFS). And it's been released a while ago. Compare it to Cyberpunk for example which looks like a game from 10 years ago. RDR2 looks stunning, no matter in what conditions, no matter if it's a cut-scene or gameplay, outside or inside a building. Every corner of the map looks stunning. The detail is insane. The animations, both facial and general are insane. Graphically the game is a masterpiece.But here's the downside – it's a technical mess. The game tends to crash and it runs extremely poorly.Crashes happen when you try to load into the game. In that case you need to go into you documents folder and delete some files which fixes it. Changing graphics settings in-game could crash the game. Having certain graphics option turned on leads to artifacts on the screen. And performance is absolutely terrible. I'm playing on high/ultra mix, dlls set to balanced and getting 60-80fps. Without dlss it's unplayable and runs at around 40fps or lower.Played on 5800x, rtx3080, 32GB at 3440x1440.No native ultrawide support but works perfectly with a fix. As always check PCgamingwiki for that.Sound, music, voice acting is of highest quality. The music is perfectly incorporated into the game. It fits every action, every moment of the story very well and enhances the overall immersion. You won't hear a lot of music in this game, it's very subtle but when you hear it you feel right at home. Voice acting is done very well starting with main characters and ending with some random character voices.Overall an amazing game worth buying despite if it's on sale or not. It has technical issues and requires a beast of a PC to run properly but it's one of the best open world experiences ever. Don't miss on this one."

Stupid marketing moves like that do nothing but pissoff loyal customers and will no doubt gonna back fire on Valve in the long run.  At the least, will  certainly delay revenue for Steam as we learn to wait and not jump right at release. Lesson learned Valve. Gosh I feel much better now getting that off my chest.  lol. Anyway, back to the game.First off the game is fun.  Good story, action, and characters. It's pretty easy to fall in love with this game. The scenery is very detailed and the voice actors are awesome. You can almost feel the cold and freeze attacking you when in snow and  mountains areas. The certain gritty aspect of the old west and voice accents just add to the experience. The story is solid although it is quite easy to  get off track with side quests which is pretty cool too. And the story keeps you interested and immersed. Besides, who doesn't like to brandish a nice six-shooter anyway.That said, I think it is crazy that as a 'fix' to starting the game for so many (me included) is to unplug your controller before launching it.  I mean ok that works. But why should we have to do that for a game that costs almost 60$ USD, whoops, I mean 47$ for all the wise and smart people that waited a bit to buy it. I would think devs would have that worked out but hey, at least it will launch (most times) doing it that way. The only other negative I can think of is that occasionally the game will crash on me. This does not happen very often and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why. However, No problem, just unplug your controller and fire that baby up again and turn on the controller and you're good to go for another run.Would I buy this game again?  Absolutely!   However I did learn a lesson for me to slow down and 'set  a spell' - like a couple of weeks to get in on a deal. Why pay more than ya have to?  That said, I think the game it worth the money (even at full price), in spite of the loading issue and occasional crashing.  And you will probably experience may hours of awesome fun playing this game. And now for me, it's back to running from the law and chasing outlaws. Enjoy."
400,haha,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eferis/,18,,1,87.4,December,"13,",996,0,1,"A narrative tour de force. Nothing less can be said to describe this almost 100-hour long journey that will take you through the towns and lands of a shifting America at the turn of the XX century, following the story of Arthur Morgan and a whole bunch of misfits and weird characters in a world that's getting less and less hospitable for their kind. The twists and turns of the plot, the extremely variegate and believable cast whose stories you'll get to know, care for and be a part of, the top notch writing and a soundtrack that is nothing short of amazing, starring some of the finest artists in American alt-country and soul music, make this one of the highest point in video games storytelling and probably one of the greatest Western stories ever told.The gameplay side of the production is an acquired taste, it's pretty well-known that the game is very slow and moving around feels kinda heavy but it's also very functional to the game world and, once you gets used to it, you will not want it any other way (and if you do, well, maybe this game is not the one for you, and there's nothing wrong with that). The amount of activities to do and stuff to see is pretty amazing and, if you enjoy them all, they will make the game even longer.On the technical side the game will probably require a bit of tinkering on your part in order to make it run properly on your system. I had to spend almost two hours adjusting visual settings so it could finally reach relatively solid 60 fps in every situation on my system (currently mounting a GTX 1070 and a i5-6600k CPU), achieving that with a combination of mostly Ultra and High settings, with a few Medium ones. The mandatory Rockstar Launcher is definitely an unnecessary hassle we really could have done without, let's just hope it won't break the game in the future like GFWL did with GTA IV.I haven't tried the Online mode (yet) so I cannot comment on that.In the end, Red Dead Redemption II is likely a game that won't please everyone but, those who'll dive deep into its rich world, won't find anything like it."

Sometimes it crashes 45m into the game.The game itself is absolutely stunning and the physics are next level. However, due to the constant crashes (especially during critical times!!!), it ruins a really great experience.  I would rate this a positive review, but the lack of optimization for PC is deplorable.Edit: I am 100% willing to update this review if or when the developers decide to do something about it.Edit 2: Still crashing. However, not as often. And to respond to the comments about the issue being on my end:I built this rig about 3 days before playing RDR2. So it is only about 1-2 weeks old by now. Everything is brand spanking new (my old rig fried). Understanding it may not happen to everyone since every pc is different, it is happening to me, and to a lot of others.  So given that fact, the issue isn't with our pc's, it is with their settings and optimization.With that being said...I shouldn't have to juggle the settings around just to get it not to crash. Why should I have to do that after paying $60 for the game? If I have the option to play everything on ultra, then I'm going to play everything on ultra and expect the ♥♥♥♥ to work flawlessly. Not ""well some options have to be medium, others high and ultra...."" ♥♥♥♥ that. Optimize the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game so I DON'T have to do that ♥♥♥♥.Edit 3: Lots of these comments are about my rig being too OP.  No one is flexing, but if I can afford a steak, why the ♥♥♥♥ would I go to McDonalds.Anyways, I don't have these optimization problems with ANY other game.  Even ♥♥♥♥♥♥ EA's Jedi: Fallen Order (EA is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one here, the game itself is gorgeous) runs perfectly fine on all ultra. Far Cry 5 runs fine on all ultra. Everything runs fine on all ultra EXCEPT this game.  I understand they are ""not gods"", but knowing there was this problem and releasing it anyways, is the problem. At least have the game work first, and if it breaks down later, I get it. But from the outset the port to PC was just bad, which is inexcusable for a company that makes millions of dollars."

The characters, including Arthur Morgan and Dutch Van Der Linde, have some of the most complicated moral dilemmas and plot lines in all of media history, and it’s more than interesting to watch unfold in the game as you play.Red Dead Redemption 2 also currently possess the most intricate and detailed open world to ever be created. With a technical marvel of an AI system, an artificially intelligent animal ecosystem, and incredibly dynamic and interactive NPCs, the technical aspects of what make the open world fantastic as truly some of the best to ever hit the market. All this, combined with the beautiful and detailed map are what really bring the world into fruition.I could look on and on about the writing and how fantastically executed it is but despite all this, this isn’t a very “gamer” game. There’s no “double jump”, or points system, or fancy fantasy game mechanics, It’s very detached from gaming as a whole and a lot more focused on telling a story. This type of style appeals to me, but I can see why it isn’t as treasured in some gaming circles either. This is a game made to be brutally realistic, and that to me feels more relatable and embraceable than any other game will ever."

This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online is not bad, but is hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that is good.The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game. Oh and i like it when the horse testicles shrink when it's cold.I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good. I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull.    Red Dead OnlineOk after playing online for some time i can say i like some elements from it. Love the grind like in GTA Online. Love the trader role because of the animal hunting.I can say that RDO is not that bad but it does need content.The game kinda has a somewhat a lot of content online. You will need to grind a lot as well.After a lot of hours that went into online i can say that Red Dead Online is not that bad, is really great actually. You can really make money easy if you know how. To get gold is kinda a pain in the ass but is worth getting it for the roles and other items that have nothing to do with getting money or such, just for the cosmetic purpose. Online does have a story driven kinda gameplay that happens before the single player campaign. The game is really great if you have friends to grind with. More people the easy it is to get money and gold but mostly money. So after all that online is quite fun but it does need more content."

HOWEVER- I could not recommend buying for PC through Steam or any other PC game platform because, like some others have said, the Rockstar social club app is a forced install and is complete garbage. So this would effect other Rockstar games as well. When I installed this game it made me create a Social Club account and must launch when you try to run the game. I get an error when I launch the game that says ""Code 17 Social Club failed to initialize"". It then will force you to try to look at a solution and a browser will pop up in RDR2 for Rockstar. The solution will say something about GTA5 and the solution didn't work for me. I've read other possible solutions from other sources and nothing worked. I know my way around a computer and have figure out how to fix just about any issue I've ever had with games and could not figure this one out. But I shouldn't have to and I'm not going to waste my time. RDR2 is excellent but don't buy this because of Social Club and maybe buy for console insteadUPDATE: Against my better judgement, because I'm not a quitter and I must be a masochist and after getting a refund I REPURCHASED this game and tried again to get this game to work. Not sure which of that many new things I tried did the trick. Moving a file here or there and deleting this other file. I was happily playing for about four days and suddenly Social Club stopped working randomly saying it couldn't connect even though the Rockstar servers are not down. And now down I go into another rabbit hole of fixes to get this garbage app working with this new issue. It sucks because I only have so much time each day to play a game and I'm sitting here for hours troubleshooting Social Club on my own instead of actually playing. Who knows if I will ever get it working again but still can't recommend this game after all Social Club has put me through- it can't be worth it."

Now, years later, I purchased Red Dead and tried to run it and apparently this also requires Social Club.  However, the last time I used Social Club was with an email address I don’t have access to anymore (like I said it was years ago) and it won’t let me log in now.  As such, it won’t let me launch red dead (or presumably GTAV if I ever wanted to play that again).  I tried making a new Social Club account and Rockstar won’t let me associate it with my Steam account until I verify my old email address that I don’t have access to anymore.  I contacted tech support and provided them with screenshots of my receipt, Steam ID, CD keys for GTAV, and some other stuff they asked for and they actually wrote me back saying that the problem is unfixable!  Like no next steps, no we need to do something else – NOTHING – just a big screw you.

Once I downloaded the game and the rockstar launcher, when running the game I started to get the problem that the game did not run directly getting the message to run the game safely but still did not run.I am a software engineer so I set out to find the causes of the errors and try to solve them, analyzing the launcher's log, where the game's events and errors are recorded, this file can usually be found in the following path 'C: \ Users \ USER-NAME \ Documents \ Rockstar Games \ Launcher \ launcher.txt ' I found some problems:.First error 0xc0000005, this error is associated with a blockage by another external program, normally the antivirus, so by deactivating the antivirus I was able to overcome this problem, I tried to run the game and received another error.Second error 0xc0000374, in programming this problem is associated with something called Heap Corruption, something that should not happen unless the game is badly programmed or there is a problem with the compilers or the hardware, in a few cases the hardware is responsible so I discarded this option, a bad programming also discarded because the game worked on other machines so I set out to see if it was compiler problems, in this case I noticed that the launcher uses Visual C ++ Redistributable 2015 and in its installation add this to the system, so I went to control panel> programs and uninstalled the versions of visual c ++ Redistributable 2015 and the rockstar launcher.Then download and install the c ++ version from the microsoft page,  and reinstall the rockstart launcher, with this I could access the game .Once there the game worked in multiplayer mode but not in campaign mode, when I tried to run the single player mode the game was loading indefinitely, seeing this I decided to use steam to analyze the integrity of the game, finding that I needed Downloading a corrupt 7.9 Gb file again, additionally proceeded to perform a clean installation of the video driver with the DDU program because the game performance was not as expected on multiplayer mode, once I finished these processes I could fully access the game.The game is great, but all these problems make my rating negative, it is not possible for the launcher to have such bad error management, they should minimally guide the user depending on the error he throws and not only leave it registered in a log file that most users will not know how to read and interpret.A lot of work ahead is left to rockstar with this game, hopefully improve in the future------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Compre el juego hace dos días, me gustaría comentarles el complicado proceso para hacer funcionar el juego, primero mis especificaciones básicas- Procesador core i7 7700 3.6 Ghz- Nvidia RTX 2060 6Gb- RAM 20 GB 2400 MhzTengo los requisitos para correr bien el juego. Una vez descargue el juego y el lanzador de rockstar al correr el juego empece a obtener el problema de que el juego no corría directamente obteniendo el mensaje de ejecutar el juego de forma segura pero aun así no ejecutaba.Soy un ingeniero de software asi que me propuse encontrar las causas de los errores y tratar de resolverlos, analizando el registro del lanzador, donde se registran los eventos y errores del juego, este archivo se puede encontar normalmente en la siguienete ruta 'C:\Users\USER-NAME\Documents\Rockstar Games\Launcher\launcher.txt'. Encontre varios problemas: Primer error 0xc0000005, este error es asociado a un bloqueo por otro programa externo, normalmente el antivirus, asi que desactivando el antivirus pude superar este problema, intente ejecutar el juego y recibi otro error.Segundo error 0xc0000374, en programacion este problema se asocia a algo llamado Heap Corruption, algo que no deberia ocurrir a menos que este el juego mal programado o que exista un problema con los compiladores o el hardware, en pocos casos el hardware es el responsable asi que descarte esta opcion, una mala programacion tambien la descarte debido a que el juego funcionaba en otras maquinas asi que me dispuse a ver si era problemas del compilador, en este caso note que el launcher utiliza Visual C++ Redistributable 2015  y en su instalacion agrega este al sistema, asi fui a panel de control > programas y desinstale las versiones de visual c++ Redistributable  2015 y el launcher de rockstar.Luego descargue e instale  la version de c++ desde la pagina de microsoft,  y reinstale el launcher de rockstart, con esto pude acceder al juego.Una vez alli el juego funcionaba en el modo multijugador pero no en el modo campaña, cuando intentaba ejecutar el modo de un solo jugador el juego se quedaba ejecutando de manera indefinida, viendo esto decidi utilizar steam para analizar la integridad del juego, encontrando que necesitaba descargar de nuevo un archivo corrupto de 7.9 Gb, adicionalmente procedi a realizar una instalacion limpia del driver de video con el programa DDU debido a que el rendimiento del juego no era el esperado, una vez termine estos procesos pude acceder completamente al juego.El juego esta genial, pero todos estos problemas hacen que mi calificacion sea negativa, no es posible que el launcher tenga tan mala gestion de los errores, minimamente deberian guiar al usuario dependiendo del error que este arroje y no solo dejarlo registrado en un archivo log que la mayoria de usuarios no sabra leer e interpretar.Mucho trabajo por delante le queda a rockstar con este juego, esperemos mejore a futuro"

433,Phoenix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixKovacs/,27,1,1,108.3,January,"6,",236,0,1,"This game is an accomplishment of visuals and narrative, but the game design is more complicated. The story missions and open world content feel so vastly different its almost jarring. Exploration is absolutely wonderful and incredibly immersive, and I even got way more invested in hunting then I ever expected. Discovering new locations and stranger missions is always enjoyable, and the first time I stumbled upon  was genuinely jaw dropping. The attention to every minute detail, and the admittedly tedious at times animations, create a truly unmatched sense of realism. It may not be for everyone but the slow pace of everything is definitely for me. On the other hand the story missions are so on rails that after a while I just treated it more like TV show more than a game. I don't actually have a problem with this, sometimes its nice to just soak in the world and story without much effort. But the mission design is at best good and at worst boring and tedious. The ride - talk - shoot - ride loop becomes incredibly rote by the end that I was so tired of it, especially the amount of shooting gallery's. None of that really matters because god darn this game has one of the greatest narratives I have ever experienced. Arthur Morgan might just be my favorite character in all of fiction. When all of the open world systems are working together, it creates an opportunity for role-play more than any RPG I have ever played, I felt like I WAS Arthur. If the mission design matched the quality of the writing this would have the potential to be the greatest game ever created. My only real issue with the game, what I believe to be objectively bad, is the epilogue. Right after the grand crescendo of the story I spent over 90 hours with at that point comes to a dramatic end, the pacing takes a massive nose dive and never recovers. It isn't all bad, and still retains its quality in writing with genuinely great moments here and there. There was just so much bloat and pointless missions that didn't add anything to the story. So many drawn out shooting galleries, I was so bored most of the time. I would almost recommend you skip it but its worth playing for that one song. Lastly I'll touch briefly on the graphics. I don't think I have ever taken more screenshots while playing a game before. There are some aw-inspiring vistas, but the graphics can get extremely muddy at a distance. That may have just been my graphics settings so if you're like me and still making the best out of your 10 series card just keep that in mind. I cant believe this came out in 2018, and is easily the best looking open world game I have ever played, and it could have easily released this year. Overall I would give Red Dead 2 a 9/10."

Avoid the steam version and go get it for console to work around the launcher. Let me begin by saying RDR2 is one of the best games I've ever played, and i'd rate it 10/10. It will go down as one of the best games ever made, but I cannot recommend the steam version because of two words: ROCKSTAR LAUNCHER. It's atrocious. I recieved an error message today saying I could not open the launcher because my social club installation was incorrect, which was odd considering I never mess with game files, so I go to try to redownload the social club and every link on Rockstar's support page leads me to the Launcher download link........something I don't need. Also, the only way to validate your social club information is by OPENING THE LAUNCHER and verifying there. See my issue? Looks like my experience of rdr2 concludes at 33 percent game completion, because the game will refuse to play if your launcher and social club crap isnt perfect, and if you're unlucky like me and get stuck in a catch 22, then you might as well get your money back and uninstall, because after 5 hours of trying to get it to work, i finally give up. I'd ask for a refund through steam but I know I wont be getting that 60 dollars back. I'd stay away from the steam version until the launcher is either completely removed or improved on. Absolutely rediculous.EDIT: I only managed to get the launcher working again after deleting the 120GB rdr2 and reinstalling it onto my computer. HOWEVER, now the launcher is saying it cannot create a sign in token, and it's been saying this for the past hour, so STILL waiting to play the game I PAYED FOR.EDIT 2: I managed to log in after enabling my vpn. Apparently, being region locked prevents the launcher and social club from updating properly. I an now able to play my games again. I will not be changing my recommendation, because it SHOULD NOT BE THIS MUCH OF A HASSLE TO PLAY A GAME I PAID FOR.EDIT 3: The launcher refuses to work without a vpn. It complains that I have no network connection when I obviously do. This single program is the only one on my computer that doesnt sense the internet connection, but for some ungodly reason, when I enable my vpn, it works like a charm. The launcher, in it's current state, WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A VPN, SO IF YOU CAN'T FORK OVER MONEY TO GET ONE, DON'T BOTHER BUYING RDR2.EDIT 4: And now for the cherry on top of this dung cake: The launcher is working without a vpn now. So it had nothing to do with any of the internet crap apparently, and just decided to spontaneously grace me with it's single braincell functionality after I tore my hair out for hours trying yo get it to work. I'm not holding my breath, because if it F***s up this badly once, it will most likely do it again at some point. What a gigantic waste of my time for absolutely no reason.EDIT 5: And like Nostradamus himself, I predicted exactly what would happen. Not only is the launcher not working AGAIN, but now it won't work with ANYTHING. Vpn? Restart computer? Mess with DNS settings? Mess with the router? Mess with wifi settings? Delete and redownload? Nothing. It doesn't work with anything now. Keeps saying there isnt any internet connection WHEN THERE IS. I'm actually at a loss for words. I cannot describe how incompetent Rockstar is for releasing a launcher that doesn't even ♥♥♥ work half of the time. I will never buy another Rockstar product if this piece of malware launcher is connected with it, and I suggest that everyone here does the same. Dont bother going to the rockstar support. A piece of molding bread that's nailed to the wall will be of more help then they would be, and it'll have more brain power to boot. Save yourself the headache and play on console. If you dont have a console, then watch a lets play or something, because the pc version of any Rockstar title will be ruined by this idiotic launcher."

Crashes consistently in the early missions preventing any story progress. But because I was silly enough to try for longer than 2 hours to get it to work, I can no longer return it. I can understand not wanting to refund games after people have already played it too much. But when you're selling a clearly defective product on your platform, you have to take some responsibility for that. This release reflects just as badly on Steam as it does on Rockstar.I feel like somebody owes me $60.EDIT:Just felt like I should update this. After much back and forth with Steam customer support, we've worked out an agreement that I'm happy with. 'Sall good. And it's just in time, too.

437,Old Man Gamer (OMG),https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/,31,3,1,420.2,August,"14,",277,2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the product of a well made interactive open world game. The main story is compelling in itself, but there are also a slew of well written and enjoyable side stories. The game can easily become the only game you play for months, without any regrets.For me, the first and foremost is the game play. The game plays well, has an open world feel that few games fully achieve, a weapon system that functions very well, and horse mechanics that will both frustrate and add enjoyable dynamics. Even when there are issues with graphics or physic simulated behaviors, the game delivers far more positively than those can retract. Typically my first and foremost is story. The story in this game is absolutely brilliant, along with the writing and voice acting. This is one of the few story style games that I could find myself enjoying, even with a bad story, however. Fortunately, the story is sacrificed, and worth the experience as well. There are liberties taken with the approach to what historically occurred, but overall, the researchers did their homework. There are a great many small details that would be easily overlooked, but are actually true. The developers also did not get so bogged down on the story, to forget to make the game for entertainment. From the writing to the voice acting to the animations, the personalities are well established with great characterization. There are also a great many life lessons within the game, such as the two competing brothers, which add to the realism and give insight to wisdom for those paying attention. The writing of the two convicts shows how far hatred typically went in the real world. There are a great many side stories that show many truths and offer pearls of wisdom, without making the game politicized or preachy. There is a great balance that gives realism and believe-ability to the impossible Author Morgan and his environment. The music is relaxing and fits the game well. There is not anything that stands out with the score, but their are quite a few songs within the game that are comical and enjoyable. The sound effects seem very meticulously and deliberately placed. This adds a great dimension to the game while fishing, hunting, robbing a home and so forth. This is something that I rarely see this well done in a video game. Ambient sounds are more present than just background noises. For example, if you hear a frog, there is quite possibly a frog right next to you, or a chatter of a raccoon, or growl of a cougar. In summation, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must play for open world and story driven gamers, in my opinion. There are more positive aspects to share of this game. From the attention to detail of the audio, maintaining historical accuracies without turning it into a daunting social political agenda, to the realistic human interaction that has been lost in so many modern games (that makes you question if the developers ever had a healthy interaction with another human). The game is not without its flaws, but they are often more comical than frustrating. At the time of this review, I have only played the single player portion of this game."

I finished my game on 93% +/- which took me more than 200-250 hrs. (played on Rockstart launcher)I think that RDR2 story is the most epic story I ever played. I really enjoyed most of the missions. I didn't even feel like there were some kind of filler missions which didn't have any impact on the main story or character development.I really like how they were able to create such unique gang characters. I played a lot of games in my life but I never cared that much about other ""main"" characters in the game until I played RDR2. This game really made me care for other characters. Every single character felt unique and through the story you learned even more about these characters.Amazing combat. Shooting is really feels real. Reloading etc. is realistically correct which is amazing. Dead Eye ability is really neat and with options to upgrade it with talismans etc. Melee combat is also good.Wow. I must say that RDR2 is my the most favorite open world game I played in A REALLY LONG TIME. I don't even remember the last time I just went to the woods and enjoy the world by hunting or just chilling. RDR2 really nailed the world.Horse physic is really great and on spot. I like that there are different types of horses and bond system is really cool as well.Map is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL! I never used fast travel in my whole  play through. Every time my ride felt unique with so many random events. Even in the very end of the game I still experienced NEW random events. Did I mention that you can hunt in the game? And that animals are very real? I spent a lot of hrs. by just hunting. Yes, it's true that RDR2 has a really bad performance but sadly it's mainly because of Rockstar Launcher and too strong protection but otherwise game is really beautiful. You have a tons of settings you can change. Overall quality of textures looks really good. RDR2 is one of my most favorite games I ever played. Story was amazing. Arthur Morgan is the most realistic in-game character I ever played as. Thanks a lot Rockstar for creating this masterpiece. Even if you heard that Multiplayer is bad, you should really try it at least for Single Player because it's really worthy.- Arthur Morgan(Product is not refunded, I own it on Steam as well, it's just a bug)"

My favourite thing about RDD2 is that you can shape your own path and how you want to play... First time around I decided to play honourably, I helped out strangers, I spared those whom I could spare, etc. This time around however I play dishonourably, I'm a menace, I kill whoever I can, I rob, I loot,  I exploit, basically everything bad, I do; and I'm having one hell of a time doing it.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him in the online mode. loaded into the game, made my character  and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and I cant wait to make future memories with my son.Thank you <3"

Also moonshine shack sometimes is buggy and you can't get in and i got moonshiner like couple of days ago and already had to switch sessions because of that bug at least 3-4 times.That are few examples i had problems with and still have.I did all the port forwarding, tried playing with net cable connected and still getting error messages.Other aspects of online well its good if your connection is stable enough for you to be able to actually enjoy it.It is grindy and don't expect to get rich instantly (if you don't want to spend money on gold), but that's the fun part of the game.So yea, if you want amazing single player story def recommended, if you want online aspect of the game well, pray to god your internet is stable otherwise its going to be a very annoying experience most of the time."

If you find yourself in a server with one in RDO, they can siphon away your character's money, they can teleport you into the sky, they can blow you up repeatedly, they can trap you in cages, they can fly, they can set you on fire, and I could go on.In addition, the Online community just got over a 7 month content drought, and many of us had given up on receiving any more updates. The update happened right when the community was reaching a point of mass protest, and it turns out that Rockstar has plans for at least one more update around Halloween.The game is worth its price tag for the single player alone, and I've personally clocked much more time online than I have in the Story mode.

Imagine having bought the Ultimate Edition like a gullible idiot (hi that's me) because you're excited to support a port of a really good game, and by extension other projects an otherwise great developer is working on.Absolutely not. Not right now.It's clearly poorly optimized, it's clearly very buggy, it's clearly just not ready for Steam.Which brings me to my next part. What the hell is the point of making us wait for a Steam release if we still have to use the Godawful, troublesome, completely unnecessary Rockstar Games Launcher to begin with exactly? What's the point of it? Completely back asswards, if you ask me. Superfluous as ♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher doesn't even recognize that yes, I've already bought the game and yes, it is clearly installed on my system. And the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher in question is telling me I still need to buy the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's just totally pointless.I've done everything from running Steam as an administrator when before I never had to, to upgrading my BIOS, to upgrading my OS even, to upgrading a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ l i t a n y of drivers, to unplugging my controller when I first boot up the game, to sitting through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clickable chorus of ""Red Dead Redemption 2 has exited unexpectedly,"" to furrowing my brow at ""The Rockstar Games Launcher is already running,"" gritting my teeth at Steam still thinking RDR2 is running after it has clearly long since crashed out thus pushing my playtime further closer to the two hour mark of no return when it comes to Steam's refund process, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around with the .xml file for the settings to even make it run smooth when I finally do get the game running only to be met with getting kicked in the face with ERR_GFX_STATE.So after every fix imaginable, every tweak, every last thing I can think of, I turn to Rockstar Support.Also a pretty horrible experience. Expect the recipient of your support ticket to rummage through the entire Amateur IT and Comp Sci Starter Pack with such classic hits as ""have you tried restarting your computer?"" and ""obvious things you've already tried by Googling them five hours ago."" Fat lot of help that was.So by now you're probably wondering hey where's the review of the actual game.You see, I'd be able to tell you if I were actually able to play it beyond a few minutes at a time.It has taken me up to my current playtime (that's 5.1 f u c k i n g hours of crashing, restarting, and all other manner of crazy things) to get . By the time another element of gameplay meets me, I'm crashing out again and either am having to reload a save that's far away from that particular point or auto-save has bailed my ass out.So it's hard to actually talk about the gameplay and story and all that.But I'll leave you with this. What I've actually been able to experience has been .The gun play is satisfying, the music score is fantastic (even heard a rendition of Leo Delibes at the first camp, that's just tasteful), the characters all seem very interesting and the environments are gorgeous and .So when the game runs, you're treated to a great experience. When it runs, it runs .But when it SUCKS, it .Don't buy this title until Rockstar bothers to iron out the kinks, and there are a metric ton of them so a lot of work still needs to be done. There's a lot of crashing, there are a lot of errors and pop-ups and launcher problems that still persist, and this launch (while financially successful) seems to echo a lot of the sentiment here in this review.That actually getting it to run is a total slog fest. It's just miserable.But when this all blows over and they DO get this thing off the ground in a smoother way, absolutely."

This game takes over 3 minutes just to load into the singleplayer even though it's installed on my SSD because it has to authenticate with Rockstar Online Services and do some cloud sync stuff that's really buggy and takes forever. I miss when games were just games. It's a shame such a beautiful game made by a team of passionate and talented devs can't just live out its existence unblemished by greedy fingerprints. I will continue to play the game with massive respect for the developers and the gorgeous world they've created, but every time I open this game, I wish I was playing a pirated version instead, and it has nothing to with the cost of the game.

A slightly dodgy port is eclipsed by the masterful story telling and cinematic missions that far outshines GTA V, another Rockstar game in recent memory.

487,DisableBore,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DisableBore/,16,,1,107.3,January,"24,",804,0,1,"Two years late to the party but still glad I got around this one.While Manhunt will still be my guilty pleasure, RDR2 is probably a top favorite from Rockstar Games.RDR2 tells the downfall the infamous Van der Linde gang before the first game, from the perspective of Arthur Morgan, the top gunman. His entire arc is the things of beauty, and to say doubting I’d like him as much as John was foolish of me. He is a character full of likable traits who can stand proudly among my favorites. Robert Clarke deserved every single praise he received alongside the rest of the cast, with especially Benjamin Davis stealing every single scene he shows up.Now, RDR was almost entirely a love letter to the Italian Western, with mostly deserted and dry locations-and people. However 2 goes beyond to cover more classic takes too. If you have enjoyed any of the tales of the western genre, you will absolutely be satisfied in some way. From small to large heists, insane shoot outs in towns and bar fights, mountains to deserts, forests to dirty swamps, every single activity in the savage times you could like from the West is here. The soft harmonic guitars, gospel chanting, gorgeous visuals and beautiful vistas just deserve that you to take your time and enjoy a slow horseback ride.Everything you do in the world comes to bite your bottom eventually. Being a carcass to people will not result in kindness, the lawmen are ruthless to hunt you down, meanwhile bounty hunters and rival gangs seek to ambush you at any turn. Exploring the environment, paying attention to the surroundings, and finding side missions and quests always benefits you, from some good looting, rare materials to sell or craft, maybe simply amusing characters that go about their antics. The hours I spent just taking a break to go about my leisure is probably half my playtime. Hunting alone is a good example of how much you can go by, hunt to eat in a makeshift camp, donate to the gang, sell for profit, use to craft. There is almost nothing you do that can be considered a waste, and letting loose to invest yourself in the people (and especially your trusted horse) will always be worth it.I'll be straightforward, however: This is a slow game. So slow, that I wouldn't blame you for getting tired of it by the first hours. In game play terms, we have a similar mannerism to Max Payne 3, the shooting mechanics being deliciously brutal, and combat as a whole feels impactful, as it should. You must keep your body well with some light rpg style mechanics and the game will not be afraid to pull a rabbit with a gun if you do not watch your back. Being able to gunfight in first person is a neat addition, not too good for the rest.As a whole, I cant deny I am biased for adoring the genre this game pays so much homage and respect to- but in it's own it's a fantastic story of it's own that does everything to immerse you in.If you liked Clint Eastwood or John Wayne's movies (if you don't please get out of my sight and leave your testicles by the door), you enjoy a slower approach to open world, and can put up mildly annoying design choices for sake of a plot, I can absolutely recommend RDR2 even at full price, and on sale it's damn worth the price."

494,A Harmless Cat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HarmlessCat/,15,,1,297.7,March,"17,","1,106",5,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure game following the end of the 19th century, the end of the Wild West. The prequel follows the story of Dutch van der Linde's gang of outlaws, fiercely fighting to escape the inevitable faith in store for them, the new ""modern"" world. The second game presents us with a brand new protagonist, Arthur Morgan. Just like the original's protagonist John Marston, he is also an outlaw - Dutch van der Linde's most trusted associate. Honorable at heart, but at the same time stuck on a crossroad between what's right and what he believes is right. Taken on a massive rollercoaster ride through the ~50h campaign, our main protagonist evolves so much when his world views get taken apart.+ A massive open-world that feels like a living and breathing creature, filled with breathtaking views. From the gorgeous snowy mountains to the giant muddy streets of Saint Denis, all the way back west to the deserted town of Armadillo. The world ""talks"" and responds to you and your actions.+ The most detailed animal wildlife featured in any video game so far. Incredibly extensive list of different animal species that act just like they would in real life.+ Technologically astounding weather system, most probably the best weather system of any video game so far as well. You will ""feel"" when it's hot outside or when a massive storm approaches.+ Rich AI behaviour for all NPCs, they remember the player's actions! Whether he robs a store or helps someone in need, everything reflects on those around him. They also have daily routines - eating, sleeping, doing some work, etc. Rockstar nailed this part here compared to GTA V.+ Incredible story, full of twists and turns, pinnacle of what video games have to offer. Rockstar made us care so much for some characters on our screens. Thanks to incredibly mature writing and the phenomenal delivery of the actors who portrayed them, those characters feel so alive and real. As if they are right in front of us. The protagonist is the main focus, but the side cast in this game is also staggering and adds so much to the whole experience.+ Huge emphasis on realism in this game, even more than GTA IV or even the original RDR. The stamina, health, and deadeye cores drain over time, there is a need to eat and sleep in the game to replenish them. They drain quicker if the player is poisoned or has a sickness. Weapons also have to be picked up from the horse, we can't carry all of them on our back like in GTA. This is not to everyone's liking, but it's important to note that this game is artistic, and art is often not appreciated by all.+ Incredible cast of actors that poured their heart and soul into these characters, possibly the best ensemble in any video game.+ Great and extensive customization options - Arthur's hair and beard grow over time. There are loads of different clothing, beard and hairstyle options. Same applies to weapon and horse customization.+ Astonishing soundtrack that deserves to be heard at least once, by everyone. Absolutely vital part of the whole experience this game presents.I am almost at loss, but there are minor things that could have been better in this overall masterpiece.- A lot of emphasis on animal hunting and plant collecting. This applies to people who want to 100% the game, of course. If you plan to start this journey be warned, you are bound to get fed up by the amount of hunting and picking you have to do.- Gambler Challenge 8 (Soul Draining!!)- The missions are a lot slower and ""calm"" compared to GTA V, for example. This is necessary, as it goes hand in hand with the heavy narrative-driven experience. I am absolutely fine with this and can appreciate the decision. You need to be aware, however, if you are primarily a GTA fan or don't have patience to take this game slow, like it should be taken.- Not exactly a negative, but I will put it here anyway. The game requires QUITE a powerful computer in order to run smoothly on high settings.Red Dead Redemption 2 is true art. If the original was a masterpiece among video games, this one is a masterpiece in all of entertainment. Elegantly and masterfully crafted, even after 4 years, this is the best example of games being on par with movies and books. Featuring one of the vastest and most detailed open-worlds, arguably the best story in video game history and the most detailed wildlife in gaming. All this brought to life by an astonishing cast of talented actors makes RDR 2 a concrete !  Game of the decade and one of the best pieces of entertainment of all time. Thank you for reading this lengthy review. A small point to mention is that the score and everything mentioned concerns only RDR 2 and not its Online mode. I know how poorly Rockstar treated the online for this game, but I've never really cared for it so it does not bother me personally.For anyone interested in doing 100%, I have a great guide you can follow, which features optimal strategies and routes!"
495,isapicobella,https://steamcommunity.com/id/isapicobella/,21,,1,"1,223.7",August,"19,",73,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time and an absolute MUST play if you're into immersive and realistic gameplay mechanics, like to sit back and unwind, and are looking for something to invest hundreds of hours in while never truly running out of things to do and ways to entertain yourself. The world of RDR2 is enormous, and as someone who is very picky and values rewarding and intriguing exploration that does not hold your hand I can wholeheartedly confirm this game  it. All of this is accompanied by a fantastic protagonist and moving story which continues to blow me away with every playthrough. The acting, storytelling and character development is top-notch.While no game is perfect, and Red Dead Redemption 2 being no exception, I still have very little to complain about. However, the in-game bounty system would be my biggest issue. It's often illogical, unpredictable and annoyingly punishing. You'll have to keep up with it and adjust yourself, as the system itself makes little sense. My second complaint would be the tracking down and hunting of Legendary Animals. There is zero challenge involved, unlike the tracking down and hunting of regular animals in the game, and will get stale quickly. Lastly, with a game this big, you are bound to run into bugs and glitches sooner or later. I have dealt with my fair share of annoyances over the course of 3 playthroughs and while I've been lucky to not run into anything game breaking there have definitely been plenty of frustrating moments that required me to reload an earlier savegame more than once. I recommend saving regularly, preferably after every mission­—just in case.Moving on to the PC port of this game, the 3 playthroughs I mentioned were completed on console. I am currently in the middle of my 4th playthrough, but first PC playthrough. I was skeptical about how the game would perform with the numerous complaints going around but the game, to my surprise, has been running well so far and performance seems to be exactly as it should be with my hardware. I have experienced a couple of crashes only when booting up the game after having changed settings or when changing settings on the in-game title screen. The game, at least on my end, seems to be sensitive to that. Once it loads into Story Mode, however, all is well and I haven't run into any issues thus far.There has only been one limiting factor regarding my setup which I'd like to mention briefly for anyone in the same situation and that is my GPU's small amount of VRAM. As the owner of a GTX 1060 3GB, Ultra texture quality in this game is out of the question during regular gameplay as that can take up 4 to 6 GBs of VRAM. I use Vulkan, which is more VRAM hungry than DX12 but also performs twice as well as DX12 so I stick with it. As a result, however, I'm experiencing frequent and at times severe pop-in of textures in big cities, small towns and even out in the wilderness with Texture quality set to High. I'm talking about entire buildings, mountains and roads popping in. Switching to DX12 eliminates the issue, but the drop in performance is even worse. I have experimented with dropping down textures further to Medium quality on Vulkan and while doing so significantly lessens the pop-in, it's  not fully eliminated.Unfortunately, the downgrade from Ultra textures to anything below that has a  impact on the overall look of the game. High texture quality is jarring, and Medium simply looks awful. It  makes me favor the console version of the game in terms of graphics despite having the majority of my other settings set to High, which far exceeds what you'll see on any current gen console. It's still not enough to make up for it, in my opinion.In conclusion? I do not recommend the PC version of the game if you've got less than 4GB of VRAM, at the very ,  especially if you've already played through the game once. Anything below Ultra texture quality will not look good, regardless of the rest of your settings."

(around 3 months before this review)Keep in mind before you read that this is a 80 ish hour singleplayer experience.The bug I am referencing is one that will crash the game in a seemingly random amount of time, could be 5 minutes or maybe an hour and a half  when you are lucky. I have experienced the issue on 2 different PC's. One bone stock laptop and 2 fresh installs on a high end custom build. Pretty soon I'm sure it will happen on a new build and will update when I put it together. I am running top percentile hardware specs on my main and maintain my systems meticulously. If you check the steam forums or reddit and sort by recent with a search for crash you will see that the exact same issue is affecting a large amount of people. I am very experienced with troubleshooting anything PC related, I have not been able to fix it even after spending a ridiculous amount of time trying literally 2 dozen or so fixes in multiple combinations. I would say that about 90% of the time I am able to fix a bugged game or put a bandaid on it with a significantly lower amount of time spent troubleshooting.Hours instead of days. Rockstar knows about this issue and fixed it before. They even have a special launch parameter that helped mitigate the issue back when it first popped up. I really hope they will fix it again but its been almost 3 months and I'm sure they are getting a large amount of support tickets regarding this error. Rockstar, you have done such an amazing job on this game and I would like to be able to reccommend it to my friends switching to PC from consoles this year. For those of us that already own it, please don't become  developer. Your number one priority is profit right which is fine, I can tell you that if you become  developer you will lose good will along with some of that profit you love next time you release a game on PC. I would say you made me waste more of my time writing this negative review, but if I help even one person then im fine with it.I will also update the review if and when its fixed and show people instead why its in my top 5."

If you can't grind the 40 gold to unlock it (which from stranger missions you can at best farm a little over 1 gold per hour doing) within the first week, then you will only get 30 gold back instead of the full 40.If you can't buy the pass at all within the time the pass is up, then you lose the ability to cook multiple food at once, fast travelling from your wilderness camp, and increased ammo storage capacity. Just a little extra here is my calculations for how much gold I could make from stranger missions (since I was greedy for the exclusive halloween event I spent my 15 gold I earned from the start on that and don't have any of the roles that cost 15 gold unlocked)-To maximize gold gains, every 3 minutes in the mission the gold you earn goes up by .08, optimally stopping at 12 minutes for .32 (after 12 minutes it goes up by .04)-suppose you can complete a mission for the .32 gold every 15 minutes (3 minutes of downtime for easier numbers, 4 minutes is more realistic)-then you can get .32 gold 4 times an hour, for 1.28 gold/h-to get 40 gold for the pass is 31 hours and 15 minutes of nonstop grind(I believe bounty hunting is the same numbers for gold, except maybe the downtime will be lower between missions)Each roll costs 15 gold (bounty hunter now technically 25 since they lowered base price to 10 and the extended license is 15) The pass costs 40Bounty hunter, Naturalist, Trader Collector, and the Outlaw Pass is 100 goldSo if you go 31.25 hours/40 gold = 78%, then 78% * 100 gold = 78 hours of grind to unlock it all.Or you can spend $40 on 2 of the $20 gold packs for 55 gold bars each to unlock all the current online$9.99   25   gold$19.99 55   gold$49.99 150 gold"

The best and greatest game of all time ...after GTA: San Andres in my opinion!In my opinion Rockstar games made gaming industry so important and a serious besinus! I remember when everybody ( not only gamers ) were talking about GTA3 and I remember every second of when GTA VC came out and I was playing it in my friend's house and when GTA SA came out and I was playing on my own PC! About haters:I don't understand why only R* gets hate while other developers what ever they do people only worship them ...that's why I hate internet it's about only hype and fooling people! Some people didn't notice RDR2 is prequel so they hate! (so no need to cry about RDR1) n00bs that say game is not optimized and they want to play on ultra with their potato PCs! ( yes game has a few bugs and crashes but not like haters say! and graphics is way better than console version !) (( it's funny when same people were so happy about the witcher 3 and none of them talked about downgrades ... they had only 1 major success for The witcher 3 I don't expect Cyberpunk 2077 to be so good like TW3! ..and fallout using same crap engine and....kojima makes a crap walking simulator .... EA/ubisoft make same crap games every year and only thing they get is love lol ...fake hype good luck to their fans ...i'm not a hater for those games I like them! I just said some facts...))About luncher every online game these days has a it's own luncher why biggest developer can't have one? I noticed some of my friends have problem with it while i don't have any problems! I guess i'm lucky or they don't know how to work with it :/ what ever it is I promise it's better than EA's origin (real cancer)About Gameplay :RDR2 uses all mechanics from GTA and Bully and Max Payne and other Rockstar games so it feels so good for R* fans! in another word It's more realistic than GTA without getting boring! ( but if you don't try to learn it you will be tired even with your horse LOL ) My story: Played RDR1 on my friend's PS3 while I was waiting for GTAV PC version and when RDR2 announced I bought a PS4 PRO only for this game ...and when game announced on PC i sold that crap console and bought a RTX 2080 for RDR2 only!I enjoyed every minute of my time play so yeah i'm gonna recommended this game to every wise person on steam! about online: R* focus never was on Online a small part of one of their studios is working on online so be patient with online bugs! it's completely playable and enjoyable and more free DLCs on the way so I recommended online too!Unlike GTA Online RDO is fun even when you play solo! with friends you can make money faster and pass missions easier! It has no cheating problem ... I guess people that say it has cheating problem they never played CS:GO LEL! I saw only a few cheaters and it was easy to get rid of them I just joined another season!About Red Dead Online golds! evey game these days that has a online should have a way to make money and it's Golds for RDR2! if you want everything in game you should buy golds and buy in game... or you should have brain and know what to do in game to earn golds and money! ( so ez while you enjoy the game you earn golds and money! )At the moment I have 420hrs time play in online and I own everything in online with 160 golds and 10k money that didn't decided what to do with them yet xD! ( why same people are excited about new half life VR ..are not talking about Valve that sells expensive skins and they talk about RDO golds!... think again you can buy skins and roles with golds only by playing game and time play and not too much like Rainbowsix crap to earn a operator! I bought RDO season pass called outlaw pass 2 in game when i had less than 100hrs! without spending 1 cent! ) all you have to do is play the game! you spend time you do something and then go reset awards it gives you golds! don't forget daily challenges! do  only one of them at least! don't kill your streak! it's best way to get golds! for money collector is the best if you like to travel whole the map solo... if you like hunting solo or with friends go for Trader! bounty hunter is real challenge and it gives good golds too and moonshiner has good and cool missions!Graphics ...it's more like a unreal engine DEMO ... best textures in open world games...  animations physics tessellation global illumination and .... are the best in 2020!Story is a long and amazing journey characters are the best unlike some movies and games like last of us it doesn't need black or g@y/les$bian characters to get any attention! 11/10 waiting for GTA VI - MP4 - Bully 2- LA Norie 2- .....

This was the first RDR game I’ve played (and I’ve never played GTA so I think this is also my first Rockstar game).•	You can switch between first person and third person perspective whenever you want. First person helps with aiming guns and is very immersive while wandering around towns and talking to NPCs, whereas third person provides a better view of the environment while horse riding.•	The open world features a stunning environment to explore, with small towns and a big city full of people, surrounded by fields, trees, rivers and snowy mountains populated by lots of varied wildlife including deer, birds, rabbits, horses, bears, wolves, alligators and more.•	Side quests have their own mini-stories. There’s not many examples of the repetitive copy/pasted mission types that you usually find in open world games. Even bounty hunting missions where you can capture or kill outlaws and bring them back to a town sheriff for a reward, have some unique dialogue.•	As you’re riding around the map you’ll encounter other people who might ask for your help. Maybe their horse died and they need a ride back to town, or they’ve suffered a serious injury and need to be taken to a doctor, while other people are being attacked by dangerous animals. However, sometimes a cry for help will be luring you into an ambush.•	Story has great writing, high quality cinematic cutscenes, and excellent voice acting.•	Sometimes stories about criminals can make us root for them on some level, depending on the nature of their crimes. I didn’t feel that way about Arthur Morgan and his gang. I didn’t agree with most of their actions and I didn’t like most of the important characters. However, the second half of the story clearly showed the negative side of that lifestyle, which at least made the story interesting.•	The lengthy epilogue, which is focused on a couple of characters that I actually did like, has a much more positive tone, and was by far my favourite part of the story.•	Graphics still look fantastic compared to newer games. I had no problems with framerate, bugs or crashes.•	There’s lots of content. It took me 62 hours to complete the main story and most side quests.•	The weapon loadout system drives me crazy, and often made the combat less enjoyable than it could have been. You have 2 slots for pistols and 2 slots for rifles, shotguns, or a bow, however the game constantly unequips weapons from those last 2 slots, forcing you to re-equip them from your horse. I’m not sure exactly how it works, it seems to happen after cutscenes or when you return to camp, but I lost count of the number of times I was in the middle of a story mission and I suddenly realised all I’ve got is my pistols. And of course by that point I couldn’t return to my horse without restarting the mission.•	Sometimes even when I’d remembered to check my loadout, the game decided to change it anyway because I guess you’re supposed to use specific weapons for some missions. On more than one occasion I had to fight several enemies at long range, but the game took away my sniper rifle that I’d bought for exactly this purpose, forcing me to use a crappy lever action rifle with no zoom scope instead.Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t quite the masterpiece that its hyped up to be, but its still very good and I recommend playing it for the fantastic open world and cinematic story."
508,iRhuel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iRhuel/,255,26,0,294.1,March,"19,",565,34,1,"This review is specifically for the online component, there are plenty of reviews for the SP portion of the game.TL;DR - Red Dead Online is a tragic tale of a game that COULD have been great, but has been incrementally ruined on almost every level by a development strategy that prioritizes one and only one thing: getting players to spend more real world money. It's seen in every aspect of the game, and means it's generally not worth investing the time in to get to the worthwhile parts.---The game has several core problems, outlined below, but know that the game has 2 currencies - $RDO (ingame currency) and Gold (RMT currency, earnable ingame as well). Almost everything can be purchased with Gold, and some things can ONLY be purchased with Gold.Especially for new players. The only money making tool available to new players are daily challenges (which force you to do things you may or may not actually enjoy, like fishing, pvp, racing, photography, hunting, or visiting a random location with no other value), and stranger missions which generally involve going from A to B while fending off NPCs.All other moneymaking methods worth considering (bounty hunting, trading, moonshining, and rare item collecting) are locked behind Gold purchases.Almost all of the major moneymaking methods are time gatedAlmost every type of mission has some arbitrary time limit placed on it, which in the case of Strangers and BH, is completely independent of and always shorter than the hidden reward timer, requiring players to ""game the system"" in order to achieve the best reward.All of this points to a design philosophy of artificially extending playtime, seemingly without regard to players' time or enjoyment. It's as if Rockstar only measures engagement by time played, and the more they have of that, the more likely players will buy more Gold.The game has a plethora of bugs ranging from relatively minor to literally gamebreaking. Most of these have been in the game for quite a while (evidenced by the yr+ old reddit threads of people having the exact same issues), so it is clear that fixing them is not a priority for Rockstar. Here's a list of some off the top of my head:There are currently several hacks available for the game, ranging from teleportation of yourself and others, to autoaim, to invulnerability, to spawning invulnerable hostile NPCs, to instantly killing other PCs, to following other PCs between lobbies, to preventing other hackers from joining your lobby. I cannot tell you how many missions have been ruined because some hacker teleported me to a roof with everyone else in the lobby, across the map from where I'm supposed to turn in, making it impossible and causing the mission to fail.Some of these hackers are fairly benign, while others will target you to ruin your day for no reason at all. It's gotten to the point where some people in the discord communities have purchased hacks JUST to defend from these other hackers.At time of writing, Rockstar seemingly refuses to do anything about this other than a onetime ban wave some time ago. I assume this is because dealing with hacking doesn't directly make them any money.As mentioned earlier, Rockstar's development strategy is one focused on maximizing the time required to actually play the game, as evidence by a few features:The game is chock full of small taxes on your time. Every single action has an associated animation. This is initially immersive, but quickly becomes annoying when, for instance, it takes ~10 seconds to craft a single item and you're trying to craft dozens of items. The UI has more layers than a katyusha doll, and there's a transition animation between every single one of them. Most actually useful information is buried several layers deep.The Naturalist role has players sedating and collecting samples from animals in the RDO world and turning them over for a (pathetic) xp and $RDO reward. Unfortunately, this directly conflicts with the trader role which requires you to kill animals to fill your goods. The Naturalist NPC will refuse to interact with you for a set time after killing animals, making it impossible to sell your samples. What. Even.Despite being a multiplayer game, there are several impediments to playing together; most of them have to do with limiting moneymaking while in a party.There are currently NO train robberies, bank heists, or stage coach robberies. The game is generally missing banditry of any kind, in a game about cowboys and bandits.At this stage, it is fairly clear that RDO is in maintenance/money-wringing mode. The last two content updates (Naturalist at 25 Gold and Prestigious Bounty Hunter upgrade at another 15 Gold) were generally poorly received by the community for being either sparse or poorly thought out additions to the game. The majority of other updates have not been bug fixes or content refinements, but Gold-only cosmetics that are becoming increasingly cartoonish and immersion breaking, from straw beards to voodoo outfits to emotes and furry belt buckles. I'm honestly not sure who this was targeted at, but I have met no one yet who actually likes them.I would be (pleasantly) surprised if there was a major update with more and better content than the last drop... but it's looking unlikely.---The prevailing strategy seems to be to annoy players into buying Gold, but it ends up just annoying them into quitting the game. All in all, while there ARE enjoyable aspects to the game, they're buried under so much annoyance and bulls**t that I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone."

Everything seems so incredibly tedious to do. I've tried a few Rockstar games in the past, and they've never latched on either though, so.Final Verdict: It doesn't have enough of today's Quality of Life mechanics to keep me interested.

The blatant anti consumer and predatory practices, content drought, neglect, refusal to fix issues in the game since launch, but extreme willingness to remove any sense of fun, progression, or achievement has ruined the game.Cutting daily rewards in half, forcing daily challenge streak resets, removing the ability to get all of your currency back with the pass, adding in a ""new"" Bounty Hunter extension, which is 15 gold for the literal exact same bounties, but with slightly more money (which is still the least profitable role out of all 5 professions.

Missing out on this game for all of the other games on Steam is like visiting the Louvre, but not seeing the Mona Lisa. It's like going to Rome and never setting eyes on the Colosseum. Don't do that to yourself. Don't miss out on this absolute masterpiece of a game. Even if you didn't play the original Red Dead Redemption (or Red Dead Revolver), this game is worth your time and money. Since it's a prequel, there are no obvious spoilers for the earlier games, as everything that occurs in this installment sets up the original Red Dead's storyline. And if you *have* played the original Red Dead but not this installment, you really should! The best aspect of Red Dead Redemption 2, aside from the *phenomenal* storytelling, is the pace of gameplay. As the player, you can choose to speed through each story mission and still get a satisfactory ending. Or, you can spend hundreds of hours in the earliest chapters, hunting and fishing your way around the Old West frontier, growing a Grizzly Adams beard and collecting cigarette cards with pretty pictures on them. Want to drop a few hundred dollars in blackjack or poker, then get up and shoot your opponents in the head if you lose? This is the game for you.Red Dead Online has its fun moments as well, though if I'm being 100 percent honest, after a few hundred hours it can get a little repetitive and Rockstar hasn't added much to the online portion of the game in quite some time. However, the story mode alone is worth far more than the box price, so if you're looking for a great game, get this one."

524,Feuersturm,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048823683/,12,,1,57.7,September,"26,",70,0,1,"Steam wants to know if I would recommend this game to other players. Yes or no. I'll tell you what. I would recommend this interactive movie to others.RDR2 is on the surface so triple A, it's practically quadruple A. The first clue of this is when you look at the keyboard control layout and go ""AAAA!"". There's literally 50 binds you are supposed to assign, that will serve absolutely no purpose at any point. The game will keep you pressing different keys to do the same actions from start to finish, seemingly for no reason. In the very beginning you pick up items with one key, but pick up a hat with another. There is no rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes to simply perform an action you're supposed to press Enter, when a moment before it was another key or a mouse button. Is this a cunning plot to nudge players into using a gamepad instead, I don't know, but I wanted to use the trusty mouse+keyboard combo even if it meant having to deal with a convoluted to hell control scheme. Of course no one will ever need all the assigned keys and just having those fundamental things at hand works fine, and the mouse can be used to bypass things like having separate keys for turning pages left and right when browsing some weapon catalog... sheesh.But I have to admit - RDR2 is the most beautiful open world I've seen on the PC, possibly in any game for that matter. Even totally vanilla with no mods, the scenery is sometimes so gorgeous you will just have to admire the impeccable eye Rockstar has for crafting visuals. Once you reach Saint Denis for instance, the attention to detail, be it how every passerby is an individual or how the lighting and shadows are so true to reality, really captures your attention over and over again. The snowy visages are the best looking renditions of wintry landscapes I've ever seen as well and the way the snow glistens or how a lantern's glow bleeds over it is a sight to behold. Reminded me of Finland's winter nights for certain.Having this living, breathing wilderness around you is a thing of beauty, but Rockstar has chosen a very narrow path with their mission design. It works not unlike an interactive movie, where you play the action scenes. This was probably the biggest fault of the game. As soon as that marker is reached, the massive open world narrows to a footpath and the player is lead through the quest in a tight leash. The developers want you to experience the story the way they intended and the missions will allow practically no innovation or personal freedoms. Attempt to flank the enemy from the right? Mission failed, you abandoned the gang. Shoot a bad guy in the leg to stop him? Mission failed, target was killed. Grab a horse other than your own? Mission failed, you became wanted. Odd, considering you're a wanted man anyway. The scripted chase sequences have not changed. Often times Rockstar will even limit movement by disabling running and climbing during certain parts. Weapons will be disabled as well so that you don't dare do something stupid. It's an epic western on the outside, but you will find yourself reduced to a passive bystander all the time, holding down one key or tapping another to make the interactive cutscene keep playing forward. AAA title mission design, everybody. Most things that would work better under player control have been turned into essentially quicktime events, meaning you will play their fiddle and watch the events unfold. Having the option to switch weapons during firefights is the most of your own material you get to write in the story. Stray 50 feet from the designated path and Rockstar says no, screw you, you didn't play by our rules, back to previous checkpoint. Difficulty is no issue because the actual parts you need to play are beginner level shooting ranges and knowing how to move from point A to point B. Do I further need to explain why this game feels like a movie? I quit playing for 2-3 months because I didn't feel like it was worth watching, but came back with lesser expectations, knowing it was going to be a linear run with heavy emphasis on telling a story. And you know, as such, it works better.I think Rockstar has sacrificed a lot on the gameplay side to favor the hottest trend - a ""cinematic experience"". Some of the mechanics have suffered in the process. For example, why not allow the player to climb freely? Because it might look inappropriate? Why can't you run in the camp? That's not justified hero behavior? Why is the melee system an insensible few animation minigame when it could have been a fun way to showcase the abilities of the physics engine? Remember fights in GTA IV? That stuff was fun. In RDR2 you don't really want to beat anyone up because you end up watching the same motion captured stuntwork and then a falling ragdoll in the end. Why can't I lasso the bad guy during a chase when I'm right behind him? Why do bullets leave trails of smoke??It took some introspection but the game won me over ultimately. I think what matters most here is the visual presentation and insane amount of production value. The rest, well, maybe it's just meant to be experienced."
525,θανεσεστερεοφων,https://steamcommunity.com/id/deaathbysterreo/,16,,1,865.8,June,"29,",692,0,1,"Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how. If you played Red Dead Redemption, you know who survives and as a result who probably won't make it to the end of the game. Even during the slower parts, you're waiting for betrayals and injuries and other events you've only vaguely heard mention of before. You're waiting for characters to reveal their true selves, and watching as everything unravels is riveting and heartbreaking if you know what's to come.You can still enjoy the story in its own right without that background knowledge, though. Some of Red Dead Redemption 2's best moments have almost no relation to its predecessor. One mission takes you to a women's suffrage rally, and a painful side mission has you facing a woman whose husband you killed and life you ruined. The new characters are among the best, too; Sadie Adler is a personal favorite for reasons I won't spoil.Generally, Red Dead 2 tackles pertinent issues of the era with care. Rather than defining any of its characters by the bigotry they may experience, it allows them the room to be well-rounded individuals while still not ignoring that things like racism and sexism exist. One arc focuses squarely on a very serious issue, and here, the lack of real choice in the story's direction--and your resulting involvement in what transpires--will likely make you uncomfortable in a powerful way.While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marston's story, Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde gang--as a community, as an idea, and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too, but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal, very messy story supports a larger tale. Some frustrating systems and a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though it does take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, AND IT'S A WORLD THATIS HARD TO LEAVE WHEN IT'S DONE."

Buy it for console if you are playing RDO. If you are only going to play single player and never touch Multiplayer then it's a fantastic game.

Apparently modders and script kiddies have free reign over the RDO servers and will continually grief you until you either uninstall the game or throw your monitor out the window. In my first hour of RDO alone I ran into at least 1-3 modders per session that I joined, in the midst of the constant dynamite arrows randomly spawning on you from across the map and continually murdering me I was also teleported across the map to some location in the middle of the snow over and over again with one of these teleports occurring in the middle of a timed starter mission, well I failed the mission and it seemed to break the game because my camp was no longer anywhere to be found and unable to be moved. Once i finally loaded into a session where i could get to my camp I was greeted by another modder who proceeded to somehow lower the safety flag of my camp allowing him to keep griefing me in my own camp. In roughly the hour all of this happened I realized that somehow all of my $1000 in-game starter cash had randomly disappeared and i was left with nothing. Tried playing multiplayer for days after but continually ran into modders in every session with no end. With more research i found out that these ""hackers"" are breaching your game files through RDO to access private & personal info on your PC as well as modders and script kiddies easily deleting any cash you've earned in a game session. Your p2w gold will be safe but cash is free game.  Oh and Steam wont refund you for ""Multiplayer not working"" or any other reason if you have over two hours in the STORY mode regardless of all these known issues making the game completely unplayable as far as online at most times and basically taking half of the game away because its such a mess of problem trying to get anything done in RDO when you're being griefed and harrassed literally every 1-2 minutes.If you want to play multiplayer do yourself a favor and save money and time and just buy it for xbox or playstation because at least Rockstar somewhat gives a ♥♥♥♥ about their servers for those platforms, been playing on XBL and haven't ran into a single previously noted issue in any of my game sessions."

Your horse always spawns behind you and never catches up, so you'll just waste time running or waiting, unless you do the quick U-turn to call em.The roam quick missions are overrun with Chinese hackers. On the bright side, if the mission isn't about killing everyone, they won't understand what to do and you'll be able to win. If it is about killing, you're just going to waste 15 minutes getting snap-on headshotted over and over by the Chinese hackers. (Possibly Korean, i shut off public voice chat after all the Chinese ear raping that i received every time i was near them)All the real fun stuff is stuck behind a soft pay-wall. I.e. you need the premium currency ""gold bars"" to purchase roles for more money and missions. Most missions give somewhere between 0.08 to 0.2, and you'll need 15-25 per role unlock and etc. Or you can drop some real $ to get the gold bars, on a game that already costs 80CAD. Yeah, not happening.Levelling is silly slow, same with earning money to get anything done. Best way is the drop in missions, treasure maps, or stranger missions.

Can blow you up or teleport to you and shoot you. Literally only place you're safe is in an instanced game OR while talking to a shopkeeper. Spawning animals kills you even if you're in your camp with white flag raised. They are a true plague on what could be a fun game. They need to be region locked out because this is just pathetic. The exact same hacks as in GTA5 are happening here and they all use the local voice chat to spam chinese/korean (so far that's all i've heard clearly) with horribly broken english trying to troll you and provoke you.That all taken with the fact that changing sessions is buggy as hell... You're screwed. 7 Attempts to join my friend's instance recently, all failed. Game crashes maybe 1/2 the time i try to load into a new session from another. Hardware issue, maybe? My friends on better rigs report similar issues and therefore I doubt it is hardware.DO NOT BUY UNTIL HACKER ISSUE RESOLVED (was it ever resolved in GTA5, or did they just get bored?)25 May 2020I have shelfed the game. No point in doing virtually the same missions 50 times just to get up a level and do them again. I'll come back if China gets region locked or anti-cheat software that actually works gets added. I might come back if they add more content, though it's unclear because why bother if you'll just have to deal with the feeble-minded people that hack?"

It's just a shame that a few bugs, flawed honor system, flawed crime reporting, and shorter story than the first game prevent  from being perfect in spite of improvements in other areas.Does a AAA game that's a few years old really need a review? Ol' Il Pallino has his gripes and the founder of  needs more reviews, so may as well! The people who need a description of  are the same people who will never read this review. Set in 1899 (roughly twelve years before the first ) the story of the Van der Linde Gang starts with main character Arthur Morgan as the only lieutenant to Dutch Van der Linde who takes his gang through a misadventure through multiple (and mostly new) states in hopes of being able to pull off that one perfect heist so everyone in the gang can retire from their life of crime. Of course with the contents of the first , it's pretty obvious that the Van der Linde Gang never comes close to this accomplishment. About the only real unexpected surprises are the stranger missions and new features.Normally this category wouldn't apply to a AAA game, but it is unforgivable for a game with such a high budget to have floating rocks encountered (albeit infrequently) along with the occasional floating character.However,  does have a really cool graphical effect that sometimes occurs in shootouts, and usually whenever headshots are scored.The sounds, however, were faultless, and the game's soundtrack was perfect for the late 19'th. century with a score of original music. (One song was even performed by Willie Nelson.)The biggest positive to  is that the game is a dramatic improvement over the first game on account of the improvement to horses. Horses have four levels of bonding (five if level zero is included) and increases in levels unlocks horse skills and increases health (hit points) and stamina. Horses can have their looks customized, and new saddles can not only be purchased, but new saddles can also be crafted by trappers located on various parts of the map. (More on that in a minute.)  On the downside, horses can now be spooked by predators, and there's a chance that a horse (especially at a lower bonding level) will buck the player off and leave them to deal with a predator whom the player will hopefully have enough time to activate deadeye and put a bullet in it's head.Unlike the outfit ensembles in , the player has the ability to truly customize the outfits of the main character in the event they see something they'd like to mix and match with clothes that can be bought from tailors and general stores, along with clothes that can be unlocked at a trapper's shop by selling snakeskins, hides, pelts, and feathers to a trapper. The best saddles in the game can also be purchased at a trapper's shop.Deadeye has also been improved with one new level of deadeye allowing the player to shoot and remain in deadeye without painting any targets, which is particularly useful in the event the player is using a sniper rifle.The concept of animals needing to be taken down with a specific type of weapon makes hunting more interesting than the first game, and makes all the difference between good and perfect condition. (With enough overkill, an animal or snake carcass can drop from perfect to poor condition.) The game also introduces a bow and arrows, and specialty arrows can be crafted and used to kill game in one shot (if aimed perfectly) and keep it's condition perfect.Also on the issue of hunting, players do not have to skin what they killed for the most part. If the player wants to have more food (at the expense of sacrificing it's outer layer or feathers) for either themselves or their camp, an intact animal carcass can be stowed on a horse. (Animal carcasses can also be sold to butchers and trappers.) In fact, several decorations can be crafted at the camp require an entire carcass.Fishing has also been added to the game, and is a nice activity to engage in to help add variety to whenever the player doesn't wanna do story missions, go hunting, complete challenges, or whatever. Apart from being a food source, fish meat that's classified as  can be used with berries to make  that can either be used to attract perfect quality predators or sold for money. While it is advised to catch fish with the fishing rod that unlocks fairly early into the story, ol' Il Pallino caught his first fish by shooting at it. (Fish can also be ""caught"" by throwing dynamite into a body of water.)Weapons can now be customized in a plethora of ways. Some ways are useful in that they make weapons function better and degrade slower, but most are purely aesthetic.The biggest negative is that the honor system is flawed and does not recognize acts of self-defense. While honor can be built easily enough by greeting everyone in the game's biggest city (along with catching and returning fishes) it is annoying to have people shooting at you and lose honor because you killed them in retaliation. Plenty of members of the rival O'Driscoll Gang can be encountered in the town of Valentine, and a few times ol' Il Pallino managed to get a bounty for getting into a non-lethal fight with some of those jackwagons. Unlike other criminal organizations, people strangely care if they see the player looting an O'Driscoll and can expect a bounty just for making an encounter worth their while if said encounter is in the Valentine area.While not affecting honor directly, ol' Il Pallino saw some game to shoot at in the outskirts of Emerald Ranch, and a freakin' dog attacked him. Again, self-defense wasn't recognized when the dog instigated a kill or be killed situation.While complaining about aesthetics, it may be unfair to complain that Arthur Morgan's (plain) default hat always takes up an inventory slot on the horse, and cannot be changed. Hat accessories to Arthur's hat also count as an entirely different hat, but this is problematic since ol' Il Pallino's favorite hat is not Arthur's default hat!Rockstar Games has been making games featuring Blackjack since 2004, and *STILL* do not treat a ten to be any different from a face card in regards to hitting a blackjack. (This works out if it's the player who hit an ace and a ten, but the dealer can also get blackjack with a ten instead of a face card.)There are bugs that are game-breaking. Ol' Il Pallino has a friend who's experience was ruined by bugs, but the only game-breaking bug that was encountered personally was once getting accidentally stuck on a stagecoach and needed to quit just to get unstuck. (An inexcusable bug for so much as a tiny indie game.)Fun fact: If the player steals a wagon transporting oil, they can sell it for $50 instead of the usual $40.This review provided independently by .No compensation was provided.Email contact@dnbmedia.co for requests & promotions."

It should be taught as lesson on how an open world game should be made, from the massive natural landscape to the towns full of life and to the way the random encounters/side activities plays out, which are presented in such an organic way that it creates a strong immersive atmosphere in which you can easily lose yourself. It offers a great freedom of exploration that often makes you take a sudden turn to a distant landmark while riding to your objective, just to see the view from there, and it does not disappoint because needless to say this game is stunning to look at. As for the narrative of the game, there is really little else to say except that it's truly beautiful, exciting and heartbreaking in so many ways. Each character you meet is believable and behaves like a real person with their unique personalities, ambitions and flaws throughout the story. It is easily one of the best games of our generation."

576,LordGandhii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/,68,5,1,52.0,May,"11,",771,5,1,"While all critically acclaimed games are well-regarded for a reason, I never really understood why  was praised as much as it was. To me, it looked like your run-of-the-mill open world game. Once I realized I was stuck inside, I knew that I had to finally give this a game a shot. And I'm glad I did, because I was really missing out.I don't think it's a stretch to say that  is the best looking game on the market right now. While open world games, especially ones as densely packed as this one, are prone to having messy textures, everything in this game looks insanely crisp. It's a remarkable technical achievement, and I'd say it's one of the few games over the years that has left me genuinely awestruck in how beautiful it is. On top of this, RDR2's other big visual strength lies in its presentation. The story is compelling, but there's definitely some moments where the game doesn't have much going on, and while these parts should be boring, they're saved by the presentation. You really feel like you're in a western film, and the cinematic camera helps add to this feeling. A lot of games that lean on being realistic end up sacrificing style as a result, however Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the very rare examples of a game that still establishes its own style and identity while placing an emphasis on realism, and in that regard, makes the graphics arguably the game's biggest strength. But, thankfully, it isn't the only strength.While this game has a lot of things going for it, unfortunately what holds this game back is definitely the gameplay. The first big criticism, of course, are the controls. They're messy, confusing, and outright unresponsive at certain points. While I did somewhat adjust to the controls as I played more of the game, there were points where the controls were so unbelievably janky that killed my immersion. However, this jank doesn't really affect the gunplay, which is a good thing because there are way too many massive shootouts in this game. I found the game was at its best when you had the smaller, mundane tasks with the occasional combat segment and full-town shootouts on rare occasions. However, as the story progressed, every mission began to follow the same structure of having you mow down hordes on top of hordes of enemies. The epilogue helped dial the game back a little bit, but even then it was still prone to having these massive shootouts a tad bit too frequently for my liking. But worst of all, these issues as well as the game being open-world create the game's biggest flaw in my eyes: the massive dissonance between story and gameplay. Just from exploring the world a little bit, I had around $4000 by the time the story ended, and that was after getting all of the camp upgrades and spending tons of money on new outfits, horse items, and customizing every single one of my weapons. Therefore, the constant stream of ""WE NEED MONEY"" and the desperation the story tries to create gets undermined when the answer to all of the gang's problems lies in my pocket. It got annoying and eventually I lost interest in exploring the open world, which sucks because the world is full of so many cool things to see and do that I'm considering starting a second playthrough just to find more of them. But the game wants to be linear, and so the game's incredible open world and compelling story collide into each other head-on, and both get tarnished as a result. Is the gameplay outright bad? No, because it's still quite fun to play and has plenty going for it. However, it still conflicts with the rest of the game, and ultimately does a lot of harm to the overall package.But that's enough negativity. Like I've already said a few times now, the game's story is amazing. Arthur Morgan is one of gaming's best protagonists of all time, and how they handled him in this game was absolutely perfect. He has an incredible amount of depth and leaves plenty open to interpretation, and he grows right alongside the player. While John is also a great character in his own right, Arthur single-handedly bumps up the game a few notches for me. But he's not the only standout here, as characters like Dutch, Micah, and Charles all excel at their roles in the story as well. I do wish some of the characters like Javier, Mary-Beth, and Karen got more screentime, though, as they were enjoyable characters in their own right. Some people argue the main plot is too predictable, but I think the game actually used this in its favor. Especially when it came to a major reveal close to the game's end, I think the idea was to give you some extra motivation for the final mission, and fleshed out some of the characters in the process. I wasn't fond of one major segment of the game as it exemplified a lot of the game's main issues, but it ended quicker than I thought it would so it didn't bother me too much. Otherwise, it's a slow burn that hooks you more and more as it progresses, and the game's amazing presentation and world help keep you occupied during the moments that aren't as engaging. There's a lot more I could talk about here, but that's a discussion for another day. What's relevant here is that the story is amazing outside of some smaller issues, and is another high point for the game.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the music. Outside of some of the major vocal tracks (which are excellent), I wouldn't say most of them were particularly noteworthy, but they blended in with the game's world and tone perfectly. The sound design is also excellent here, as everything sounds incredibly crisp and satisfying. However, the real star of the show here is the voice acting. Roger Clark absolutely nails Arthur, and helps provide a subtle layer to the character that couldn't be conveyed through text. Another standout is Benjamin Byron Davis as Dutch, whose charisma really helped me understand how Dutch could be as revered of a figure as he was, and he manages to keep you hooked on every word that comes out of his mouth. The voice acting is some of the best in a very long time, if ever, and really helps sell the western feel of the game. And with the music and sound design blending together perfectly, the audio continues to prove the game's remarkably high quality.Gameplay/story disconnect aside, the open world is absolutely phenomenal. There's a ton of different side activities, like fishing, hunting, and playing poker to keep things interesting in ways that aren't just shootouts. There's also lots of cool little interactions in the world, and while you don't get rewarded much in terms of loot, the experience of seeing them is worth it alone. On top of a densely-packed single-player, there's also an online mode. I have no intentions of playing it, but it's like eating a pizza with too many toppings on it. Even if you ignore eating some of the toppings, the pizza's still delicious. You'll get a ton of value just from the game's world alone, and the engaging story and additional online mode merely serve as supplements for the incredible world. To conclude,  is a remarkable achievement in almost every way. The gameplay does hold it back, but it's the only blemish on an otherwise incredible game. If you have the time and money, then I have to insist that you give it a shot. - 10/10 - 5.5/10 - 10/10 - 9.5/10 - 10/10+ Amazing protagonist+ Beautiful graphics+ Engaging story+ Strong presentation+ Outstanding voice acting+ Detailed open world- Gameplay/story dissonance- Messy controls- Repetitive missions"

Breathtaking story, living open world with lots of things to explore, mysteries to unravel, activities to participate. If you're looking for an open-world shooter action with guns and cowboys, this game's singleplayer will leave you more than satisfied.The reason for my disappointment in this game is Rockstar's greedy attitude towards their online projects. I have somewhat about 500 hours in GTA V, most of wich comes from the GTA Online and after many years passed from PC release of the title, Rockstar haven't or didn't want to learn from their mistakes.Red Dead Online faces same issues as GTA Online did. Bugs and glitches aren't getting fixed, if they don't help you to get money. Rockstar selectively fixes bugs that allow for easier in-game income, while ignoring any gamebreaking glithes that may occure during the missions or open-world exploration.All they care about is making players buy in-game currency for real money. This would've been understandable if they tried to make more profit while fixing issues existing in the game, but they're not.Just wait for them to add horses with homing missiles and jet-engines up their arses. GTA Online: Wild West.edit: since they've made RDO stand-alone game, I change my review to positive.

However, for red dead redemption 2, I struggle to find any reason why it's NOT objectively the best single-player game of all time.Its story may not be an intricate plot but it's full of small, nuanced displays of emotions and life-like dialogue that pulls you into the world and sometimes forget that these are virtual characters. It's by far better than most Hollywood films, tv-series and dare I say should be up there with some of the great tv shows if it could be classified as one.The gameplay is equally amazing with npcs feeling life like amazing random events, amazing side quests, and a robust selection of guns, outfits, animals etc.I really struggle to find any negative to this game other than the slow start to the game. To me, it's necessary to have that slow start as good pacing but I can see how the slow start might put off people from the game entirely. Anybody that says red dead 2 is a bad game either never completed it or is just trying to be different and go against the wind.  Red dead 2 is a masterpiece. Even after 2 years since I finished it, I still remember its story vividly and without hesitation say its the best game I've played if someone asks me that question."

It turned out to be one of the worst PC gaming experiences in my life. When I launched the game the first time it installed Rockstar Social Club launcher and I had an accout already so I logged on and then the launcher said I had to switch to a very old account I completely forgot I had. The problem is that the old account is linked to an email I don't have anymore (it's a very old account) so I can't access it and the launcher won't let me start the game with the newer account which is atleast a few years old.Good job Rockstar! How can you mess up a launcher to the extent where it won't let you start the game you want to play and why do I have to use your stupid launcher when I buy it on Steam. I tried searching for a solution to this problem but couldn't find an answer anywhere. Until Rockstar either fix their stupid launcher or even better remove it completely and just let me play using Steam I guess I'll never buy a Rockstar game on PC again.Steam refunded me for the game so I want to give a big thumbs up to Steam. Thank you Steam!(I usually never write reviews but this experience was so bad I want to warn other people.)

This isn't one of those one-sentence reviews.I regret to say that I cannot recommend anyone to buy Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC in it's current state. This comes from a variety of reasons, which have led me to request a refund of the game.To start with, upon installing the game I encountered immediate crashing (before even getting to the main menu) every time I launched the game. After trying many forum fixed to no avail, I decided to contact Rockstar support. I spent a few days trying to get a hold of Rockstar support on their website (a confusing badly-made mess of a system), and eventually managed to get in-contact with someone.I spent around 7 hours talking to Rockstar support in a live chat attempting to fix the crashing, and all they did was (unnecessarily) walking me through steps in an attempt to fix the crashes. They had me update drivers, change launch options, run things as administrator, UNINSTALL MY ANTIVIRUS (I refused to do this), and numerous more pointless tasks.After getting to the point where I was about to give up and simply refund the game, I ended up managing to fix my issue by actually reading the files they were having me change. It took me less than 5 minutes to read, comprehend, and fix my issue. I find it ironic how I fixed the issue so quickly (once knowing what to look at) while the support were seemingly messing around with me. Not only did I spend an extended period of time with support talking to them in the live chat, I also had to actively wait well over a total of 4 hours on my computer to even be assigned to a support agent.The live chat system that Rockstar presents is one that demands the user stay at their computer awaiting assignment to a support member. If you don't reply to the support staffs message soon after they send it, the chat is closed and you are forced to wait another hour or more to open it again. For the first chat I opened, I had to wait a hour and a half before reaching a person.At this point I managed to actually get into the game, which at the time seemed like a blessing. I spent about a hour actively changing the graphics settings in the game to attempt to get a reasonable FPS in the game. No matter how low I set my graphics settings, my FPS struggled to get over 40; I was getting frustrated. Some may automatically assume that my hardware is not good enough for this game, but this is easily dis-proven by taking a quick look at the other games I actively play in my Steam library, most of which I have on near-maximum graphics settings.Overall, it's extremely hard for me to put a negative review on this game, and especially to request a refund for it. The original Red Dead Redemption remains one of my favorite games of all time, and I still go back to play through it once in a while. I really wish I could play this game, but the state that it's in and Rockstar support have made it un-playable for me. If after reading this you do still decide to purchase Red Dead Redemption 2, I sincerely hope you have a better experience with it than me."

Aside the fact it took me a year to get the game working on my PC after a complete rebuild, and Rock Star's crappy REQUIRED third-party system, I did manage to get it to work.But I am continuing to give this a negative review.I pumped about 50 hours into the game.  I log back in one night (tonight) to play some games and about 30+ hours of gaemplay vanished.  Just all of it is gone, and I don't have it in me to continue playing this game or trying anymore.This is just a terrible PC port and I don't recommend it on PC.Old review:Bought this game maybe 6 months ago but had issues with Social Club, so I refunded it.Tried again last night, same thing.I keep having problems with Steam connecting to Rockstar's Social Club. >Buy game>Download game>Launch>Sorry, you need to download Social Club>k, I download it>You need to make an account with Social Club>k, I make an account>Sorry, but that email address is linked to a different Steam account>huh?  k, lemme check brb>nope, it's the same email>Re launch>Sorry, but that email address is linked to a different Steam account>*randomly gets emails from Rockstar in all Russian*I am in the middle of my second refund.  I have never played this game and I really want to, but it literally will not let me.  That said, I have no choice but to down vote this as a Steam game.  You can likely just buy it direvtly through Social Club - that said, just buy it and play directly through Rockstar's system."

However...After an entire week of negotiating the borderline useless Rockstar support, the damn game only launches after making an completely new windows account. Meaning I have to log in to windows as a separate user every time I want to play. Apparently that was a satisfactory outcome for Rockstar. The sheer number of hoops I've had to jump through trying to reset profiles, doing system scans, editing registry permissions and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, coupled with a complete lack of error code details on Rockstar's behalf. It just boggles the mind.I cannot in good conscience recommend this, simply because of the terrible, broken and frankly (for single player) unnecessary launcher and Rockstar's cavalier and negligent attitude towards improving or fixing it."

Rockstar is not showing the required attention to the problem of cheating in both rdr2 and gta5. Both games are time and time again rendered unplayable by its toxic and childish community of wannabe hackers. At this point Rockstar should put a disclaimer at the start of their games stating that ruining the fun for other players wouldn't make a person ""hacker"".

Glad other users on here have seen this, since pro journos can't be trusted.Gameplay:First person really doesn't work well. Difficulty is laughable, even playing in first person with all aim assist turned on. Enemies take multiple hits, and you are a tank. There's lots of standing in the open and shooting at each other from 10 feet away, out of cover, shaving off health with multiple shots. Basically gives everything a very low energy, low pressure feeling even with all assists turned off, so that you feel no excitement. The whole experience just feels like a chore. Free aim is terribly clunky, and hit detection is something they still haven't got the hang of without lock on turned on. I'm a very mediocre gamer, and this was one of the easiest game I've played, and not in a good way. Enemies are identical in behavior and armament, and don't behave organically enough to justify the sameness on the grounds of ""realism"". Last but not least, a lot of boring riding through the same forested landscape. Its wants to be the Witcher but lacks the beauty, variety, and depth of the countryside. It also can't get off its own shaft, and constantly make you ride the same area and pause so the developers can jerk themselves and make you look at their masterpiece. Never though, did I have organic moment like in other games where I stopped to admire.Story:Bad. But I have a much higher bar for stories than most people, while my gameplay bar is about average. Still if you like HBO stuff more than say FOX or NBC, the story will disappoint. It's the same tragic tale as last time, with very inconsistently written characters. The dialogue is great in some cases, but the overall story is very lacking. The biggest issue is the attempt to paint Arthur as the good guy, vs just a likeable bad guy.When you murder 700 law abiding government officials, its hard to portray the guy as a classic hero, but try they do. To make it doable, the employ the laziest method ever, which is to make everyone else racist, and Arthur and his gang of barely literate horse thieves and prostitute feminists and equality centric. Why is it okay that Arthur is killing trains full of 18 year US Army personal just doing a job? Oh, because they are, every one of them racists, so now Arthur the murdering thieve is a nice guy do-gooder. Dumb + lazy writing. Makes me wish for Niko again. Didn't pretend to be a good guy any more than Scarface, so when he thinned out the ranks of the NYPD, it still made sense.Value for money:Low. They claim like 200 hours in bonus activity, but this isn't the case. You end the game with tons of money, with nothing in the game world to spend it on. Even if you did have something worth buying, you wouldn't be able to make it. All side activities pay very poorly. Robbing a store (banks are not robbable???) pays 30$, meanwhile the bounty you'll rack up escaping will be a minimum of 400$ bounty if you want to have any fun, and you can lose thousands if you die. Bounties pay nothing, like 80$ on average, and hunting fishing is boring (somehow the only viable option is with a bow, and you there are so many animals you can just ride up to them and dead eye, making it pointless to go looking) and pays very little. Stick ups pay 50 cents, and always go the same way. Poker games are limited to 5$, also making them pointless. I think the reason the post game feels so dead is to force people into online."

635,B,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bsc01451m5423423brhkcr/,16,,0,823.4,February,"21,",160,0,1,"For starters, if you like open world games, beautiful scenery to take in, character customization (not the best, but it suffices), and have a soft spot for historic games, this might be the game for you. The attention to detail is fairly impressive, to give some examples, you get bloodied and dirtied on specific parts depending on what you did, such as on the hands after skinning an animal, on the shoulders if you carry a skinned beast, mud on the side you fell from your horse and so on, not only that, people on the street comment and have different treatment towards you about it, the singleplayer character's hair and beard grow over time, shop owners' comments change depending how recently you visited them and more, so, among other things, praise on this aspect is well deserved. The combat is ok, featuring decent gunplay, wall/object cover, gruesome melee that makes you feel the impact of hitting your enemies, different animations depending which weapon you have on your hand when grabbing someone, having to click again when using repeating guns, a lasso and other tools that are very fun to use on animals and people, all make it overall enjoyable, the only con, besides the ones in the following section, though i'm probably biased thanks to playing some shooters where every shot is lethal, is that some enemies take too many shots to die if you don't aim for the head/neck, granted it's not as bad as some other stuff out there. The sounds of the game are overall pretty good, it's nice to just stop and hear the scenery around you whether you're in a farm, a city or the wilds, the animals, gun sounds are alright too. The soundtrack puts a nice touch, it heightens every moment well, whether it's a relaxing or intense one, though it's not something i plan on stopping to listen to when not playing. Overall the ambience is nice and the game provides good decent immersion.Now that i'm done talking about the things i think are nice, i'm gonna talk about its shortcomings related mainly to multiplayer, which i play more than singleplayer, and is the main reason i'm on this game for.The bugs/glitches are the ultimate reason that led me to giving this game a negative review, and quite honestly, given the relatively extense list of positives, even if you expect it as a standard of an AAA title, they have to really be bad to outweigh the positives, and it turns out to me that they are. For the price this game has, the ammount of issues on this aspect is subpar to what it should have been, actually, just saying that feels like an understatement, i normally don't write game reviews, but i reached a level of frustration that made me want to use the time i normally would be in-game and write this. Now onto examples:- The absolutely most aggravating issue, is the fact that sometimes you get stuck on infinite loading screens. This can happen on the most unfortunate times - just before i was writing this review i had finished doing a mission that took around 20 minutes, the cutscene ends, and a load starts, i cross my fingers per usual, because every loading screen feels like a russian roulette where  out of 6 rounds are loaded, after it took too long, leading me to wait over 5 minutes, i realized, ""yep it's bugged again"" and had to press Alt + F4, effectivelly nullifying all my effort and time i spent doing that job in the game. Thanks to other bugs i'll mention below, you're forced to go through loading screens more which only adds up to the problem.- Randomly losing connection to the game servers, it doesn't matter how good your internet is, you will still get disconnected at some point from the game, it may be now, it may be in 2 hours or more, it can also happen so much you give up on playing that day, it'll happen, and just like the previously mentioned bug, it may happen on unfortunate times where you're in the middle of something, which can upset you. Now imagine you're in the middle of a mission, the game disconnects you, taking back to the menu. You try to join a new session, then you have to load...and load, and you get the infinite loading glitch, thus making you waste even more time and have to alt f4 again. It happened to me, my friends and a bunch of other people i'm sure.- Sometimes your horse, which you spend more time on than on foot, and is the main transportation method on the game, straight up gets stuck, you hop on it and it doesn't move, sometimes you can try things and it'll work to restore it, specially getting a friend on the horse, sometimes it doesn't and you're left there on foot, sometimes you have to restart the session... and have to  the game again, do you see where i'm going? Maybe have to reboot the game again if you get the infinite load bug.- In the game there is a role called trader, which is a job that utilizes a table on your camp to start its missions and retrieve animals that are used as resources for it, so here i went to hunt good quality animals to bring to my camp, i set my path back to camp after being done, reach its location, and the camp is not there, even if the icon on the map tells me it is. This makes me unable to deliver the resources bogging me down. I open the camp menu and try to relocate the camp, it doesn't work, so this made all the hunting i did be pointless, because the only way to fix it, is swapping session again. Not in the mood to do it, i gave away the animals to another player hunting near me and decided to do missions from another job. I get there, interact with a door to get in (most places don't need loading screens to get in btw, but this one does) and...- Sometimes interacting with things straight up doesn't work, continuing from above i couldn't get in the estabilishment to conduct a completely different activity from what i was doing because it was bugged. Long story short, i had to reset the game post infinite load bug after trying new session because i couldn't do both of the options i felt like at the time.So yeah, those are the main bugs i remember on top of my head because they're the most aggravating ones, the game seems to be worse on peak hours also, which is the only time some people have to play. Some days are better than others. I've experienced other bugs and if this doesn't convince you this will be a frustrating experience, i don't know what will. My other complaint is that the online economy is pretty grindy, so if you don't have a lot of time to play, expect the rewards and wealthy part of the game to come in slow, granted it's worse in the beginning than when you have more hours put in and have more resources.Saw some people complain about poor optimization but it runs mostly smoothly FPS wise for me.Sometimes the game crashes, but it's rare on my end.I still play the game despite everything, call me crazy, but the good part of the game is still there but it's mostly because there's no other game i feel like playing right now. My advice is for you to  don't buy the game just yet, me and i'm sure a lot of the player base are looking forward for this stuff being fixed, in some time it'll be cheaper and hopefully with less bugs. If the bugs never get dealt with i'll probably ditch this game.Hopefully this review helped you, cheers :)"

Absolutely amazing work and effort put in by Rockstar Games.The game's graphics are absolutely spectacular, especially when you finish the first chapter of the game. The lighting and fog effects are unbelievably good. The god ray effects in forests are realistic. Nighttime lighting is realistic as the moonlight spreads over the whole area instead of being a light in the sky. Character clothes have great attention to detail, along with the fur on animals, and mud effects in towns.The gameplay can be a bit of a slow burn at the start, but once the first chapter is done, the gameplay becomes less restricting, and continues to do so as you progress forward. The gameplay is also very realistic as you have to maintain your guns to keep them working effectively (they can jam if you don't) and you also have to bathe regularly to keep yourself clean, eat regularly to keep your weight in check and also yo You also have to feed your horse regularly so they don't starve. All this may be confusing at first, and may be tedious to some, but you'll figure it out once you start playing the game.The story is possibly one of the best ones in videogames. rest assured, if you pay attention to the story, you will enjoy the game to its fullest. Coming to the other thing, side missions are often humorous and enjoyable, and are usually as good as the main story. Make sure to do side quests around the same pace as the main missionsI could go on and on but I'll just let you experience the rest. It is a 10/10 game made by the legendary company Rockstar Games, so rest assured, it's worth every single penny."

I play in bursts and love what the game is.I don't recommend the game however because of what the profoundly incompetent nimrods at Rockstar have done with it. The online content is not only now dead but was always atrocious and plagued by cheaters, not something new to Rockstar online games but really seems to be bad in this one. It also will not be receiving any further content updates so Rockstar can focus on GTA6 (which if we're honest is the only franchise they actually care about anymore). The final nail in the coffin for me was the announcement of no planned DLC. The BEST thing about the original game for me was Undead Nightmare. Period.

The phenomenal story, well written characters, and incredibly talented voice actors makes me wonder if this might be the greatest game ever made. Other fantastic open-world games like AC Origins and TW3 felt incredibly vibrant, and RDR2 easily stands tall amongst those giants with its incredible sights and sounds. But what really sets RDR2 apart from those 2 is the level of effort put into developing the NPCs in this game. You just don't see random NPCs with unique conversations amongst themselves in other games, and with such diverse appearances, emotes, personalities, and mood states at that. Hiring over 1000 voice actors to voice NPCs that aren't even a part of side-missions? Truly incredible.I challenge anyone to ever feel bored playing RDR2. And yes, there're some game breaking bugs every now and then, but everything else is so phenomenal, that you just don't even care.RDR2 is truly a landmark in video games as an art form."
657,Meatbug,https://steamcommunity.com/id/meat_bug/,17,1,1,330.3,November,"26,",944,0,1,"In Red Dead Redemption 2 you're playing Arthur Morgen, a member of a posse of outlaws, lead by Dutch van der Linde, who are on the run from federal agents due to a heist that went awry.While on the run and relocating their camp regularly, you're trying to make money by doing jobs that aren't necessarily legal all the time, everytime with a promise that the next big job will be the last.Over the course of the game, Arthur is also faced with his own mortality, making him question the things he does and their consequences and together with things going wrong and questioning the motives and integrity of Dutch, tensions rise and a conflict seems inevitable.The game is played in third-person, in a huge open world that you can traverse by foot or horseback (there are also carriages you can pay).Visually the game is gorgeous, from the snowy mountains to the prairie lands and dark and swampy regions, it's a feast to look at.But not just the visual presentation is great, there are some tracks from the soundtrack that are absolutely fantastic and their implementation in the scenes of the game sent shivers down my spine.Besides looking and sounding good, the gameplay is fine as well in my opinion. There's nothing groundbreaking new here though. You aim, you shoot, take cover and reload. Sometimes movement might feel a little wonky and sluggish, but there's nothing really standing in the way of enjoying things.The open world offers a lot of quests and activities you can do, animals to hunt, collectibles to find so you shouldn't get bored too easily.Now, while mentioned ""boredom"", the pacing of the game is quite deliberate, if not slow at times. Especially in the beginning. Personally, i think it fits the game and helps getting to know the characters, the situation everyone is in and personally, i love stories in games. So be aware, that you might not be able to explore and roam free as much as you want right away.I did played the multiplayer part a bit, though it feels more limited, empty and more repetitive than the singleplayer.Though if you have friends to play with, i guess it should offer some fun as well.I haven't encountered a lot of toxic players in my playtime, i really just got into a fight 2 or 3 times and that never really lasted too long and was more or less a minor inconvenience, though i'm not sure if this might have changed over time.Overall i think the game is a very good singleplayer, wild west game, with an online part that might hook you as well, depending how much you can bear repetitive tasks and if you have friends to play with as well, which probably increases the experience a lot."

Allow me to elaborate.They pushed the same gameplay model as GTAV (Get money, buy things and get more money). This would be fine except they force you to purchase useless ♥♥♥♥ and lock professions behind a 10-15 gold transaction. This is not to mention everything is insanely overpriced which I assume is an attempt to pad the sparse gameplay. They also made it so the ""survival"" mechanics from singleplayer are present in the multiplayer portion. An asinine decision however it is what it is. All of this would be forgiveable if not for a handful of the combat mechanics. First of all, if you play on controller, even on PC, the aim assist is insane. On mouse and keyboard you are at a massive disadvantage unless it is a free aim lobby. Secondly there is a new pseudo passive mode called ""Defensive mode"". This makes it harder for other players to attack you, however it still allows you to attack people who are not in that mode extremely easily. It also disables any form of aim assist and ability to tackle when fighting someone in defensive mode. All in all the story is great, unforgiving at times, but great. It is worth the buy if that is what you are looking for. The multiplayer is the single worst experience that I have had in a very long time. If i could give it negative stars I would run out of negative numbers.Edit as of 11/29/2020:Second verse same as the first, the story is great and the multiplayer is ass.

665,King Bradley,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/,11,1,1,129.3,November,"30,",418,0,1,"RDR2 was really something new for me. If you have never played RDR1 like I didn't when you first start the game, you will probably wonder why the pace is so slow, and what's the hype all about, but if you are patient, and stick with the journey, you will see that this is truly a wonderful game, well worth your time and my top 2 favorite games of all time.Story is this game starts a bit slow and that was off-putting for quite some time until I understood that this game is like a long book. It takes some time for you to get to know characters, so for a long time nothing actually happens, but when it starts happening, you will actually care way more if something good or bad happens, because you will know characters very well. You play as Arthur Morgan, outlaw who is part of the gang led by Dutch Van Der Linde, charismatic leader, loved by everyone. Arthur is like a son to Dutch, he was adopted by the gang when he was only the kid, and he has been living this gang life since then. There are around 20 people in the gang. So what is story about? Gang has been killing, robbing for ages, and they are wanted men for a long time, however this time, they screwed up some job in Blackwater, and Pinkertons, federal agency almost captured them and they had to escape Blackwater and hide somewhere. Traveling through harsh snowy mountains, hopefully nobody will find them there, gang needs to settle down and start getting money and food so they survive these harsh times. So for quite such time, nothing is really happening, and you are just killing, robbing, hunting, trying to help the gang, trying to survive. It's like real life, well real life of the outlaw. Eventually things start getting intense. Without spoiling much anymore, I will just say that the story is amazing, possibly the best written story out there imo, it's a pretty real and emotional story that features wonderful journey and great characters, that you will really care about, and that's what makes this game so great, this wonderful journey. Gameplay in this game is complex enough. Combat is simple, you just shoot folks, and most of the time it's a pretty easy game. You just hide behind rocks, walls, trees and shoot, if you get shot you can just drink some medicine that you probably have a lot, because money is easily made in this game. First of all you don't even need to rob people outside of main story, because you will earn more than enough money just playing missions. I was being good guy, bad with boys, pure sweetheart on my own, not breaking any laws and I always had a lot of money. I would go to store and buy everything I need, food, drinks, medicine, ammo, and all that is so cheap, that you don't have to worry about side looting. One important technique to mention, and the only combat ability in this game it's Dead Eye, it's basically like something you have seen in Max Payne games, time slows down and and you can shoot people easily, only difference is that Arthur is not as nearly agile as the Max. This Dead Eye has it's own meter, so you gotta fill it up when it depletes, but it also increases on it's own when you kill people. So all in all, combat is really simple and most of the time you won't have any issues beating the tasks. Aside from combat important thing to mention is that Arthur is traveling on his horse, and you can change horse any time, by buying new horse, or taming wild one, however in first missions you get some new horse and I stayed loyal to him, even though they were better horses. Traveling through lands on your horse is extremly relaxing, music is so chill, and the world is beautiful. You can hunt or go fishing if you like these things and there are legendary animals to get caught, but these things didn't really pick my interest. You can rob anyone you want, however there is honor meter and if you do bad things it will go down and this will affect the personallity, he won't be caring person (for an outlaw at least) if you are doing bad things. It's kinda like paragon and renegade meters  in Mass Effect series. It also affects store prices and most importantly, the story. What's unique about Red Dead games is that there are random encounters in the world, you will be going through world, and white dot on the map will start blinking or you will hear voices and bunch of random things will happen. Strangers will ask for your help, for example snake bit them, and you can help them, or someone is taking bounty on their horse, and by bounty  I mean wanted people and you can help them, or not, if you do help some strangers your honor will increase a bit, but however sometimes helping them is not a good thing. I am not really gonna go into details how your honor meter increases, cause everything is explained in details in the game, but pretty much helping random strangers, saying hello to random strangers, helping gang in the camp by doing daily chores are some of the things that will increase that meter. Aside from random encounters, there are also stranger missions, and these are missions that will appear on the map when you are walking close to them. These are basically side quests in this game, and most of the time these side quests are divided into few parts. Once you are done with one part, next part will appear after some time. In that situation if you want to continue quests, just set up camp in the wilds, and sleep till the mission shows up, or you can continue doing something else and mission will pop up eventually. There are also few optional missions from the gang members. Aside from that bounty hunts are worth mentioning, you can go to local sheriff and start your bounty quests, and money will be paid to you once you bring back target dead or alive, based on your request. There are also a bunch of side activites in this game, like poker, robbing stagecoaches, houses, etc. I mentioned before that you can make a camp in the wild, and basically whenever you are not in the city or in the gang camp, you can set up the camp, and you can sleep, cook food there or fast travel (Money Lending mission, after you acquire ledger, you can purchase that ability). Overall pretty good gameplay.Atmosphere is amazing, like I already mentioned. It's so relaxing, so chill, it's one of the most relaxing games I've ever played, if not the most relaxing one. Performance wise this game ran pretty good on my configuration, I was getting 60 fps most of the time on high-ultra settings at 1080p. Fps does goes down in one city, but if you lower lightings it will definitelly help a lot. It's not the best optimized game out there, but it worked pretty well for myself. Game is around 70-80 hours long, if you do most of side quests in the game, minus hunting and fishing, but it's an open world game, so there is no limit, as you know. I didn't try online at all, because I wasn't really interested in that, so I can't say anything on that topic. - Amazing beautiful open world, with so many things happening, like random encounters- Writting and the story are one of the best I've ever seen, if not the best- Journey is wonderful- Beautiful atmosphere, maybe the most relaxing game I've ever played- Gameplay is pretty good- Performance wise it's not the best optimized game out there Wonderful relaxing game with beautiful world, story and the characters. I would recommend this game even at full price, it's my top 2 favorite games of all time along with Dark Souls, and in my opinion the masterpiece, because I don't see any flaws in this game, it's totally complete game and the story is so detailed."

The game itself feels weird. The game feels like it is trying to reimagine GTA IV in the end of the wild west era. But at the same time trying to make the game as cinematic as possible like GTA V. But this creates a slight clash of ideoligies. The missions are now much easier and seem to have no ""direct but suboptimal results vs smart with better results"" options. The game seems to want to feel like its dynamic and reacting to you, but it can only happen in the less scripted open world, and there it feels amazing.Original: Game does not launch.When trying to boot straight from exe tells me that the soucial club does not have rights for this product.When starting from steam, crashes when trying to launch, unexpected error.Worth buying on a maybe when the rockstar launcher has been completly removed from the launch process.Not worth my time and money if it doesnt even tell me whats wrong and it isnt fixed 2 months after launch."

I absolutely loved its campaign it's a prequel to previous game of franchise which is very well executed, the story felt very cinematic and every bit of it was solid, i thoroughly enjoyed it. Open World is very immersive and it feels hand-crafted as you explore and encounter its elements and there are certain activities to do like hunting, fishing etc. i'd also like to acknowledge the great soundtracks this game offers, songs like American Venom, that's the way it is are some of my favourites, overall the music is punched and gutted right through its moments and you'll feel it. Combat is highly enjoyable and it feels great through-ought the game."

I have even done 3 fresh and clean installs of the steam game and the Rockstar launcher and still not working. I asked Steam to refund my money and I get a canned email from them saying since I was able to play the game more than 2 hours with no issues they will not issue a refund.

I did not play before in the first part, and as I understand it, this is a prequel, so PC players who did not play the original now even won.The game takes place in North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where we play as Arthur Morgan, a man of new progressive views, stuck in a gang of thieves, killers and liars. On his apth the protagonist saw a lot of blood, participated in more than a dozen skirmishes. The story of how blindly following friends leave their lives, their future for the short-sighted and selfish plans of the leader of the detachment Van der Linde.The game evokes different feelings, but most of all it makes you empathize with the main character, because he is true to his word, his friends, but at the same time wants a better life for his loved ones. At the same time, he is forced to go to the ""last"" deal in order to raise money and realize the so-called American dream.Graphically, this is a new word in the gaming industry. The game squeezes all the juices from any PC configuration. Here you have support for 4K with HDR, support for ultrawide monitors and an unlimited number of FPS, just requires the hardware, which is still under development.Fascinating landscapes, changing the time of day, weather and seasons, simply fascinate and force you to take screenshots with incredible beauty every now and then.For all this you have to pay a lot, you need to find a balance between a beautiful picture, but at the same time not to lose in the number of frames. This game is very voracious.The music in this game deserves special praise. Dramatic notes during intense scenes are replaced by cheerful and perky melodies in bars and taverns.The voice acting is beyond praise, it seems that the bandits you draw in your head look exactly like that, and the voice actors have done their best.This is not just GTA V in the wild west, there are much more activities, customization and just a huge number of random encounters that will lead to something unexpected.For the first time, fishing in the game looks like I want to do it. Hunting animals is made not just as a source of food, but also as an art in finding legendary animals from which legendary artifacts can be obtained.A huge variety of missions: from robberies to building your house, from fishing with friends to creating the first iron man. Separate praise is the best “drunken” mission in the bar with Leni - tons of ​​humor are guaranteed.I want to say that this is another masterpiece in the Rockstar piggy bank, but this is a masterpiece in the whole gaming industry, even the entire entertainment industry. A deep and sad story with its sparks of hope for a better life ...- A heartbreaking story, lasting more than 150 hours (including the search for all animals)- Fascinating secondary quests with unusual development of further events- A new word in visual and graphic terms (and this is without raytracing)- Memorable music and voices of the main characters- A wide variety of activities (from playing dominoes to hunting animals)- Dull multiplayer with a lot of hackers spoiling the impression of the gameЛегендарная игра от легендарных разработчиков наконец-то заглянула на ПК в ее самом совершенном виде. Не играл я до этого в первую часть и так понимаю, что это приквел, так что ПК игроки, не игравшие в оригинал теперь даже выиграли.Действия игры разворачиваются в Северной Америке конца 19 - начала 20 века, где мы играем за Артура Моргана, человека новых прогрессивных взглядов, застрявшего в банде воров, убийц и лжецов. На своем пути главный герой повидал немало крови, поучаствовал не в одном десятке перепалок. История о том, как слепо следующие друзья оставляют свои жизни, свое будущее за недальновидные и корыстные планы главаря отряда Ван Дер Линда.Игра вызывает разные чувства, но больше всего она заставляет сопереживать главному герою, ведь он верен своему слову, своим друзьям, но в то же время хочет лучшей жизни для своих близких. При этом вынужден отправляться на ""последнее"" дело, дабы собрать денег и осуществить так называемую американскую мечту.Графически - это новое слово в игровой индустрии. Игра выжимает все соки из любой конфигурации ПК. Здесь тебе и поддержка 4к с HDR, поддержка ultrawide мониторов и неограниченное число FPS, только подавай железо, которое находится еще в разработке. Завораживающие пейзажи, смена времени суток, погоды и сезонов, просто завораживают и заставляют то и дело снимать скриншоты с невероятной красотой.За все это приходится платить очень дорого, необходимо найти баланс между красивой картинкой, но при этом не потерять в количестве кадров. Эта игра очень прожорлива.Музыка в этой игре заслуживает отдельной похвалы. Драматические ноты во время напряженных сцен сменяются веселыми и задорными мелодиями в барах и кабаках.Озвучка выше всяких похвал, кажется что именно так и выглядят бандиты, которых ты рисуешь себе в голове, а актеры озвучки постарались на славу.Это не просто GTA V в диком западе, здесь гораздо больше активностей, кастомизации и просто огромное количество случайных встреч, которые приведут к чему-то неожиданному.Впервые рыбалка в игре выглядит так, что хочется этим заниматься. Охота на животных сделана не просто как источник пищи, а так же как искусство в поиске легендарных животных из которых можно получить легендарные артефакты.Громаднейшее разнообразие миссий: от ограблений до постройки своего дома, от ловли рыбы с друзьями до создания первого железного человека. Отдельной похвалы стоит самая лучшая ""пьяная"" миссия в баре с Лени - море юмора обеспечено. Хочется сказать, что это очередной шедевр в копилку Rockstar, но это шедевр всей игровой индустрии, даже всей индустрии развлечений. Глубокая и грустная история с ее искорками надежды о лучшей жизни...- Душераздирающая история, длительностью в более 150 часов (с учетом поиска всех животных)- Увлекательные второстепенные квесты с необычными развитием дальнейших событий- Новое слово в визуальном и графическом плане (и это без лучей)- Запоминающаяся музыка и голоса главных героев- Большое разнообразие активностей (от игры в домино до охоты на животных)- Унылый мультиплеер с большим количеством хакеров, портящих впечатление об игре"

This game is like wild west life simulation with immersive environment, it is very nice to wander around the map, doing activities like hunting, stowing animals you killed on the horse, riding and doing random encounters.   The game is  reminds me of childhood because i grew up watching western movies with my family on every sunday. You know cowboys, outlaws and sheriff stuff. (also fighting with natives). Of course, there are also things i did not like while playing the game; like shooting without using slow motion not so funny, therefore i am always using slow motion to headshot enemies. Also missions with doing daily stuff sometimes could be boring like driving coach to town to buy supplies, but i said the game is like wild west times life simulation.   Do i suggest this game?

This is actually my second time buying it, and I am not having as fun of a time as I was on PS4. Unfortunately, this port is pretty lazy and there are a whole lot of technical problems that have resulted from it. I've only had the game crash twice, but it generally runs like ♥♥♥♥, which is sad considering I am running it on a RTX 2070. Framerate drops, graphical issues, and harsh stutters are very common. From trying online, I can say that the community is by far this game's best feature. Other players, 9 out of 10 times will drop whatever they're doing to help you if you need it. It genuinely blew me away when I first started playing this game, and honestly it still does to this day, considering Rockstar Game's other titles' communities and how godawful they are. There are occasional hackers online, but I can't think of a time where they were genuinely obnoxious. Most of the time they just spawn a bunch of bears or something. The last gripe I have about the online mode is the general lack of love and attention it gets from Rockstar. I would describe the experience as ""barebones"" - while it has a great setting and atmosphere and gameplay, its absolutely lacking in content or just general things to do. The online scene is dying because Rockstar refuses to add anything to it, seeing as it doesn't make nearly as much money as GTAO does for the same amount of work.TLDR: Rockstar has a great game here, but it is plagued by a generally embarrassing amount of technical issues."

The technical aspects of this game are some of the most brilliantly realized I've ever seen in an interactive medium.  The visuals,  animations, and voice acting are all the level of quality you've come to expect from a rockstar release.  With that said, it's without a doubt, the most BORING game I've ever played in my life.  The mission structure is such that it basically plays itself and has you go from point A to point B with the game telling you exactly where to go/what to do and god forbid you go off-script.  The missions make sure to throw in some braindead easy shooting galleries every now and again to ensure you stay engaged but it simply wasn't enough to keep me interested.  I don't really have much to say about the open-world, it's fine I guess.  On the merits of it's technical aspects and story it's a 10/10.  In terms of the gameplay experience, I'd have to give it a 3/10.  I don't think I've ever tried to hard to enjoy something so beloved by many and just been completely unable to.  I realize I'm in the VAST minority here but that was just my experience sadly."

Unfortunately, as soon as we made it through the initial quest and grouped up in the first town, hackers found us. Not the ""aim so well you are suspicious and frustrated"" hackers, but the kind that explode you over and over, catch you on fire, teleport you across the map, teleport you into the sky, spawn dangerous mobs on you, kill your horse, spawn multiple replicas of your character which then attack you type hackers. I have never had anything like this happen in a game before. I ended up stuck in a loop being exploded to death over and over before I could access the menu to quit out of the game or try to load into a different realm. I had to alt f4 to exit the game. We have all asked for our money back, this is the most we have ever spent on a game and the fact that hackers have this level of control unchecked with no way of even seeing their names to report them is insane. A cursory google shows that we are not alone, this is a huge problem that is not being addressed."

But not only you get to know the west, you also visit American south and even one of the big southern cities with all modern features of that time. The environment and depth of the game is breathtaking and just riding around on your horse can be just as fascinating as shooting gangs, which you will get to do a lot here. The level of detail and scale of random events happening to you or just around you makes it feel like you were really there. This is something I was overwhelmed by. Now about the main story plot. You are typical gunslinger in one of many outlaw gangs roaming the west pursued by the law. All your gang care about is how to get more and more money in every possible way and you can see how gang leader Dutch Van Der Linde is just more and more obsessed with that and even though your character does not like that, he follows, because he is just a gun. Yes, this is some character development, but overall this is something I just didn’t like even though characters develop it does not affect their actions. The story is simple in my opinion, very straightforward, with little to no choice whatsoever and most importantly very predictable. ✪   ✪   ✪   and their enhancement choices✪   ✪   ✪   ✪   – after great beginning it goes downhill✪   –annoying a lot✪   ✪   – always online even in singleplayerOverall rating"

So I tried whatever I could find online to solve my issue. For some reason my IP is considered an abusable ip or something, that hackers can use to exploit the game or something, basically the suggestion people gave with that is to disconnect my router for 5-6 hours and maybe my ip address will change. I cannot do this as other people in my household use the internet for their jobs. I tried a vpn, and I could connect to the servers on my browser, but i needed to use my phone hotspot to even connect to not my internet ip to use the launcher, and when all of that was said and done RdR.exe could not respond, so after all of that work to play a game I was still gatekept by rockstar to play their single player game. I cannot even play it offline. So with that in mind I unfortunately have to refund this game i was otherwise excited to play again after so long but now with this sour taste in my mouth I do not know if i can continue supporting this company if i had to jump through this many hoops just to be denied access to a game a purchased.

I am enjoying the story right now but what I am not enjoying is that you can't transfer your ps4 character to pc and there are rumors that they won't even try to make it so. I tried to play online again but I just couldn't handle to start from 0 when I have an OP character on the ps4. If they can make the transfer possible (Just like in GTA 5) then I bet a bunch of ps4 users will buy the PC version and gladly spend more money on gold bars.Rockstar do yourself a favor and just make the online character transfer from ps4 to pc possible.

738,Dalton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GriffonKeep/,24,1,0,235.7,May,"9,",222,0,1,"As much as I want to recommend this title I just can't do it. So, let's talk about that.First I would like to go over the pros:1) Graphics are excellent and optimization is good2) Stories are fantastic with very interesting characters3) It will take a LONG LONG time to run out of things to do in this game, whether it's online or offline. After 101 hours I am still nowhere near running out of fun things to do.Now, let's get to the main cons and the reasons I can't recommend the game:1) Controls. They're bad. Real bad. It's exceedingly difficult to do precision movement whether on foot or horse due to the unresponsive and clunky controls. Not to mention a lot of times your mount will just veer off the direction you're heading and run you into a tree, rock, fence, building, etc. even when you're not pushing any directional keys. Trust me, the controls are infuriating.2) Online bugs and glitches. I have had entire shipments that I have spent hours putting together just vanish on turn in with no rewards. The shipments (trader and moonshine roles) do not get reset back to your camp or moonshine shack, they're just gone. This is the most egregious of the glitches so far, but there are also a lot of glitches involving movement that are frustrating.3) Hackers online. Oh so so so many hackers. These people can drain your money, print their own, god mode, aim bots, downpours of dynamite, invisibility, etc. etc. The worst part of this is that even if the hacker does not target you the hacks will break the lobby causing NPCs to be unresponsive along with... well.... everything else.4) Micro-transaction shop. Had I realized there was one in the game I would have never purchased it. These shops, every single one of them in ANY game, are nothing but scams. The developers purposely make things a grind (though in RDR2 it's not as bad as others) so that you will feed them money just out of frustration due to lack of progress even though you just paid for a full price game. Every single game with one of these shops is designed this way, some are just more subtle than others.    So, this review is long enough as it is, but I could keep going. However, I feel I have hit the most important points as to why I can not recommend this game. Maybe if it ever goes on sale for 20$, but I can't state enough that it's just not worth more than that due to the glaring issues, ESPECIALLY if you're looking to play online. As long as people keep feeding devs that practice shady tactics and ignore glaring issues (because, hell, they already have your money so they will just pretend they're working on fixes, but never actually fix the problems).    I will probably continue playing it because I am one of the dimwits that sprang for the ultimate version, so I already have a lot of money in the game, but had I known what I know now before purchase I would have never even paid the basic 60$. The online play especially is too broken with the CONSTANT harassment from hackers.    So, in conclusion, I would recommend you do not dump any more than a 20$ bill for this broken mess. And since that isn't likely to happen any time soon, I highly recommend you just pass this by completely."
739,Skays,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skays_gaming/,7,,1,253.1,November,"28,",280,0,1,"It's definitely Game of the year, but...Maybe I approached it with incorrect attitude but honor machanics are pretty confusing for example until chapter 4/5 game just didn't let me to be good guy. Main character Arthur is messed up guy with a lot of personal issues and this what kept me confusing about these Honor mechanics it was very hard to keep it on high(est) level. Don't get me wrong I loved main character (and his horse), I loved story but I felt that Honor mechanics are not needed and they sometimes pissed me off, for example why looting some guy's body who obviously died ten years earlier in the middle of a desert decreases honor? I still cannot tell especially when there is content in it (letters, valuable items or diary entry). In one sentence? It's hard to be a good guy on wild west even if you try hard.Next thing I have to mention are horses. Oh my... these are made beautifully not even by design but all of these have a soul and are so natural that when you meet some in the wild you know that you want to have him or her. There are a lot of things to do which if I would like to decribe It would take ma a lot of time. But discovery new places, hunting, a lot of sidequests. It took me 250h to achieve 100% completion and even though I'm sure that there are places that I haven't discovered.Probably I will add something in the future but for now that's it.Its worth every penny.

In this game there are two components, the first essence is known as story mode, the sequence is referred to online (multiplayer). Although online may seem debatable to some players, it overall gives a more positive output compared to GTA online (Grand Theft Auto). Story mode is considered one of the most heartfelt and captivating narrative components of a video game ever.Story (10/10):  In the Story mode component of this virtual game, the story consists of a low life cowboy named Arthur Morgan. Seen throughout the story as you progress, Mr Morgan is trying to find a way out of this life that he has brought himself into. There are exclusive features and details that vary among the story anticipated on your honor ranking. High honor will receive a contrasting ending that will gratify players' minds and captivate their hearts. But a differing sequence occurs when a player will receive low honor, the ending sequence of this virtual game is rather substandard and undesirable leaving players regretting the negative choices they had established throughout the story component. Overall this virtual game has a formidable story component that is highly ranked by all onlookers.Online (7/10):Online consists of an immensely inexpedient quantity of labor, consisting of a high amount of hours spent on playtime. Although GTA online (Grand Theft Auto) Consists of many players who decrepit and withdraw the satisfaction of playing. Rockstar Games had made sure those issues wouldn't arise again. Instead, leaving us with a correspondence that is genuine and pleasant. But the labor that has to be put into this sequence is over the top and leaves onlookers feeling purposeless. Therefore reducing a prohibitive amount of attention drawn towards the online sequence. Overall online is good but will take an excessive amount of time that is unwanted to most onlookers."
746,NotASpy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/definitelynotaspy/,6,,1,71.8,May,"30,",871,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is such an extraordinary game that it deserves more than just walls of text covering random topics like other reviews I made in the past. As quality of a game as Red Dead 2 is, I will try and make an equally informative and quality review of it. I will cover 3 main points that I think are important to what makes a game, this includes its story/characterization, gameplay, and visuals/sound.Many people see a game such as Red Dead Redemption and think about the gunslinging, the robbing, the violence but it is much deeper than what meets the eye. The story revolves around the main protagonist Arthur Morgan, it explains the origins of Dutch’s gang and the steps they need to go through in order to reach their goal of getting out of the U.S. and off to exotic lands to escape their tragic lives. The story is full of exciting missions and events that mostly revolve around the one last big score the gang needs to get the money they need to escape. Many twists and turns happen throughout which cause division amongst the gang and some drastically halt progress to getting the money they need. I am trying to keep it as vague as possible as it’s best to experience the game unspoiled, like I said it’s much bigger than a robbing simulator, it’s a story of redemption. You need to sit back and think of the world that the gang once knew is still a viable way of living. You think about your actions, and think if the harm you cause to others throughout is right. The cast in this game is outstanding, you can go from looking up to, to feeling sorry for, to hating, to feeling sorry for just one character of the many you get close to. This way of life takes a toll on people, and there is no honor in this life and you will find it out first handedly. How the people you grow close to change into people they once despised, how people react to certain events, how their lives can be taken at any instant and you wonder if Arthur Morgan is doing the right things for the people he cares about.While Red Dead Redemption 2 is a near perfect game in all other ways to measure a games worth, here is where you can see some of its faults. The game revolves around such realistic and beautiful animations, that it sometimes bleeds into lowering the quality of controlling Arthur. Not on many occasions but maybe a handful of times, I clicked buttons that didn’t register properly which lead to the game doing something I didn't want. For example, trying to mount your horse in a city and Arthur brutally tackles a random civilian which leads to me having every police officer in the city shooting at me even though it was not sevre and an accident. This made me have to mount up and escape from the law for about 2 minutes before I can return to the story mission I was on my way to. The gunplay leaves dissatisfied and you wanting something that feels a little more impactful. The shooting in this game just feels frustrating and unrewarding, which had me abuse deadeye which was fine but turned later missions in the game to me stuffing tobacco down Arthurs throat and point and clicking until I got to a cutscene. The stiff controls and poor shooting mechanics are really my only two gripes with this game, it may put some people off but I feel pushing through these issues are worth it for getting to play the almost masterpiece that Red Dead Redemption 2 is. The game tries its hardest to be realistic, and with that comes certain sim elements. Which has you naturally get immersed in the game that it is. You need to stop at stores to stock up for long journeys to keep arthurs weight up, you need to sleep to keep deadeye up and stay awake. Which has you every once in a while making trips to shops getting to know the shop owner and stocking supplies for you, crafting, horses, and more. It isn’t too in your face, it almost feels refreshing and natural to keep these things in mind throughout the game. The missions in this game are typically Rock* activities but set in 1899. You can go from robbing a bank, taking out rival gangs, helping out fellow gang members, to riding a hot air balloon. The mission diversity is amazing and has you wanting to pull 5+ hour sessions regularly. Besides the main story, this open world isn’t barren like other games . There are tons of strangers to meet that can have you escorting a cameraman to get the perfect shots, helping a newly widowed women survive on her own, tear bounty posters for escaped inmates, help a stranger on the side of the road who just got bitten by a venomous snake, and so much more. I am not usually a fan of side content, as it usually is subpar compared to main story quests. But the side content here is on par if not better than most main missions. They are full of interesting characters, twists and turns of their own that it feels great to just see a small story on its own. You can hunt various legendary animals or any old deer to get materials to craft new upgrades for your camp or upgrades to Arthurs equipment. This is hands down the single greatest visual and sound in a video game you can experience as of today. There are no other games that compete with the beauty of the world and no one can tell me otherwise. I was playing this game on near ultra @1440p with my Gtx 1080ti at a smooth 60fps . And at no point in this game did I stop getting stunned by the visual quality. The shadows are outstanding and reflect the time of day, on every blade of grass. The textures are top notch, everything is incredibly detailed from the horse’s balls to Arthurs buttons on his coat. But what really takes over here is the lighting quality, from the dust shining from the light coming through the windows, to the reflecting light of the swamps. I feel in this review I was able to thoroughly explain each of my points well, but in the case of Red Dead Redemption's 2 graphics I don’t think I am up to that task. Just take a look at my screenshots to see for yourself. This whole game immerses you with its dialogue, sim elements, but what ties it all together is the better than real life views. The forest can make you feel the dread of what's to come, the foggy and darkness of the swamp has you ride for your life in fear of the monsters lurking, the snowy mountains have you bundle Arthur to keep him from getting frozen solid. If there is one thing to take away from this review is that, this game seriously looks better than real life at times it will have you stop and take a screenshot to remember the time you had. Another key to the visual quality in this game are it’s animations and physics. Arthur moves around the world in beautiful fashion, the people smoking a cigar during a poker game are all realistic. It really has you believe that this is a real living world with how amazingly the people interact with the world itself. The sound design is also key to the delivery of the game, everything from rain hitting trees, to the distant gunshots, are all realistic and have you fully in love with the design of Red Dead Redemption 2. Not only are the sounds amazing, but the music and the timing of it is equally as impressive. The only other game that has comparable music is Nier Automata and we all know how amazingly the game weaves gameplay with its soundtrack. Here the music also perfectly matches with what you are doing, slow paced music while you are setting up a heist, and when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan the music reacts appropriately.The few real life songs that actually play, play at emotionally impactful moments."

And I am sure this one may have been just as great and wonderful.   BUT, there is just one minor annoyance that has prevented me from enjoying this game.  wait did I say one minor annoyance? I meant a CATASTROPHIC FAILING IN BASIC FUNCTIONALITY. Any one who has tried to play this game on pc will know what I'm talking about.  The fact that it requires yet another launcher is not even the worst part, what is is the fact that you cannot play this game while offline.  You have to be connected to the internet for the entire time you are playing this game.  for some this is not a problem.  for me though, I travel a lot for work.  And not everywhere has access to the internet.  and some places that do, it is unreliable at the best of times.  so playing a game that boots you from playing just because of a hiccup in the connection is problematic at the best of times.  I would like to think that this isn't going to be the new normal for games in the future.  However, i have a feeling that this (just like i said about micro-transactions) is going to RUIN several games and franchises for many of their loyal fanbases."

How can I comprehend the masterpiece of this game and the amazing character development and the incredible voice acting and the outstanding soundtrack? And best of all sets up perfectly for the first Red Dead. Arthur Morgan Where do I start with him He is the perfect protagonist, in my opinion, the game sets him up as a simply hardened outlaw who lives to ride and kills to live with him and his gang but as you continue to play the story you get deeper and deeper into who he really is and it's not only him it's also with Dutch, and John, and Micah, and Javier, Bill (all these names are your gang members) we all see their true selves at the end of the game. But Arthur changed the most because back then he was a ruthless man who gave no mercy or pity to others (if you choose to) But as you play as him he suddenly changes and shows that he really is a good man (again if you choose to have high or low honor for Arthur). As you continue to get higher honor you see his character development as he helps his gang and other important characters like Rains fall and Eagle flies they played a huge part in showing his true self. And Tuberculosis also played a major part in changing his life, and not only that but John and his family, Tilly, Ms. Grimshaw, Mr. Pearson, Mary-Beth, Even Uncle. Arthur redeemed himself by trying to save as many as he could and get justice to those who deserved it. His passing was one of the most heartbreaking moments for gamers and It gets even better when you then Play as John Marston Arthurs Good friend and brotherly figure, Together with his former gang members Charles and Sadie who the game will introduce you to as the game progresses through the story. They hunt and avenge for their good friend and get the retribution he deserved and cuts into the sequel to red dead redemption the entire story is amazing from beginning to first."

A perfect exhibition of the fallacy that was the American Dream. A beautiful tragedy of an idea so many have hopelessly held onto only for the optimist to lose their hope, the idealist to turn cynic, and the dreamer to wake from their dream and into a nightmare. The beauty was in the fight for it. That's what this game is. Dreamers fighting for a world in which they can still dream. Sadly the world in which they truly live doesn't want them anymore, they are 'more ghosts than people'. The dawn of a new century means the death of the last one and thus modernity kills mysticism. The tale of Arthur Morgan and the Dutch Van Der Linde gang in all its richness is the tale of those last few who held onto, fought for, and believed in the myth of the West. A particularly poignant song on the game's soundtrack contains one lyric in particular that translates this sentiment best: 'the building of a shrine only just to burn'. They gave themselves to an idea that could not give back. But who's to say they fought in vain? In the end, if not for an idea, we can fight for each other. That's the only thing worth fighting for. I know it's just a game and everything but I found a lot of truth in my time with it. So yes, I would recommend this game."

788,Theoran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theoran/,7,,1,"1,614.6",November,"13,",66,3,1,"I never played Red Dead Redemption 1 but knew of it, so I was so excited to have a chance to play RDR2 when it came to PC. I jumped into the game not knowing anything and quickly realized this was going to be a slow burn of a game. The opening chapter is pretty slow paced as the game introduces you to the many characters and the mechanics of the game. I cannot stress this enough; the rest of the game is nothing like Chapter 1. So don’t give up on the game early on, there is so much more to come. Chapter 2 opens most of the world and you can finally explore the land at your own pace. This is where the game really shines. Exploring, hunting, and random encounters really make the world feel alive.Take your time and explore the world. Enjoy the scenery, bond with your horse, hunt animals, complete honor quests and side quests, and even do the main quest when you want. It all is so extremely rewarding. Obviously, you could only do the main quest and finish the game over the weekend, but you will miss so much about what makes this game great. The more you put into the game, the more you get out of it.In the early game, I did not know how I felt about Arthur. I just didn’t connect with him, and I certainly did not like him at all during the Leopold Strauss missions. As time passed in game, my feeling for Arthur began to change and you get to start seeing small changes in Arthur as well. You get to see the honorable, caring, and loyal friend he is, and I fell in love with him. By Chapter 6, I wanted nothing more than to protect Sadie Adler, Charles Smith, Abigail Roberts, and my horse, and save the gang and live happily ever after.I got lucky and was able to get Biscuit, my grey dappled Missouri Fox Trotter, seven quests into Chapter 2 and I kept Biscuit to the very end and without even realizing it, I had formed an emotional bond with her. I love this horse. I fed her; brushed her; took her to the stables for treats! It is an odd thing to realize how attached you have become to a video game character and as much as Arthur meant to me, Biscuit meant just as much.As Chapter 6 ends and the music plays, I am an emotional wreck. As the scene faded to black, I just sat there, staring at my screen. I had spent 500 hours in game at this point and I was drained. I had become so emotionally connected to all these characters that I did not want this the be the end, but it was. It was a satisfying, gripping, emotional story that left me filled with feelings of elation, despair, happiness, and sadness.The story of Booker and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite is the only other game I have played that had so completely pulled me in to the world and built connections with characters in the game so much so that I teared up at the end. This game delivered and the journey this game took me on trumps any glitches, bugs, or error codes that happened along the way.To say that RDR2 put a spell on me is an understatement. I own the RDR2 Official Guide, the original soundtrack, and the original score. This game consumed me as I worked my way to 100% completing the game.  I love this game, flaws, and all....even the ridiculous gambler challenges.The online game is what it is. I played RDO for 30 straight days and pretty much hated almost everything about it. It felt empty, soulless, and boring. There was no one to play with and for the most part I simply grinded the same area for cougars and plants. Ultimately, I got to a certain point where I asked myself, “Why are you even playing this?” At that point, I stopped playing and have not gone back even after RDO updates."

That being said, seeing that half of the game is still in a bad shape and little is being done about it I see no way but to keep my recommendation negative. ****************2020.01.24 - After playing over 100h, and most of that on-line I can tell that game instead of getting better is rolling downhill, and fast - old bugs that were there in december when game was launching on steam are still there, and new ones are poping-up almost on a daily basis -  shopkeepers and questgivers becoming unresponsive, daily challenges not getting counted properly, world events and animals respawning at terrible rate. On top of that servers are performing like sh*t, and all R* seems to be caring about is new premium currency content, which i wouldnt mind if the game was working fine, but it's not.This game has TONS of potential to be great, and I'd love to recommend it, but in current state RDO is unplayable.******That being said i love single player part of the game, which is awesome so far I recommend it with my whole heart."

The game has more physics details, than other games. About the story. Main character is Arthur Morgan. This man is very very charismatic, memorable and handsome. Always in my heart. About the graphics. Graphics are wonderful and very good, i just each watch on sky and my eyes get awesome beauty. Soundtrack and ambient music is perfect.Red Dead Online is good multuplayer about the Wild West. There are 5 roles (Bounty Hunter, Collector, Moonshiner, Naturalist and Trader). If you play with friends, then the game become more interesting. But, you can play solo, It won't be boring. Multiplayer has clothes, horses and guns, according to your taste.My rating is 10/10 - I recommended to buy!"

Of all those games, this is most assuredly one of my absolute favorites. I went into this game with no expectations, all I had heard was this was supposed to be a very very good game. The first several hours I spent starting and restarting, learning the mechanics and what does what and all of that and eventually it clicked and when it did, an adventure began the likes of which I've never experienced before. I am happy I waited until I had a beefy PC to play this game at max settings in all its glory too. My only real critiques are that I wish the map was just a tad bigger and the physics were a little less buggy. Beyond that, this game and its story are near flawless. A life changing game I would suggest any gamer play at least once. Thank you for the memories Arthur, enjoy Tahiti <3UPDATE: after finally sinking significant time into RDO, I feel like I can give an honest and fair review.It's a money-grubbing grind fest similar to GTA online and if you don't want to grind, you can gladly pay to get ahead. The story missions aren't bad, but most others are just radiant fetch missions or your standard guard this/take that/steal this jobs. What's more, in order to access more missions and features in the game, you actually have to pay a significant amount to buy ""kits"" that'll allow you to partake, and then in some instances (Blood Money) you have to pay just to do missions. If you're OK with grinding mostly for cosmetics, or want to RP, this might be up your alley. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. I would gladly pay $200+ for the RDR2 story. And I'd gladly pay $20+ to forget RDO exists."

""Non gamers don't know what they're missing out on, it saddens me to know a lot of people still think video games are still in that pac man or donkey kong phase where it's just a fun time waster for kids; but games have evolved into a broad medium of storytelling and world building in ways movies or books wish they could make their audience connect to."" - Comment from Youtube video.I like to review games based on MANY reasons but I mostly prefer to point to 3 main reasons that have a big impact on my experience:Very realistic. This is by far, the best and mostly will be even on the future the most realistic and graphical game I have played to date, aswell the whole physics which are breath taking and how well done they are, every single small detail is put into the game for one to experience the real west times! It also has it's own weather and it's another surreal part of the game. Snow, rain, sun, thunderstorm, sandstorm.. The map is one giant open-world with a lot of different biomes and also having a change of time for day and night, which already increases drastically the way a player view the game at. Not only that but the combat, the guns and the blood are super good! If you have played the game or at least seen a video or two, you know this game is no joke, but at same time it is very optimized as I played mostly on 90-120 fps on max settings for 1080p, considering the perfect graphics. Wow! Not only has the most thrilling western songs out there, aswell the sounds from ambience and everything are just in shape. Travelling by the forest, earing the owls at night while riding the horse listening to it's walking, and Arthur/John breathing. Or walking into the snowy mountains with your steps in and with eagles above birding loud, probably looking for a prey to catch. The rain or the wind on a top mountain... Simply outstanding!Also walking by the cities, specially the crowded ones and listening to the trains, the people chatting and all... it's a very different feeling than any other game, maybe because it's complemented with the graphics making it feel so real? Yet I think it's amazing what the creators have done with the sound in RDR2, as most of the games aren't this much detailed at all, to the most small point.The story is HUGE and very well writen, one of the best I have played so far. There are a lot of characters and cities, aswell a lot of missions and things to do. Nothing more to say, only playing is the best way to tell.Adding another extra part as the game includes a Online version but I really despise it and my hate goes all here since it needed to play it in order to complete the game's full achievements. Reaching rank 50 required me to buy a 10€ pack to collect easy but grindy XP that took me around 20 hours, not so fun. The PVP was crazy bad and really didn't liked it.Take a look at these two videos, just an amazing experience!  -"
803,Blarghalt,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980238865/,5,,1,92.1,January,"27,",341,0,1,"You wouldn't find yourself alone on the internet today if you went around saying that despite Rockstar's cash cow with the Grand Theft Auto series, Rockstar was truly at their best when they made Red Dead Redemption. A game with unforgettable characters, amazing gunplay, and the occasional horse glitching through a boulder. A game that, to this day, I've never found someone that thought poorly of it. And now, here we are. Ten years later, with a prequel of even grander ambition than the first.The only true way I can describe this game is that it  the embodiment of everything good about the ""Triple AAA"" games. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that oozes with care and attention to detail in a way you usually only see in a Metal Gear Solid game. A cast of characters you genuinely come to care for, and an open world that feels truly . As Arthur Morgan, a member of Dutch's gang, most of the game world is open to you from the start, but the way the game is structured, your journey across it tends to unfold organically as you follow the main story. As a member of Dutch's gang, your main goal is to make money, and how you go about this can range from simple robbery to more theatrical methods of plunder.And this is where the core gameplay loop of RDR2 comes in: go out and explore the world, and experience its splendor. I haven't felt a sense of a game world being this huge since Skyrim, and in the same way, you tend to stumble upon quests as you reach around every rock and stick to see what the game world has in store. It's an immensely satisfying way to have quests structured, and that's not even getting into the gameplay.In my entire life of playing video games, I don't think  has even come close to how fun the gunplay is in RDR2. Nearly every single firearm is just plain  to shoot, and there's a lot of times I'd just ride through the game world shooting my gun into the air because it just felt right. And then, when you get into combat, you have a pretty bog-standard cover shooter, but with the element of the satisfying guns put into the mix, pretty much every gunfight is a blast to go through. It's almost decadent how full this game feels, and how much is packed in. This game could be double the price it is, and still be worth every penny. And I've only talked about the singleplayer experience; there's an entire and well-made online portion than can keep you entertained well after you've beaten the singleplayer portion. This is a game I hold on nearly the same level of Undertale or Chrono Trigger; you owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Cannot recommend enough."

805,NB,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198221239660/,6,,1,336.4,December,"19,",134,6,1,"This is an in depth review of Red Dead Redemption 2.I have over 300 hrs ( on pc ) in the game so i basically know the game inside out and also have all the achievements for the campaign mode.Now a lot of people are reluctant to buy rdr2 because of the launch issues it faced in its pc port and i totally agree it was buggy at launch but things have changed now , rockstar has fixed almost all the issues that the game had so there's no point in holding back your purchase for this reason.Now the game isn't for everyone its a very slow paced game,the game takes its time to show u the magnificent world that rockstar have created and its an experience that u need to take in slowly. MUSICNow music is on the top of list because this game has one of the best soundtracks out there. OPEN WORLDThe world of rdr2 is something that every gamer must experience.Its a beautiful world but don't be fooled danger lurks in every corner of this game from random gang encounters to you being hunted down by predators like a panther or a pack of wolves, you cant trust anyone in the wild .I had an encounter with a man who called out for help and said he lost his way, so naturally i went to give him a ride back to his town but he pulled me down and stole my horse, this is one of the many encounters that i had in the open and each one plays out differently. Its filled with a level of detail that is unmatched. There are treasure maps to be found ,dinosaur bones to be discovered, animals to be hunted and skinned etc ,i can go on and on about this but i will stop and give you a few numbers.The game has 178 animals all of them with distinct movements just like their real life counter parts ,around 30 types of fishes ,19 horse type each with their own unique skill set.There are around 60 weapons ,43 types of plants,60 types of items.GAMEPLAYIts a typical rockstar game so it uses a physics based engine which still creates hilarious moments ,Arthur (the main protagonist) moves like a real person and does actions at his own pace, for stats he has a stamina bar, health bar and a dead eye meter .All the mechanics from the first game have been implemented and improved in rdr2 with additional new ones. Hogtieing a npc and placing them on the train tracks just to see them run over is still fun to do.There are occasional glitches but not a deal breaker.The weather system is top notch with sand and rain storms being highlights.Gun gameplay is still clunky like all other rockstar games ,cover system is okish, first person mode of the game is the best way to make the gunplay interesting if u are having difficulties in the shooting areas of the game.For me the campaign was not at all challenging but it had some amazing moment which i am not gonna spoil for you. Even though the game has many weapons you can pretty much use a carbine repeater through the whole game with no issues ,which is one of the problems i had with the game.Looting an enemy or an area takes a lot of time because Arthur manually has to do loot each single area and can be frustrating some times.Horse gamplay is fantastic, the movements are just like real life and for the most part they can be controlled easily with a few cases where i had my horse going on its own, now i don't know if rockstar did this to make it more realistic or its just a bug.Horses have stamina and health bar.Bonding is a new mechanic in which it increases depending on how you treat your horse for instance cleaning them, feeding etc.As the bonding level increase the stamina and health of the horse is also increased in addition it can perform skids and side movements.Another new introduction is the camp area where all the gang members hangout and go about their lives.Arthur can talk to each member and can do small fetch quests for them.The gang reacts to how you behave to them.The camp has an upgradation mechanic where you can use in game money to upgrade the camp abilities like unlocking fast travel, better food for the members etc.There are mini games like poker,dominos, five finger fillet and black jack 21 all of which are fun to play.*Dead eye is still in the game and is still lovely and honor system also returns*STORYStory wise rdr2 takes place before the first once where you play as Arthur Morgan a member of the Dutch van der lined gang and shows how the age of civilization afted their lives. The game has hands down the best writing in the video game industry, Arthur is such a well written character that you actually start t care about him as the game progresses.Every piece of dialogue is masterfully written and executed ,each charecter feels unique and have different back stories. Side missions are also of excellent quality. The missions are fun to play there is humor and charm to the character which all in all adds to the experience.The only down side is the story starts to drag towards the end creating some missions which were not necessary.ONLINERdro is still new and is improving as of now i havent played much but its still a good aditional package that you are getting.It is not as good as gtao considering is fairly new whereas gtao has been around since 2013.From what i have played its very good ,the missions are fun do with friends and has a lot of side activities to keep you invested.There is room for improvement.Yes server issues still exists.VERDICTThe game is an absolute must play and i  highly recommend it.I have a lot of screenshots uploaded on my profile for rdr2 so if u want to see how the game looks you can check them out.Thank you."
806,Soloccidens,https://steamcommunity.com/id/soloccidens/,10,,1,124.5,December,"12,",100,0,1,"I decided to give RDR2 a try because of the protagonist's ability to pet horses and, honestly, to pass my time before the release of Cyberpunk 2077. Now that I played it upon release, I felt like I should come back and say something about RDR2.Boy was I never this wrong in my expectations. Maybe this is due to the fact that I never played a Rockstar game before, but I really didn't have many ideas on how this will unfold besides shooting bandits and stealing their horses. But the game was a hell of a ride.The story is extremely well-written and beautiful, the main character is probably my favourite protagonist so far: his actions are all making sense, there is little to no dissonance between his established personality and the world it lives in, and his development doesn't feel unjustified, rushed or faked, which is something I quite often experience in video game media. His voice acting is top quality and in general, I found Arthur a charming main hero, flawed and imperfect, but totally alive. In the beginning, I was worried about quite a big amount of supporting characters in Arthur's journey. I kept mixing Bill and John, Charles and Lenny, Hosea and reverend Swanson (!) and pretty much all female characters in their posse thinking they will be a minor decorum in our journey. And they ended up none of this, every minor character is great and their interactions are a treasure, and the amount of work put into their camp banter, responses, mimics and writing much be insane to feel this satisfying, From horses (I love my good girls!) to hunting, playing poker, chasing serial killers, antagonizing Micah in the camp or fishing in the frozen lakes of Grizzlies — this game does its job brilliantly and delivers an incredibly immersive and believable picture of living in America on the turn of the XIX century.I know this game is not a hidden gem in need of more recommendations, but if you are doubting and somehow reading this — make sure to give it a try. It is not cheap, but definitely worth the price. Albeit slow-passed and sometimes sluggish, it is a great story of Arthur Morgan, Dutch van der Linde (I would give this guy an Academy Award if this was a film!) and his gang which for me pushed the boundaries of open-world gaming and made it into a Coen brother meeting Faulker tale of a people trying to find their place in the world passing by.10/10 if only for the mission ""Blood Feuds, Ancient and Modern"", this is the best crafted scene in the video games I have ever seen."

How he realizes the truth behind things he otherwise followed blindly as the game progresses is done with no rush. Playing with High honor is the best way to play this game., although I wasn't a fan of this honor system at the beginning, it just adds that little touch of 'Realization' that Arthur goes through in the game.

815,oarsoid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Oarsoe/,6,1,0,55.1,December,"24,",80,1,1,"I have to start with words of praise for the game. I first bought the game half a year ago for PS4 launch and it was incredible. I finished the game, spent a good 100 hours in it and what a game that was! Truly a masterpiece. Logging into social club was awkward, but it never bothered me once after, so it was a smooth sailing.A couple of weeks back my friends convinced me that I need to join their posse in RD Online and get it on my PC. So I did, I bought the $80 edition, went through the 100GB download and wanted to start playing. I was expecting something on par with my PS4 experience. Boy was I wrong.Game requires not one, not two, but THREE launchers to be operational - Steam, Rockstar launcher and the despicable Social Club.So far I've spent 30 minutes to 1.5 hours trying to start the game DAILY. Today was it - I sat there trying and trying and trying again and spent my last hour with red dead 2. I cannot start the game whatever I do.The vicious circle starts with ACTIVATION ERROR greeting me upon loading. Looks like thisThen it basically two things - either you are not logged on into social club, or the rockstar launcher. I tried both, with multiple captchas and every time it lags for MINUTES. Why? How much time does it require to verify the login, jesus!Second thing I see then is the cloud sync conflict. Naturally RETRY doesn't do anything! You start anew waiting each time for these stupid launchers to crawl for 5-10 minutes before even attempting to launch the applicationThen I'm being reminded that after paying $80 I still don't own the game: I try relogging into launch - and it doesn't let me complaining about authentication tickets I had to reset the password to break through this one. And boy was that fun - launcher was stuck with 'expired auth token' - and outright refused to log me in with a new password. Mind you, each attempt costs you a few minutes of LAG.Then I get another one after playing good 20 hours And another one And another one this one was so horrible, I'm still shaking - basically after the password change in the rockstar launcher, the social club just refused to let me into the game. It gives no options naturally, only Quit. What they don't show you is that you can press HOME twice then sign out there, then sign in, then quit the game (because at this stage it is no longer operational regardless of that you actually DID login into the social club), and then it MAYBE works. It gave me the menu, but after trying to get Online, I got disconnected with 0x10022190 - What is the reason for it? Only god knows. Some people on reddit say it's when you have bad internet connection. My 1Gigabyte network says otherwise.But when I do login, I have roughly 2-40 minutes to play before I hit another bomb with sudden disconnection and lost progress, naturally. It's HORRIBLE. It's mind-numbingly stupid, slow and borderline painful.That being said, I know I have quite a few hours played, but I just can't anymore. It's a great game that I can't play. A few days in a row I spend more time trying to login than actually playing. It's ridiculous experiense that leaves me filled up with anger and disappointment."
816,Ossi ㋛,https://steamcommunity.com/id/armanossiloko/,6,,1,56.6,April,"23,","1,058",0,1,"The popularity of Red Dead Redemption, being a console exclusive, was incredible. At the time, the Internet was full of fan made art and posters of the game and even some fan fiction continuations of the story. But, beside a really great DLC - named Undead Nightmare, the franchise went silent for years, though, it was never forgotten. Everything went viral in Fall 2016 when Rockstar teased the return with a new company logo, themed similarly to the colors which the franchise is known for. It turned out that a new Red Dead game was in development, which is set years prior to the popular ""sequel"". Knowing 2010's Red Dead Redemption, RDR2 had a lot to live up to with a limitation to the story, having in mind that many players already know the outcome. It's oddly satisfying to say that it manages to deliver a beautiful, carefully written story with a big number of memorable characters you interact with. It's set in 1899, an era where the society began to modernize and little to no space was left for the dying breed that the cowboys were. Dutch van der Linde and his gang refuse to accept the new ways of living and are in constant clash with the law. You, Arthur Morgan, are part of that gang, one of Dutch's closest people and are set on a quest to earn enough money so that the gang can leave the area and disappear once and for all.Dutch's ideals are phylosophical and often not the most unrealistic ones, but the way of going through that path has to result in constant robberies and a huge number of dead people, both innocent and guilty ones. After a disastrous robbery attempt in Blackwater, the gang has lost a lot of its members. The law is constantly chasing them and there are bounty hunters waiting around corners, ready to kill. On the run, the gang is slowly being torn apart. Arthur is a man of a slow realization of his gang's terrible deeds who, while remaining loyal, is starting to question Dutch's transformation and his way of handling situations.The camp is crucial to the game and story... Or so they want us to think. Dutch will complain about being broke no matter how much money you donate. Essentially, all the camp activities can be totally ignored, and nothing will change, really. Beside Dutch, there are some, expectedly, familiar faces in the game such as John Marston, his wife and son and a few other characters known from the original Red Dead Redemption. Essentially, it is very hard to provide any details without spoiling the end of the story, but RDR2's story is beautiful. Arthur's character transformation throughout the story is haunting and in reality, I started playing the game wanting to play as John Marston, but ended up wishing to remain as Arthur. His character arc is really amazing and he certainly is one of the best protagonists I've ever seen.One of the crucial elements of any game is its gameplay. From the wide variety of animal life to the random encounters with strange NPCs and the weird and mysterious places you may come across, RDR2 has a lot of stuff to offer. Alongside the main story, you'll occasionally meet strangers - paleontologists, beggars, other outlaws on the run as well as an occasional NPC in need of help, their variety tends to be interesting and creative from time to time - there was an instance where I was able to watch a doctor amputate an NPCs left arm. Unfortunately, these seem to be too scripted and I found myself in a few occasions where I helped a prisoner on the run and left the area before he was able to speak to me, only to cross the path with the exact same NPC and the exact same problem a few hours later, just in a different place. Eventually, I helped him again and waited for him to finish his line in order to avoid the same meetup again.People can be weird at times and riding a horse often caused encounters with strangers who greet me. The game provides a fun option to talk to any NPC, but I found myself avoiding this since you can never really know what Arthur is going to say next, no matter whether it's positive or not. Random NPCs sometimes greet you in the wild, and while I'd gladly send some greetings back, it feels a bit too much work to stop the horse from riding, focus on the NPC who may already left and then talk to them. At the end of the day, it's the littlest interactions that truly magnify the experience. There was an instance in the camp where two characters had a discussion whether the gang is losing their way and after few arguments, Hosea turned to me and ask me of ""my"" opinion.The controls are binded the way they are natural, but there are often really unresponsive, especially while riding a horse. The horse sometimes may or may not slip over anything. The bond with your horse is important, since a it will result in both better and easier controls as well as the distance within you can call it. If it's far away, you'll have to wait for the horse to physically return to you. Stealing a horse will mark it as a temporary one, and a nice touch was seeing how the game will remember its existence and the last place you left it the next time you play. Combat, on the other hand, feels really good and it has the positive elements of GTA5's with some improvements. Guns will have lower stats if they are not cleaned, but they won't be low enough for most players to care.The weather can change randomly within a few seconds and when it does, colder weather will impact your health, so you allegedly need to wear clothes intended for the current temperature. Arthur's actions won't have an impact on the story, but depending on the honor level, the same cutscene will play out differently. One of the things that impact the honor level is the so-called ""witness system"" - unfortunately, RDR2 suffers from the GTA police effect. The law will magically know you for killing a person in the middle of nowhere which usually results in a randomly spawned traveler running away to tell the sheriff. Every step of the horse, every animation, every plant and rock you come across are meant to immerse you into its beautiful open world, and it's incredible to see that the game succeeds in doing that more than often. The lighting is just phenomenal and it works really well. The game features a wide range of terrains - from the foggy and snowy mountains all the way to the swamps filled with alligators, it never ever felt repetitive. Even visiting the exact same spot feels like a totally new place. Rockstar has really inducted the power of QUIXEL's Megascans in a proper way and the result is just wonderful.The details of each gun and character is astonishing. The characters will be covered in mud if not cleaned, their health will worsen and Arthur's face and animation will changed based on his health or if he got attacked by someone. The skin may be brighter and reddish on sunlight and both mud and snow will have footprints if walked on.There's an outstanding cast of talented voice actors featured in RDR2; Rob Wiethoff and Benjamin Byron Davis reprise their roles as John Marston and Dutch van der Linde, respectively. The main character is portrayed by Roger Clark and he delivers the line wonderfully most of the time - it's a performance of a lifetime. The sound of the guns is great as well and has a nice few touches depending on the origin and area of the gunshot, so it will sound different indoors and outdoors.2010's Red Dead Redemption had entering Mexico playing ""Far Away"" by Jose Gonzalez, and that is one of the most wonderful moments in all of gaming. While ""Far Away"" doesn't return here, there is a similar equivalent - D'Angelo's ""Unshaken"", and it works well for RDR2's setting. Generally, Rockstar's music choice is top notch and I loved every bit of it.If anyone cares, here's some numbers:"

After nearly 10 years of waiting for the sucessor, it definitively paid off, the  game is  astonishing. The story and dialogues of individual characters are amazingly written. You can take your time with the story, explore many locations, or side missions which tell other interesting stories. As far as you can go, you can also do a lot of nonsense, caution here, because due to the high level of realism of NPCs’, they remember nearly every little detail of you (clothing, horse etc.) Nevertheless, which was also known, the game also has its issues. The game is very large and extensive that the developers have actually forgotten, to explain things a lot more precisely, which were relevant for gameplay. Of course there were also many PC bugs, but this shouldn't matter in terms of the game itself, but was a mistake by the developers. Since the game has definitely laid a new foundation for realism in games, I think that there are lovers or dislikes depending on the player. For me, it was great. In my opinion, one of the best games over the past 10 years."

I wont be the first person to say this but the game literally felt *alive*. Each npc moving around has its own personal life which it carries out over and over again, the animals react to you and the surrounding almost as if it is actually happening in real life. The attention to detail Rockstar put into this game is just marvelous. The story, the scenery, the gameplay is all just perfect and fits in extremely well. I've heard people say that the game is *slow* or just calling it a *Cowboy GTA*. I believe that the game actually tries to convey its story like a movie, In the first chapter, it sets up characters and lays down there traits and how they react to certain situations. Watching Dutch Van Der Linde, John Marston, Javier Escuella and Bill Williamson is certainly nostalgic and reminds how RDR1 was a Masterpiece too. The slow gameplay is needed to sets up the amount of chaos that's gonna happen towards the end. The major difference between RDR and GTA is that the latter is a blockbuster action movie with an okay enough story while the former is a slow paced Scorcese movie with cinematic moments and an amazing story and setting. Overall Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece 10/10 Edit: People complaining about fast travel is a valid point as game doesnt exactly explain how to use it properly. Basically you just need to set up your campfire outside any city and you can fast travel back to any loaction that you've been too. Hope it helps"
825,DRACER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IDRACERI/,20,5,1,498.5,May,"18,",622,2,1,"Absolutely amazing work and effort put in by Rockstar Games. This review is spoiler free so you can read this without worry.Graphics: The game's graphics are absolutely spectacular, especially when you finish the first chapter of the game. The lighting and fog effects are unbelievably good. The god ray effects in forests are realistic. Nighttime lighting is realistic as the moonlight spreads over the whole area instead of being a light in the sky. Character clothes have great attention to detail, along with the fur on animals, and mud effects in towns.Gameplay: The gameplay can be a bit of a slow burn at the start, but once the first chapter is done, the gameplay becomes less restricting, and continues to do so as you progress forward. The Dead-Eye system, which is a character ability to slow down time when shooting, isn't like regular slow-mo shooting, but you can tag targets to automatically shoot them when you press the shoot button. The gameplay is also very realistic as you have to maintain your guns to keep them working effectively (they can jam if you don't) and you also have to bathe regularly to keep yourself clean, eat regularly (but not too much at a time) to keep your weight in check and also you have to sleep and eat regularly to maintain your cores. The 3 cores (Health, Stamina and Dead-Eye) decide how fast their respective attribute regenerates. If you have full cores, the attributes will regenerate at the fastest possible rate. Another mechanic is horse bonding and to do this you have to groom, feed and be kind to your horse to bond to the maximum level i.e level 4. You also have to feed your horse regularly so they don't starve. All this may be confusing at first, and may be tedious to some, but you'll figure it out once you start playing the gameDetails: I could go on and on about this. Horse balls expand/contract based on the weather, wolves mourn other wolves' death, constellations in the sky are 100% accurate. You drown if you swim too long, boats sink if a hole is shot in them, you pass out if you drink too much alcohol, you can vomit if you eat too much. Snow, mud and blood can get stuck on your character's clothes, and clothes only get wet up to the part they have been inside the water. Also, let's not forget the great random encounters in this game.Story and side missions: The story is possibly one of the best ones in videogames. I won't write much about this as it's filled with spoilers, but rest assured, if you pay attention to the story, you will enjoy the game to its fullest. Coming to the other thing, side missions are often humorous and enjoyable, and are usually as good as the main story. Make sure to do side quests around the same pace as the main story.Characters: The characters are quite amazing. People who only played the first game may not like Arthur at first, but trust me, he is amazing. Then there's the iconic John Marston who isn't as great as he was as he is still young and foolish. We also have the charismatic Dutch Van Der Linde as the leader of the gang, and Bill and Javier as guns on heists. Other returning characters include Abigail Roberts/Marston and a 4 year old Jack Marston. There are also a lot of new characters like Hosea Matthews, Micah Bell, Lenny Summers, Charles Smith etc, who you all don't know at the start, but eventually come to form an opinion and virtual bond with them.I could go on and on but I'll just let you experience the rest. It is a 10/10 game made by the legendary company Rockstar Games, so rest assured, it's worth every single penny.Happy trails My Rating for this game - 9.5/10"

831,Ke1N,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ke1n4o/,7,,1,19.9,December,"25,","1,250",0,1,"Red Dead Redemption II was definitely one of the best experiences that I ever had in a video game.I bought the title day one on the PS4 and enjoyed almost every part of Arthur and the gang’s adventures. The story was enthralling and I remained interested in understanding what exactly went so wrong, that we got the “hell bent on revenge” John Marston in the first game (the second game is actually acting as a prequel).The attention the detail was amazing. Rockstar completely nailed every little thing and managed to make it feel not so tedious, I hugely enjoyed every realistic aspect of the game. The ability to have a “short conversation” with strangers, the fact that you and your clothes get dirty so you need to take a bath and clean them.  People will also react differently to you if you are wearing dirty clothes.Also, the fact that when your horse is dirty it impacts its stamina and you need to take care of him as well. These little things are doing a really good job of making the world feel alive.As with every other Rockstar game you have complete control (out of missions) in the world. You can explore as much, as you like. You can do various side missions and participate in a lot of the classic mini games that were present in the original. The amount of shows and attractions that you can visit is also really impressive, especially when you get to St. Denis, the performances there are amazing.The setting is amazingly done, I still remember the chills that I had when I played Red Dead Redemption 1 and went to Mexico, they are several plot points here that left the same or maybe even bigger impression on me. I just love the Wild West era.Graphically the game looks stunning, it looks even better on PC, of course from what I’ve seen so far. I understand that there were some issues with the port, welp I guess that’s what the 1 month of Epic exclusivity is for, to test and tweak the bugs, so that we can get a good release on the real platforms. The optimization sure seems strange at best, but unfortunately this has become a tradition with Rockstar ports… (it speaks a lot that the top reviews are all users posting fixes for crashing or other technical problems)They continue to treat the PC market as “second hand customers”, and sadly this is not changing soon.My only real gripe with this game is how “limited” the world feels when you are doing a “scripted” story mission. The game holds your hand too much on the story points, the freedom that you were having in the open world disappears and you need to follow the path that was set by the developers. You can’t do most of the things your way, which is kind of strange because it feels really limiting. I understand that they probably do that as part of the “cinematic” experience, but a big part of Rockstar games in the past was the complete freedom that you were having to fully create your own experience.I’m looking forward to playing the game - 1 year later with keyboard and mouse and with better graphics. I don’t know if it’s worth 60 bucks right now, based on the fact that it’s more than a year since the official console release, but if you are looking for a great story with an amazing open world, look no more.(I didn’t write anything about the online part, because I’m not familiar with it, I treated this game purely as a single player experience. Maybe I will check the online someday.)"

Just FPS loss at odd moments otherwise it runs great.I can't wait for RedM to come out (FiveM for RDR2) to RP as a kickass cowgirl. Red Dead Online is also interesting, rather bare at the moment.

838,Sonic Punk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sonic_punk/,7,,1,230.2,December,"8,",971,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the game that sets a new bar for all open world games. It took me around 190 hours to complete this amazing journey with 87% completion and I still have some side missions and unexplored lands left. The game is a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, so even if you didn't play the first one you can perfectly enjoy the ride and start hoping for a remake. If you played the first RDR though, you will definitely get the best experience, as some characters return and the ending part of the story is so connected to RDR that you will get emotional. There are two game modes available: story and online (which I barely touched). I would say that, even without the online part, the game is worth every single cent. Since it's a massive game, it's hard to write a proper review without taking every single aspect in consideration.Once again Rockstar elaborates its amazing version of the frontier depicting a world at the edge of civilization where there's no longer place for outlaws and gunslingers. Everything is narrated through the eyes of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van Der Linde gang. It takes quite some time to introduce story, characters and world events, but it always feels natural. You will enjoy the story better if you treat the gang as your family, talking to them, fullfilling their requests, doing activities together. There are also some choices you can make that will indeed change dialogue lines, cutscenes and even unlock more story missions, so choose wisely when someone asks you to help. You will also be able to increase or lower your level of honor, depending on your actions, and that will affect how the other gang members react and talk about you.Speaking about longevity and replay value, every story mission has some challenges that will reward you with a bronze, silver or gold medal. Sadly most of these challenges require you to complete missions in the shortest time possible, which I think it's a wrong game design choice, 'cause the game is slow paced and you will get so absorbed by the dialogues that you won't rush just to get some medals. It adds some replayability but personally I don't feel like getting all the gold medals.The gameplay is as realistic and immersive as it could be: opening drawers, skinning an animal, tying your horse, picking weapons, looting corpses and much more. Everything has its own command, takes its own time and it's fully animated, with a level of detail that I never saw in any other open world game. You can even interact with all NPCs, though you will often have only three options: talk, provoke and rob. While most of NPCs will eventually start to repeat the same dialogues, this interaction is really useful with particular strangers, random encounters, gang members, animals and more. It's a kind of interaction that is based on context, so it's really important to keep an eye on the things you can say or do depending on the situation.Like the previous game, there's a level of honor connected to your actions. It helps define what kind of person you want Arthur Morgan to be, although his story is already written, so it's more about how he behaves and what others think of him.Horse riding is the best one I've seen in a videogame: realistic, social and not buggy. You can capture horses, buy and sell them. You need to take good care of your horse if you want to increase his stats and your bonding level which will unlock new riding abilities. Be careful though, your horse can be stolen or killed (you can revive him using a special medicine if it's not too late). Small tip: you can talk while riding, no need to get off your horse. You can also drive boats and trains.Gunplay is good. It's simple, but with all the available weapons you can get really creative. Not just guns but also arrows, throwing knives, explosives etc. You can also customize weapons and outfits of course. There's an Aim Assist feature that you can reduce or disable if you don't like. Red Dead also uses the Dead Eye system, which allows to slow down time and manually target your enemies before auto-shooting them all.AI is very good. During combat I've seen not only enemies taking cover and trying to flank you, but also trying to stab or disarm you. Enemies also react realistically when shot, they can lose their hats and get injured. Outside from combat, AI does a great job too. NPCs start looking at you if you follow them, asking what you want. People looking at you the first time you enter a saloon. Small things like this really help increasing the immersion.The world of RDR 2 is one of the biggest and most detailed I have ever seen. Every single region has its own unique beauty and wildlife: different forests, towns, mountains, deserts. The weather system is also incredible. You can tell when it's about to rain, you can hear thunders at distance, you can see your horse getting scared, the wind moving grass and leaves around you. RDR 2 open world is truly an amazing experience. As always, exploration is a key element. It rewards you in different ways:That's just a short recap, there's so much to do that you will never get bored.Generally speaking, soundtrack and sound design are great. The game has this random soundtrack system that selects the music depending on the place and the mood, which I think is amazing.Despite what others might say, the game is really well optimized. Even medium settings look amazing, but being able to play the game at higher settings is breathtaking. In any case there are so many options to tweak that you can find the perfect balance between graphic quality and performance, it just needs some testing.One thing though. In the prologue area you might get a better performance due to the fact that you can't roam in the open world for story reasons, so you will only have a real idea of your performance after the prologue (which could take more than 2 hours).The only cons I could think of is the Rockstar Launcher. It's awful and it can give you problems if you want to start the game offline.RDO is a real Westworld experience. It shares the same huge map, so if you don't want to get spoilers about locations, I would suggest to play it only after finishing the main story, or at least exploring most of the map. There's a storyline that introduces you the online mechanics. There are co-op missions, side activities, co-op and pvp events, but hopefully Rockstar will keep adding more. Like GTA Online, the game includes microtransactions. It can be really grindy if you want to buy expensive horses and outfits and they probably hope you will buy some gold bars using real money.If you want to buy the game just for Red Dead Online, don't.With its living open world and its amazing story Red Dead Redemption 2 offers a true western experience you won't find in any other game."

848,Machiavelli,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DieNackteKanone/,7,1,1,354.3,December,"21,",53,0,1,"So I spend 90 hours in one week on this game... Am I mad?Background:Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure, open world game set in a wild west scenario. As its name suggests, the game is part of the Red Dead series and a prequel to Red Dead Redemption. You play as Arthur Morgan, an enforcer of the Dutch van der Linde gang. After a job went horribly wrong, the gang has to run and pick up the pieces to be able to leave the country for good.Opinion on the game:Lets get to it. This game is one of the greatest open world games ever. And I mean that literally. The world you play in is huge, the regions vary from a cold Rocky Mountain environment over the humid swamps of Florida to the arid and hot dessert wasteland of Texas. The world is so vast but yet full of life. Even in the remotest dessert areas or on the coldest mountain tops, you never get the impression that you would be alone in an empty world. Rockstar managed to put life into this game with the incredible diversity in the animal and plant fauna, the interaction with others and the map design in general. Especially the great contrast between the deadly wilderness and the life in all the small villages and towns really adds to the game's capability of immersing the player into a world as it could have been in the late 19th century in the wild west. A big contributing factor is that with exception of one character (to whom I come to later), all pro- and antagonists are credible, which is partly due the fact that they were played by real life actors.So the game is huge, not only in terms of space (on your drive) but also in terms of how mauch playtime you can get out of it. The single player camapign alone without doing any sidequests will take you at least 15 hours.The graphic and sound design are also incredible. There was one instance where I was in the desert during a severe storm. (You have a dynamic weather btw) The lighting and sound effects were so impressive that I was just standing in the midst of the storm for 3 minutes straight watching how the rain affected the wild life and environment around me. One of my all time favourite moments in playing video games was riding through Saint Denis at night. A post-Victorian era industralized city resembling the likes of what is now New Orleans. On the one hand, you see the ones profiting from the industrialization and just a few streets further you experience the lifes of the people that did not manage to cope with these changes. You see the snobbery and corruption, you see the poverty and you get a perfect understanding of why certain elements in the population reject the society this era produced.The interaction with NPCs is nothing but outstanding. You can talk to practically anyone and the responses will be always somewhat different. Some will even tell you their life stories if you dont leave in time. And others may try to rob and kill you...The protagonist(s) you play have the most important trait that I value the most in a video game character. And that is credibility. Just by playing the game, you understand why they make the decisions they make. And why they change the way they change. Rockstar has done a great job with that and this also includes the antagonists.So in summary, the gameplay experience this game provides is amazing. I can only think of two to maybe three other games that managed to immerse me into their world in a way that RDR 2 accomplished. It really ticks all the boxes so far but is it a perfect game?Even though I would really like to give this game a 10/10, I cant. There are two major things holding it back. One is the character I previously mentioned. Unfortunately, this character (Sadie Adler) feels so forced into the game since she is written way too over the top and exaggerated. This is why whenever you interact with her, she manages to destory single-handedly all the immersion created by the entirety of all the other game elements. Thats a real shame, especially since she is way more present in the last chapters of the game and really soured my gaming experience towards the end. Plus, her voice is so annyoing that at some point, I just skipped all the dialoge with her.The second aspect (and arguably or objectivley the more important one) is the fact that this game (on PC) is just a console port. Which Rockstar is not really famous for, and this is for good reason. This game is liable to crashing and freezing. Once you have to replay 30 minute story missions that basically only consist of walking and talking, you get somewhat frustrated. For a AAA title, the amount of crashing is just not acceptable. Furthermore, the menus, UI and also the interactions with objects can be clunky. This game was designed for consoles and you feel it every minute you play. Another issue is that this game is really hardware hungry/badly optimized, especially so if you want to crank up your graphics settings. Eg, I got an RTX 3070 and a Ryzen 5 5600X and I struggle to achieve 40 fps on ultra settings in full HD. Apart from that, there are also notable bugs and glitches in the game but I wont consider them in the final rating. This is because it is just ridiuclous to assume that anyone could create a world as huge and impressive as this game without having a small amount of bugs in it as well.Summary:In conclusion, this game is astonishing. If you have any interest in western themed scenaria, like open world games or prefer story driven games in general, get this game! You will not regret it. (Or maybe dont if you have a potato PC, otherwise the game might not even launch in the first place) Despite its shortcomings, it is easily in the top 3 games Ive ever played. There are only a few games out there, that achieve a comparable level of immersion and authenticity. Considering everything I stated above, I give RDR 2 9.8/10. This is a Game of the Generation contender, nothing short of that. Period. So maybe I might not be mad after all. Well, at least not completely...."

Sometimes I'm wanted for a crime when there was no-one for miles around to witness it - there's just no way to avoid being wanted, and it's no fun.The first Red Dead Redemption was a joy to play. This one is a chore. I keep playing as it constantly feels like the fun is just around the corner, but it never is."
850,Vlad 254,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VLAD4591322/,7,,1,113.6,January,"27,",154,5,1,"The prequel to Red Dead RedemptionMaybe you want action, maybe you need a chill game for a break in the action (this game has both). This game has it all and regardless if you played the first RDR or not you'll find this game is absolutely amazing, I'd go so far as to say a masterpiece. Sometimes there is more story than action but that's not to say it's a boring game at all and the story is simply superb. That said you do have control of how much action you want vs story. The game has stunning graphics, great gameplay, it's immersive and you truly get attached to the characters in the Van der Linde gang. I'd say Rockstar has mastered open world gaming with RDR2 which is a true western right down to the gun and saloon fights as well as the train and stage coach robberies. Call it an RPG where there are no skill or perk trees to put points in to at each level up as there is no character level system. You earn XP in 3 attributes, Health, Stamina, and an excellent aiming system called Dead Eye which are all leveled separately. You level up your stats in a learning-by-doing type system. You must do certain physical actions, such as sprinting to increase stamina, rowing a boat to increase health and shooting to increase dead eye. The map is massive. There is also a Honor rank which you control with good or bad deeds or even things like doing chores if you so choose. There are potions and food to control your health and weight and of course camping, cooking, even skining animals. In short this game is incredible. The game does a good job with both funny and touching moments I'm already looking forward to another playthrough where I make different choices. Iv'e played about 100 hours so far on my RTX 2070 with an i7-8700 CPU and have encountered zero bugs. I give this game a 10/10!"

This game really puts you in the world of the old west and allows you to relive your greatest old west and makes you feel like part of that world. Have played the 1st part on console and have been waiting for it to release on PC since it was announce and boy it was worth the wait.Writing 10/10Sound 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Acting 10/10The story was so breath taking and progressed beautifully showing the current adventures of an outlaw who has lived a life violence and sorrow. As the story progresses you learn even more about the character which may or may not make you feel for him. The story present many chances for big choices to be made which impact whether the character is good or bad. The soundtrack is impressive and really brings the story to life and greatly aided in bringing me to tears several times.  Game play was great and really inventive but at times it felt like a lot. In the end the acting greatly benefited the overall story and really added to the motion i think all the actors deserve a pat on the back. The Graphics of course was stunning the detail was almost felt impossible it really makes the game stand out."

864,Gunter Severloh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GunterSeverloh/,10,2,1,885.0,February,"2,",76,0,1,"Love this game!   Going to list some good and bad points:Good Points:==========- Graphically game is stunning, that is if you have the hardware to boot, I'm running the game on an- i7 -700k 4.20 cpu- EVGA Geforce RTX 2060 12gb- 32gb ram 3600mhz- 1 TB SSD- 4 500gb SSD's- PSU 1000wGame is smooth for me no hiccups, or stutters.   If you have low specs, low ram, no SSD, low end system then i suggest not buying the game, you not only may not be able to play it, but then the quality, and performance would be crap, and you would be frustrated because its not going to run like it should, so either upgrade ... seriously or dont by it, trust me, i've seen reviews where people complain the game runs like crap, yet they have crap hardware and they blame the game for their own lack, dont do it!- Graphics again -==============I use a Reshade ---> It seriously changed how my game looks without any performance impact.  Most of my settings are in ultra except for a few.- Gameplay -===========You can play in 1st & 3rd person! i love open world, there is alot of freedom, and then there is not depending, some things i wish it was just like skyrim, open, unrestricted, drop, pickup what you like, even instead of a story, i would have preferred to have a character creation like it is online.       Besides the hunting, fishing, looting, camping, and exploring, the world has amazing detail, it seems fairly authentic to how it looked back in the day, like i would know but from documentaries, pics, ect. i'd say it seems legit.          The weapons are pretty cool overall, sound, look, and function, i dislike the automatic reload, the automatic fill my gun up with bullets when i shot 4 and have 2 remaining and i holster the gun and then pull it out and find a little gremlin has filled the gun for me, wtf    You can change that with a mod ;)     Deadeye, i dont use it, i play hudless, since im an Arma fan and used to simulations, thats how i prefer it, i dont care for the deadeye, i think its just cheating, and its a fools tool, for me it breaks the immersion so im happy that you can have the option to not use it, i prefer looking at the map and using my brain. I prefer the challenge and the threat it makes you think about your tactics, and how to overcome or go about doing something.- NPC's / AI  -===========    The fact that NPC's respond to you based on what you do, what you say ect,. is to me the 1st i have experienced in any game, i find it incredibly immersive, i do wish there was a bit more to it, like go into further dialogue with them, but if you keep hitting greet, or even antagonize it will go a bit further.    NPC's remember you, even after you haven't been around for a while, thats all of them, if they've seen you before, if you have good honor they respond accordingly, this to me is very refreshing in a game, it makes it more as i said alive, immersive, but more interactive, also effects you emotionally to a degree.- Animals, Hunting,Fishing, other things related -=====================================  I mostly do hunting, and fishing, skinning animals is pretty realistic, when i skinned my first animal it was a bit gruesome to see but i got used to it, i actually felt sorry, empathetic, sad for the animals when i shot them as they do respond, i mean they cry out in pain if they are wounded, its scary real where you feel guilty, like you feel bad to have done that.    Of course you know its a game too, so still for a game to stimulate those feelings really adds to the immersion.  The predators .... Scary!  Wolves, bears, watch out for them, be ready!!!   i dont want to say they are rare but when you do come apon them your horse will get antsy and start going crazy, best get off him and find high ground with a view and some distance.   Been killed a number of times by wolves, cougars, and bears, but most encounters were warded off or i ran.    Animals are ""alive"" they respond like they would in real life (to a point, im no expert but its believable), predators are scary, either run like the wind or kill them!  Other animals, may either ram you, bite you, or run from you, so watch your step!- Horses -========    Horses are awesome, customize them, gear/equipment like saddle ect,. even their tail, ect,. treat your horse with respect, feed them, pat them, wash/brush them, and you will bond with them, ya its that real, theres 4 levels of bonding, after level 2 they respond to commands, you can tell them to stay, and whistle for them provided their within hearing range of you.   I have 3 horses, i use all 3 at the same time, you can name them too, and tell them to follow me, and stay when i need them too.        You can individually call them, tell them to stay, ect,. but i use all 3 for hunting, for carrying pelts, and hides which will gain you more money when you sell them.   Just remember your horse is everything in this game, ya you can run everywhere on foot but then why would you, the horse is pretty realistic and feels very immersive, its like riding a real horse, and yes i did when i was a kid.- Story / Game -=============Story is pretty interesting, the game is fairly linear up til you get to chapter 2, as its made to be an immersive story tutorial you just dont know it, its pretty cool how they do it.   There are missions, the main quest missions with the gang your with are what progresses chapters, the story is immersive and really brings you into the game and characters emotionally, theres alot there!- Bad Points -===========- Game can be linear with some missions, overall its free roam.- I wish the game had more customization for your character instead of a set character, otherwise you can change the look of your character (Arthur Morgan)I would rather have to create a character and spend 1-2hrs on features, looks, ect,. then just go with it, however your character's hair, beard does grow, and can be long, and you can get haircuts and shave to how you want to look, change your clothes, and there are many other customization's for weapons, gear and for the horse so thats good at least.- Not everything is interactive.- I hate in some instances when you setup camp in a certain spot (unlike skyrim camp mod) where you camp, you dont end up there, its close though.There is a mod where you can camp anywhere so if you dont plan to play online and like camping get that mod!- Honor system needs some tweaking  - dont loot knocked out people = bad honor, anddont kill horses are the two most things imo that lowers honor quickly, unless your a straight up outlaw then thats up to you.- Time can be a bit ""fast"" and the weather goes with it, i mean its not super fast, but the day change still takes quite a bit, You can change it with a trainer, a good one is one that comes with scripthook rdr2 weather its pretty cool too.- Deadeye as said before to me is stupid, it breaks the immersion, i wish it weren't in the game but i dont use it so thats good enough.=========Idk what else to say here, its a good game if you have the hardware and if your into westerns, if you like western movies, or even old history then this game will be for you.=========LastlyWatch this video, its 37min long, but it goes into detail, its funny as hell, but its the truth, if you have any experience with Rockstar's game this guy tells the truth on how RDR2 plays he nails it:Here are some resources for the game:Mod Websites===========Nexus - RDR2Game GuideMapsFull mapInteractive RDR2 Map"

Sorry friends but I did not get that feeling. After beating the story and plenty of side quests (not all) that took me over 55-60 hours, only thing in my head is WHY the hell are 99% characters so stupid.People were intelligent back then same as today, but the amount of stupidity and retarded actions in this game is unreal. I didn't feel well playing the game where main character and his friends had IQ lower than outside temperature, and yes it's winter.... In any case amount of playtime and replayability  justify the price of the game, that is for singleplayer/story mode.Now the major thing, WHY negative review?!I do not understand how is it possible for a Rockstar, AAA dev/publisher multimilionarebiollionaretrillionare company  to allow themselves to release the game that is NOT working properly.First there are random crashes in singleplayer, some players experience it more some the less, I was lucky that I had maybe 5 crashes in interval of 50-60 hours, that was tolerable.However, ONLINE, that's the trick, it keep crashing,crashing and crashing due Rockstar end, it crash you in middle of mission, it crash you with inventory and horse full of goods that ofc disappear... you get the picture.WORST part on this subject is that I saw people complaining about this 0x20010006 error BS for over 7 months.... 7 FU MONTHS.... that brings be to conclusion that it may never be fixed.P.S. Almost forgot, loads of cheaters, in almost every event, you get at least one or two... god mode on, aim on... If I didn't see it with my own eyes I'd say yeah Im bad, they were better, but after shooting at man over and over again and his hp is stucked at full not to mention legit scores such as level 20 with 50kills 0 deaths.... convinced me again that Rockstar anti-cheat is a joke same as in gta5.And worst thing about this is that you cant report players after event is over, only in middle of it. Thats it from me :D But yeah it's great game, hopefully they will fix it in future.UPDATE 10/1/2022Just installed the game again to see if I can enjoy it some more... aaaand I'm happy to see that connection has been fixed and It's playable. HOWEVER still sea of lowlife cheaters, it's impossible to play anything online  involving shooting, unless you have a cheater in your squad too. Still remains negative review."

I had no issues then, and I don't have them now. Before I bought it, I made sure my GTA-5 was still in working order. I had to reconfirm my E-Mail address, but that only took 2 minutes. It's been quite some time since I played, and I just didn't want to buy the game, and find out something odd happened to my R* account, as has been reported by a few people.I had only one crash, and that was the very first launch of the game. So I adjusted my Graphics Card a tad, and there have been no issues to report. You don't really need Ultra Settings on everything. So I knocked a couple down a notch. I'm not going to bother listing my FPS, because I totally hate the  that lurk around out there, but the game runs nice, and smooth for me, and my benchmark test ran just fine. In-fact, better than I expected.I also got the  to work properly without any lag, or stuttering. No need to fiddle around with files placing this here, and that there, as noted on the forum. Now I can go into the games  and take some nice pics.I like the grit of Westerns (movies or games), and this game is a real treat for me to play. The story thus far is engaging, and the graphics are superb once you get the right mix. I only play  so you'll have to go elsewhere for a review on Coop/MP.So, if you've got the money, give it a try. This was an early Christmas Gift for myself, and I'm not regretting the purchase price for the Special Edition."

Even though I know that the problem is often sitting behind the screen, in this particular case I can say with a great certainty that I have done everything in my power to get the game running stably.(...Searching for corrupt files; switching between Vulcan and Dx12; testing the graphic settings; using health care and 'SFC /scannow' in cmd etc.; using DDU to freshly reinstall my drivers; using steam commands as '-ignorepipelinecache'; etc etc etc...)I really want to like this game and have spent much more time then I would like to admit trying to fix this mess Rockstar Games has released but after 15 hours even I surrender.I hope to get this game working one day, but my patience is not endless and it has now reached its limit."

The soundtrack chosen for the main menu, gameplay, cutscenes, and many different missions are amazing and are perfectly timed it gives you chills. The gameplay is detailed where you would do many things realistically and it's extremely fun. The graphics and details are just unbelievable it will really amaze you so much that it makes you stop and look at your surroundings just like in Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.

887,Inkly,https://steamcommunity.com/id/inklee/,6,,1,164.9,December,"27,",377,0,1,"Gonna be honest, I only play(ed) the Online mode, I'm sure the single player is great but it's not my primary interest.Bought the game during the Steam sale, game is great but not full price great; get it on sale.Graphics: Very pretty, looks great love itRuns like garbage for your average system if your Rig isn't up to snuff, I run a RTX 2060 and it still barely gets to 35 FPS on max settings, you can drop them but it get muddy and ugly fast. Be ready for an unoptomized game; You've been warned.Grind: Compared to every MMO I've played and the grind hell that is GTA Online, this is a breath of fresh air. There are two currencies = Cash and Gold. Both can be obtained in fairly healthy amounts in-game. You CAN buy gold with IRL money though, but you don't have to at all. Gold is easily obtainable in-game and when bought with IRL money only speeds up progression instead of being a blocker from even being able to compete with others. A LOT of content automatically either makes you unkillable or instanced so harassment and endless murder during a mission is almost unheard of.Hackers: Unlike GTA Online, they are rare or at the very least, not as public about what they do. Because of the way the game plays, it's not exactly very fun for them to harass people. Not much of a reaction and that results in a ton of them either not being around or just not harassing people. I've run into a single hacker over the last 2 weeks i've been playing nonestop + multiple different timezones.Balance: So far so good, nearly every weapon is great; with a few rifles being borderline overpowered. It's still pretty fair and you don't feel like someone has bought a win against you. You can min-max some stuff so there are still the crazy guys that are harder to take down so try to be ready for them during a match.Focus: Instead of the power fantasy obsession of GTA Online, you get an incredibly solid western fantasy with all the horse riding and cowboy-Outlaw badassery included. If you don't enjoy long horse rides you won't enjoy this game. Tons of outfits, tons of PvE content to do, a large amount of it instanced as to not get harassed.Community: Miles better than the other platforms ESPECIALLY when compared to GTA Online. Folks naturally get into their roles and characters, due to the game's focus out of being a murder obsessed psychopath (GTAO) and into being your own character with a grey morality. There are still people that will kill you in the open world but they are a minority instead of the majority. You'll still get the odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the PvP modes but they're uncommon and easy to ignore.Most people you run into just say howdy or try to group up. Had a guy the other day tell me merry christmas, that's the kinda thing I love about this community.Be a little more trusting and you'll see that most folk are quite fun to interact with and a bit of a tussle didn't hurt no one. Don't take it personallyKids are rare (Due to the horse riding being boring for most of them) So that's great for us fellow adultsOverall a fantastic experience, I pissed off my significant other with how i've been obsessively playing this!9/10 needs more horse armor (I'm joking Rockstar please don't actually do this)"

I felt happy and sad, but I'm glad i put in the time to play this awesome story.The world is beautiful, it amazes me what some developers can do with the current tools at their disposal and other prefer to take the quick route and do a poor job.

Between GTA IV and V and the previous Red Dead, we’ve beheld iconic performances and tremendous leaps in animation, physics, and immersion. While you can sense the DNA of the acclaimed studio’s previous work in the follow-up to their Wild West hit, it’s nearly evolved past a point of recognition. I’ll come right out and say it: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece that transcends the current generation and elevates gameplay and storytelling to a level of which is unprecedented. It exceeds far beyond my own expectations, and following more than seven years of passionate development, Rockstar has prevailed in crafting the finest game in their history and unequivocally the most immersive open world ever created.The story occurs in 1899, more than a decade before the events of John Marston’s tale in the first game. As the 19th century draws to a conclusion, so too does the era of outlaws in the American West. You fill the boots of Arthur Morgan, a senior member and lead enforcer in the infamous Van der Linde gang. Following a job gone haywire in the town of Blackwater, the gang heads north to escape the federal agents and bounty hunters who are hot on their heels.You quickly grasp a sense of the inevitable doom that awaits the gang’s lifestyle. The civilized world is rapidly evolving, and their ways of living within it are shifting to survival tactics as they rob and fight across the American frontier. Throughout the story, the gang relocates to diverse areas as they flee law and order. While they intend to steal enough cash to escape the clutches of justice once and for all, they struggle to make ends meet as divisions rise.Expertly paced and masterfully written, the tale of the Van der Linde gang is one that will forever remain with me. The game takes you on an emotional roller coaster as you get to know Arthur and his fellow gang members throughout sixty plus hours of the main story. Themes of loyalty, betrayal, revolution, and the American Dream are woven deep into a truly captivating, funny, and at times heartbreaking narrative. I loved every moment I spent with the engaging and diverse cast as the story unfolded, and I desperately wish I could experience it all over again for the first time. What’s more is the prevalence of player choice, and the world reacts to your day to day decisions as Arthur Morgan."

Far, far too many hackers. They are unbridled currently. They will spawn you into locked rooms, kill you repeatedly with a kill command, drain your bank accounts, teleport, run around in god mode, aim bot, pick you up and drop you from high altitude and just generally ruin the entire experience. Pretty much guarantee your game will be ruined by a hacker at least once every 2 hours. Maybe more. This will require you to quit the game and start another...which you will find is a common theme.Then there are the bugs / glitches. The VERY first thing you do in the game is glitched. It asks you to name your horse, and freezes there. A restart is required. Pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the experience though. Long load screens that load into black screens or never load at all. Poor animal spawn rates..where most everything in the game revolves around animal spawns. Not getting credit for daily challenges you clearly completed, while everyone else in your party gets credit. Your horse will sometimes just stand still, cant be moved. Many things require you quit the game and restart completely to resolve. This is just scratching the surface...but the running theme seems to be restart the game every few hours or less and watch long loading screens. Cross your fingers it actually loads.On the positive side, when everything works as intended the game is beautiful and fun. But the hackers and glitches REALLY hobble the experience.*update* LOGGED IN 2 YEARS LATER AFTER UNINSTALLING, VERY FIRST GAME WITHIN 5 MINS encountered 2 hackers using god mode, spawning in tornadoes, etc. Relogged to a different lobby, connection kept dropping every 5 mins.

I cant believe you are wasting potential on such a beautiful game, you are still updating GTA, coming out soon on another generation, but letting die Red Dead and its fanbase slowly, you finally fixed some bugs that were since the beta, you added some good updates, but made incredibly difficult to get gold, and update every once in a while. Please Rockstar dont let Red Dead Online die so quick.Even with all that, i highly recommend to buy the full game. Campaign is incredible, and if you are patient, you may enjoy online too."

920,NickyJ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NickyJ3/,5,,1,648.5,January,"16,",216,0,1,"Several hundred hours later into the game, I have two different ratings for the game:Singleplayer: 10/10. The story is superb. It's linear enough to truly be a story, but with an open world that lets you choose when you want to move on with the story. The moral system gives you a fair amount of influence over how you look at the story and the main character. The open world ranges from beautiful snowy mountain peaks to swamps and deserts. Many interesting jobs and people are found in those lands, all of them unique but not so outlandish to be annoying (looking at you, GTA).Multiplayer: 5/10. The open world has lots to do, but 80% of it is locked behind a pay-or-grind wall covered with suggestions to pay. Each set of skills you can use (bounty hunting, trading, moon shining, etc.) is unlocked through gold bars that you can spend a week or two grinding for, or you can TOTALLY JU$T $HELL OUT $OME MONEY, JU$T CLICK HERE FOR YOUR PA$$. They're cool once you get them, but it gets boring fast if you don't have a solid group of friends to form a posse and play with. Server stability is also lacking. Not as horrid as it once was, but the game has inconvenient moments of crashing after taking your ingame money but before giving you possession of what you bought. Too bad lol, guess you'll have to buy that train ticket again.Oh yeah, the singleplayer story is about working for a gang of thieves who rob banks and trains, right? Well you can't do that online. But you can buy the content where some nature hippie gets mad at you for killing animals when you hunt for your traders business. Priorities."

I'm a huge fan of immersion in games and this game has really set new standards for me. The story itself is fantastic but it was the rich open world as well that tied me up in front of my PC. You play as Arthur Morgan in the year 1899 who is a gangmember of John Marston's old gang and get to see what happened before the events of Red Dead Redemption 1. Every gangmember has his or her own unique background story making them distinctive. Ruthless gunslingers or sweet and innocent looking young women who take advantage of their skills as thieves. You really get to either love or hate them. The story missions offer much variety. Next to the obvious robberies and heists there are also few fun missions that made me smirk but i don't want to spoiler here. Just a small hint  The open-world felt vivid. NPCs weren't simply just chunks of meat standing around but felt like real people. Every simple action has consequences, from simply robbing a shop owner to robbing a whole bank.Red Dead Redemption 2 has its own crime & bounty system. You get to choose as what type of person you're playing as. Be a ruthless outlaw or a kind and merciful feller. Be a good guy and gain advantages like reduced prices at shops. Be an outlaw and have bountyhunters hunting you. As a gangmember you constantly have to keep your other gangmembers in mind. You're basically responsible for everything. You have to hunt for food or pay the ammo for example.In addition to that RDR2 even offers an immersive hair-system as well a weight-gain system. While the hair-system does not actively change your experience, the weight-gain system does. Eat too much and lose stamina, don't eat at all and lose health.There are a lots of activities and minigames that keep you occupied like poker, tabletop games, fishing etc. Furthermore, there exist numerous random events just like in the previous RDR. However, they're optional but they will increase your good honor stats once you help (The crime and bounty system i mentioned earlier). The event vary from helping a captured citizen who is held at gunpoint by outlaws to rather hilarious saloon brawls. Did i mention you even have friendship system with your horse?Graphicwise it really does manage to keep up with current standards. From forests to swamps to snowy mountains, villages, huge cities, canyons; This game just looks pretty yet it is demanding and i strongly recommend watching an optimization guide to get the most enjoyable experience possible.  It does not feel dull and every region has its own charm. There's a fast-traveling system in RDR2 but i rather rode to my destination!The gun system is pretty decent. There's a fair amount of guns you can choose from. Revolvers, pistols, shotguns, repeaters, rifles and more. Every single one feels like they should. The hit-feedback is amazing. I quite enjoyed the fact that bullets actually caused bulletholes in bodies depending on where you hit them and not just plain blood effects.What about the soundtrack? Breathtaking. While being scripted most of the times (there are no radios on horses duh) it gave the gunfights that certain ""something"".  The soundtrack made me wanna be a gunslinger wandering around on a horse. Not even exaggerating at this point. My personal favourite is ""American Venom"". Soundtracks that are not performed during combat are mostly harmonica ones.. since RDR2 takes place in the late 19th century. Okay, after praising the game i want to tell you something i did not like. The controls felt rather clunky in certain situations. I know Arthur is not a trained elite fighter. Instead of doing a roll he just throws himself into the ground when jumping to the side while aiming a weapon. Also, looking for cover can be fiddly since Arthur just goes to the nearest cover possible. By the way i played with a controller so i don't know what it's like with mouse and keyboard. Probably worse.Sometimes the horse does what it  wants and struggles to jump over the simplest obstacles or even worse; tripping over small rocks. While first being rather funny it got annoying.While reading other reviews you might have noticed how bad the online mode is. Does it really deserve the hate? I think it does partially.  While the PvE modes offer a wide variety of missions like heists, bounty hunting or robberies, the PvP experience is where it starts to stink. There is no shortage of coward cheaters in this game who will kill you for no reason. Does not matter if it's in free roam, during a mission or the shootout modes. They'll use godmodes, aimbots or invisibility cheats  to ruin your day. I encounter a cheater every fifth or sixth match. Apart from that the online mode is pure grinding. As a newbie you don't stand the slightest chance against other players in PvP. They have more HP, more stamina, better equipment and the worst of all far better dead eye abilities that are just unfair. Even if you want to change your clothing you must grind for several hours. A cool looking coat  or a somewhat decent gun cost around 250$ ingame dollars. A mission (approx. 15 minutes) usually rewards you with around 10-30$. You do the math. I'm not saying the online mode is not fun at all. I enjoy hanging out with fellow gunslingers and doing shenanigans but speaking of PvP... i recommend sticking to PvE (especially as a new player). I wish Rockstar Games would make more effort banning the cheaters.The single player is one of the best experiences i have had in video games. The story,  visuals,  cinematics, soundtrack,  gameplay has set up new standards for every upcoming triple A title.This Rockstar Game's open world   is a game you'll lose yourself in for 50-100 hours if not longer. You don't even have to like the western setting to appreciate the love and effort they put in this marvelous game. Regarding Red Dead Online; if you stick to PvE and have no problems with grinding it is fine. You will encounter good & bad people just like in any other game.9,5/10"

928,jnbek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jnbek/,6,,1,250.8,January,"23,",399,0,1,"Disclaimer: I have not played the Online Mode, the 229 hours you see logged are for the Story Mode only. I am one of those pedantic players who prefers to open the map, play all the side missions as they come available and wander around checking out everything in my path, I also have not played this before on any other platform, so I can not offer any comparisons with the original platform release. I will start with the Story itself, the writing is top notch, there are very few holes in the story, each event has a purpose and serves to move the whole thing along. You're given the opportunity to shape your character's personality and will find yourself getting really attached to your characters and a number or the NPCs. I really like how well thought out the story lines were put together. I want to avoid spoiling anything but I really appreciate the zero tolerance for certain ways of thinking and how the consequences vary depending on the ideology of the NPC involved. Certain actions will be ignored if the NPCs ideology is repulsive, but if the NPC is forward thinking or well liked, the exact same actions will place you in a pretty difficult situation that will prove hard to escape from. I became very attached to my character and was very invested in how things turned out. Next is overall gameplay. I found the controls very intuitive and responsive using the keyboard and mouse. The older technology in the weaponry did pose some challenges initially, these are not GTA weapons with high fire rates, they reflect the technology of the day and you're required to work with these limitations accordingly. I was impressed with the attention to detail with the weaponry, how the horses and wagons handled, and the need to properly care for your horse as well as yourself. I did get somewhat annoyed with the idea that the temperature was 42F and I go and got my ass bitten by a snake, beings as a snake is mostly unable to move at those temperatures, but this was a minor annoyance. Some of the AI for the other wildlife was also a bit weird, but made for some rather humorous interactions. Overall the controls and the feel is very comfortable and easy to work with.The graphics are beautiful, again the attention to detail is remarkable. I ended up playing at a lower setting, for those with powerhouse graphics cards, the possibilities are endless. But even on the lower settings, every blade of grass has it's own unique movement depending on weather conditions, movement of animals, NPCs, etc... you can actually see the grass react when a snake is 20-30 feet off moving away from you. The clouds were natural, the rain was great, I got caught in a thunderstorm and I was legitimately blown away by the level of detail, the heavy rain affected long distance views even more so than a normal shower and the lightning effect blew my mind. Overall performance, 95% of the time, I had no problems with performance, there were occasional times when jumping on a horse and attempting to leave town in any kind of hurry, there were occasional 'blips'. I did have issues with crashes that a number of other reviewers have mentioned. I made no effort to try to fix anything, but almost on queue, after about 3.5 hours of playing, the game would crash. I did notice that it tended to be more common when using the Steam Overlay, or if a Steam Notification popped up particularly when attempting the above getting on a horse to leave town behavior. Once I stopped using the Steam Overlay, the occurrences of crashes were reduced significantly, there were a few days where I played 8-10 hours and did not have any crashes at all, only for the next day to have it crash an hour in. I was pretty annoyed by these crashes, but it is worth noting that never did I have the game crash when on a mission and I'm a pedantic saver, so I had no issues of losing any progress. I never went as far as disabling the Steam Overlay to see if that corrected the crashes, but I'm convinced that this is where the core problem lies.IMO this is the best game story wise that Rockstar has ever made to date. Rockstar never disappoints when it comes to graphics and detail in their games either, they push whatever hardware they develop to the max and make a beautiful presentation with a story you can get invested in. You will find plenty of easter eggs, mysteries and some things that will make you kinda sad and other things that will make you go ""Oh wow!!"" scattered all over the map, if you just go looking for them. Overall this is a 10/10 game, but the crashing force me to give it an 8.5/10."

The environments are lush and the long draw distances make the game look gorgeous. I have fooled people before that screenshots from this game are real photos, that's how real it looks in some instances. While the shadows and reflections aren't quite as good as some of the new RTX titles, they still look amazing. The only place where the graphics fall short is the textures. They often looked blurry and I installed a mod that allowed me to apply a sharpness filter to fix this. ---{Gameplay}---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It‘s just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don'tDespite some wacky controls and mildly irritating small glitches, I really enjoyed the gameplay aspects of this game. Gunplay was fun and the missions had a lot of variety. The variety of the missions was great as you didn't expect the same exact thing with each missions. This was an especially good thing after recently playing a Ubisoft game. Some of the controls, specifically the horse controls, were mildly annoying. Sometimes my horse would just go in random directions and I failed missions as as result. I guess this is realistic, but not something I want when playing a video game. And because of the similarity of some controls, I sometimes found myself accidentally shooting or strangling someone instead of getting on my horse or initiating dialogue. The cover system was also bad, but not quite GTA V levels of bad. Another thing that may not be for everyone is the extreme level of realism in the game. There are several mechanics such as you character's and horse's weight, whether your character was hot or cold, and your horse's mood that could be mildly tedious at times to manage. While this may be a good thing for some as it can help with immersion, when I am playing a game I just don't want to worry about these things. In addition, Rockstar is kind of encouraging eating disorders with the ability for your character to lose weight by simply not eating or gain weight by spamming down an ungodly amount of snacks. Again. this mechanic isn't entirely bad, it just wasn't for me.  ---{Audio}---☑ Eargasm☐ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deafI was very pleasantly surprised by the music in this game. I have never played a western before this, and I was expecting more twangy country style music (narrow minded, I know). Instead, I got some of the best music I have ever heard in any digital work. There was unique music for each of the major missions that was uniquely fitting for that mission and the tone of the game. I found myself humming the songs even after I stopped playing the game. My favorite song in the game was ""Unshaken,"" which Rockstar got D'Angelo to perform specifically for this game. The scenes with this song were some of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in gaming. In addition to the music, the ambient sounds, sound effects, and voice acting were all convincing and added to the game. ---{Audience}---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ AllM rating is accurate. Plenty of violence, foul language, and heavy content to ensure that the game is not suitable for children. ---{PC Requirements}---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☐ Fast☑ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computerWhile much better than what I read it was like at launch, this game still has some optimization issues and doesn't perform as I would like on my PC hardware. Combine this with the game being overall very demanding and you get mediocre framerates on all except the best hardware. I was playing at 4K on a combination of ultra, high, and medium settings and got anywhere from 55-80 FPS depending on the situation. I have an RTX 3090 and 3900XT, so my PC is a beast. Not bad performance and totally playable, but I would've liked a consistent 70+. Also got some random stutters, which was odd and mildly annoying. ---{Difficulity}---☐ Just press 'W'☑ Easy☐ Significant brain usage☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Difficult☐ Dark SoulsI didn't have trouble with this game at all. The abilities such as deadeye and dual wielding made it much easier and more fun. ---{Grind}---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☑ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You‘ll need a second life for grindingFor the main story, there is no need to grind, as you get plenty of money from just the main story missions. In fact, I consistently found myself with too much money with nothing to spend it on. The only scenario I could see the need for grinding is if one was trying to collect every single item in the game, or just kept spamming down so many snacks that you'd buy out every single general store on the map. ---{Story}---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It‘ll replace your lifeThe story is by far the best part of this game. While a little slow at the beginning, it is absolutely worth getting through it as the middle and end of the story is phenomenal. The story is very emotional and can make you laugh and cry all withing the same mission. The characters are amazing, and I can easily see why some say that Arthur Morgan is the best video game protagonist ever made. His story arc along with the other characters' is beautifully written. It is extremely difficult to put into words just how beautiful the story of this game is. The main story consists of 6 chapters and 2 epilogue chapters. The epilogue, while good, felt like it was drawn out and was a bit of a letdown after the phenomenal main story. It was filled with somewhat mundane missions that involved scooping horse sh*t to constructing a house that could have easily been made into cut-scenes. However, from what I've read, the epilogue does an excellent job of setting up RDR1 if you plan on playing that (Sadly I won't play it unless Rockstar makes a PC port remaster as it is a last gen console exclusive, and I only have a PC). Mostly I feel that the epilogue could have been condenced into something around half to two thirds of the length that it was. All this said, I would consider this game a masterpiece, and the story is why. ---{Game Time}---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyondTook me 55 hours to beat the main story and epilogue with very few side missions (I honestly wish I had played a few more). ---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your moneyEasily worth the price for this masterpiece. Despite the fact that I got this game as a gift, I would easily pay full price for it knowing how amazing it is. ---{Bugs}---☐ Never heard of☑ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsOnly a few mildly annoying bugs such as my horse always being irritated and the audio being extraordinarily quiet (easily remedied by simply turning up the volume), but nothing game breaking. ---{Verdict}---I am a die-hard science fiction fan. When I got this game as a gift from my friend I was genuinely not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Despite this being the polar opposite of the games I usually play, I enjoyed it equally as much if not more than any science fiction game. If I can get as much enjoyment from this game as I did, I genuinely believe that anyone can. There are very few games that I would be comfortable calling masterpieces, and this is one of them."

PS4 (muddy as all hell - don't buy), Xbox One X (okay, but has HDR issues), Rockstar Store (unwanted launcher), Steam (unwanted launcher, but with easier to see achievements).Game prefers CPUs with more cores due to file I/O thread design; lower core CPUs (especially CPUs without HyperThreading) will hitch during asset streaming. Ryzen CPUs are especially good at avoiding sharp 1% low events, but not so good at achieving maximum framerate. Given the game's absurd GPU taxing quality presets, the distinction between Intel and AMD's strengths largely don't matter. Just get a CPU with SMT (HyperThreading) and you'll avoid wild framerate fluctuations.The rest falls entirely on your GPU. My RTX 2080 Ti does 4K HDR @50 FPS with negligible variation at mostly high settings (2.2 GHz GPU, 7.4 GHz Memory). Expect to spend some quality time fiddling with settings until you get volumetric effects (you want these!) looking good and performance stable.Special K has limited support for this game. Threading, and SteamAPI features work, but the overlay (and framerate limiter) only works on NVIDIA hardware and only with the game running in HDR mode.

STAY AWAY UNTIL IT'S FIXED.PLAY IT FOR THE SINGLE-PLAYER NOT THE MULTI-PLAYER(10/10)PROS+Arthur Morgan is one of the best characters in ANY form of media, not just video-games. I  honestly cannot stress how incredible of a character he is.+A masterpiece of a story and one of the best stories ever told in ANY form of media. Seriously, it will leave you emotionally wrecked (in a fantastic way).  +Best open world so far with a ton of stuff to do (Cyberpunk may overtake it but who knows).+Beautiful soundtrack (Especially House building theme, Unshaken and That's the way it is).+Tense missions such as the train robbery missions.+Gorgeous visuals.+Incredible performances from all the cast.+Tahiti.+Great sound effects.+Incredible animations.+Extremely detailed and lifelike (Arthur’s pupils dilate, horses have shrinking balls, your gun performance changes on whether it is clean or dirty).CONS-Can feel clunky and over slow (I understand the game is MEANT to be slow but sometimes it can be a little too time consuming, especially for those of us who have jobs/school).-Guarma was cool but felt a little out of place (On a side-note Rockstar NEEDS to make a pirate game).-Bad optimization and performance-Game design is outdated and most missions end the same way.-Intro feels like one large tutorial but at least it serves as a good introduction to the characters and story. Don't skip it.-Despite the animations being the best we have seen in a video game, they can be a little too long and slow (Modders will probably resolve this).-No single-player DLC so far nor is any being planned (I am still hoping Rockstar surprises us).-Online is getting better but still lacks variety and can get stale after a while.Overall score:10/10- It may have flaws but it is still a true masterpiece.BUY FULL PRICE!"

Now it crashes roughly every half hour. I'd be somewhat forgiving of it if it weren't for the game NOT auto saving at some points during a mission... I'm writing this after having had to restart the same long mission 7 times because the game always crashed during it. Last attempt it crashed literally seconds before finishing the mission, yet on relaunching the game it still makes me start the mission from scratch... Unacceptable."

Don't worry, they aren't many.+ Great attention to detail (as I said in the beginning). The world is full of wildlife, the vegetation is diverse. The cities are bustling with life,the people are always doing something - they broom their property, talk to each other, smoke, drink, play cards; there are small animals like cats and dogs,it's just so nice and comfy.+ The scenery is very beautiful. What I really appreciate is that each area you go through feels completely different and has a unique atmosphere,attached to it. Jungles, forests, snowy mountains, beaches, you have it all.+ Amazing voice-acting on Arthur Morgan. The main character is pretty decent, to be honest.+ You can grow a huge beard and have a cool hat.Well... To be honest I was expecting the pros to be a little more than that, but truly I don't see anything else that would classify as a 'pro'.Let's see what's up with the cons.- Incredibly slow and mundane gameplay. I understand that the game is meant to be enjoyed slowly, but it's too much. I thought Red Dead was a game, where you are supposed to robtrains and banks and cause chaos. However, most of the missions are just a long-ass stroll with a bit of gunnin' here and there. The looting animations are soooooooooooooslow, too - it takes ages looting a pile of bodies or skinning an animal.- Pretty much a non-existent story. Basically, you're a part of a gang and do errand-boy stuff, so you can get your boss a nice new home on an exotic island.- Way too many characters. I don't know the names of 75% of Red Dead's characters, because they appear like 2 times in the whole game. Not only that,but they are so badly made - they are either very bland and completely lacking any kind of personality or they are so stupidly stereotypical, thattheir way of acting feels forced as hell. I didn't get emotionally attached to any of them- Every single gun feels absolutely the same. There is literally no reason for you to own more than 1 repeater, they all shoot at the same speed and have similar damage. Even if they didn't, you're always aiming for the head, right? Why would you even care what damage they have if you always 1-tap your enemy. The revolvers are cool, but they are useless. The customization options are terrible as well.- Nobody, except for blacks, say 'niġger'. When it comes to that word, it's always substituted with 'blackie' or 'darkie'. Now I understand that the slavery is over, butdo you REALLY think that after it was abolished and everyone magically started acting like they've always known it was wrong and are totally against it? I don't think so.- Karma system... Are you for real? ... This is a game, where you are the BAD guy, a villain, a robber and a murderer and you put a KARMA system??? I remember RDR1 also having such system,which pissed me off back then as well. So basically - I go to a town, rob a bank, kill 250 police officers and then I go into another town, greet 5 people and my Karma goes up? K.If there was a respect system - that would have been a different story.- Atrocious horse physics. Your horse tips over the tiniest little pebble on the road which can result into it breaking its neck.- Boring missions as a whole.- Dull soundtrack.- The legendary animal clothing is the ugliest abomination in the world.- The inventory management sucks. Too many items doing the exact same thing. Keep these things simple! Why would I need 100 different kinds of food that restore the same stat?- Failed core system.- Glitches, bugs, crashes, launching issues and horrible optimization.- Terrible Ultimate edition items and addons for a stupidly high price.Well, there we go. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me, but that's how I really feel.Everyone has the right to have an opinion and just know that I genuinely feel happy for you, if you are enjoying the game, although I sure as heck didn't!Also.....SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD WAS GONNA HANG MEI AIN'T THE SHARPEST OUTLAW AROUNDTHEY WERE LOOKIN KINDA DUMBWITH THEIR SEMI-AUTO GUNSAND THE PINKERTON BADGE ON THEIR JACKETSWELLWE WON'T STOP RUNNINAND WE CAN'T STOP RUNNINBACK TO THE PLANAND I HIT THE TRAIN GUNNINDIDN'T MAKE SENSE NOT TO LIVE FOR CASHYOUR PLAN GOES WRONGAND YOUR FRIENDS DIE FASTSO MUCH TO STEALA GANG TO FEEDSO WHAT'S WRONG WITH A BANK ROBBERYIF YOU DOUBT ME YOU'RE NEVER SAFEYOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT IF YOU LOSE FAITHHEY NOW, YOU'RE AN OUTLAWPUT YOUR MASK ONGET PAIDHEY NOW, YOU'RE IN MY GANGFOLLOW MY PLANHAVE FAITHBUT ALL THAT WILD WEST IS GONEONLY THE ISLANDS HAVE MY MANGOES"

See my stream on RDR2 Below; Hot air balloons, Horses, Prison Breaks, Bank robberies, tuberculosis, family feuds, snitches, Dutch's orders, ramblings, and keeper of his insanity. Buying this, you are in for an extremely amazing journey, more than 60 hours GUARANTEED STORY MODE, and travelling. Also up to you to prioritize, but travel = fast = your horse, or the horses you find, etc.This is 'My Little Pony' For adults. 99% of your RDR2 life is with your horse. You are nothing without your horse. Life in 1899 revolved around you having horsepower. Ain't no outlaw without horsepower.This game is marketed as 3rd Person Cowboy simulator:: BUT: :You can play first person cowboy!There is fast travel and this is how: It also becomes a very beautiful screensaver. You mark on the map where you want to travel, so you have the red mark, and then you hold V, enter cinematic mode, in the world, so that your horse navigates to the end mark with automation. You can hold shift to sprint, or tap it, etc. but otherwise, you can sip a drink, chill, relax, listen to the ambient sounds of the game. Escapism at its finest.The bugs noticed: 3rd person on   a horse, Arthur keeps putting a gun away that you are not holding, as it's holstered, and he keeps doing the animation as though he's putting it away when holding shift, and turning around corner, to the right, sucks, but doesn't break the game.Game breaking bug: played up until like 38% - Vulkan. I searched for 22 dinosaur bones, then the next day, the game will NOT start. Not safe mode, not altered settings. Only changing vulkan to DX12 fixed it. Now the game has longer loading times, etc. DX12 is a pain. Vulkan had that one bug. Loading into Chapter 3/ near the end, was not possible.You play Arthur Morgan, there will be lassoing of people -taking hostages, hunting animals in the wild, bows and arrows, guns, headshots, missions rankings- upon completions/bronze/silver/gold/R* ranks.You have three stats affecting you and the horse, which is health points and energy points, and you the gunslinger has a dead eye, where you squint for the best shots. The guns are cool, expensive back in the day, and very customizable. The mission types feels almost endless. I played block domino's, went bounty hunting, story witness searching to confirm something really happened and of the first  4, 2 were not crazy enough to mess with Arthur. The time of this era, feels like community building where everyone works together. There's so many letters to find, with small details. Or a location of where something is going wrong, and you are there to help fix it. Things go wrong. It's super fun. And that's just the way life is.  It's incredibly deep <Story Mode> You're on the run - I didnt play RDR 1 - so I dont know if it's connecting to Blackwater that way.. :/0 crashes in vulkan once all the settings are optimized, played for 5 hours straight last night. <28~29 December 2019> and used only like 1kwh.

Numerous community 'optimization guides' prove just how badly this game runs, as half of the graphics settings have inane and arbitrary performance hits. I can't stress enough how suffocating this game's performance has a tendency to be. Narrative pacing is so slow it is almost unbearable. Numerous major online bugs still haven't been fixed after half a year, and continuous server issues have plagued the game since release, even on consoles. It almost seems like Rockstar put forth an obligatory, cursory effort to port this game to PC and then moved on.I personally feel that Rockstar screwed the pooch on this. Joke's on me though, I didn't ask for a refund within the 2 hours of 'gameplay' it took for me to adjust the graphics settings just to get the game to run at a quasi-stable 60fps."

I originally bought this game because I love cowboys and westerns and it did not fail me. The story is amazing, many touching moments and the freedom of choice is something I adore about this game. You can either be known as a terrible man or a very honorable one. The characters are acted very well and you can see them as almost real individuals. Arthur Morgan is great, that's all I need to say. There is never a dull moment in the story and you can play it however you like! Online is fun, yet there are many downsides. Hackers, Modders, very grindy, glitches, etc. If you want to play online, do so with a friend or a group. I stayed up countless nights messing around with my friend(s) and having the time of my life. If you have none of those or like to be a lone wolf, online is a great time waster and I have found myself spending hours listening to music and hunting.  The game goes on sale often so I'd say wait for the sale, but if you really want to, it is worth the full price. 10/10 love this game and I bet you will to."

We can discuss the finer details of the foolishness of such an assumption in the comments if you want to.This game is like being in an abusive relationship. There are some good qualities to it but man... does it get ugly.I won't deny that the SP content is fantastic but from a technical point of view RDR2 is a mess. RDO is even worse.We get loading screens that won't stop, flickering screens that require a restart, inventory is inconsistent, base camp won't show up or disappear mid game, pelts disappear fresh after skinning, inability to mercy kill an animal after a fumbled shot without reducing carcass quality (which is strange since it exists in SP though), despawning corpses over a ridiculously small range, broken towns where for some reason you can't use their services anymore, randomly killed bounties (they were fine a second ago, I turn around... DEAD... Red Dead I guess), completed missions that won't get registered, stuck animations that break the game (particularly entering the moonshine shack), inability to pick up bounties therefore not being able to finish the mission, inability to start new missions because ""You have done a job too recently."" which was half an hour ago, slow transaction of trades when selling a lot of items (Processing Transaction...), slow crafting (similar to the Processing Transaction bug), and a couple of visual glitches.To my surprise that became quite the list and I have only written down the common issues I've encountered on a regular basis the last couple of weeks. Now one could argue that some of those issues might get fixed over the course of the next couple of decades. Given how quickly Rockstar deals with exploits to dupe items or gold it is painfully obvious that gameplay issues aren't a priority.Then there are some questionable or disappointing gameplay design decisions. A big chunk of content is locked behind the premium currency, namely the 4 roles. It's 15 gold per role, 25 for the moonshiner. That's a lot for a full price title. There are ways to get gold through gameplay, even if slowly.Bounty missions (once purchased) provide gold, based on how long it takes you to finish it. The longer it takes you, the more gold you get... wow... just, wow.If you thought you could play RDO to play a co-op PvE version of the game... well... no. PvP is definitely the focus and you're part of it whether you like it or not. Setting yourself up for defensive play does next to nothing to protect you from other players. The idea is that they can't lock on to you (gamepad controls), do significantly less damage and can't crit. It still only takes about two shots to get killed. Granted, thankfully you don't lose anything when dying aside from being respawned somewhere in the rough vicinity, which can easily cause you to fail missions though. Really, all ""Defensive Mode"" does is exclude you from missions that have a PvP element in them, which is the vast majority. Story missions set you to offensive play but conveniently don't put you back.Is there any way to protect you from griefers and trolls you might wonder?Well, we have the parley mechanic which protects you from getting shot by that player for a limited time. Why on earth this isn't default for defensive play is beyond me. After the timer expires you're free to be harassed again.The other option is to press charges which gives the offender a whoppin' 50 cents bounty and increases his hostility level for a limited time. The latter means his radar blip is visible from further away and at high hostility he gets to be attacked by anyone without repercussions. I'm not sure how that is punishment for someone who clearly wants PvP, yet does not want to play one of the many particular game modes that exist for that exact purpose.Out of 10 player interactions 8 are bad experiences. You might say that the devs are not responsible for player actions, which is true but they do provide the ground rules and environment. Hate the game not the player is quite an apropriate saying in this case.The player issues could be easily resolved by having private sessions/servers which isn't possible. While I understand there are reasons for it, people who just don't want to play with randos are simply out of luck.You can't even start the story missions without having to get on the matchmaking queue. I understand that it should be an option but I can't even attempt to solo the missions?

Let's start with the down sides  gifted us with the PC port of RDR 2 . . .[-] Optimization kinda OK now, after several patches/ updates. But it's still not perfect![-] Bugs & Game breaking glitches still present in the game.[-] At some point, the game uses more resource than it should. These also bind with optimization issue, I guess![-]  RDR Online is a blunt boring game mode as soon as the online story missions ends.[+] Beautiful & Meaningful huge open world.[+] Wildlife has a rhythm in their lifestyle. Thanks to smart A! . . .[+] Enough customization & varieties in weapons, horses & clothing as well.[+] Very relaxing & pleasure to explore gameplay style.[+] Engaging story mode with meaningful characters![+] Various weather effects are very close to realism & eye soothing.[+] Voice act & overall sound quality is top notch![+] Graphical details are amazing everywhere u look at this game!"

Don't get me wrong, if I didn't have to deal with the whole Rockstar Games Launcher, and I didn't have to deal with the Activation error window, which literally takes you back to the desktop, I would certainly recommend this... but as things stand, maybe test your luck, some people may not find this too frustrating, others may not have any problems at all. hopefully Rockstar gives us the chance to play the single player game mode while being offline and not have to worry about Rockstar's online interface. --------------------------------------updateAfter several months after purchase Rockstar has not made any improvements to the initial problems I had with this game. It has gotten worse actually, now the game won't launch, verifying the game's files and re-installing the rockstar launcher, the game itself does not fix the issue, the game fails to launch consistently at every step... DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, Rockstar does not support their PC ports.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3rd Update... After trying several times to get a hold of costumer support, which was painful, the contact by email feature is the only one that works (some times), the direct chat and the call feature for how to get in touch with Rockstar customer support DO NOT WORK. I was replied on my email that I have to delete every single rockstar related folder on the C-Drive, delete my Steam Folder, delete any other rockstar games, they even gave me the file directories for what to delete...deleting your steam folder also deletes every other steam game you have installed, so good luck with that... ♥♥♥♥ THIS COMPANY your launcher does not work, you make it impossible to play these games' singleplayer mode offline, and provide worst customer support than EA?!?

999,Parzalai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Parzalai/,4,,1,72.9,January,"13,",415,0,1,"Simply put, this game excels in an insane amount of aspects - Visuals, Animations, Sounds, Activities and most importantly, Story.I've completed the game on release on my PS4 and I'm in the process of replaying it on PC. The game at first had enamoured me in 2018. Before playing this game, I never really thought of video games as Art Forms, just some fun stuff to do when you're bored.After completing the game, I was left contemplating it for a full week, I seriously had this stuck in my mind, especially the ending of the story. Below is a basic summary.- Bad gameplay loop, controls can be sluggish and annoying to use, missions are usually shoot shoot and very linear, like every single other R* game.- #SAVEREDDEADONLINE : The Online mode has major potential but is infested with unfair and stupid ass Micro - Transactions and the promised, advertised major DLCs ended up being MONTH LONG DOUBLE EXP.... Online grind is hit or miss fun, with friends it's great.- Performance, could be improved, DLSS does a good bit but even on a 3070, ultra @ 1080p can drop to 30fps and sometimes the game enters a weird broken loop where I'm playing on 2 - 20 fps.- The number one highlight of this game, . To sum it up, the story is beautiful, heartbreaking, action-packed, daunting, and just revering. I speak fully about the story at the end of this review.- Gwafiks, game look near photo-realistic, the sky is favourite of mine, it looks so real. . On a serious note though, the way snow crushes under your foot, the you see your horses muscles flex in their running, the astutely detailed gore and death animations with a GTA IV - esque ragdoll. The way water refracts and reflects, sculpting itself to your movements, simply great.- Animations, the type of thing that you never notice, but adds so much to gameplay, the horses, feel like horses, the tackle animation is lifelike asf, the way your character stabs someone is gruelling, just an insane amount of detail to idle animations, eating, fishing and so much more.- Mechanics, mainly coming from RDR1, the Dead Eye system is amazing and really fits the cowboy shoot off theme, additionally, R* increases the immersion by having a health system, eat to much, phat boi, eat nothing, skinny twig. There's a hair growth system, your hair grows with time. There are 3 cores, Health - Stamina - Dead Eye + The same for your horse exc Dead Eye. You keep these cores 100% by eating food and the more you uses it, the higher your capacity is for these cores.- Voice Acting (Actors/ress') / Sounds, are eloquent, they are masterfully made, from the snow crushing, mud crushing, to the daunting voice of Angry Dutch, all the actors were perfectly casted and R* did a great job sourcing out the sounds for every minute detail.- Open World / Activities are insane, there's so much to do from the hunting, fishing, general shops and games to the stranger missions and collectable hunts the game offers, this will keep you on the game for hours I cannot wait to 100% this game. The Online also offers additional content such as the story mode and train heists, but your fun will end if you finish all the mission, being left to do GTA Online grinding (Cargo, so on...). Mods also offer a good bit, such as purchasable properties and more, but these are not supported by R(*)ckstar so you will get banned if you play online whilst having these installed.You play as Arthur Morgan, in the Van Der Linde Gang of which RDR1s John Marston was also in. The times are comin, American Civilisation and Law is conquering Native America and Outlaws / Gangs are slowly dying, The Van Der Linde Gang is of the little remaining gangs being hunted down by the Pinkertons (Lawmen / Police).You go through the journey of violence and tranquillity, maturing and realising the wrongs of your own and people around you. The devs used music, cinematography and voice acting to absolutely pull the player into the life of Arthur Morgan, putting you beyond any other media form - This isn't a movie, you don't  the story, you  the story, you decide what type of person you want to be, adding to the replayability.The story has strong portrayals of mental health and intra-personal conflicts, confronting fears and worries, accepting them and overcoming them. The story sort of puts you through a philosophical awakening of material living over faithful living, letting you live a Machiavellian life or move like a true Stoic in trying times. Rockstar is very known for their comedic and satirical portrayal of modern America and the flaws around it, most notable GTA V - facing the flaws of the government system and corrupt officials, as well as commercial submission and the TikTok life. But in RDR2 R* take a rightfully need turn darker to an early 1900s America, facing the stark truth of how Native America was snatched, aggressively and forcefully by colonisers. The story faces issues of racism, sexism and colonialism in its Main and Side Missions. The USA, the one that was the Great One, is the enemy, it rears its ugly head of capitalism and technological dominance in Saint Denis, the hub of America and ""Civilisation"". Rockstar and it's directors do a great job in being the one out of a hundred that go the way that usually doesn't get done out of sheer fear of backlash.Simply put; For me, Red Dead Redemption 2s Story is single-handedly the best story I've ever played, this may be different for you - I mean, I haven't played every game, there may be another masterpiece out there - But, currently for me, the Story is amazing and memorising, it's a must-have."

If you don't grind day and night or become a hacker, it's impossible to make enough money and gold. You need to eat like a pig to keep your stats from falling, horses are extremely needy, which would be fantastic for the campaign part, but in a multiplayer you have to keep hunting and spend your hard-earned money on ammunition just to keep you alive. So your savings would be almost nothing.It's nothing like many other MMOs out there after a few hours of play online it gets extremely repetitive and annoying to continue there are many other games that have better ECO systems"

Some aspects in online are actually better than story. However the servers are not working half the time.

I pre-ordered and played it as soon as it was listed on Steam, and then released. No shame in that, it's hard to say no to a single player Rockstar game, but...This game is essentially, in my eyes, Rockstar's swan song. They're not as interested in single player content anymore, with this game and Grand Theft Auto 5 having ample opportunity for more content through DLC. However, their eyes are now dead set on multiplayer, which is a shame because their games are absolute powerhouses for single player. This is further cemented by the fact the last strong arm talent, Dan Houser, left the company last year.Beforehand, the ""Rockstar Launcher"" is absolute hot garbage. Pirate the game if you bought it already, it's a better experience.The story is a prequel, and it's so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good. It has so much damn content, I've been on a single chapter for almost a week because I'm trying to collect everything before moving on for a 100% playthrough that I'm doing more recently, which really says how much there is to do, before you even realize there are 6 chapters PLUS an epilogue. If you're not trying to 100% and collect everything that could be missed, you could probably finish the story in a day or two, but you really shouldn't try speed running it because you may slow down later in the chapters kinda confused after you skipped all the story dialogue. This isn't a Pokemon game, so, don't treat it like one.When you get over the story and want something else to do, it's basically a ""wild"" west sandbox. Shoot someone? you can do that. Shoot near someone? Definitely. Shoot the ground? The ground doesn't care. Shoot someone while they're shooting you shooting them? Yeah. You get the idea. Hunt animals to shoot someone with? Why not. This is a Rockstar game, so you can have some mods to improve the enjoyment of the sandbox. Look at Rampage trainer with a decent spawner system, or Lenny's Simple Trainer for a simple trainer. The hint is in the name.The graphics are pretty good for how I play, a mix of Medium-Low, with Ultra textures on. It doesn't look amazing, but I really favor higher framerates instead of looks. I've had issues with grainy shadows but they've mostly gone away, save for some specific instances. You can turn that off by turning Soft Shadows to Low, or Shadows on High with MSAA off.Multiplayer. I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hate it. Coming from someone who played Hour 1 Grand Theft Auto Online. I hate both of them. Grand Theft Auto Online and Red Dead Online are not games, they're literally why Rockstar doesn't care about single player anymore. Why make investing stories when you can just create an online mode with microtransactions to make simple money? I don't want to believe it's Rockstar who decided on this, and my rose-tinted glasses wants to blame Take-Two, but I don't want to deal with either of them. I'm going to add my Grand Theft Auto Online experience here, too, since it'll help to add understanding to my reasoning.I'll be honest, I cheated online in both of them. It's so commonplace, and it's the only way to make both of them a fun experience, otherwise you have to grind and grind. Grand Theft Auto 4's online was fun because you can just hop on in, and boom you can have fun. There was no grinding or anything, it was (for pc players, can't say the same for console) a fun online sandbox. When Grand Theft Auto 5 online came out, I was doing the first race the same minute it was released on Xbox 360. I played it a bunch, grinding that Martin mission to get a high-end apartment. It was alright, until they nerfed the ever-living ♥♥♥♥ out of the rewards from that mission and Gerald's mission. When it came out for PC, it was an alright experience, their promised heist experience that was met with questionable response not really rewarding much was finally out at that point, and playing around with some friends was humorous at first. It finally hit the ""fun"" status when I cheated in hundreds of millions of dollars to afford any kind of enjoyment that their games usually came with, and subsequently banned for it.But when Red Dead Online came out, same problem. Grinding stupid ♥♥♥♥. A friend and I just cheated a few hundred gold bars just to do any kind of fun activity when the major stuff like Collector, Trader, Bounty Hunter, and Moonshiner were available. There's a fifth one, but I just can't be arsed go back on to play it. After we got to do stuff like that together, the actual game became more fun, nudging to the fact that you can bypass the ""treasure hunting gold nugget"" grind by buying their... gold bars for real money. How fun. I'd rather be permanently banned from online. Rockstar's games aren't really meant to be grindy online experiences, that's already reserved for Runescape and other RPGs like Destiny 2.They've also added a battle pass system, for some godforsaken reason. Battle passes are annoying, and just add to the disdain I have for online. I got the husky for my camp, and Arthur's hat a few passes ago, and I basically dipped. Huskies are my favorite dog breed.The last nail in the coffin for both of these online modes is... the exclusives. Both of them suffer from exclusive online items. Grand Theft Auto Online has cars, weapons, and Benny's. Red Dead has some weapons, horses, and saddles. You can get them in single player, but they have some issues when it comes to saving. An example would be . There's so much content that they already have in the game that they could just make available in single player, but they are absolutely content on preventing any of it being available for the single player sandbox. That is absolutely infuriating, and to see it happen twice is already a break of integrity to their next games. Why play them if you can't enjoy everything there without needing to use mods to just be able to access it? Why do you need mods in the first place?Let's not hide the fact that Take-Two (and maybe Rockstar) tried killing OpenIV a few years ago, and more recently DCMAing mods that add maps from previous games. How long until the Nuevo Paraiso mods for Red Dead Redemption 2 get DCMA'd by them because it added content from the first Red Dead Redemption? I can't be the judge of if it's fair use or not, I'm just some guy.Mods. Rockstar games are more known for their mods. Red Dead Redemption 2 has some mods, like ones that improve the gun metal, and there's an upscale mod for engravings and woods on guns to make them look better. There's the two trainers I pointed to earlier as well, and the like. This game, however, just doesn't really have a major modding scene yet. It's still a bit early to tell, and it doesn't help that OpenIV still hasn't been able to fully decode the game files yet. A bunch of them are still named in hash when trying to view the files. It can't be fully decked out, yet, but hopefully soon. There are some stuff there, though. I also have the Basically, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a great prequel. I recommend you play it for the single player, only. Do not play multiplayer, it's not worth the grind nor the time. I guess I can finally stop hoping for Bully 2 now, as well."

Not only is it incredibly detailed down to the blades of individual grass and swing of trees on a stormy afternoon, but really well thought out and researched through and through down to tobacco spittin and whiskey. Rockstar has yet again proven themselves as a worthy Game developer and publisher as well as a true knack for the arts as they take you to the wild wild west! The story is well written and takes you through  without the need to rush nor does it ever make you feel the need to press on. Six full chapters and an incredible two-part Epilogue that will take you on  a ride through the main protagonist eyes, Mr Arthur Morgan, A true Western ""cowboy"" if you will. A detailed story full of laughter, crime and decisions that will not only change your honour, but will make you question your actions as you progress! It truly is a story you will want to experience more than once with consecutive plays not only to discover all the game has to offer, but to really get to know the world Rockstar has created! Sit, relax and enjoy the ride.I take personal offence when people tell me that Red Dead Redemption 2 is too hard to get into because my only reply is “Alright, well, you’re missing out on one of the greatest stories ever told, but you do you.”Much of Red Dead 2’s strength lies in its incredibly realised characters, especially Arthur Morgan who might be my favourite fictional character to ever exist. Another theme present here that I’ve mentioned  is that the story, writing, and characterisation succeeds due to its subtlety.Arthur is relatively reserved, he doesn’t want to be mixed up in the drama of the rest of the Van der Linde gang and almost everything in the story just happens to or around him and he’s forced to deal with it. The fact that Red Dead Redemption is already a masterclass in video game writing and we just added gorgeous graphics and a new fantastic character means Rockstar were set up for success and they continued to prove themselves.There’s a deep pathos and empathy you feel for Arthur throughout his journey and experiences meaning you’re unlikely to forget Red Dead 2’s story any time soon.The open world is available as your playground but returning regularly to the linear story at the heart of the branching sub missions and activities is essential to carrying you toward the story’s grand conclusion. The story is riddled with tension as allegiances evolve and crumble, plans fall apart, and Arthur discovers there are some things that can’t be resolved with a gun or any amount of money.Your deep connection with Arthur is what winds you into every plot point and NPC interaction. You’ll be cheering at every win and have your heart aching at every loss and it’s just fantastic.1) The graphics (OMG)2) The Animations (Incredibly detailed and life-like) 3) The story (mouthwatering) 4) The Characters (Some you love, some you hate, but they work) 5) Exploration (Huge map packed with detail)6) Hunting (Requires giving a ♥♥♥♥ and implementing strategies) 7) Horses (Realism, training and companionship) 1) You need to take your time to fully enjoy what RDR2 has to offer.ex: DON'T fast travel! You WILL miss a lot! 2) Some mechanics can be tedious but rewarding. (Does make it truly realistic though) ex: Picking up ammo and shopping per item. 3) Wanted system can be dodgy at times.ex: Riding into someone by accident can cause a small bounty.  1) For full immersion a decent CPU and GPU are needed. ex: Playing on a RTX2080 Super with a Core I5 9700KF OC Avg frames 50-70 Ultra Quality  RDR2 is a game you will never forget. It pays such great homage to the first game and will immerse you in a world that is full of life! The story really gets to you emotionally and you will often find yourself getting lost in. I have spent hours crafting and looking for the perfect animal pelt and because it is so realistic with its planning and strategies. I have also really enjoyed all the activities from the gambling to bounty hunting and even horse training!!! Get ready for the western experience you have been waiting for.... Just buy it. It's truly worth it even at full price!"

The way the game starts the way world reacts around your behavior, the way every gang members talk with you i have never seen anything like this ever before. for few people it might seems the story starts kinda slow but thats cause of the story. game wants you to know everyone and slowly introducing every character so that you started to care about them like they really exist. That effects big time in endgame. Rockstar really nailed it big time.Music: another great part of this game. u will get a pure western feel and at the end when u were overwhelmed by emotion there will be some great songs to give you goosebumps multiple times. so yah hands down again !!!!Online: Nothing fancy here tbh. Almost  Every game is fun if you play with your friends. Rockstar will add so many contents in next couple of years that’s for sure (if you are a GTA Online Player you would trust them about that too) But still I wouldn’t recommended the game if only you want to play this game for online.

We absolutely got lost in it for the entirety of our Christmas holidays () when it came out on Steam. It's easily one of the best games I've ever played, and right up there with CoJ: Gunslinger and Gun in terms of the all-time best Western games....Red Dead Online, is where it falls apart. It's only enjoyable with friends, and a dull grind for anything worthwhile. We both got to Level 120+, but it wasn't anywhere near fun for most of that. We dropped it as we were just logging in for Daily Challenges for Gold Bars to keep that Daily Streak up, like some sort of job. We definitely got suckered into the grind - it played on people's impatience, and taking full advantage of their FOMO. Everything was set up in a way for you to not make money/have money taken away from you. Even mini-games and activities that were in SP were taken out of MP, purely because it would be a way to earn money. The economy didn't even make sense, compared to the period-correct-ish of singleplayer. We had our fun bits with it, but it honestly dampened and tarnished the outstanding singleplayer experience - we poured so much time into it hoping it would open up to what we played in the SP, but it just never did. The boardroom was definitely thinking about people's wallets rather than people's enjoyment when RDO was half-baked and strapped to the main game. It really could've been great, and it's sad that it was ruined out of typical GaaS greed.: Since we've stopped playing, Rockstar released Red Dead Online as a standalone release, cutting monetary and Gold Bar rewards even further to the experience I've outlined above. , don't buy Gold Bars and support this greed - play something else that respects you as a player and isn't solely after your wallet."

There are still disconnects and missing camps but It's more playable now than what was before. But I wanted change it to positive after completing story without any optimization problems or crashes. It was smooth, fun and has a really great story. It's more like reading a book than playing a game. It's just great. Definetly worth it.Singleplayer solely worths the full price. I'd like to think multiplayer as a bonus, where you can test gameplay mechanics with friends. Some sort of a sandbox. I played multiplayer first and left singleplayer for a time that I can play freely. Quarantine allowed me to play story and I'm happy and a little sad that I've finally finished it.There are minor problems on gameplay like game constantly switching your weapons and ammo after you start mission. Which can make you mad time to time. But it's an acceptable problem when you consider how smooth and fun the gameplay is.For me pros were:+ Awesome story+ Details on literally everything+ Choices+ Smooth western gunplay (especially fanning the hammer)+ Melee fights+ Memorable characters+ Random events+ Alive environment+ Beautiful graphics+ No fps drops, + No gamebreaking bugs + No serious crashes+ Fun hunting+ Awesome voice acting+ Smooth animations...+ and many more that I forgot.Cons:- Online issues- Forced weapon changes on missions- Annoying (but ignorable) tasks while doing missionsAs a result, I think this game is a masterpiece and you should go for it. For any price it's just worth it.Red dead redemption is GTA in 1899. It's fun and has a suspenseful story.I gave negative because rdr online is kicking me out from the multiplayer sessions with an error on their side. I'll keep it until they fix their game.SOLUTION:"

There's just so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and issues, there's some really painful grinding to be done for pristine animals and some very easy mistakes you can make that would rob you of a 100% run forcing a completely new game from scratch to achieve, not to mention the performance issues, bugs, crashes and all the usual technical faults present in a lazy port.As for Read Dead Online... Well it's a buggy, empty, hollow, cheater-filled excuse to hunt whales. The entire thing is a ridiculous grind designed purely to sell you gold bars - and by you I mean the 1% of players who generate 99% of Rockstar's annual revenue. Oh and if you use mouse and keyboard and don't want to play against controller aimbots (and would rather just play against regular cheater aimbots, but that's a different issue) then you can change an obscure option in the controller settings, but be prepared to meet very few other players because of it.It's so close to the perfect game that it genuinely makes me feel sad, if Rockstar's primary concern wasn't generating insane quarterly earnings figures for their parent company, it'd only need about a week of balance and economy changes and a few months of polish to be an absolute classic in terms of single and multiplayer, however money talks and the whales have spoken loud and clear when it comes to multiplayer, obviously to the detriment of the single player experience. At the price they're asking for it, I honestly cannot recommend it because there are games with far fewer issues for a quarter of the price that won't make you feel guilty for spending your hard earned money."
1046,Blaine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/suicideboy/,329,63,0,2.5,December,"29,",438,49,1,"When people warned that this game was buggy and unstable on PC, they sure weren't kidding.At the moment, there's a known bug that's been around for months: The RDR2 executable sets its own app-specific volume slider in the Windows sound mixer extremely low. You therefore have to adjust the RDR2 volume slider up every single time you launch the game, unless you want to hear everything as a faint whisper.Personally I have a G-Sync monitor and my games run far better in exclusive fullscreen mode. So, every single time I launch RDR2, I must navigate to the game settings, switch to windowed mode, increase the RDR2 volume mixer slider, then switch back to exclusive fullscreen mode.Unfortunately, there is another known bug/instability issue that's been around for months: Changing graphics settings can cause the game to crash, or even BSOD. I've had two BSODs just from changing RDR2's graphics settings... the only two I've ever had on this rig. And I have no choice but to change them every time I launch the game due to the aforementioned volume slider bug.My rig is more than powerful enough to run the game. When not crashing or otherwise bugging out, the game runs very smoothly and at 80-90 FPS for me on a mix of high/ultra settings. GPU and CPU temps and voltages stay within normal ranges.I've refunded this game because if the developers are too incompetent to fix something as fundamental as CHANGING GRAPHICS SETTINGS without BSODing the computer, then despite how great the game itself is supposed to be, I'm not willing to risk throwing my money away on something that is borderline unplayable. Nor am I willing to spend dozens of hours trying tweaks, fixes, and .xml file edits to fix the game that may or may not actually help."

You know, a lot of AAA companies get called out for greed and unethical anti-consumer tactics, but Take-Two has somehow managed to avoid scrutiny for the despicable things they have done.Before that, let’s get into this game. It doesn’t work. At least for me. The dumb Rockstar Launcher DRM is broken so I can’t even play single player. It is an utter joke. But maybe it is for the best since everyone is saying this is an awful port. Bugs, FPS Drops, server problems, game crashes, and so on. Not to mention over 100gb and a 2 day download period. And that is with good internet. This port is a joke and not worth your money.But onto Take-Two. Did you know that Take-Two hires thugs they refer to as “Private Investigators” to harass their community? Take-Two has this fun little thing they do where they will hire online thugs to find where you live and go to your house to threaten you. They have done this multiple times, mostly to people who mod their games.But the worst of all was the case of SupMatto where Take-Two ruined a Youtuber’s career over him covering leaks for Borderlands 3 he found on Reddit. They went ahead and hired their thugs to go to his house and threaten him on his property, get his Discord shut down, and illegally file over 120 false DMCA claims on his Youtube channel getting it shut down also, destroying his monetization and channel.Most recently at the time of making this review they filed a lawsuit on a modder making the Red Dead Redemption Enhancement mod. This is a modder who they were harassing about 4 months before the lawsuit and through private investigators found his real name, phone numbers of his family, and email addresses. They then proceeded to harass the modder anywhere they could, and even called his elderly mother and threaten her with a lawsuit.Take-Two is a blight on the video game industry that insults customers who do not buy micro-transactions in their games by calling them “Freeloaders”. Out of all the anti-consumer things other companies may do, they at least don’t act like they are part of a Mafia."

Even a simple task like getting a gun from a horse becomes a tedious chore: You think it would be as simple as standing near the horse, pressing a hotkey and clicking on the rifle? Noooooo, that would be too easy! You have to focus the horse with the RMB, pressing Tab down, then - while still holding RMB and Tab - aiming the cursor at the correct segment and cycling through weapons in the segment with Q and E. Also, the game seems to change constantly which hotkey to use for contextual actions. It's a bit of a mess.During the first mission, I observed an allied NPC talking with another NPC. The game showed me a help text ""Press [° ] to aim"", with a mouse symbol with highlighted left mouse button. So I pressed that button - and triggered a gunfight. Ooops. Took me a while to understand that the game was talking about the other button... Don't they even have an UX guy at Rockstar?The second gunfight - a fight between two gangs - was even worse. I struggled with the confusing hotkeys and clumsy interface to shoot out of cover, until a teammate was shot (apparently he forgot to take cover) and the mission was lost. No possibility to retry the mission afterwards. I found myself in a cabin with lots of snow but no mission objective whatsoever, only the gang boss talking about sending someone to go to the site of the first gunfight (the one I had triggered with the wrong mouse button) to bury a corpse. So I took my horse and my bow (my rifle was nowhere to be found), convinced the interface to display a map (no, there is no hotkey) and tried to ride to that site... I said 'tried"" because about halfway, my horse died under my but ""because of the harsh weather"". I tried several times, always the same. Apparently, the game doesn't want me to go where it told me to go, or to do anything else for that matter - just walk around in the snow around the cabin and have one-line conversations with depressed people. Maybe whe I do this for an hour, something will happen, I dunno, but it's not what I would call entertaining.Only then I discovered that there is a save-load screen, well hidden in the menus behind an obscure menu item like ""Story"". Of course there was only one autosave, and it was already in the cabin with no missions whatsoever. Bummer. I might restart the game one day to play it with a controller, but not anytime soon."

I'm having a blast playing the story (just hit chapter 4) and meeting all theses different characters and story lines Rockstar has given us. As someone who found the story in Grand Theft Auto V bad and pretty childish, it’s nice to play a Rockstar game take the story more serious and make us feel emotions at times. Story mode has a lot to give and you could easily clock in 100 plus hours trying to do all the missions and if you want to 100% , 500 plus.I played for about an hour or two of online and it was great from what I saw, I can’t really say much since I didn’t even hit level 10 on a character yet but I hope they support online more with some future updates like “Undead Nightmare” since I feel like Story mode is pretty much set and a lot more people bought this for online vs story mode.I Really hope people pick this up and enjoy the story like I am and not just go online because you’re truly missing out on a great story."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."
1086,Kiwi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kiwicro/,4,,1,411.1,December,"30,","1,121",1,1,"You know a game is good when it has a skip cutscene option and you don't want to use it.You know a game is good when you are sad that they skip the boring part of traveling to a mission objective.You know a game is good when the story makes you almost stop playing because what's the point.It's hard to write in a review what makes this game so special as you need to experience it. What I can write is why I think it's a masterpiece while not spoiling it.If you want an open world experience where the world feels alive, NPC live their lives and where stories unfold with or without your active involvement this is the game for you. Just riding around between missions you will get so many random events, some of them even forming little stories that even after 100 hours I was still finding new things. Save a man from his own bear trap? Meet the same fellow in a nearby town few days later and he gives you a reward. Pickup a stranded girl and bring her home, get some information that helps you later. This type of event's make it feel like individuals have their own life and good or bad luck. Activities that you can do are plentiful and integrate very well into the game. Even collectable mission are something you do for extra cash and you can do them in increments. This makes it so natural during gameplay and it's not something you go out to do just to achieve 100%. Finding cards and bones just happens while exploring, hunting or fishing. Not to mention that there are so many interiors, shacks, houses, whole farms that you can explore, steal and murder your way through them. All of this makes the world of RDR2 one of the best open worlds out there. Ubisoft should take a note here. This is how you make a open world work. Every mechanic stands alone but also is seemingly integrated with the general feel of the game.Story is I would say Rockstar going to their original quality. Memorable main and side characters. Through story, side mission and activities you get to know them and they become part of the experience. This leads to questioning any available decision that the game throws at you whit great caution. I feel that they took a different path than in GTA 5 where side characters kinda felt like a mean to an end while here they are your friends and you actually care for them. Your character Arthur has a very unique progression. Without spoiling anything he is a man that tries to live in the ever changing world  going through industrialization. He is learning to cope that the old days are gone and trying to find a purpose in this new era. Even if you don't do any side activities just playing through the story is a worthwhile experience.The downsides are very few. There is some jittering of animations in towns that happens at random. I also experiences a bug when toggle to aim was on so I had to play with hold to aim option and one quest was bugged from progressing due to a known bug.Besides bugs I would love to see the eating and drinking mechanics serve a more survival purpose. I loved going up to the mountain rationing and hunting for food.All in all this game pulled me in and didn't let me go until I finished it. It's a unique experience that I would recommend to everyone. Only regret is that I didn't start playing it sooner!"

With that out of the way here are some things that stand out the most; The story and (especially) the gameplay is very very slow for the first 20 hours or so - it's a slow burn and it's not for everyone, but the thing is when things heat up - you will miss those opening hours very much.  Juts stick with it and try to relax and enjoy the ride, don't rush it (and don't even start the game if you don't have enough time to properly enjoy it).The game looks and sounds incredible. It feels like a proper generational upgrade over GTA V, especially the character models (but also pretty much everything else) and it's optimised pretty good although it's pretty demanding.The characters in the game are written beautifully and even though there are a lot of them all of them have different personalities. You will care for a lot of them and you will hate some of them (not because they are badly written, mind you).The story is set before the events of RDR1 and it ties pretty much spot on to it. If you haven't played the first one I would even recommend doing so after you play RDR2 because it will hit even harder then (storywise). There are countless random encounters, side missions and activities to partake in. You can also customise a lot of things like your hair/beard, guns, equipment, horse, camp, etc.I didn't play RDR2 online so I can't really comment on that, but I could ramble on for a long, long time about the SP story. If you like open world games, a great story and memorable characters or maybe just want to experience the old West in the best form possible just go for it. It's not a perfect game and it's not for absolutely everyone but nothing is. As it stands RDR2 is a masterpiece and it gets a 10/10 from me."
1088,twitch.tv/xChrispay,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xChrispay/,14,3,1,"1,665.0",January,"9,",72,3,1,"is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to start discussing it.So let’s start at the beginning: It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story.And what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game’s map are also included). There are snowy peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then there’s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable.The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not. I’ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur’s story; it just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that few – if any – games have before.The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it.The main story missions themselves are a cocktail of high-stakes heists, deadly shootouts, desperate rescues, and thrilling chases, mixed with a lengthy list of other activities. Many of those function as organic ways to teach us about new side hustles and activities that can be undertaken, from selling stolen horses to playing poker or fishing.It all feels great to play, similar in a lot of ways to its immediate predecessor but injected with a pile of new animations and multiple layers of interactivity. It asks a lot of the finite amount of buttons on a controller, but once I became accustomed to which commands require a tap and which require a press-and-hold I had few hassles. Shootouts are supremely cinematic thanks to plenty of gun smoke and the same style of on-the-fly, ever-changing death animations that have characterised Rockstar games since GTA IV. You can even shoot off people’s hats and pick them up later for yourself.I think there’s a common presumption that Red Dead Redemption is just GTA on a horse, but that’s a bit reductive. Certainly the GTA DNA is here, but with far more primitive firearms at your fingertips gun battles are more intimate and anarchic. I love the close range clashes, hunkered down behind bits of cover exchanging lead with enemies often just yards away, or slugging it out in bareknuckle scraps. It’s exciting and fun. Combat from horseback is equally well-handled and it’s always a grisly highlight to watch unfortunate saps go limp and tumble from the saddle in a seemingly endless number of ways. I think Arthur feels a fraction heavier than any of the GTA V trio, but I would not say that I found his movement cumbersome. I really like how connected Arthur feels to the world. I’m not a particular fan of that old-school, skating third-person feel – like the player character has no inertia – and that’s certainly not present here.Dead Eye returns, naturally, as it’s been part of the series since Red Dead Revolver. It’s had some upgrades this time, the most useful of which highlights critical hit areas on a target (very useful for clean kills while hunting). It’s still a very effective way to make you feel like an unstoppable gunslinger and the gruesome ballet of slow-motion death-dealing remains disturbingly satisfying.Red Dead Redemption 2 is an undeniably pretty game across the board. The lighting is fantastic, particularly in dark, misty situations where shafts of moonlight stab through the trees, and I love the way it handles Arthur leaving weakly-lit interiors into the temporarily blinding sun outside. The sunsets are especially spectacular and seem to vary depending on the weather system. Some are harsh and beaming while others are warm and soft. The facial animation is a noticeable step up from GTA V, and the level of granular detail is almost absurd, from the way blood smears on Arthur’s shoulder after carrying a kill to the way individual strands of his majestic mutton chops quiver in the breeze. The way wagon wheels become caked in mud. The way rust builds up on a poorly-maintained firearm. It’s another long, long list that speaks to a high level of attention to detail.No matter where you look, everything feels meticulously handcrafted. Every consumable is labelled and can be picked up and inspected. Every catalogue in stores is full of custom text and illustrations pointing to products available for sale or old timey advertisements. Hallways are decorated with framed pictures I’ve never noticed repeated throughout the world. Remember: this is the game where horse testicles shrink when the weather is cold. More than once I found myself temporarily hypnotised by the musculature and skin creases on my horse’s butt. That’s a weird sentence, but you’re going to be spending a lot of time looking at a horse’s butt. It might as well impress you.Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date. Even after finishing the lengthy story I can’t wait to go back and play more. This is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era. Looking for one of this generation’s very best single-player action experiences? Here’s your huckleberry."
1089,Rocket,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketraider33/,5,,1,189.0,April,"17,",126,0,1,"I'm afraid I have to insist, this game is a masterpiece!Sorry folks, but you can't complain on the fact this game has animations for every action, it ain't some dumbed down gameplay for ya, it's immersion at it's peak. For real, this is a late-wild west simulation, and the best at that. Enjoy the story, that is great in its own right, but when you go free roaming, robbing banks and random people, stumbling upon some weird couple murdering lone travellers, or just play some law-enforcing bounty hunter, you feel free, and totally immersed in this world. I hope we see more games with that kind of mindset, that level of work in the animations and in the world. I'm afraid I have to insist Dutch, but the animations of opening chests, random furnitures and picking up loot, made me feel like I interact with the world more than any other game I've ever played. They took the tech from LA Noire (the item manipulation stuff) and expanded it greatly. Even though it's slower than just mashing triangle to loot every plant and three in the zone, it feels totally normal and once you understand you have to take your time on Red Dead Redemption 2, you'll feel less strongly about those. Again, without those great animations, the game would just not feel as good or immersive. Other than that missions are still too linear and Rockstar did not give enough love to the online mode, but who cares? I prefer to talk to the random folks I cross paths with, listening to the dozens of Greet/Greet/Antagonize jokes and NPCs reactions, and more. Have fun guys, this is a safe pick."

1095,King Link,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglink/,6,,1,116.0,November,"23,","2,772",0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 feels like Rockstar has turned a corner, but it might not be the corner fans were hoping they would turn.Rockstar’s previous titles, both Red Dead Redemption, and Grand Theft Auto series had a lot of variety.  Grand Theft Auto 3 through San Andreas focused on a satirical open world where the player could create his own brand of havoc.  Grand Theft Auto IV created a more simulation-style game though fans had mixed reactions, though generally negative.Then Red Dead Redemption moved back to allow the player to create their own fun, and Grand Theft Auto V returned to the satirical style Rockstar was known for.I bring all of this up because Red Dead Redemption 2 is another attempt like Grand Theft Auto IV where the goal is to create a more realistic game.  Part of the reason is while crime and urban gang life can be satirized very easily, westerns are no longer as common in pop culture, and while there have been amazing comedies in the genre, like Blazing Saddles, Rockstar made the assumption most fans would prefer a serious take on the western formula. Perhaps they were wrong. While Red Dead Redemption 2 maintains a serious tone, it goes so far as to almost become a wild west simulation rather than a normal open-world game.   The player still has the normal ability as a personified superman, where they can take too much damage, become a crack shot, and is the only person who seems to matter in the world.  However, the game removes much of the niceties players expect.   There’s no way to quickly travel around the world, skin animals, or even purchase items.  There’s even a bounty system where if players are seen having too much fun (Stealing, harming NPCs, murdering, and more) they can get a bounty unless they deal with the witnesses. Quite often players are given a menial task and expected to execute the entire thing.  This has created some issues for some players where shoveling ♥♥♥♥ in a pig trough upsets them or creates situations where players want to get to the action quicker. But Red Dead Redemption 2 seems more focused on these smaller actions, and the experience over the gameplay.  The story and graphics always seem to be at the forefront, but just the simple act of riding a horse towards a town while the player sees wildlife he can chase after, smoke from a camp he can investigate, or other people on the trail shows the amount of detail that Rockstar invested in creating a realistic experience.If you want to really experience the wild west, Red Dead Redemption 2 is going to be the standard for many years to come. With an amazing world, the next question would be what can players do, and while the open world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is absolutely packed with content, there is also a story that Rockstar attempts to tell. The opening cutscenes catch the player up to the current situation of “Dutch’s gang”, a group of outlaws on the run from the law, which the main character is a part of.  This is a band of outlaws that have become tight knit.  Rather than a couple of robbers getting together for a single heist, they are a group that follows their leaders even as they are being pursued. Dutch and his cofounder of the gang, Hosea, clearly have inspired loyalty in the gang and you can actually feel the bonds between these characters.  This is absolutely what people talk about when they discuss “Show, don’t tell” It’s easy for the game to tell you that Dutch is the leader, but the characters you meet and spend time with here are amazing.  There are multiple members of this gang that feel like real people with actual problems. While the characters are well designed, the story is weaker.  The main thrust of the opening is to get away from the law, get settled, and make money.  This however is the mentality of Dutch for the entire game until the end.  It’s always about one more score and while that mentality is understandable, especially when one learns about Dutch, the issue becomes the story doesn’t really change for the first two acts of the game.  The entire gang takes Dutch’s desire for one last big score as a necessity. The third act does change the formula, and finally, some characters start to wake up but for forty to sixty hours before that point, the story was focused on the same topic and it’s not a great experience.  Taking some time at the beginning of the game and showing a little more of why this gang is so tight-knit, or even showing the gang before the fall of the gang in the first mission would have been better because it would inform the rest of the game.  Shortening the first and second acts of the game from a monstrous forty hours to just twenty or thirty hours could have made that section feel less like repeating the same patterns and more visceral leading to the final act of the game.  It also could have freed up time to show more of the gang’s history.Without talking about those final chapters of the game, I can say that the story does resolve itself well.  It’s one of the reasons that so many people praise Red Dead Redemption 2 and it’s storytelling.  When it has a story it wants to deliver and a purpose, the scenes are well done, and the final ten to twenty hours are exceptional as are the first five.The problem is those bookend such a large and dull section where much of Red Dead Redemption 2 seems to be repeating the same story beats, and truthfully that really harms the experience because it feels like the game is filled with the content just to elongate the experience rather than because it is evolving the story and narrative. A similar problem happens with the gameplay.  While Red Dead Redemption 2 has some amazing moments, much of the story missions feel the same.  Most missions involve long rides where characters talk.  This often comes moments after the player is watching a five-minute cutscene at the start of the mission. But with a five-minute cutscene preceding it, another five minutes spent riding to a location while discussing topics with the other people on the mission feels excessive.  Some of these conversations are excellent, and there are quite a few moments where the player feels like he’s riding in a posse, but having every mission have these travel sections gets old.  There’s a handful of missions with cutscenes for traveling but these are the exceptions.At the same time missions feel like they all run into the same pattern.  After the cutscene and travel sections, the player often ends up in gunfights, and while this is typical for a Rockstar title, it feels worse here.  I actually analyzed all the missions and found 72 percent of the missions had some form of gunfighting, usually a large shootout. That means almost three-fourths of missions have you shooting it out with enemies and while there’s a couple of them that are small contained shootouts, many shootouts have double digits numbers of enemies, even when it makes little sense.  There isn’t a lack of originality in what the missions ask the player to do.  There are all the classic staples of the Wild West story, though they get overused here.  Bank robberies are a staple of the time period’s myths.  And the player ends up robbing a couple of banks.  There are also town shootouts and robbing of trains that are done a few times, and by the end of the game, it feels a bit excessive.  At some point early in this game, the whole gang would be public enemy number 1 and have people chasing them no matter what.Due to Steam Character limits, you can see the review at There is also a video I made on this game that is available here"

The Dead eye ability is overpowered as hell. Even if you avoid using it like I did, it's impossible to die at any point in the game if you've ever played a shooter before.-The missions are very linear, with annoying fail conditions, because they want to railroad you into the story.-The game pushes some agendas in very obvious ways.

If you are interested in games telling a gripping narrative, then you should have played it. About  60-80 hour of gameplay can be expected, depending on how much time you spend on exploring the breathtaking, palpable wildnerness. The open world is fantasic, dragging you into an life of hardship in the slowly vvanishing frontier. What really stands out, is the audio oif the game. The audio alone comprises 25 GB of the disk space needed, offering a cinematic musical score, countless dialogues around the open world.It's incredible how much time has been spend on making the world believable by recording a myriad of different conversations for the NPCs around the world.It's one of the few games one can recommend without a doubt.

Let's start.First things first, Rockstar Games surpassed itself. It's understanding why this game has been in developing for a long time, and now it's even more understanding why are we waiting for GTA VI this long. To make game better then this masterpiece, it's even hard to imagine what can we expect in GTA VI.Concerning RDR2, game is perfect. It's like some RP server where everything is already planned and developed, you have feeling that you are playing with Real Life players instead of NPC's. They are programmed, they have daily routines. You go there and sit in restaurant, you see NPC entering, sitting, ordering, eating and then leaving same restaurant in few minutes. This detail said, there is no need for anything else. About more details, horses balls are getting smaller when is on snow, cats are catching mouses, dogs are playing with each other, 500k+ lines of NPC's + Story modes, simulation already without any additional mods or anything needed, and many more details that are incredible and unimaginable, but Rockstar did it and Rockstar added it. Story: What to say about story? After Last of US and God of War, this is probably my favourite story game ever made. To experience life as a cowboy, in wild west that we all grown up, learned about it at schools, watched some of movies, and then got a chance to see it in game, to experience life as outlaw, helping those Indians, getting betrayed after so much adventures and etc. It's just remarkable what gaming industry is available to offer, only if people such as Rockstar Games team know how to use that potential. I can't express my feelings about this game, I dare say it's like first time experiencing s 3 x, only that game lasts 40+ hours, and other thing 40sec :D. Just magnificent thing, music, environment, company, characters, side missions, random events, graphics, nature, horse interaction and relationship, options. I believe that I can't say everything I wanted to say in this 1 recommendation section, but this game is 10/10 with not doubt and one of saddest but also best I've ever played. True, it has some minor bugs, you might even experience lag on some parts in game, but after playing it and experiencing it, you forget and forgive all about it.At the end, I just hope 2 things from this company. I hope that they will make GTA VI experience even more better then experiencing GTA V and this masterpiece RDR2. I don't care if it takes 5+ years, but once it's done, you can enjoy a few years playing it. Just like RDR2 there is so much that people are still discovering after having 300-500-800-1000 hours on game. 2nd thing I wish to see from this company, is Red Dead Redemption 1 remake/remasterd or whatever. I read that it's complicated to do it cause codes or something, but I believe that Rockstar can manage it!Once again, total recommendation about this game, buy it, experience it, you will not regret it. Words and reviews cannot describe it until you get feeling by playing this game!"

1107,Sfogliatella Riccia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/valefordm/,37,6,0,60.4,August,"26,",467,0,1,"All in all, I enjoyed my time in RDR2, but going back I wouldn't buy it and play it again. It's beautiful world to explore and immerse yourself, squandered by the worst of R* game design.So, each time you boot up the game on pc you must log into the R* social club because reasons. But whatever, that's barely mildly annoying. Then the game reverts your graphic settings at every launch, so you have to re-edit back everything you altered, every time. But okay, I can live with that.Now, let’s list how RDR2 allows you to partake in its “open world”:1.	I tried to turn off radar and directions for a more immersive experience in this beautiful game, and got a game over twice in the first mission because it's not enough to just move towards your destination, you have to guess and follow the ONE specific route you're supposed to take.2.	My first duel went with a tutorial on the bottom centre, a prompt on the bottom right and another tutorial on the top left, all at the same time. I got killed five times trying to process all the info. This one is on me I guess, but that's really a counterintuitive way to explain stuff.3.	There were two separate missions where I tried to sneak close to a target and capture them without problems, but I couldn't do that because I *had* to follow the prompts and learn the tutorials for catching them while they were running away, which basically means riding a horse, the first thing the game teaches you.4.	In fact, in multiple instances I tried to solve a boring mission using a bullet or, again, sneaking, but every time I tried the game then just went ""X cannot be done now, come back later"", so I can't even choose to fail.5.	One of the first missions gives you the option to ""borrow"" a horse but then do the right thing and bring it back to the owner once you don't need it anymore. I did so, and the owner promptly walked under his own horse, scaring himself and running away. Okay, that's fine, I can reload and try again. The guy wasn't there anymore. I still had the horse I stole, but there wasn't anyone to give it back to.6.	Once I got my horse stuck into the woods and kept whistling for a good minute because I refused to accept this nonsense was possible. While whistling a lawman saw me and, for some reason, I was now wanted. Very immersive indeed.7.	Speaking of immersion, in R* endless bulls--t quest for achieving realism, there are perfectly climbable slopes in the world that, despite being visibly walkable if you were a human being, just makes you slip no matter how you approach them, slow, fast, jumping, crouching, you cannot traverse otherwise *realistically* traversable paths.8.	Bulls--t realism aside let's talk about the mission structure. It's terrible.The storyline wouldn't work if Arthur wasn't the world's greatest doormat and if the gameplay allowed for choices (not choices about the narrative but regarding what tools to utilize for each situation), but that's apparently R* whole template. The best mission I've played up to chapter 3 was the one where Arthur had to get drunk with Lenny, not because it was necessarily a good mission, although it was funny, but because it stuck out into the endless bog of sameness that prevents any mission from being unique. One mission starts with Molly trying to open up about her personal life, and immediately she's cut off for a robbery with horse chases and shootouts, she’s not heard from for another 15 hours. That's the entirity of RDR2, which would be fine if the game was more upfront about it. Instead, there are missions with a legitimate interesting premise (a jail break, a fishing trip with friends, sheep hustling, train robberies, stealth infiltrations) but screw it, at some point it turns, unavoidably, in horse chases and shootouts, with dozens of bodies piling up, bloody hell. 9.	Once, a man literally asked me to pick up pig manure and the only way I could play that mission was by doing that, the main character plainly stating ""all right, but I ain't gonna like it"", EVEN THE BLOODY PROTAGONIST WISHES THERE WERE OPTIONS IN THE GAME. I get punished for trying a different approach in a sandbox game (some sites even say RPG lol), and the punishment is doing the task deemed, by the narrative itself, too stupid to do. Actually, at one point I did find the roleplaying feature: during a stealth mission the gang was, bloody of course, discovered and chase and shootout ensued. I was so done by that point that I just let the mission fail and discovered that, if you fail enough times, the game offers you to skip the checkpoint and proceed to the next part of the game. Which I did and, from a narrative perspective, it seemed like I had successfully completed the mission and left without problems.So, R* actually did put the option to choose your own adventure, by letting you choose to skip it.This is such a weird, bizarre, welcomed and utterly awful feature. If the devs were so uninterested in having the player play the game like they planned, then why not give them the possibility to choose how to approach a mission? The rails of each mission are fixed but, if I don't like them, I can just move on anyway instead of having an actual choice in the gameplay. And the only explanation I can find is that they were so confident in the narrative and so aware of the gameplay shortcomings that this seemed like the better choice? What the hell.At that point I was actively avoiding story missions for as long as I can, I just travelled around trying to engage npcs on the road and in the cities, walking around the camp looking for odd jobs, doing menial tasks, trying to balance hunting and wildlife preservation, apparently pointless stuff but, again, I'm just trying to have fun by immersing myself into this world, anything but having to do only those obnoxious horse chases and shootouts.I won’t get too deep into the story, only a couple of things on theming and presentation: pacing issue aside, I like the decadent western setting where there are no heroes, only criminals masquerading their atrocities as a search for freedom and a government that vexes its people with corruption, idiocy and militarism. Both are a most accurate representation of the United States, indeed.Problem is, the way the story is told is so padded, the important bits relegated to sparse cutscenes or long debates on horse-back riding, which are funny but so overlong yet so overconfident in their delivery.And all in all, it's just doesn't never hit emotional high, because the stakes are always so undercut by (supposedly) adrenaline pumping action. In the camp (the hub being actually one of the best features in the game) Arthur complains about feeling angry all the time and, by extent, killing a lot of people needlessly, when my playthrough instead was with almost no civilian death, so is he talking about the dozens of cannon fodder I have to slay with no choice in the matter? Bloody hell, at least Deus Ex or Mass Effect let me get to the ending before telling me, in the face, that every choice I made was equally useless, RDR2 doesn't even wait for the middle act. Also, because by that point the game has forced you to kill so many people that you’ve gone numb to it as one of many menial tasks you need to do to progress into the game, but now apparently it matters, even though the game sure as hell won’t stop having you mow down hundreds of mobs from that point onward.All of this to say, no new ground in the western canon is being explored here (this genre has been used to tell how terrible America is since, afaik, the 1950s, and it only progressively became more explicit with titles like High Noon, The Searchers, The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy Heaven's Gate, Unforgiven, Once upon a time in the West, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, etc etc you get the idea) and everything that the game's story actually explores would be good if it wasn’t unceasingly undercut by the worst ludonarrative dissonance."

(Custom saddles, Preferred horse tail etc.)- The map is huge- You can spend 70-80 hours with just the Story mode!- Side missions are fun.- Attention to detail (An example: If your hat falls off, you have to pick it up for yourself and put it back on your head)- Weapon customization and keeping them clean.- Side activities (fishing, playing cards etc.)- Some parts of the map feels kinda empty- The cover system isn't that great- Gunplay feels weird at first.- Looting feels monoton after many hours into the game.- Sometimes you get into situations when you get down from your horse you run into battle and then notice you don't have your guns with you, only your handguns and then you have to run back.- You can have your own character (Obviously)- Some characters from the Story mode appears here too.- Completely new story just for the Online mode- Side missions across the map- You can choose from several roles to play as. (Bounty hunter, Trader, Collector, Moonshiner)- There are custom made cutscenes for criminals when you do ""Legendary Bounty""- Characters in RDO's story aren't really memorable.- Servers are often laggy making every PVP matches unfair and frustrating.- No text chat, you can only use emotes or voice chat as a way of communicating. (..Why Rockstar?)- Side missions get repetitive after completing them once.- Rockstar doesn't really update Red Dead Online.- There isn't really much to do after you've done the missions. Not much replayability.- Some things in the game are way too expensive and grindy. (Like the Moonshine shack which I've never got, because I got so bored of grinding)- Having deadeye in online mode is kinda unfair.I can recommend this game for its Story Mode 100%, but not for it's online mode, not in its current state, but if Rockstar updates RDO with many more new interesting content, then maybe."

I can confidently say that this is one of, if not the, greatest story ever told in gaming. Arthur Morgan has one of the most compelling and emotional anti-hero arcs I have ever witnessed. But it isn't just him - there are a dozen other characters that get plenty of time and attention alongside him. They all get their own complex character arcs, which are deeply explored and developed. How Rockstar managed to achieve this is a testament. Halfway through I was invested in so many of the characters and the whole thing was an emotional roller coaster. You'll surely feel every emotion you can imagine by the end. Take your time and appreciate this game as there are few out there like it."

It is a technical mess. I was plagued by the game crashing on launch. I followed a fix on Rockstar's support site that did fix it.....temporarily. One day, for whatever reason, the crashes started again. I reapplied the fix, and the problem went away......temporarily. This time, I had to submit a ticket to Rockstar support. They told me to switch from Vulkan to DX12 and to disable the Steam overlay. This has ended the crashes on launch, but why on Earth does this game feature an API that it can't run on? And why does the Steam overlay impact? Every other game I have runs just fine with the Steam overlay.And then there is the in-game crashes. This game must crash at least once per session. My most recent crash just happened during a very long story mission. The previous checkpoint was ages ago, and now I have to replay a large portion of it all over again. I tried but closed the game out of frustration and came to leave this review instead.There are also other smaller technical things. I have lost complete control of the horse on several occasions for no discernible reason. The physics get wonky on a regular basis. There is also some graphical artifacting from time to time. The game play is also repetitive and boring. I would list some of the positives, but I am too disgusted with the constant technical hiccups to write them out. It has been several months since launch on PC, and the game is still beset with issues. I am fed up. If I could get my money back, I would. If you want to play this game, wait until it is one deep discount some time from now. Do not pay full price for this. This, with its issues, is not a $60 game."

You can flee, ignore or interact however you want. I've even spent multiple hours just playing poker. Hands down the best game I've ever played so far, and it is a 110% worth the money. I haven't played online much, but it's a possibility if you want. Don't buy it just for the online though, the story is what is worth the money."
1150,Chris,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cdimmick/,4,,1,137.6,October,"30,",214,0,1,"The tutorial section of the game bored me to death, I quit playing two times because of it. The animations are painfully realistic, it is as if the game is taking place in slow motion at times. I would have never thought I would be complaining about a game being too realistic, worst of all the controls. With v-sync off the input delay in this game is borderline unbearable, by far the worst I have ever experienced, the only way I was able to get past it was by using a controller, even that took time to adjust to. The open world was amazing at first however It does get old fast riding across the map time after time, the random encounters are repetitive and the side missions aren't too interesting either. There are a few exceptions however if you want to 100% this game be prepared for mindless fetch quests.Despite the shortcomings this game has an excellent story, the voice acting is top-notch, and the facial animations are fantastic. Once I focused on the story and getting side tracked for the occasional side mission, the game really started to shine. This type of story would be better played in a semi open world with more linear game play. Weapon variety is strong as well as weapon and outfit customization. If you are expecting a massive open world game with tons of varying side content like an elder scrolls or fallout title you will be disappointed. The story writing and voice actors do such an outstanding job they redeem all the negative aspects of the game. There are countless hours of high quality cut scenes it is almost like a movie-like at times.I give Red Dead Redemption 2 an 8.5/10.Update: 11/23/2022The control related issues appear to have been resolved, DLSS and Nvidia Reflex have since been added to the game. Input delay is much lower than on the initial release of the game, DLSS not only improves framerate but serves as the best anti aliasing option and removes the horrible smudge effect that happens from TAANew score is a 9/10"

1153,Torllay,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Torllay/,4,,1,105.7,August,"24,",452,0,1,"Let’s just be honest here. I strongly doubt you’ll be disappointed. But~  and maybe you want know a bit more of what you’d be getting, so, bear with me, I’ll go into more details. You play as , and you’ll be surrounded by his gang which is more of a family than anything else. The game is set in the year 1899, right as America was getting more civilized and there was no space for cowboys and gunslingers in the new world anymore. You start this journey as the group is running away from the law after what was probably their biggest score. Though it went wrong and, being forced to leave all the money and gold behind, for now, they are on the run trying to survive. I won’t go any more into details, I can, though, say, this game’s story is absolutely one of the best I’ve ever played. It’s amazingly written and I could not consider it anything less than amazing. As per usual, from Rockstar. Talking of Rockstar, the game is extremely detailed, as expected. The currency is perfectly in line with the year, which makes winning 76 cents at poker far from sad, but incredible, since today that would be 23$!The world feels ALIVE, from the cities to the forests with animals that have behaviorism to keep in mind when hunting or fishing, it feels like it has its own well-crafted ecosystem. This world is nothing short of great and full of love, and it shows in every step you take going from A to B around America on your horse as you bond and take care of it.It’s very simulative and there’s so much detail and so much attention into everything you could literally open the game just to hunt, play poker, or pet and brush your horse and it would be fine.Even side quests are not-so-side after all, a bit like in The Witcher 3, they are entire questlines and stories of people you meet more than once in your journey.   The gunplay and gameplay are extremely fun, every weapon feels unique and it's a bit customizable. You also have a dead eye ability, that evolves as you go through the game, where you can slow time down to aim and shoot someone. A little bit like Micheal in GTA V. The game has also some survival mechanics. You increase your stats by using them, but if you go lower than your stats you'll start to drain the core of your health/stamina/dead eye. You can recover the core by eating food or sleeping, making you micro-manage especially stamina cause you don't wanna run out of that since it's gonna start draining your health after you run out of it. The same thing to the horse, you gotta take a lot of care of it, and caring will make your bond with it stronger.Now that I praised the game, I want to address what I said earlier: the game is not perfect.See, being a Rockstar Game, means you've got to cope already with the fact that inputs are extremely slow. It might be good on controller, but on mouse and keyboard, it feels really unresponsive. Very simulative, but slow.The game is VERY unresponsive, making sometimes simple things like getting on a cart to use a Gatling gun the hardest thing in the world when you try and get in position to interact with it and it just doesn't.The Anti-Aliasing techniques they choose for this game are a nightmare. There is FXAA which does less than nothing, MSAA which is way too performance-heavy, and TAA which leaves a lot of ghosting and it's very blurry. There is also an option to have TAA Sharpening, but that makes the ghosting even more obvious at times and creates a lot of weird artifacts. Simple TAA with a 15% Sharpening is the best option, although still not ideal. I hope that when DLSS 3.0 drops it's true that it'll work with any game with TAA, which would definitely save this game's AA. Other than that the game is very well optimized and it is very scalable, but, one little complaint is that even if the game weighs so much, the textures are only good at ultra, making it even high hard to look at, so I really hope that in the future they'll release a better texture pack to increase the life of the game.I praised the story and side quests, but...that's mostly all there is to the game. Sure, the world is nothing but amazing and extremely detailed, but compared to other similar big titles it feels more like a painting than anything else. There's very little interaction with it.And yeah, the game does have some collectibles and side objectives. One of them is hunting the legendary animals that allow you to craft unique clothing, but the clothing is just aesthetic, and hunting animals, even if legendary, is sadly more of a: go around the area, find clue, follow clue, kill. You usually you'll just follow the fur, marks, and dung of an animal in the general area of it to find it.Also, these legendary animals are less than 20, which is a lot, but it's also not since after that there's no reason to go hunt beside some specific pelts to increase Arthur's bag, which is almost useless since the normal bag by itself is just so big that you don't really need this upgrade. Also, killing the legendary animals gives you a way to craft trinkets that gives you a passive buff, which to me is such a wasted chance cause if said buffs were instead on the clothing it would make sense to use the whole outfit or part of it cause hey, , instead of all being passive effects you get regardless.The game has a great melee fighting system, and as I said earlier you can play Poker, Blackjack, Domino, etc. But that's it, all the things I just listed in the game besides some moments, are just there in case you need or want to do them. Leaving the game almost empty after you finish it and you have so much money that honestly going and playing poker for 10$, besides the fun of it, makes no sense. I'm not saying the game should have done much more, but even just some tournaments in fighting and poker would have made these activities more than just an option and something else to do after you finish it or even as you play it, besides the side quests which as I said, don't feel like side content at all. And don't get me wrong, I played other Rockstar titles, and I know, usually, in these games, after you finish it there's always very little left to do if not replay the game and get all gold medals in missions.BUT, compared to GTAV which came out in 2013, this feels more like an open-world TW3 style and I was hoping for at least some things to do in the open world besides hunting, fishing, and going through it. It feels bad after all these hours you put into the game, realizing that you can only go hunt some animals and go around looking for some cards and stuff.Anyway, let me wrap this up in a single sentence:Great world-building, an amazing story, and an extremely beautiful mapVery slow inputs and a world that has very little to do with it besides the story. I loved it, but this is still a videogame with a big open world, and, from RDR2 and its budget I guess I was expecting a bit more than just a nice story. I was hoping for a bit more interaction with the world, Which is why my vote is .The game is great, I strongly suggest it, but I see so much potential unused. PS: R.I.P Online"

But as soon as it came out for PC I had to get it as it would solve the only issue I had with the game... the capability of the PS4... it's hard to focus on being an outlaw in the late 1800s when you constantly hear a plane taking off from your TV stand lol… But I knew I wanted to play it again, mainly just for the story & experiences.A big reason I loved this game so much is because the world feels alive. Animals to hunt, plants to gather, places to explore, notes & secrets to be uncovered. I've been trying to complete the game for a 3rd time, but I just always find myself just getting lost in the world looking at the beautiful scenery, caves, abandoned buildings and other secrets this world harbors within.  Another thing I noticed about this game is that every character seems fleshed out like they're a genuine person living in this world that's beaten them down. Regular NPCs go about their daily lives, jobs, getting drunk at the saloon or just going back home for the night.  Plus back at the camp some of the gang members will tell stories at night by the fire, get into arguments with each other, drink together or just try to pull you in for a short conversation.In my opinion this is probably one of the best games I've played alongside others like fallout New Vegas, GTA San Andreas and GTA 5"

The story telling and the voice acting is truly remarkable, makes you really feel attached to the characters and their traits, especially the protagonist. A lot of side quests, missions and challenges to do. Really gets you addicted to playing, usually ended up playing from dawn till dusk every single day of the week without even realizing it.

Even when I picked it up when it was 20% off, I feel the price does not reflect the polish I would expect from Rockstar. I have been waiting to review this game after several bug fixing patches, but every day when I check there are still no updates.In short, there are numerous bugs and stability issues. The game frequently crashes and I have to replay missions. One of the most annoying bugs effects story cut scenes where I miss out on the dialogue. For example, when hunting the big bear and saving that one guy, I have no idea what happened because the cut scene skipped. Another really annoying bug happens frequently in missions where I need to chase someone on my horse, and all of a sudden my horse will just run in circles. It does not matter what I press or what direction I try to move, my horse will just go in circles and I fail the mission.This game will be awesome one day. I would encourage Rockstar to focus their development on fixing the current game before trying to add new content. Optimize the game, fix bugs, and increase stability. Until then, I would recommend waiting to buy this game."
1170,Drastic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drastic977/,5,,1,487.2,August,"8,",429,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 pits you into a beautifully crafted, awe-inspiring sandbox of a world where you assume the role of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van Der Linde Gang. (I'd love to go on about this but spoilers!!!)For those of you looking for a wild west shootout game, look elsewhere, however, if you're looking for extremely well thought out character development, an albeit linear yet intriguing story, and an overall emotional roller coaster of an experience within the wild west universe, Red Dead Redemption 2 is the game for you. As for the game itself and how it plays, while I believe Rockstar could have done a better job with the PC port (as my friends and I have gotten quite a few issues with tabbing out, random crashes and what not), the world is immersive, be it in terms of visual fidelity, sound or the environment it offers. While there is no doubt that the RDR2 is impressive looking, what stands out for me is the sound engineering and its use in encapsulating the experience of the environment.In short, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must-play. P.S Quite a lot of people have trouble getting into the Red Dead Online world as it is a bit different than that of the game. I'd advise it best to finish the story and then head over to Online as it'll be easier to get into. In addition, when getting into online, research on how the RDR Online world works and figure the do's and don'ts out so as to have an enjoyable experience."

Likewise, as we have come to expect, the voice acting is once again stellar and the game has an interesting cast of characters (some of which are more cartoony than others, and some of which don't really get anything meaningful to say or do, if truth be told).The game's considerable technical merits are let down by the following issues in particular:Too bad the open vistas and gorgeous game world are not equally matched by inspired gameplay. As it stands playing RDR2 feels quite repetitive with severely limited player agency and choice (you don't really make any meaningful choices, aside from the length of your beard).Rockstar needs to update their formula which has remained pretty much unchanged since GTA3. Despite the numerous criticisms listed above the game is still good...but it left me feeling that it could have been so, so much better. Which is probably why the tone of my review seems to be quite negative despite many of the positive aspects of RDR2.EDIT: formatting"

This is long and I know this is a loved game but here are my thoughts.*Spoilers Ahead*1. This game has been a stressful experience ever since I realized that the game AUTOSAVED whenever I died and WROTE OVER my manual saves with the new autosaves. Excuse me but isn't the point of a manual save so I can go back and try again without losing money every time I died for some dumb reason? So I turned off autosaves and now have to manually save pretty much constantly. So already I'm annoyed at the game and we didn't really start off on a good note. Let that be known.2. Probably about half the time, the reason I died was because the game bugged out somehow and wouldn't let me aim/shoot in the middle of a shootout. The game is about as glitchy as I'd expect from a game of this magnitude, but it was annoying when it happened during Key Moments. Other things happened too that I guess were intentional, although they really killed the immersion and came off as bugs anyway. Like when I killed a bunch of bounty hunters or whatever, if I strayed just a *little* too far to recollect whatever pelt they knocked off my horse, all the bodies have disappeared. I get the concept of garbage collection, but can you just *wait* like 10 seconds before erasing them from the area?? 3. The ""realistic"" aspect. Yeah there's realism but it's...misplaced. Yes my horse poops often and as much as I love to watch it, it would be nice if they had put at least a fraction of that effort into the freaking cursed *Wanted System*. Like how is it realistic when I accidentally bump into someone in Saint Denis, and suddenly 20 cops are shooting at me? Wouldn't it be more realistic if people in my group actually did something besides sending me out to do everything? Or if they actually shot enemies instead of just yelling at ME to do it? Or if people in my camp ever donated more than 37 cents while I donated half my income? 4. Let me paint you a scene of something that happened in a mission. I was walking Charles the artist to his boat (in Chapter 5 I think) when suddenly these dudes came over and started punching me?? I tried to walk away but I couldn't, and the game gave me the prompt to ""defeat the attackers"" so I did, and Charles got on his boat, and not 10 seconds later, I'm wanted for murdering these two attackers, and I'm chased for like ten minutes throughout the city and I get a $650 bounty, and eventually I perish. When I reemerge, my horse is DEAD (RIP Roach #3 the Horse), and as I'm trying to mourn and bring the saddle to my new horse, some GUY just comes up to me on his horse and is like, ""DO YOU WANT TO DIE TODAY?"" and starts shooting me, so I try to run away because I know self-defense isn't a known concept to the RDR police force, so he's like ""YEAH I THOUGHT SO"" and rides off, CIRCLES BACK AROUND, and starts shooting me again, so I shoot him back to get him away from me, and of course immediately cops are after me and I'm wanted again. Like *this is not fun. This does not make the game more fun*. Why is there no ""please get away from me"" or ""idk what I did, but I didn't mean it, leave me alone now"" option?5. This game does NOT want you to experiment. These missions are so scripted that if you're just a little off, you'll fail. I hear that's a Rockstar design thing. Like for one mission, I had to follow a stagecoach, first I failed because I was too far away. Then I failed because I was too close. It's like you're set up to fail for a lot of these missions. I felt like I was fighting the game for most of the time, not knowing exactly how they wanted me to do it. (I admit I am spoiled by The Witcher 3, where you can just run away and come back and it doesn't automatically fail you.) I never was allowed to forget that I was playing a game. I couldn't really get into the story because I was too stressed out about just getting past the checkpoints before I failed for some arbitrary reason. And all the side missions to slowly walk some person to the nearest town or whatever, I DREAD those and I feel like you're not supposed to literally dread those question marks that pop up in the game...6. The game encourages you to do things and then punishes you for it. For example, it REALLY wants you to rob a train and tells you the first time you're stopped at a moving passenger train. And you have the Bandit Challenges for things like ""drag someone 3300 feet with a lasso!"" But then it has the audacity to throw in an honor system and makes you lose honor for doing what the game itself was egging you on to do. And then it gives you this huge guilt trip about it, like after five chapters of robbing trains and whatnot it starts to add in these ""Do you accept payment?"" choice prompts which are just dumb. Like for one mission, I had to collect a debt, and then the guy's pregnant wife walks over, and there's a prompt where you can choose to ""forgive the debt"" and I'm like wtf no?? I'm sorry? When did you suddenly get so honorable? You just robbed a store and then lassoed a witness and then killed a witness to that witness then someone witnessed that so you killed that witness too so don't EVEN7. I don't understand what we are supposed to think of Arthur as a character. When he's collecting debts for Strauss he's super gruff and mean and threatening but then there's the nun and other characters being like ""ah, you're a good person, I can just feel it!"" And the game keeps trying to make you feel connected to Arthur by suddenly making him all philosophical after Guarma, and Dutch suddenly becomes diabolical, and it feels like there's no reason for it really, so now all of a sudden Arthur is being all judgmental towards Dutch for ""killing for no reason"" when Arthur has literally spent the entire game killing for no reason and draggin people 3300 feet with a lasso?? Wtf game? And it's all like ""oh, he's DYING, aren't you sad? Look at this cut scene and here's some vocal music because now you know he's DYING, and don't you want to turn on cinematic mode now and ride your horse after you leave Guarma for five minutes with cinematic mode on? Doesn't this make you sad? btw he's DYING, did you know?"" It was a bit pushy, I don't like when games tell me exactly what I'm supposed to be feeling all the time, and this game was pretty shameless about that. It really wanted to be ""epic"" but of course the terrible game design and controls kind of ruined that for me (see points 3 and 5). 8. I never really cared about the people at my camp either. I wasn't sad when any of them was killed and I didn't really go out of my way to decorate the camp or whatever. The game didn't do much to make me feel that connected to anyone, I guess. Also, what's the point of some of them even being in the gang? Like what did Mary Beth ever do? Why is she there? Also, they wonder why they're always getting spotted but even when they have a huge house to hide in, they're all camped outside so you can see them from like 100 miles away. TLDR: All the little annoying things about the game killed the realism and immersion that they tried so hard to curate. Also, the Wanted System is CURSED and punishes you for doing what the game itself encourages you to do.Anyway yeah it's fine but idk, I definitely won't be playing through it again. And I personally don't really get the excitement over this game, but I guess lassoing people was pretty fun.PS There is a guy on youtube with a video called ""Rockstar's Game Design is Outdated"" which has a pretty good summary of my beef about this game if you're interested"

Just the story and side content and such.However, now on the PC I only play the online portion of Red Dead and I gotta say: It's amazing. If your PC can take it, the game is absolutely stunning. However it is much more fun with friends, obviously.There isn't much story in the online mode of RDR2, but the content that is there, is very enjoyable. All of my 80+ hours so far have been spent in RDO, no story mode at all. Few downsides though:- You can not just jump in now and play the new content (Moonshine) as you do have to grind the existing /older Roles to unlock your own speak-easy etc. - Grinding Gold /Nuggets in the game is very slow and works best with Bounty Hunter (which you can do with a friend who has the role for example),- but its clearly making you feel like you should just buy it for real money. (It's not required ofc, but it is grindy)- There is no real matchmaking. If you get into a showdown you may be headshot immediately. Could be good players, could be Dead-Eye. We will never know lolNow the good stuff:- ALL. THE. REST! ^_^Even if you just go play the game to feel like a Cowboy or to embrace the graphics, it's definitely worth it. For the amount of hours you will spend on it. And that this review doesn't even include the story mode which in itself is worth it already! <3"

This is like watching best western movie and controling your destiny in it. The Good, the Bad, and the Evil, 3:10 To Yuma, Godless (tv mini series) mostly reminded me of this game. To this moment I still can't believe what I just experienced. Im still in shock how good this game is. Was very skeptical that Rockstar can pull this off after Red dead Redemption first one. Oh boy how was I wrong in many ways. Cant say any weak part of this game. the story the world the gameplay are just breathtaking. Sure it has some mini annoying flaws like slow looting system, horse can bump into tree with no reason if you are not careful (The witcher 3 somehow managed to pull this off) and there is one big problem that needs to be adressed. This game needs good optimization cause at this state you need monster PC to play this game. I didnt had any crashes or bugs but man I wish I had opportunity to play on highest settings. Sadly had to lower down some effects to enjoy stable 60 FPS. You play as Arthur Morgan...an outlaw...and friend...a husband or maybe a killer. So many things this game shows you and you experience many emotions. Honestly I liked him more than John Marston. I know its strange. But thats what happens when you develop amazing character. You can play as evil or as decent human beying. Thou there are a lot of killing in this game. The world felt to alive. For me I didnt played this game I lived in it. It was so real. Map is so big and vast. Riding with your horsie is the best feeling you experience in this wild west. Please dont use fast travel cause you gonna miss alot. Its mindblowing how much can you do and see and explore and find. How detailed and beautiful it is. You just need to see with your eyes. Everything you see on horizon you almost can go there. Wild life is dangerous and gorgeous at the same time. Better be prepared for some suprises cause one wrong step and you can face cougar. Oh boy if you dont have shotgun on yourself she will destroy you almost in one hit. Thats what I loved as I said it felt so alive this world. So many animals to find. You can kill them for pelts but I didnt find that amusing and didnt do that. I love nature so I left it to rest. You also can collect plants or go fishing. The towns and people living there are so real. Thou I love smaller towns not the biggest one. I dont like big cities :) You can go to bar, play poker, dominoes, black jack. I spend one hour just playing poker. That is how good this feel. there are also other duties like bounty hunting. The story is the strongest part also. Even to this moment I cant believe Rockstar pulled this off. Arthur Morgan feels like true human. You starting to like him an at the end of a game you feel like you grow bond with him. He is trully like your brother that you care for him. There are also other likable characters like strong Abigail Roberts and Sadie Adler-she is the best. I like her alot. Charles Smith is also cool. He gives you I think tomahawk one of the coolest weapons in the game ;) And there are also devils like Andrew Milton, Micah Bell and most hated satan Dutch. This guy is...well I just dont want to cross path with this guy. You also can help them do side missions which is what I like the most. They felt so good. The other game I maxed out and did every side mission was Witcher 3. You can find so many them in the world also. Meet some strangers. At the end what can I say. Red dead Redemtion 2 is one of those game that you 110% can trully call Masterpiece. Arthur Morgan became my friend at the  the end he was my brother.  RDR 2 ending where true man cries. This is wild west and You my friend will ride to the sunset forever as cowboy. 10/10 Masterpiece"

That changed when I played Red Dead Redemption 2.Characters were written and performed so genuinely. The well-being of each individual, and actions I took towards them, even NPCs insignificant to the story, weighed heavily on my shoulders. Each person you encounter throughout the game seemed like they lived an existence of their own, had their own families, problems, and realities that they lived in. That, coupled with the most vast, detailed, and believable open-world that I've experienced made it impossible not to be completely immersed in its world. The game is able to capture and showcase the beauty of nature and its inhabitants like no other game has before it; wide sprawling landscapes that'll take your breath away as you struggle to remind yourself it isn't real. Cities, towns, and the people in them feel intimate and real. Compared to Rockstar Games' previous works, nothing compares to the impression RDR2 gives you of a living, breathing community. With a story that can be both heartwarming and heart-wrenching, the amount of emotion I've invested into each and every character, each and every moment, cannot be overstated, keeping me at the edge of my seat in genuine suspense, worry, or joy. Red Dead Redemption 2.The only game that could make me forget about the real world for a moment, bringing me into its own.I doubt I'll ever play another game like this one in my lifetime. Truly one of a kind."

The size of the world is stunning and the the way everyone react inside is just amazing. It is one of the few games where you don't want to use fast travel because you never know what will you find along your travels. Maybe you want to enjoy the scenery or maybe you want to do some hunting or you will find a new adventure that is not marked as a mission on the map. The level of detail is so great that each item picked up from the world is hand-held and stored in the bag. I finished the game on PS4 but I decided to get it on PC also so I can enjoy it again. This is an adventure you don't want to miss out and I know Arthur will grow close to your hart as you play the game. Playing on single play on PC after PS4 made me appriciate the game even more.

Some important points - - Insanely beautiful open world.- Phenomenal attention to detail.- Great gameplay mechanics - from stealth kills to hitting headshots with guns they were spot on with that.- Superb story, was totally indulged into the characters and their tragic storylines :(- Sooo much to discover in the wild - herbs, fishes, birds, reptiles etc which can be used for crafting.The game ran smooth for me, had a crash once or twice in total other than that no performance issues happened on a GTX 1060 6GB with an i5 4460. Definitely recommend this game. First two chapters might be very slow, but trust me, it's worth your time."

Now I can say this is my 2nd fav game ever. Never felt such a bond with a protagonist. The story, the characters, the dialogues, everything is just perfect.Arthur Morgan is the Best character rockstar ever made. Just love how the game builds up such emotional ride throughout the gameplay. The hornor mechanics helps a lot. The gameplay is slow and peaceful, not like every other running and shooting types. Even then you will never feel like doing nothing, there is always something to do. Best rockstar game IMO. Each and every character made me feel something, such good Unforgettable characters. About performance.... Yea It was a bad launch on PC when It came out on Rockstar launcher and others but Since I got it on steam after 1 month exclusive terms, I have never got any crash or bug till now. I play it on Ultra-High and gives me good playable 50-60 FPS avg. And if you follow the YT famous graphical breakdown video guide, you can get 60+ FPS easy. Don't regret buying it for full price after all the drama happened. Love this game. Go for it blindly. It's worth your time and money and an amazing experience you'll get for a lifetime.ONLINE MODE -------If you read everything above, you have to read this too because the Online mode is nothing but trash. at this time there is nothing in the game you can do once you complete some 10-12 missions. Animal spawns f**ked up so you have to spend a whole day to find animals, kill them, dontae to cripps and then wait for 2-3 hours to earn 500$$. In bounty hunter missions even if you catch the target in time and you want to deliever him/her to prison, you have to wait for last 30 sec timer to get the most out of it or else it doesn't even give good reward. Collector role is simple and fun so far. Moonshine role is trash. There is nothing to do in the whole massive world other than these things which you will get bored of. You do same things as a LVL 20 or LVL 200... only difference is higher rank players have GOLDEN WEAPONS and GOOD CLOTHES. The GOLD BARS system r* started in this game is absolute sh*t cashgrab ( PAY TO WIN ). This game is fun only if you have some friends to play with. The big open world with so much potential is wasted somehow. I don't recommend playing online mode if you hate grinding. Online mode makes you grind whole day to unlock a piece of cloth. That says it all. If they add something more meaningful and fun stuff that players actually enjoy, I might change the review but for now Online mode is 2/10."

While no game being really ""perfect"", RDR2 is quite close to it.The graphics is magneficent. Voice acting is phenomenal, never thought I would stop and enjoy hearing the NPCs' dialogues. The world is massive and there is always something new to discover or some details that I might have missed because the attention to detail in this game is unprecedented. Being able to grow out Arthur's Beard and hair, and even styling it at given length is incredible!The story telling is also a big part of it. It is truly a sad story with excellent writing, though I understand the story being strictly scripted and there is always one outcome. There are also tons of content like side missions which I equally enjoyed.My most memorable immersive experience was to sit by the campfire with the gang and a bottle of Whiskey in my hand. Everyone was jolly singing together for a hot minute. And then there was Javier who played with his amazing guitar. It was quiet, peaceful, I took my time and appreciate the moment. This is a slow-paced game that not a minute I ever regret spending.No such game has made me so attached to a fictional character like RDR2. It showed me to appreciate the moments with those who are with you, because you will never know when they could be taken away. Why did you have to do this to me, Rockstar…"

The world is beautiful and diverse and the cities are vibrant and full of character+Quests are extremely varied, very few fetch quests and some of the more monotonous activities like fishing are entirely optional to partake in+Well written characters that all feel like they are distinct personalities, and great dialogue between them all+Lots of dynamic interactions away from cities, makes the world seem alive even in rural places+The game does a really good job of making it feel like everyone’s at your throat+Photo mode, cool for taking screenshots-A few bugs: mainly the occasional graphic glitch such as trees flickering and people sitting down into thin air, but a few treasure hunts and horse interactions can bug out from time to time too-Subtitles confuse “your” and “you’re” on multiple occasions-Rockstar Social Club: the fact that this is mandatory for offline play is equal parts baffling and infuriatingI didn't play the much bemoaned multiplayer component that this game has to offer, but purely based on how incredibly fun (and lengthy - I got 88 hours of gameplay out of one playthrough) the singleplayer campaign is, I'd have a hard time giving this game anything but a high recommendation. 9.5/10."

Just, before you rush headfirst into things, make sure your machine can run it decently enough. The game is absolutely gorgeous and it'd be a shame not to experience it as best as you possibly can.Now, for my actual review:I must admit that I hadn't played RDR1 before, only watched the walkthrough on YouTube and found it rather boring and repetitive. When it comes to whether you should play RDR1 before RDR2 or not, it's more a matter of personal preference. It does give you a bit of an understanding of the gang and some character backstory, but you can probably do without that, too. I know people got really attached to Marston - I couldn't, and that's that.On the other hand, RDR2 introduces you to a new protagonist: Arthur Morgan. As a character of moral ambiguity, you get to shape him up into the person you want him to be through the actions you take in-game. Not only that, but your choices also shape up the world around you. Albeit limited by the story, I really appreciated that degree of freedom and the amount of detail that brought the game's world to life. I don't believe I ever felt so immersed in a game - it truly makes you realize what a powerful storytelling medium a game can be, when done right.The story is amazing and the characters compelling. The music, along with the excellent pacing of the game, turns every mission into a memorable experience. Do yourself a favor and don't just rush through the story - as tempting as that may be. Take your time to explore, and just enjoy Arthur's little sketches in his journal :) the game world has a lot to offer: hundreds of hours later and you'll still find some little detail that you hadn't known about.The whole game was filled with pros for me. As for cons, I had little to no technical difficulties, thankfully. This review is solely for the single-player aspect of the game, I can't really speak much about the online version. The weight behind your character's movement adds a LOT to the immersion, I must say, but can sometimes make movement an absolute pain. Probably feels a lot better on console, I don't know. I just think they could've done a better job on the PC port. Sometimes the weapons you were using get replaced when you start a mission and that's quite annoying, hopefully they'll fix it. Other than that, I have little, next to nothing to complain about and I can only hope that your experience will be a pleasant one as well. I have yet to see a flawless game, and RDR2 is definitely worth playing no matter what. As for the gameplay itself, things are kept rather simple and obvious. Not sure how I feel about that, but it fits in well with the story and pacing so you'll definitely find it gets your blood pumping well enough.Anything else you'll have to see for yourself. What're you waiting for? Go get yourself the game and buckle up, 'cause you're in for a ride!"

You can feel rockstar spared nothing in making this almost artwork, it's a masterpiece of a game, beautifully crafted, every corner of the map, the dialog, the voices, honestly a joy to go through.Bad points, the controls are a little janky, akin to GTA where your character sometimes just won't do what you want them to do, the rockstar intergration can be flakey, a couple of times I had to restart the game to make rockstar believe I owned it, neither of the two particularly impacted my enjoyment, I'm just being critical.If you want a game to sink yourself into, properly, then pick this up, it's in my top games of all time.

I run with a 2070 super, so yeah. Will the 2070 super run games like Cyberpunk 2077 smoothly? I'd say yes. This game is great, it has one of the best story modes I have ever played. Wouldn't want to spoil anything, but buy it. As for the gameplay, Rockstar has focused a lot on realism, which can be frustrating sometimes. Should have better fast travel system.

But lets be real, no game can escape bugs. Everything from animation to dialogue to npcs makes the world feel alive, you know it took me 250 hours before I found out I could hitch a ride from an npc in a cart to take me to the nearest town if I found myself stranded without a horse? Small things like that blow my mind as R* really thought of everything.This was worth waiting 8 years (+1 month for pc users who don't go epic) for without a doubt.This game alone shows game making is not a production of a product, its a craft of an art.Objectively speaking, this is one of the greatest games of this generation, and it still continues to blow my mind.11/10"
1266,_inu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lordvessel/,4,,1,59.7,March,"18,",789,2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a story of sacrifice without the illusion of a true good or a definite choice. This portrayal of the life of an outlaw gang in the wild west does a great job at teaching you that no matter what you do, which path you choose or which choice you make - They all lead to suffering and sacrifice, but whether that sacrifice be worth it is a choice even the roughest gunslinger and train robber can make.I would say this game is more of a character portrait of a real person with real consequence rather than your average bad guy / hero fairy tale that will somehow work out in the end. There are many decisions to be made but not an abundance of opportunity to change your path, thus making your shaping of Arthur Morgan really feel important and persistent to the vast and beautiful game world.As a protagonist Arthur Morgan is stunningly dynamic, with great facial animations and a very moody and atmospheric voice over, which really lets you perceive his journey through his eyes and perhaps walk a path you did not initially think would be the way you wanted to play this game.It is as much a story of gun-slinging and amassing riches as it is about heartbreak and the fragility of it all with a huge strong point on the player being able to shape the protagonist, the story and ultimately the world based on simple concepts such as greed, compassion, kindness, determination and most importantly - Loyalty.Are you a good man, Arthur Morgan?"

1268,woozyevo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/woozyevo/,7,,1,168.3,January,"11,",152,0,1,"I just wanna start this review off by saying, i paid about 30 bucks for this game, every penny was worth it. This is by far the best story driven game I've ever played. I played this game knowing a lot of the major events as I only beat the campaign a couple days ago and yet the game still gave me so many surprises. At some points I completely forget the game was even a game, it felt like I was watching one of those interactive movies you get on netflix. The cinematic style stays consistent through to the end of the epilogue. The game constantly pushes to look like a classic western movie and it works so well. You'll notice a lot of the long tasks you get given are shortened down by transitioning to a cutscene half way to keep you entertained and invested in whats happening. The story is amazing, the greatest told in a video game in my opinion. You play as Arthur Morgan while running from the law with the rest of your gang. As an outlaw, Arthur is introduced as a man with no more than his loyalty and a code. He'll kill and rob anyone deserving as long as he gets paid and Dutch is happy. But eventually Arthurs character develops into a more heroic figure rather than rebellious. You see him start doing more honourable things (no matter what honour level you are). I don't want to talk too much more about the story as it will spoil, but the level of depth in these characters is amazing. The attention to detail in this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ crazy. Even more so than breath of the wild. When you go to play this just stop and actually take a look around the world, you will 100% see some ♥♥♥♥ you wouldn't have noticed that looks realistic as ♥♥♥♥. The graphics are amazing, in fact so amazing that I'm pretty sure my 2060 starts dying every time I boot this game up. Even on low graphics the game looks really good, unless you actually stop and look at them then they won't as much lol. A lot of people criticise the guarma section of the game, and I really don't see why. The section is extremely short and the main criticism thrown at it was that 'it's just a long shooting mission with a lot of shooting and nothing else.' This isn't true, at least not entirely. Yes you do shoot a lot more than you do anything else, however, the change of environment is very nice and while you're progressing through the missions it really is refreshing taking in the exotic sights of the tropic. Personally, I loved going through this game and just looking at all the environments, it was amazing. And guarma was by far the best place for this. Another thing to mention is that the story is still there. Some people say the story falls off from here, but I completely disagree. It doesn't get better or worse it simply continues being as good as it was. Anyways that's all im gonna write (there are some other things i could talk about that also made the game great but this review is getting long enough so I'll cut it here). This has easily become my 2nd favourite game ever (just behind breath of the wild) and I highly recommend this game to absolutely everyone.5/5 - woozy points"

This is because that's how long you get to play before the game crashes and you have to reload and restart the mission you are on or loose the random encounter you just found.  This is the only game I have ever owned that this happens with and I would expect more.  If you don't have patience for restarting then stay away.  Other than that story is good and game play is fun.  Wrote this review after the 100th crash, just frustrated."

1275,Langovskyy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Langovskyy/,4,,1,888.0,May,"18,",260,0,1,"RDR2 is a really great masterpiece.It's a story about outlasw running away from stuff they done, but getting end up bringing even more on themselves.The game looks absolutely stunning, and music is really great.So, let's just get straight to gameplay review.The game is (obviously) an open world tps.It's really well polished, has a countless amount of great detail in all game mechanics (npc's remembering what you've done, guns/horses getting dirtier, beard growing, etc.) and really well done missions.Gunplay is really updated and smooth, comparing to GTA V.Horses were made extremely well done, comparing to Witcher 3 or AC Odyssey, they don't feel like generic mount, but your actual Friend you bond with in this adventure.The characters of the story are well-written and so the story itself, including side missions.Game has hours of just dialogues you will miss in a camp, but it's there, even though rockstar knew 80% of people will miss them.There is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bonus stuff you can do (bounties, stagecoach/train robbing, herbs gattering, poker, hunting for camp/clothing upgrades.)So, is game any bad?For me? No.But I know some things that certain people (like my one friend) would hate.1. Incredibly long mission intros.Well, this one is a rockstar certified Classic:After mission cutscene, you have to get to point B from A, with some guy tigether, while you both talk.But the thing is, every single person in this game has a horse.They will not sit on yours, they will just ride along with you AT THEIR OWN PACE.You can't speed them up, you're basically FORCED to slowly gallop with them and listen to them.Now, idc tbh. I like to listen to them, but many ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are unpatient af and gonna straight up negative review because they lose 3 mins of their life they'd spend playing this game anyways, which also ties to 2nd possibly negative reason.2.Game is incredibly slow.With point 1 and overall fact you don't have cars in WIld West, game feels a lot slower.Looting enemies is slow, skinning animals is slow, mission onbjectives are slow.They make you take your time, which again, IDC, but some people would just hate on that.3.Game is holding your hand.And that's one thing I kinda can agree on.As we know, linearity of open world missions in Rockstar's game is a classic.Red Dead is no different.Unlike idk, MGSV... The game will not let you do another aproach that the game wants to.You wanna rush in on a stealth job? Mission Failed, you alerted them.You wanna go from different angle? Mission Failed, you ran away from the objective.You wanna loot some corspes when your other friends cover you? Mission Failed, npc got killed because you didn't kept shooting at enemies.Again, Ik that they're linear because the mission have to feel cinematic, unlike MGSV where every job felt boring and barely had any story.4.Optimization.Game's runs like ass.Crashes, freezes, has problems loading textures on time.Rockstar never did any good console port, so I ain't telling the game is ♥♥♥♥ becvause of it.Although this game was unlaunchable on release!Now, for me the game is awesome, I kinda don't understand how God OF War won against it, and you should honestly buy it.I ain't refering to Online Multiplayer in this.You ain't payed for that thing and I will not write extra lines about cancerous cash grab putted in such great game."

However, I never had any problems with the game crashing. After around 70 hours of gameplay I had a problem with the game crashing upon loading back to the game, but simply switching the game's API from the default Vulcan to DX12 fixed the issue.I didn't want to write a review until I've finished the game, just to see if I can get to the end without any technical difficulties and also because I wanted to know how I truly felt about it. I don't usually write reviews of any sort, but this game is an absolute masterpiece and deserves the recognition. The world, characters and story are all amazing. Gameplay is fun and engaging. I would 100% recommend this. It is one of those games that can truly make a difference in someone's life no matter the hardships they are facing. Give it a chance!"

But the thing that is stopping me playing this game is Rockstar. Turns out even though it's on Steam you are still forced to use Rockstar's broken launcher even for the singleplayer story mode. So you might be thinking, ""that's fine idc about downloading another laucher..."" because that's what I thought. Unfortunately what it actually means if for some reason the Rockstar Game Laucher thinks you're offline your game is essentially bricked. My PC is wired to the router but and I've gotten about half way through the game but I can't even load up the game anymore because the Rockstar laucher seems to be broken and even though I've tried to troubleshoot it there doesn't seem to be a fix for me.If you love to troubleshoot why software won't run for you then this is the game for you.

I have not had much issue when the opponent is human.. Headshots are  not hard to do at least so far.. I have only used the base rifle I have started with so take that as you will.I will probably be updating this at some point when I get more time both to make a better review as well as more time in the game itself.

It's a very polished game with an engaging story, interesting characters, memorable moments, and an amazing soundtrack. Arthur Morgan for me definitely became one of the best protagonists of all time. A well-written character with a tragic story who becomes more than just an outlaw.But the game also has some problems... The wanted system is hit or miss, broken economy but for me biggest disappointing thing was the game design. Rockstar created this huge open-world game with a ton of things to do like hunting, fishing, exploring, robbing, and killing, but when it comes to story missions it's super linear aka follow the yellow line. You can't approach a mission differently, you always need to do what the game says you to do and if you do anything other than what the mission said you to do, the mission failed. Approach the enemy from another angle? Mission failed. Take a different route? Mission failed. Mount your horse, go there, kill everybody and repeat over and over. I loved the story in this game, but some exciting story missions for me were outweighed by this repetitiveness and lack of freedom.It's definitely worth its price and I highly recommend this game for everyone who loves exploring and slow-paced games."

As a result, I had to reinstall windows and format my SSD, which had the local RDR2 save files.Edit: The saves were on my HDD, now it makes even less sense that Rockstar doesn't have them and they apparently overwrites the saves when reinstalling the game But no biggie I thought, the Rockstar launcher asked me, when I first started the Game up, if I wanted to have Cloud saves enabled, and I said Yea, enable them.So, when my Windows was reinstalled, as well as Red Dead, and I started the Game, I was first glad it asked me to turn Cloud Saves on again, and even said logged in as *MyRockstarTag*.So I started the Story and...It starts from the beginning?I skipped the first sequence, went to the menu and tried to Load a Save file; ""No save files available""...So yea, if Rockstar wouldn't be these self-indulgent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just allowed Steam to make Cloud Saves, I could easily just get my save back from the Steam Cloud Save web-page ( But no, they purposely disabled that Steam feature and didn't allow Steam to make Cloud saves of your progress.So, I've got save files from my, I think over a decade old, session of Portal, but not the RDR2 Save file I had 2 weeks ago?Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ Rockstar.Update like 2 weeks later:I got into contact with Rockstar support and they tried to ""save"" my save file and get it back to me.

The newest update, if you can call it that, had players waiting months for new content only to completely spit in the face of fans and completely disrespect time spent in the game. Nerfing Gold (Premium currency purchased with real money) gains from daily challenges is completely unwarranted and purely greed driven. It is honestly an incredibly scummy thing to have done. If you don't have gold to get the new pass (that doesn't reward gold back as they used too) you best bust out the wallet because it will take weeks of boring grinds to earn the gold to purchase them. Then once you do actually buy the pass and bounty hunter upgrade, yes they charge 15 gold bars to get the BH ""expansion."" They are littered with garbage. The only thing good in these purchases are some QOL changes like cooking more meat and holding more ammo. Changes that should not be knotted to a premium pass I might add. Forcing players to buy gold for QOL changes that have been asked for for two years is absolutely ridiculous.These are just a few of the issues with this absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of an update. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME FOR ONLINE. Story mode is a different story and one of my favorite games of all time, but with Rockstars handling of their ""GTA:O Successor"" and their insatiable greed I cannot even recommend you give Rockstar your money.I usually don't bother making bad reviews but Rockstar needs a wakeup call. People need to brigade the negative reviews like they did when Rockstar tried to stop modding of online."

The game revolves around you - as Arthur Morgan, help the Van der Linde get money so that they can get money and travel far away. But each chapter you progress through, instead of the gang succeeding to get enough money and move away far, the gang will start to tear apart. With each chapter, there will be some gang member dying. Until the end of the chapter on Arthur's side, you will see that the gang is no longer considered as a gang. With mostly everyone leaving Dutch behind, Arthur's fate has long been decided when you do Leopold Strauss's mission once you enter Valentine. If you play as honorary Arthur, you will be given a choice to lay aside watching the sunset on the mountains as Arthur's soul, or take revenge on Micah Bell. The game overall is fantastic, the graphics are gorgeous as hell and along with the amount of activities you can do, watch the environment around you, gambling, doing robberies, fishing, hunting, doing bounty hunting,.. all that kind of stuff. You can really get a lot of amazing moments when you play this game. The NPCs are also a great part of the game as they provide you with some interesting and/or very fun moments to encounter. They make you feel bad at times when you do something horrible at times, or just make you laugh out of the comedy you can get just messing around with them. Rockstar really captured the essence of open-world to this game.It is amazing, so amazing to the point where my laptop couldn't even handle the game, like seriously. I played this game in 360p and 8 FPS (I'm not even lying to you, you can check my screenshots if you want to). Even in 360p, I still felt the game was beautiful on it's own comparing to other games, that's not even mentioning the fact that what the game looks like in 4K.Overall, I think that this game needs and I will repeat, NEEDS to be played if you haven't already. You're missing out precious amounts of time if you're not doing anything. I would give this game a 10/10 or even an 11/10 just because of how good it is, I even consider it to be a masterpiece, even in 2021 (or 2022 as of writing this review). If someone says this game is bad, they haven't tried out this game yet, yes the Rockstar Launcher is very much hot garbage but if you set that aside, I would highly or strongly recommend you to try out the game, even if the Rockstar Launcher is the sole purpose that you didn't buy the game.(Editor's note: I hope that you can get some ideas on if you want to buy this game or not in my short review, it's not a really good review since I'm not that good at writing essays or anything at all relating to long text, that's all and I hope you can enjoy this game once you do buy it.)"

1316,Draino,https://steamcommunity.com/id/33rdblakkglass-/,4,,1,125.7,December,"6,",259,0,1,"Edit 1/2021: Playing this game on a 3080 @1440p and it looks stunning. While averaging 55-75fps with almost maxed out settings this game is by far one of the prettiest games ever. In my opinion this is definitely a game that can only be fully appreciated on the latest hardware. I highly recommend Hardware Unboxed's RDR2 Optimization videos to help optimize this game.To start off, the story is great. Some of the characters are very likable and funny while others are easy to dislike. Without going into too much detail, this story is very good and is probably one of the best of the decade. Arthur Morgan is a great character, and his voice actor did an incredible job. The game world itself not only feels alive but it also feels lived in, Rockstar added in the smallest of details to the game and I have had many moments where I say to myself wow I didn't expect something like that. From game mechanics like eating/drinking, bathing, buying individual items off of store shelves, caring for your horse, hair cutting and beard trimming, right down to the clothing and gun options, this game leaves very view stones unturned. The only part that really upsets me is Rockstar's old ways of mission design. The missions for the most part are very linear and hardly allow players to experiment or try to approach the missions from different ways. Its one of the games few major letdowns and it really unfortunate that they messed up one of the biggest parts of the game. They can easily fix some of these issues by reworking mission restrictions but I doubt they will.Besides the main story there is plenty to do in game. You can be a good guy and do camp chores, help countless numbers of strangers, and spend hours and hours hunting and fishing. If you want to be on the other side of the law you can rob stagecoaches, stores, people, horses, trains and any other living thing you chose to interact with. There is always the option of going on a rampage, however the wanted system in this game is a double edged sword, and in my opinion another let down of the game. You start a fight with an NPC? Wanted. You accidentally press the wrong button and try to rob a store? Wanted. You are out in the middle of nowhere and you kill a person? WITNESS. Its got a lot of flaws. Not to mention the NPCs who beat the crap out of you right next to a lawman, while he stands there and watches - but once you put a finger on the NPC, you guessed it. WANTED. Its not completely broken, as sometimes the system works decently, but like most Rockstar games with a wanted system its pretty artificial and only spawns enemies around you as you try to escape.It is important to remember that this game has many complex, intertwined systems, and these systems work pretty well most of the time, and Rockstar deserves all the praise they get for the Single Player portion of the game. As for Red Dead Online it can be fun but as a solo player you will encounter a lot of other players and posses come after you whenever you are doing your own thing. Its definitely a grind and the pricing of items is designed to make you think about buying gold bars. The story serves as a basic plot and of course your character is a mute. If you enjoy endlessly doing the same things over and over again to unlock a new shirt or horse, only to find out it costs 10 times more then you have in your wallet, this is for you. RDO needs a lot more content to be a great experience, and most will find GTA Online to be more fun, but RDO is still worth it for a few hours at least. In 2021, RDO still does not have anywhere near as much content as GTAO and it is rather obvious that it is not Rockstar's top priority.Overall this game is nearly perfect, and it will take a lot of effort for anyone other than Rockstar to top this absolute gem of a game. This is a game everyone should play, and everyone should hold it in high regard. All video game devs and publishers should strive to create masterpieces like Red Dead Redemption 2, and I am super excited to see how the next GTA game turns out, especially if they use a lot of what they did in RDR2.This boah is a 9.5/10, and I highly recommend it to anyone who can match its hefty performance requirements."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that."

Obviously we know that the game itself, the singleplayer, is great... but coming from GTA Online to this - there is no comparison. Rockstar love GTA much much more than this game, but they are still willing to ask full price + micro transactions for RDO. .... We got an update coming and I hope they fix at least the connection issues, but I'm not holding my breath. Chances are, if you watch gameplay and think RDO would be fun, you will LOVE it... until Day 3 and you can't join the servers, keep getting booted out of them, get weird crashes that come from no where, camp doesn't spawn, missions won't start, your friends bug out and appear not to be playing when they are, NPCs become invincible, etc etc. This game is SO GOOD RDO IS SOOOO AWESOME HOW?

A great story, beautiful graphics, touching moments, immersive world, host of activities and lots of fun make this game just too hard to review. There are thousands of small details like horse balls shrinking, pointing guns at blind men making them react or not if they're a fricking liar or not and so much more that I can't all put in this review. No amount of words can do this game justice.The hunting, amount of clothing in singleplayer and online, strangers, Arthur's beautiful journal, touching and badass moments in the story, voice acting, animation, mocap that the va's themselves did. The sheer amount of detail and work put into the singleplayer is astonishing and I'm happy I could finally exeperience it on PC.This game is praised by many and it's having backlash on PC because of people having issues with performance, either because of outdated drivers, Rockstar's launcher not working or turning their settings too high but all those problems are so small compared to the experience I've had with this game. I love it. Even the Online that many people hate is slowly improving, and is pretty clear of griefers and hackers despite what people say. Go to GTA today and you will have more modders and griefers on your ass than here. There are several little moments that I've captured and recorded of me helping out a player in online and parting with a wave, or finding some secret in the singleplayer and uncovering a story. There's just too much to write down here, I can only tell you that you absolutely should buy this game.

1339,darthaegis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/,5,,1,64.5,March,"29,",386,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western open-world shooter set in 1899, in the last days of the wild, untamed West as civilization slowly creeps in from East. You play as Arthur Morgan, a member in a gang of outlaws.This is a Rockstar game, which entails open world sandbox where you can go around shooting people and doing missions for a large cast of characters, but it feels very different. RDR2 is very slow paced: animations are lengthy, where Arthur sure takes his damn time picking things up, skinning animals, or looting, and just moving around feels like you're controlling a very heavy person. This doesn't make it feel exactly real (it probably doesn't take just 10 seconds to skin an animal in real life), but it feels less grounded and... ""gamey"" than most other games. This isn't a game where you go around doing missions or just shooting people, it wants you to take things slow. After a mission, I usually go hunting, get new clothes, shave, customize my weapons. Depending on the chapter I tried different styles of facial hair and clothing just for the fun of it. Riding around you usually find strangers with smaller side missions, or just random characters that may need help (they sadly repeat and I saw the same man asking me to suck the venom out of his snake bite twice, but even in such a high budget there is always a limit to how much content you see before things start repeating). Just... going around, hunting, talking with the people on your camp, taking in the atmosphere, it's a big part of why the game is enjoyable for me. This isn't something you wanna just turn on for 10 minutes, it's a slow burn that's very enjoyable for longer sessions. The immense detail and beauty of the virtual world Rockstar has created here is a step above everything else you'll play, even if the gameplay itself is nothing special.The missions are mostly the usual Rockstar fare: you get on your car... I mean, horse, you ride around for 5 minutes while your characters talk, and then you shoot a ridiculous amount of people. Divert in any way from what you're supposed to do and you get a Mission Failed screen (this is especially in ""stealth"" missions where the stealth just involves following a character and doing what he tells you to do). What elevates the story is... everything else, really. As scripted as the missions are, the writing is really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good, showing Rockstar's talent when they're not just doing caricatures in their GTA games. As scripted as the missions are, in many of them it feels like they were made to play in this way and this way only. The writing, soundtrack, even the way the camera zooms out when you're with your whole posse, it heightens what is essentially a playable movie with little interaction into... a very good playable movie with little interaction. However, only the best missions feel like this. Many of them feel unnecessarily scripted as aforementioned ""stealth"" missions, or some where I can't even rush enemies with a shotgun because the game thinks I abandoned my companion. The story is absolutely amazing nonetheless (barring - slightly spoilery - ), Arthur Morgan being one of the best characters ever written for a game.I usually can't stand highly scripted games such as Uncharted, and get eventually sick of GTA missions, but RDR2's atmosphere and detail make it a joy to be in 1899 America, and the story is absolutely outstanding. Its slow pace and often questionable design decisions (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hell game, stop switching my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ guns around whenever you want to) may turn off some, but I think it's still very worth playing. Curiously, for such a high budget game it doesn't feel like a design-by-committee mess; it kinda feels like some guy said ""you know, let's make a very slow and autistically detailed western game with a huge map"" and then overworked thousands of people and spent millions to get his vision across. It's a very interesting (and very good!) game."

Game has this strange, scary, gloomy like mood, and i love it. Only Fallout games made me feel similar to this before. Controls are sometimes majorly annoying for such straightforward basic stuff. It takes a long time to get used to it. You gotta be really careful for not pulling your gun, or anger some folk. because even for little things they may go on an all out death match against you. Some people just turn hostile just because you are near them, and they immediately shoot you and never back down, unless you kill em, or run far away.Another thing is, how your camp works. its simply ridiculous, annoying and not worth most of the time. I mean, whats good about ""upgrading"" your tent with some animal skulls. You walk like a slowpoke in your camp, you can mistakenly initiate missions while thinking you are just chatting with NPCs. All of your guns stored in your horse unless you pick them up before getting of your horse, and when you get back on your horse, they automatically go back on your horse... Also, some of your items are in your horse. I see they were trying to look more realistic, but come on, this is GAME! Just give me a backpack and its good to go. Everything is fairly expensive and usual stuff that you can grind to earn money goes by pennies. And you have to go to a special store to sell most things, a place like a pawn shop which are kinda far apart. You advance a bit in the story and then everything turns 180 and drown in money. I have about 10K and nothing else to buy, and yet Dutch needs money for this and that, and work we do brings 500-1K, Dutch says we are so close, it was a good work lolLast thing is inventory clutter. BOY there re so many useless crap in the game. I mean do we really need 10s of different drinks and food and other consumables ? and you can only carry limited amount of real good ones, 3 or 5 etc. Rest is just a clutter, tiny benefits etc.After advancing in the story, and finishing it, I can say this game pretty dope, even with a very little discount, I dont regret buying it!RDR2 Online review:After a year playing Single player, I gave RDO a go, things were pretty slow at first but then, It gets better, especially with the roles, and friends. Coming from Fallout 76, I'd say its a lot harder to make new friends, people are either afraid or griefy. I love going to a rival and help them in their mission. So I play with friends I have. I got The Collector first, and made a ton of money and traveled across the map. Random griefings are not uncommon, stay in defensive mod, work on your ability cards to fight them or just parley and move on, or go to another server. Another tip is, rockstar places you in a map location with the highest player density, so when you join a server, start from a location FAR away from your intended play area, and then fast  travel there. It will most likely have less players/griefers."

Rockstar has removed the ""ignore VRAM limitations"" option that was present in GTA V for this title, meaning that you are literally blocked from controlling the graphical settings in a game that you bought and own.worst and buggiest port of any game i've ever seen. never had as many bugs compound with ♥♥♥♥ design choices as regards settings. cannot recommend this game unless you've got a better GPU than i do, and only then after at least another six months of Rockstar bugfixing. assuming they can be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to do so."

1369,Gasnryo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gasnryo/,4,,1,351.7,January,"2,",111,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is split up into two different games, RDR2 and Red Dead Online. I say they are two different games because of how wildly they differ from each other, both in available content, and gameplay. RDR2 (Which I will refer to as story from now on) is one of the greatest games I have ever played. Theres so many things to explore in the wilderness, so many missions, random encounters with strangers, hunting, and more! There's many hours of replayability here and never ceases to be fun. The story takes you through the adventures of a man named Arthur Morgan, who is part of a notorious gang of outlaws. I can't say much more without spoiling some early game things, but I would highly recommend buying the game for just the story mode.Online on the other hand, is an absolute ♥♥♥♥ show. The wilderness that felt so colorful and full in story feels empty and dull, with less random encounters, a lackluster storyline to follow, and bugged animal spawns. Also, money in online is very hard to get, with most stranger missions paying a maximum of $15, which even for 1899 currency is barely anything. The only solid ways of making money is completing the storyline missions (which give about $200 for your first time completing it, they give very small amounts of money if you choose to replay the mission.) and using roles. Roles are ""jobs"" that you can buy with the premium currency, gold. Completing missions awards very small amounts of gold, so the only way to get it reliably is grinding daily challenges (which give amounts of gold) and getting a streak of multiple weeks to increase the yield of gold they give you. If you aren't able to get on for a day, your streak resets and the challenges go back to giving you the small amount of 0.2 gold. Once you spend a few days/weeks (depending on how much you play) grinding up the gold to get a role, you can start making some okayish money. To get all 4 of the roles, you will need to play for multiple weeks or months, which shouldnt be necessary for a game that gets boring and repetitive quickly.Theres also the issue with bugs. The game uses a P2P connection method, which leads to cheaters, poor connection, long load times, and more. Many times I have completed a high-paying mission or delivery, only to be faced with the disconnect screen instead of being payed. The result? The mission I spent a long time setting up was worthless. This shouldn't be acceptable for a massive company like Rockstar. Sometimes I will try to enter a certain building, just to have it brick me into not being able to use weapons or move freely. Sometimes objectives are uncompletable. I've invested some time into RDO so I have all the roles, and decent ways of making money, so I still play the game occasionally, but at its current state, I would not recommend buying this game for the sole purpose of playing the online mode.One thing I always tell friends who are looking to get it:When you buy Red Dead, you're purchasing the story mode. The online mode is just included as a bonus.(Another note: Once you buy the game, theres no way to upgrade to higher versions without paying the full price again, which is another really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ move by Rockstar.)TL:DR: Story mode is great, online mode is ♥♥♥♥♥♥"

After 65 Hours, I have now beaten it and can easily say that this game is amazing. For the most part, it is not any slower than other story heavy games that I have played. It would have been nice if you could run inside your camp, but other than that minor annoyance, the game never felt dull. There is always something happening. The game does have a decent bit of walking, or in this case horse riding, from one spot to another, but so does every other open world game. This game kept those journeys interesting by almost always having conversations happening during the entire journey.Even before seeing the almost 40-minute-long credits, it was clear that a lot of work went into this game. The world is beautiful, while still running pretty well. Everything is fully voice acted as you would except from a AAA game these days. The story and characters are interesting and well written. I really like that this game was not afraid to . This really made the game feel a lot more real. Something that makes the game stand out is the little things. For example, picking up a skinned animal will get your clothes bloody, which you can wash of by taking a dip in a river and when you go for a swim or hang out in the rain, materials, such as your clothes, get visibly wet. The music in this game is also amazing. Its often very subtle but fits perfectly.Of course, this game is not without issue. The most frustrating issue I had was with movement. Sometimes while simply holding ‘W’ to go straight, my horse would decide to just start running in circles until I completely stopped it and started moving again. Other than that, it was mostly just small things like clipping, floating objects, or a horse parked funnily."

If you're interested in it's story mode it's actually pretty alright.Rockstar's attempts to incentivize players into participating in PvP gameplay is a borderline joke when considering how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the player on player interactions become. Players relying on endgame equipment and OP ability cards to irritate low level players helps build complete apathy and ignorance to such a feature, a feature I was looking forward to.Also hackers galore, teleporting players, blowing them up, spawning 30 panthers around them, they've even managed to drain players hard earned cash over time. With all this in mind Rockstar prefers to patch money exploits and quick xp glitches rather than enacting justice on these power-tripping neanderthals that plague this game in droves.You'd think Rockstar would've learned from GTA:Online."
1377,Dao Jones,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dao_jones/,9,,0,30.6,October,"24,",143,0,1,"TL;DR: This is a really great game marred by absolutely horrible PC controls.I want to like this game. I really, really do. Great graphics, good story, interesting NPCs, and a dynamic world you can interact with that changes over time. It's got everything it needs to be absolutely amazing.Except a decent control scheme.Like most PC ports of a console game, the controls are a bit fiddly. Functions that innately require button press sensitivity (like gun duels/fast draw) simply don't work as well due to the fact that PC keyboards don't function that way. Steering with keys in a system that expects stick movement ends up feeling really sluggish, and sometimes you just lose control and crash into things while doing something important like riding for dear life away from a bandit camp that you unwisely picked a fight with.But that's not the worst part. It's the buttons. Dear god, *everything* you do in this game requires too many discrete buttons to accomplish.Picking up loot has two separate buttons. Gun duels require several buttons. Using Deadeye? Three. Hell - even trying to exit the @#$%ing game requires literally FIVE different actions to accomplish (Esc > select Exit > Action Key to confirm > Quit Game on main menu > Action Key to confirm).It's clumsy, and it's janky, and it's basically killing the game for me. Sure, I could use a controller, but if I wanted to use a controller I'd have just bought the game on console. (Plus, I can't bullseye headshots for crap with my thumbs. Mouse Aim Crew 4 Lyfe.)Some people can get past all that (or aren't bothered by it), and I salute those people. This game is well-loved for a reason. But for those of us that don't want to play Twister every time we want to loot a battlefield, this game is a regrettable pass."

Still, it's compelling on multiple levels if you can endure the consoleitis that plagues the UI and controls (and a few bugs besides).It's not a mile-a-minute in terms of action sequences and more often than not the joy is found in immersing yourself in the beautiful game world and moseying on about to stumble across random encounters or engage with the plentiful busywork (collect-a-thon and minigame completionists will be moderately satisfied).Overall, there's a lot of outlaw role-playing and shooting fun to be had here if you can work past the game's shortcomings. I have not engaged in the online mode yet as by most accounts it's full of griefers akin to GTA Online. Sort your life out Rockstar."

As much as I want to really love and recommend this audiovisually stunning game, especially to more of my friends so that we can have fun together on it, I'm sad to say that my very first review on Steam is to point out that this game's glaring flaws stifle its success as proven by the generally mixed reviews from its playerbase.I thought, as an add-on, I would include more to points brought up in my friend's review mentioned above:• Vanishing NPCs: The beautiful wilderness is often scarce of wildlife, making hunting — one of my favorite aspects of the game — less exciting and more of a chore for certain challenges or building up materials for the Trader role.• Stability: I originally played the game using DX12 as the renderer, but as a result of their latest patch, this has caused my game to completely lock up my computer. I was forced to switch back to Vulcan, which unfortunately causes the aforementioned disruptive and reoccurring ""ERR_GFX_STATE"", necessitating the routine deletion of the sga files to resolve. Infinite loading screens upon entering or changing sessions/lobbies definitely adds to this frustration.• Posse: In regards to the ""content starting"" bug, it also prevents inviting or joining a posse as well, which is equally frustrating.• Griefers: While I encounter them somewhat uncommonly, they are generally nuisances. If you're a Rival Trader or Moonshiner, or something, fine. But running up and executing me for no reason other than to just ruin my time to relax and enjoy something because you're miserable in real life, you're just being obnoxious. Unfortunately, many griefers tend to be...• Hackers: The single most infuriating part of the game. If you're going to grief me, at least do it fairly and not be untargetable, undamageable, and ragdolling me into the sky with explosions, while spawning predators everywhere, and circumventing my reports for your disruptive and cheating behavior. These two points about griefers and hackers are especially prevalent during my evenings, particularly when players from ""the Far East"" start appearing online.• Customer Support: Painfully slow, although seemingly accommodating upon response when provided with enough details of your issue.The following is a >>player-made<< patch note list from another website that hits the nail on the head on how many players feel:• fixed an issue where an infinite black loading screen would appear when completing/starting missions or switching lobbies• fixed an issue where moonshine making progress would randomly reset, even if the player were doing nothing other than standing inside their shack• fixed an issue where the price of mash would randomly reset to $50• fixed animal spawns• fixed bounty hunter license awarded from Twitch Prime benefits• fixed an issue where players could not start/leave a Posse because the ""in mission"" status was stuck, even after completing the activity• fixed an issue where player camps could not be placed• fixed an issue where player camps would be invisible• fixed an issue where player camps would randomly change locations when logging in• fixed an issue where piece of **** cheaters could attack all players from any location• fixed an issue where piece of **** cheaters could teleport other players across the mapYou get the point.Rockstar's blatant negligence and disregard to the playerbase overall is disappointing for a AAA studio. It appears they put very little effort into the health of the game given its patch history and large severity of bugs, glitches, and exploits that go unresolved. Given its niche of being Old Western-themed, you think Rockstar would want to really make it stand out and polish their product to appeal to players who have been looking for a setting as such to play with their friends in, rather than allow it to appear as it does, a cash-grab that they simply don't care about enough to improve.TL;DR — If you're looking to play this game, buy it for the single-player portion. You'll be fairly disappointed with the Online portion for the time being and foreseeable future."

You will find many of the same gameplay elements of the first game expanded upon, and if you are a new player luckily this game will take you through all you need to know. The story and soundtrack are well developed (as they should be, the game was in development for 5+ years) and no doubt rock* achieved what they were looking for.Besides all of that, this game does for me what many others fail to do. It brings me peace to simply play within the environment. You can travel, camp, hunt, relax, and take in the nature that could fool you for the real thing. Many of us struggle with blood pressure, depression, and dissatisfaction, however RD2 at least lets me forget about and attempt to mend that for the time I play it. That is something I cant put a price on, and therefore I recommend this game. No memes, no caveats, if you want to feel peace but cant physically spend a week out in the state parks camping, then play this game. Take care everyone <3Edit: Rockstar is making Red Dead Online a stand alone optional purchase beginning December 1st. For $5 you will have access to the multiplayer only version of the game, while rdr2 rarely goes on sale and if so does not drop further than $40, this will get you to explore the wilderness at a much lower point of entry. The physics and textures are toned down online as compared to the singleplayer version, however if that does not turn you away: welcome"

It is fairly slow paced which might not appeal to everyone. This is not a game you want to play in short sessions. From the moment you launch RDR2 it is so immersive you might as well forget you have real life for a while. Incredible attention to detail and beauty of this massive world is a step above everything else you have played before, even if the gameplay itself is nothing too special.Game world looks stunning, actually some of the best visuals I have ever seen in a video game. Amazing story with great, memorable characters and even better voice acting. World feels alive, there is always something happening around you. To me RDR2 felt more like a good movie you get to take a part in rather than a video game and I enjoyed every moment of it. The main story alone is lengthy but there is so much to do besides the main story you will no doubt get sidetracked for hours at a time before you realize you have important business to attend to.Having said all that RDR2 is not without its flaws. Controls on PC feel really awkward and clunky, sometimes to the point of frustration. Some weird sound glitches every now and then. Online is average at best. And then there is the mandatory Rockstar’s social club launcher. F*ck you social club.All in all it has been an incredible journey, definitely worth a buy."

It is the same beautiful world, but in your own created character perspective same as GTA Online.

Apart from John Marston from Red Dead Redemption 1 Arthur has became the most fan favourite character not because of personality but also for every action he makes in the video game-->Smooth Freeroam : The free roam in this game is unlike any other game. Red Dead Redemption 2 has  relaxing free roam with a natural environment and great visuals and physics-->Online multiplayer : The online multiplayer experience at the moment is decent actually, not a lot of contents and also the moonshine businesses and few objectives are cool but lengthy, if you got friends to play with its fun but i really didn't enjoy that much playing alone as the online is still lacking content--> Story : The story is outstanding and it will give u goosebumps and specially talking about real goosebumps here if u played rdr 1 before. The game really gives you a cowbow kind of feeling which is absolutely amazing besides good soundtracks. I loved how they actually make the game in a way that your choices actually matter and also the ending depends on your choices. Every single characters in the game were outstanding but my personal favourite were Arthur Morgan, Sean and Hosea besides John from red dead redemption 1. The game takes place before the time period of red dead redemption 1 so it's really intense. I won't spoil much anymore play it yourself and taste the masterpiece yourselfReplayability : Undoubtedly yes Game lackings : 1) Red Dead Online contents are very less, they should add more content to make the multiplayer more enjoyable.2) Some of the missions in the game feels a bit repetitive and boring3) have poor optimization for PC players ( they recently fixed it, it's a bit better now )4) Red Dead Online grind is too lengthy and buying a new horse or owning any business is really hard with less effort Note : besides these there were no other flaws found in the game according to my opinion and and the game was an absolute masterpiece for me so far thanks for reading"

I’m a huge fan of open-world games and this is easily the best open-world I’ve experienced. It may not be the largest or have the most activities, but it’s a joy to spend time in. It’s probably the most visually impressive game I’ve ever played, from the general beauty and atmosphere to fine details like footprints in mud and bullet holes in hats.Those impressive visuals need a powerful PC to experience though. With an i5 12600k and 3080 I ended up using graphics analysis videos on Youtube to configure everything to get a mostly-stable 120Hz at 1440p. I have screenshots of the settings I used in my collection that may be of help.I’m posting this after a single playthrough of the story mode. I didn’t rush through the game but I also deliberately didn’t see everything, to save plenty of side content for another time.The story hooked me in the first hour and never let go. The general pace is excellent, the characters are interesting with fantastic voice acting and the missions were varied and interesting from beginning to end. The soundtrack and general ambience are stunning. I repeatedly found myself strolling through populated areas, finding somewhere to sit and watching the world go by, listening to conversations between people that could easily have been missed. I haven’t done that since my first playthrough of Skyrim. The world really feels alive.Red Dead Redemption 2 is easily one of the best games I’ve ever played, and in my humble opinion it’s one of the greatest games ever made. I could say a lot more about the game, but I don’t want to spoil any aspect of it for anyone. I went in blind and I’m very glad I did.It certainly isn’t perfect though. The compulsory Rockstar launcher sometimes decides I don’t own the game, requiring a restart of just the launcher or the whole PC. I’ve also experienced a few crashes when trying to load the game from the main menu, though I didn’t experience a single crash once I was actually in. I experienced a few graphical glitches, like shadows not appearing or shadows not disappearing when they should, a bit of light flickering, some artifacts when very close to particle clouds and parts of the main characters face not loading, but nothing major. Most were solved be reloading the last save.I did find the controls a little awkward at times. I started the game using mouse & keyboard, where I found armed combat very easy but melee combat and general movement was clumsy. After a few hours I tried a controller and found everything except armed combat much better. The free-aim was too slow with controller, but enabling aim assist helped without doing all the work for me so I’d personally recommend playing with a controller.I was hesitant to get this at first, as I’ve never really been a fan of stories in this setting, I never played the first game and I found GTAV disappointing overall, but from the opening cutscene to the end credits, Red Dead Redemption 2 is enthralling, spectacular and magnificent. I very highly recommend it to anyone interested in story-based games. It’s an experience I certainly won’t forget."

The game has a meticulous, plodding pace that is genuinely fantastic and allows complete immersion.  It's what I'd consider a period piece; the game is best played if you assume the role of Arthur and do the things you believe Arthur would do.  It's not a game for you to go max speed everywhere, shoot everything in sight.  The game will allow it, but you won't be getting the most out of it.PC port is fine so far - have had one bug that required a restart due to losing the ability to interact with my horse at one point, but other than that I've had no performance issues.  Game is running great at 4k even on my aging setup (i7 6700k/1080).  Gorgeous game, enticing storyline, and a world that feels incredibly alive - I'm a massive fan."

Full of both thrill and emotion. Profound gamelay and beautifully breathtaking graphics. The story sticks with you forever after you're done with the game. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game about consequences where you have only the illusion of choice. Yes, there are some decisions to be made, and those decisions will shape your character and the world around you. But some of the most disastrous choices were made for you before the game even begins, leaving you to deal with the fallout.Red Dead Redemption 2's version of America is vast and wide open, stretching from snowy mountains and the Great Plains down to the original game's New Austin in the southwest. Further to the east is the Louisiana-inspired Deep South, which is still feeling the effects of the Civil War after nearly 40 years. There's a distinct shift when traveling from region to region; as grassy hillsides become alligator-filled swamps, Union veterans give way to angry Confederate holdouts, and good intentions and casual racism turn into desperation and outright bigotry. The variety makes the world feel rich, and it both reacts to you and changes independently of your involvement; new buildings will go up as time goes on, and some of the people you talk to will remember you long after you first interacted with them (for better or worse).The story has incredible weight as a prequel with the anticipation that comes from knowing how it all ends. A varied and reactive world filled with chance encounters and surprises to discover compels you to explore. Mission structure and morality mechanics create tension that increases the story's impact.Simpy one of the best games out there, definitely well worth your money."

1452,Commander Llama,https://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/,4,,1,157.6,December,"29,",678,0,1,"Not reviewed: Online mode. I am only playing the Story mode right now.First, the Bad:- Demanding game. I wouldn't recommend this game without also recommending watching the DigitalFoundry and HardwareUnboxed Optimization videos from YouTube. Even so, on a top spec PC I can manage 1440p at 60-100fps, the range varies a lot by time of day and environment. I could run 4K at 45-60fps. This is after following the optimized setting guides, which boosted performance by around 40% at almost no discernible visual cost.- Stability may vary. Mine has been good, but some people I know have reported consistent isses. I crashed to desktop once in 37 hours while playing at 4K. No other crashes.- Performance tanks with Steam Overlay events is a consistent issue of mine. Whether you have the In-Game Overlay enabled or not. If someone sends me a message on Steam, the game starts micro-stuttering quite a bit, even though fps counters don't register it.- Dual layer DRM. Rather expectedly, the game runs the Rockstar service behind the Steam service. I also have the Nvidia overlay, so there's quite a number of layers on this bad boy. No big surprise the above bug exists...The Good:- Pretty much everything else. This is one of the best games I've ever played, and I think I will give it the #1 spot for most immersive. Most of the bad points are technical in nature, but once we assume you're running the game fine and so on, I have almost nothing but good things to say about it. - Huge, but not over-sized game world with a number of different biomes. You're never more than a hundred meters away from some kind of action, so there's always something to do theoretically. Exploring and hunting  in this space is so much fun. Plenty of secrets to find, people to rob/save, animals to study/hunt, and scripted encounters to come across.- The gunplay really comes home on PC, where you can finally aim with a damn mouse. I played about 30 hours on Xbox and while the game is still great, I disliked the mandatory reliance on auto-aim. With a mouse I can aim so much better, but I still need practice and skill to be the best gunslinger in the land.- The gang and camp gameplay adds a richness to resource acquisition and management that makes it feel like more than just numbers going up or bank account getting bigger. The gang characters are varied and boost the immersion. The story isn't mindblowing so far (in Chapter 3), but you can just about ignore it after the introductory Chapter 1.- I just really can't get over the attention to detail in the game, and the game design. Everything seems well thought out, from time it takes to skin animals or loot things, being able to choose honor vs. dishonor, supporting the gang vs. not. This may backfire with some players however, since the game ""takes its time"" and all these animations have a pretty massive input latency. Dark Souls slick RDR2 is not.The Nitpicks:- The introduction (Chapter 1 and part of Chapter 2) is rather slow, which I think will lose some players. The game also really takes its time introducing concepts. You're almost at Chapter 3 when the game explains a gunsmith, for instance, which is so elementary and can be visited right away.- Not aware of being able to set a consistent weapon loadout for Arthur when he mounts and then dismounts his horse. I pretty much rock the same weapons every damn time, but the game constantly unequips my weapons and I have to set them up every time. This does get old after a while.- I keep chugging Hair Tonic but I can't seem to get my beard longer than 7 on 10!- The ""Core Drain"" bug might still exist. I've been playing the game at roughly 75fps (compared to the console ~30) and Arthur is becoming consistently underweight even though I eat game meat regularly and stop for meals at saloons. It's not severe, but good PC performance might still correlate with skinny Arthur.- Far be it from me to suggest nerfs, but the Legend of the East satchel is a little OP. Carrying capacity is 3 or 5 for most items. Upgraded satchels can double that for one item type, and then Legend of the East does Full Blown Video Game and boosts most capacity to 99 for all items. Kind of an insane jump. Why not all item types to 10?- As far as I can tell, all of the Pearson camp upgrades don't matter besides the satchel? It would be cool if they did."

1455,Divalti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Divalti/,5,,1,57.1,November,"27,","1,499",0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an epic taking place across a long span of time and several locations, telling the tale of Arthur Morgan, the rough-around-the-edges yet lovable lieutenant of the Van der Linde outlaw gang.Aesthetically, the game does a great job. The Van der Linde gang's journey will take them to all manners of locations, from frosted mountaintops to vast plains to soggy swamps. You'll find yourself at new, beautiful locations at a reasonable pace and, if you're anything like me, you'll always find something to investigate. The visuals are intertwined alongside great sound quality as well. I was enamored by the voices of the characters you interact with, the sounds of the animals and the somberness of the sung music.After a botched heist forces the Van Der Linde gang on the run, they search for that ""one last heist"" that will finally let them go into hiding comfortably forever. Arthur will have to duel rival gangs and Pinkerton lawmen to keep his posse safe along the way. The story for the game is quite enjoyable, but it is not the star.  What draws you in more are instead the characters. Protagonist Arthur Morgan is a man of but's - serious but comical, shaken but determined, brash but endearing. The other characters you'll meet aren't quite as lovable as Arthur, but you'll love the ones you're intended to love and hate the ones you're intended to hate, and it's hard to ask for more.The gameplay mixes combat with exploration.  Outside of story missions, I wandered the western prairies,  hunting animals, investigating stranger encounters, and squandered my time just simply exploring in a relaxed fashion. The story missions can do with a little more variance - most of them involve going to a location, getting shot at, and shooting back. Still, the missions were enjoyable. A gripe I do have however is how unrewarding it is to be a criminal -  you'll quickly accrue a bounty if you're not a skillful outlaw.I didn't get too far into Online - I encountered a few bugs and lost connection to the Online server and decided that I had enough of Red Dead 2 for my money's worth.TLDR: If you're going to play Red Dead Redemption 2 for its base campaign, you'll almost definitely enjoy it due to its charming characters, diverse locations, and simple but engaging gameplay. I can't speak for the quality of the Online because that mode seemed to be pretty buggy, as opposed to the story mode."

Details are very amazing, characters are easy to get along with, and easily one of the best games of this generation along side with Witcher 3 and God of War.A lot of people are claiming this game is very bland and boring because you ride with your horse and destination can take a long time. However, once you push through the story you won't stop playing the game. In Red Dead Redemption 2 there are features that makes things easier like the saving feature which you don't have to go back to camp to ensure your game is saved, fast travel system in game, and other side quest which is not repetitive and can be very interesting.You play as Arthur Morgan and you are apart of the Dutch's Van Der Linde Gang. A bunch of outlaws fighting for freedom after the incident that happen at Blackwater. Each chapter demonstrates what the Van Der Linde gang goes through to survive. As you progress in the story, you will see how each characters build up with emotions and connections.Do not go in this game and expect to be or have the same gameplay as Grand Theft Auto or any other Rockstar title.

This will be my last Rockstar game I will ever bother playing legitimately currently it doesn't matter anymore time to look for some actual mods. is clearly Rockstar doesn't give a f*** if I play by their rules they'll do whatever they feel like doing. they offer zero customer support and outright say in their email they sent to you when you are suspended there is nothing you can do about it that you cannot fight it nor will they restore your account.

Single Player  runs terribly, Multiple black screens, infinite loading screens, buggy path finding, broken audio and a downright abysmal frame rate on SLI systems makes this a huge disappointment for me. And that's just on the Single Player mode.     To say Online is in a good place is a lie. The community has had major problems since GTAO and those same problems carry over to RDO. Hackers are abundant with overpowered weapons, speed hacks, aim bots and exploits. Forced online play is a joke and the idea that they removed private instances reeks of them selling it back to you like Bethesda did. On top of the random kicks that are clearly on Rock Stars end. A lot of the bugs from single player come to online as well. Broken animal spawns, audio bugs, broken screen tearing and bad hit boxes make playing with friends a chore. The “DLC” patches that you have to pay way too much for reeks of greed, and once start you run the risk of crashing out or having trolls one shot you even in defensive mode.

Between the main story, the online mode and the hundreds of hours of optional content, this is one of the rare games that is truly worth every penny you spend for what it will give you in return.

1509,Danika,https://steamcommunity.com/id/diasam/,6,,1,704.8,November,"26,",343,0,1,"Well, here we are. I can honestly say that this has been one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. It took me well over 300 hours to 100% the game, though admittedly I took my time taking in all that the game has to offer. RDR2 is, by far, the most content-rich open world game that I have played, and I wish I could experience it all over again. Apart from the rare immersion-breaking bug, this is the most realistic game that I've seen to date and implemented some features that I've been longing for in games since forever, for example snow physics and a great looking, stable LOD.If The Witcher 3 amazed me with its world building and landscapes, RDR2 brought up the same feeling in me, but elevated it to a whole other level. Not only was the world beautifully designed, it really felt alive. Not just were the cities bustling with NPCs following everyday schedules, but the wilds were brimming with wildlife. And holy ♥♥♥♥ I commend Rockstar, there was so much effort put into the wildlife, with so many lifelike animals to observe and discover. The map itself is huge and full of places to explore, from ancient burial grounds to strange landmarks to abandoned shacks. There's so many little easter eggs and oddities scattered around the world, some of which haven't even been found out yet. There are also tons of challenges and sets of collectables to complete and the process of filling up my journal was very entertaining and satisfying. If you're a perfectionist/collector/achievement hunter like me, I can't think of a more perfect game for you, because there is a TON to do.As usual with Rockstar games, the characters and voice acting did not disappoint. There are so many well-made charismatic, lovable characters and a healthy dose of humour sprinkled throughout your interactions with them. Every single character that matters in this game feels human with their own flaws and problems. Arthur himself is an outstanding protagonist, a complicated (anti-)hero that undergoes some incredible character development as the game progresses. Going through this journey with Arthur is the most I could empathise with a story in any media in a long time. I'll even go so far as to say that Arthur Morgan is probably one of the best video game characters of all time.In my opinion, the story was fantastic. Without spoiling the details, it's about an outlaw gang in the late 19th century America trying to survive as the glory days of the Wild West are coming to an end. The tale was moving, and I have to admit, also pretty emotional. There were moments of elan after a momentous occasion, moments of exasperation and absolute tearjerkers. I enjoyed it very much, even if it did make me depressed as is usually the case after you finish a good story.Of course there were some gripes I had with RDR2. The game felt quite badly optimized for PC and the performance could definitely have been better. Graphical errors and crashes were quite abundant, so were connection issues on the Red Dead Online servers, which in the end I couldn't even be bothered with. As for the actual quests, in both story mode and online, they were nothing innovative or special and carried out in the usual Rockstar fashion. Similarly to GTA, most quests followed the formula of: go here, commence shootout with the baddies, collect the payment, escape, and repeat. So even in this late 19th century setting, Rockstar managed to make ""steal a car"" quests, only that the ""cars"" are horses and carriages.Overall however, my experience with RDR2 was one of a kind and I'll never forget the fun I had with this game. I was very pleased with RDR2's story mode and I do believe it's a masterpiece of a game. Hats off to the artists, the writers, the animators, voice actors and everyone who contributed to make this into the great game that it is.""It's been quite a journey."""

While RDR2, compared to GTA V, may be lacking in it's Online mode, it compensates through the well-crafted story and gameplay. You find yourself in the shoes of Arthur Morgan, an enforcer in the Van der Linde gang, a rogue's gallery of outcasts that desperately cling on to old-world ideals in a society that is quickly modernising. As the story progresses, the feeling of hopelessness, melancholia, and disillusionment begin resonating deeply as Arthur begins to question himself, and the values of his mentor. Without spoiling much, it all culminates in a cathartic finale that gives a satisfying and bona-fide end to the prequel chapter of Red Dead Redemption. As someone who was completely uninterested in GTA V's plot, RDR2 was a complete surprise; I found myself being immensely invested in the characters, the overarching storyline, and the  themes of change. Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an exceptional title that doesn't just introduce an abundant amount of action, but also a heartfelt tale of the final days of the Wild West. You don't have to play the first Red Dead to get into this masterpiece, but if you have, it only makes the whole experience more bittersweet. Greatly recommend."

Rockstar is making the same mistakes again and again.So I have played GTA V, and I'm well aware of how it is plagued with cheaters (""modders"" ? Whatever you call them, kids) who are free to ruin any session by using ridiculously obvious hacks that would have been unimaginable in any other game (changing weather, turning your player into objects, slaying you, etc.). Now I have bought RDR2, and I was hoping that somehow, Rockstar would have learned from their mistakes and made it more difficult to hack the game to the core in multiplayer. Well, I was completely wrong.I have only played about 4 hours, half of which I actually spent online. And I already had to leave a session because someone was able to set me on fire wherever I spawned, instantly killing me. And because they really couldn't care less about this problem, you have : 1) No easy way to report a player for cheating and 2) No way to LEAVE THE GAME or change server before you respawn. I actually had to Alt+F4 to be able to escape this situation.Seriously, what's the point of tolerating mods in RDR online ? Can't they use some kind of anti-cheat ? (Even games with the most basic hack protections could easily spot someone messing with the code in such obvious ways) This is especially sad considering this was released YEARS after a game which already had these issues from the start.I paid more than 40€ for this, and I am greatly disappointed. My advice : If you want to buy this thing, wait until it gets veeeeery cheap. Not worth a cent right now."

I’m sure the players would have come with stuff to keep the game feeling fresh between the sorely missed updates.

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

When a game is this big (150 GBs) let's understand there will be bugs in putting everything together. However, the game is certainly not overclock friendly and if you are struggling with error_gfx error you can try these steps that worked for me:If your game is crashing right on the start, delete the RDR2 folder FROM rockstar games. Enable cloud saves so that if it happens again, you have your saves.1) Make sure that you have latest windows updates.2) If you are running on an overclocked CPU, make sure that it is stable. 3) Install MSI afterburner-kombuster and test your GPU stability. If you have overclocked it already it could be causing the crash, try bumping down the core clock by 20 and memory by 100 each time. Hopefully this should fix your gfx error.4) If you get some frame stuttering, optimize it further by bumping down your core/memory clock."

I have a 1080, i7 6700K and 16 GB of memory and I get ~30-60 FPS, which is not great, but it's quality over quantity. I haven't seen any bugs or weird performance issues or anything like that.The graphics are somewhere between painterly and photorealistic. In a way it reminds me of BOTW (Zelda), though obviously a far greater amount of processing power is being thrown at it. Just beautiful, in a handcrafted way that transcends polygon count and texture resolution etcetera. Lots of handcrafted shaders here.What I've seen of the story is decent too. The characters are drawn fairly well, good voice acting, good cinematic presentation. Some of the missions feel like they aren't much more than delivery vehicles for dialogue.That brings me to the bad part: the gameplay. It's tedious. The dude walks *so* slow, and his ""run"" speed is constantly changing in arbitrary ways depending on where you are and what you're doing. All the animations are slow, and the dude controls like he's wading through molasses. I am not new to third-person cover shooters but I constantly find myself doing stupid stuff like getting behind the wrong cover or walking when I should be running, and it's mostly because there's no immediacy to the controls. Looting buildings is excruciating.There are too many systems. I feel like they really wanted to create an immersive experience, and it works sometimes, but just as often I find myself feeling like the game wants me to keep track of so many things and juggle so many menus and button presses (e.g. every time you get off your horse you have to go up to it and press some buttons or you'll find yourself without weapons when you need them) that it's just exhausting in a way that's destructive to immersion. I spent a bunch of money on a cool horse and a bunch of time feeding it apples and whatnot to build its trust and then some bandits spawned in front of me and headshotted me instantly and only later did I notice that when I died my horse had been replaced by one that looked similar but was actually new and worse... I think? I don't even *know* what happened to my horse. It did not feel good to have the game take that away in such an arbitrary and frustrating way without even explaining what happenedAnd *that* brings me to the combat: it sucks. It's bad mostly because of the aforementioned slow-as-molasses movement controls. I feel like I'm trying to control the dude with puppet strings. Sometimes enemies will just headshot you and you will die instantly, sometimes they are completely ineffective. I'm not expecting something arcadey like Gears, but look at e.g The Last of Us for movement and combat that's tense and fraught and messy without using comically slow movement and convoluted controls as a crutch to achieve ""realism"".I get that some people might really enjoy this sim-style gameplay, but it's not for me. Right now I'm pissed off at the game because it sucks me in with its beauty and then does something opaquely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and frustrating that makes me feel like a chump for trusting it. I don't know how much more of it I'll play."

Lets be clear; I think RDR2 the game is the best gaming experience of 2019. But the PC version just took a dump on everyone who bought it.The game itself is great. I had crashes but it wasn't because of the game (I'll get to that later). The game is gorgeous; simply breathtaking, no doubt, when I played hooked up to my 60"" 4K TV. My beefy rig was able to run it maxed out at 4K at a solid 45 fps average. But by using the very good benchmark included with the game, I was able to fiddle around to get the game looking almost as good as maxed out but with an extra 10+ fps average.The only problem I had playing the game itself, when I was able to actually play it, was with the mushy mouse controls. No amount of fiddling with the ingame mouse sensitivity settings or my mouse's dpi settings was able to get it to feel right. I think I would have gotten use to it in a couple of hours; but I was not able to play for that much...And the reason is simple: greed. I know having your own launcher platform is the new craze in the industry; but come on! The Rockstar Launcher is a piece of garbage, and that's being generous. Shoehorning a launcher that's neither needed or wanted on the PC port of the best game of the year is just simply ridiculous. I mean; the launcher isn't even able to recognize the game's installation FFS!Preloading the game, installing it, installing the Rockstar Launcher, synching my Steam account with my existing Rockstar Social Club account, and booting up the game for the first time all went without a hitch. I was able to use the game's benchmark to get my optimal graphics settings and actually create a character for online and play for about 30 mins. Then the game crashed; and I wasn't able to get the game to start up again for almost 24 hours... all because of the Rockstar Launcher. Rockstar support has been less than useless and suggested that the solution for my problem is to redownload a 100+GB game... not gonna happen. Finally got in to the game again and then found out the character I spent 20 mins creating and through most of the beginning tutorial was deleted because the game crashed before I actually completed the tutorial. That was the last straw.Sorry for the wordy review; but I hope this helps to shed some light on what you're going to face if you buy this game. I would say wait a few months to see how things pan out then decide."

Im talking i got into a pvp match and a guy was flying around in godmode firing dynamite like a machine gun and blowing everything up within a 50 meter radius.

Thats awesome; watch your camp disappear in front of you then you cant reset it up because it glitched itself into oblivion. Missions get glitched horses get glitched. Like ive played prealpha early release games on day one with less glitches. The economy is hot garbage. They pretty much force you to pay real money to buy gold in order to progress in ANY of hte roles. Unless you have 7 months of time to farm up the gold needed to even START a role. OR you can be one of the AFK asshats joining pvp missions for the microscopic gold output from doing pvp. They effectively prevent pvp missions from progressing because not enough people complete the task; being afk and all. And what gives in online mode; there is literally no role for a criminal? But they made a collector role? Who the hell wants to roam around collecting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ OVER being a bank robber? Like what? Huge miss. Bad all around. If you want to play online; dont get this.

You see only the possi leader can have a role active. You want to be a trader and they want to be a bounty hunter? Too bad. You cant do both. Whats worse; trader role is a passively wait for goods to build up afte ryou load cripps up. But you STILL HAVE TO BE POSSI leader to have them increase. So everyone just stays away from possis until theyre ready to go on a trade run; then they all join up get money and leave again. This game is outright awful if you wish to play with friends.

It actually HAS that confidence. And it delivers. This is the greatest video game narrative ever written. The choice to make it a prequel and tie it back to John Marston’s old days in the Dutch Van Der Linde Gang is hands down the BEST aspect of this game. It harkens back to characters you love, so you instantly have that connection and uses that context to establish new characters you’ll know and love as well. Arthur Morgan’s struggle with morality and the inevitable outcome of his actions is one of the most engaging gaming stories ever told and is a great successor to John Marston’s story which was also brilliant."

1567,A Tomato,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustatomato/,3,,1,87.1,November,"12,",250,0,1,"is Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive's 2018 blockbuster open world action game. This prequel to 2010's Red Dead Redemption tells the story of the Dutch Van der Linde gang's fight for survival and eventual downfall, in the increasingly civilized frontier of 1899's United States. this review only covers the singleplayer aspect of the game. Also,  - you have been warned.Starting off with the visuals, it is an absolutely gorgeous looking game, and remains remarkably presentable even with the majority of graphics options turned down*. Given its scope and scale, it understandably is taxing when run on the highest settings, yet remains comfortably playable when tweaked moderately. The visual atmosphere is fantastic, owing to very frequent use of volumetric effects and lighting - mornings and evenings in forests, especially, look extraordinary. The remaining technical aspects are high class as well, as every conceivable thing in the game world is pleasingly detailed and smoothly animated.*Most options can be reduced or disabled without compromising the graphics quality of the game,  It's in your best interest to keep this one at the very least on High.The voice acting in RDR2 is fantastic and varied, and given the extensive focus on storytelling and character development, this is most welcome. The majority of sound effects are also high quality and generally fitting. Music is where things turn somewhat mixed, sadly. The actual lyrical tracks, which play at pivotal moments in the story, are excellent and even emotional, and the freeroam ambience is nice, but most missions use something of a layered composed soundtrack, which unfortunately quickly ends up repetitive.The story gets special attention in this title, possibly being Rockstar's most ambitious and relatable tale yet. It's easily the main attraction of the game: experiencing being a member of the Van der Linde gang, even as it slowly falls apart. All the cast you encounter and interact with in the game, especially your gang members, are colourful and likeable, and your own protagonist are merely humans who wish they could do something else. The actual gameplay is immediately familiar to people who have played previous GTA titles, or indeed RDR: group of outlaws, criminals and/or outcasts perform deeds ranging from morally dubious to downright criminal, in order to make ends meet. The world is packed with opportunities for side activities, including poker, five finger fillet, hunting, horse breaking, robberies, as well as assorted challenges like performing a feat under certain conditions. A set of light survival and maintenance elements exist, as your basic health, stamina and Dead Eye (bullet time) stats should be maintained with occasional food and other provisions (and the same applies to your horse), but can generally be ignored at the cost of reduced regen and lower buffer for damage.Rockstar has gone all in on the immersive presentation of the game: almost every action done in the game world comes with its own little animation. This is a double edged sword, however: to pick up something, your character must stand in the industry regulated position to do so, and cannot set aside an object if need be, unless it's in its own designated spot. These take up a few seconds on their own, but can quickly add up over the course of the story, and further slow down the game's pacing - not to mention being, ironically, immersion breaking on their own just because of how  the game is in performing these actions.Gunplay isn't significantly different in execution from other Rockstar outings: a standard third person over-the-shoulder shooter. They attempted to add another layer of complexity/immersion/??? with manual weapon cocking, which in practice just needs another click or trigger pull to fire. Hardly enriches the gameplay, but instead makes it more tedious. Most long arms and alternate weapons are stored in your horse's satchel, and you can't carry your entire arsenal on your person all the time, which is fair game... but the game doesn't like you being certain of the weapons you've  set up for use while near the horse, which means you must double check your assigned weapons, lest you leave for battle with just two revolvers. This is actually annoying, which doesn't help how the regular combat is only ""alright"" at best.What really makes the game less fun to play through is that  in stark contrast to the open world mechanics and random encounters. Despite being where all the juicy action takes place, you cannot deviate from the path or go too far behind or ahead of your allies, otherwise you risk failing the mission. In fact, you generally can't try nonstandard solutions, like hogtying a person instead of going on a scripted cinematic chase, or intimidating someone over their late payments instead of beating them up; the main missions only give a tiny, at worst just one path to take. On top of this, nearly every story mission (and a good chunk of optional missions) involve you riding or walking with someone else for several minutes at a time while they do exposition. I guess it's nice worldbuilding, but at some point one just wants to get to the good bits.The game has multiple interaction functions and prompts for everything the player can and must do, and many of them aren't consistent with one another. Actual movement feels laborious and somewhat delayed, a consequence of realistic animation and attempts to implement more lifelike movement instead of direct control - again, this ends up feeling less immersive than otherwise.The basic story can last at least 40 hours to complete. Performing tasks around camp, exploring the game world for random encounters or goodies, and doing side activities and optional missions, can easily double or even triple the playtime just within the singleplayer. However, the draw of the game is the story, and I personally don't find the gameplay engaging enough for continuous play. is a fantastically polished experience telling a riveting story about human characters facing ever worse odds. While it requires high patience and tolerance to be able to enjoy the actual gameplay, I've not regretted my time playing it."

If you do not enjoy grinding the same content again and again, it's absolutely nightmarish. Even the purchases that seem fine are not so. A red chestnut is decently priced for an early game player considering its stats, even with the additional hit for getting a stable slot for it. Then you pay its price in insurance and realize you spent 150% more for it than you were expecting, and get to enjoy an unbonded horse that for the next little while will be inferior to the starting horse. One of the memes early into the release of the game is that a can of beans (which will mildly restore your cores) costs more than a gold ring (which you would pawn to a fence). This is an excellent representation of the multiplayer economy: The game is positively miserly in doling out any money and gold bars alike, whilst making sure you're spending $60 on a burlap sack shirt, let alone something you would want to actually wear. People recommend hunting to make money. If making less than $28 every tedious trip after investing in the right weapons to get perfect pelts and then circling around 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ times to look for three star animals is a good way of making money, I would recommend that the best part of this game is getting hit and killed by a parked stagecoach. Bounty Hunting seems to be far superior time-wise, but the task is so repetitive to do again and again, I simply find it unfathomable that the game expects us to endlessly grind like that.Thankfully, if you happen to find a rare golden-pelted bear, Gus will offer you $50 for this one-of-a-kind pelt, a considerable step towards the $950 for the golden-pelted coat! You see, the presence of good clothing is very limited, due to Rockstar discontinuing clothing pieces for whatever reason. Unlike GTA Online where you can have well over 60 pieces in a category that can all be mixed and matched, Red Dead Online offers intense variety such as 10 pairs of pants or 8 skirts, but don't worry, there's 62 kinds of similar-looking hats that will end up knocked off your head every 5 minutes!The game insists on throwing out contrived nonsense at you to continue to drain your income. An hour of gameplay leave your gun unclean and nigh-irreparable, wholly unsuitable for combat as specks of dirt make it inaccurate and less able to cause damage: And heaven forbid your gun (which look visually pristine) be considered ""dirty"", or gunsmiths will find themselves unable to place cloth wraps on them! Worry not: For the price of $10, your whole arsenal can be cleaned - every hour or so!In one of the missions, your posse will perform several setup missions and rob a bank. Story missions, at least proportionately, are excellent ways for new characters to make money. What does 1/2 the cut of an intricate bank robbery including stealing money from a vault and bonds from a managerial desk receive you? A ground-shattering $86, or a mind-boggling 143% of the dirty shirt mentioned earlier! Thankfully, when you're sitting in poverty, the game has several checks to make sure you do not become mildly less impoverished: If you shoot-out with the police as combat is one of the enjoyable portions of the game but too seldom given as everything insists you ride around on an unruly, slow horse for 30 years or spend far-too-much on loading screens to skip the tedium of travel, your honor will be so low, you will be unable to continue the story! I hope you enjoy running around the map performing menial tasks at $7 bucks a task to slightly nudge your honor up for you to continue the reality-shattering storyline that Rockstar has meticulously handcrafted for you."

I do still enjoy the game.*Restricting the player's movements* has been a staple of the series since GTA 4, but Red Dead 2 really takes the cake. There are so many missions where you'll spend at least ten minutes locked into a walk-and-talk that it really started to feel like I was just along for the ride. It's boring, frustrating and more than a little insulting. In the car-based GTAs you can at least drive how you like, but in Red Dead all of those traveling conversations have your movements locked down. You cannot choose where or how to ride.Every time you want to pick up an item, Arthur needs to align his body to the object, move to it, bend over and interact with it, stand back up, place the item in his vest, and mutter a dry one-liner. Every time you loot a corpse, you need to painstakingly bend down, pick the body up, rummage through their pockets and then drop it. Switching weapons is clumsy, accessing horse inventory is cumbersome. Hunting and skinning animals is such a chore that I only did it a few times. The same goes for fishing. There are no carts to load skins, birds or fish on. You've only got a horse that can carry one carcass and a handful of other items. Thus, hunting is restricted to more of a curious side-activity than a method of generating money. Cooking meat you harvest yourself provides powerful healing items, but just like most of the other features, doing so is EXTREMELY slow. You need to hold down the button for a solid ten seconds for each individual piece of meat when cooking. Your inventory is small, so storing lots of food for later is not an option.Missions will arbitrarily switch your favorite weapons out for worse ones totally at random. Cut scenes are often boring, the story really isn't very compelling, and the controls do a great job of making me feel like I'm playing Resident Evil, not Red Dead.Visiting Dutch's camp is a snore-fest. The random interactions with other NPCs are interesting, but Arthur's walk speed is locked down to an inexcusably slow crawl when moving through the area. Returning to the base doesn't feel like coming home. I don't feel welcome in the camp. It feels as though I've stepped into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ swamp. It's slow, and aside from dispensing missions the camp itself provides little value.I still feel like RDR 2 is worth the buy, because it presents a beautiful world to explore. When this game mercifully allows the player a little agency to act how they please, it can be very immersive. A few of the side-quests are indeed pretty interesting. Hunting an albino wildcat with a doomed debtor was pretty neat, and listening to the anxious concerns of our black comrades when we started to get close to the Mississippi river felt realistic and endearing. I just wish that my horse would go where I want, and that Arthur would stop running in the opposite direction when I hold down a move key."

I bought this game with some slight hesitation, since the price was high even on sale, and people were complaining of bugs and crashes galore; however I am so very glad I bought it.I have had one crash since playing this game (29 hours) and I would admit it was probably due to me pushing my system too hard for what it could handle, as the frames simply slowed down until it froze, and then crashed to desktop. Not an issue in my opinion, it's happened once and I have had much worse issues with other games.The amount of detail in this game is incredible. There is so much to do, so many conversations to have with characters. I have been completely drawn into the world of Arthur and his gang, there's some wonderful storytelling.The graphical detail in Red Dead is absolutely breathtaking, so much so that I actually upgraded my graphics card especially so I could run this game on Ultra textures, and boy was it worth it.I haven't felt this immersed in a world since the first Red Dead Redemption. It has been a long wait for us PC gamers and I can quite honestly say that the wait has been more than worth it for me.If there are bugs in this game, I can't say I've come across them yet. I haven't played Online as that's not really my thing, but I will give it a go once I've finished the story.I can't comment on any of the bugs people have experienced, but I have changed my hardware especially for this game and have still yet to encounter any major issues despite playing with two different hardware setups on the same save. Don't let the discussion comments put you off, this is an absolute joy to play and I've poured in 29 hours so far, with only a third of the story complete.Update after 135 hours:This is the greatest single player experience I have ever had the privilege of playing. After 135 hours I have finally completed the main story and most of the side quests, and I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment. I can't express how brilliant this game is and how you should buy it and experience it for yourself. I can't wait to attain 100% completion and give online a go."

On a 970 Evo Plus, with a OC'd 1600 and a 1060 together with 16GB of 3200MHz RAM it's still barely functional. My first time with the game went rather decent, sure I locked it to 30 at about medium settings but hey, it worked. Then I decided alright let's take Digital Foundries optimized settings and try that out which is basically Xbox One X settings and see if performance will get better. Still pretty low but looks beautiful, better than consoles, and should only be slightly lower than my current settings but much better FPS meaning I can see where it goes frame rate wise unlocked. LMAO NOPE CRASH TO DESKTOP AT LAUNCH After trying all kinds of random troubleshooting, together with safe mode, it wouldn't work after like 10 attempts in which finally it did work. Okay phew maybe it's fine now.  GET LASERED HOMIE 10FPS. So I lowered the settings, alright, let's get that right: lowered the settings: and it's running worse. Lower quality = lower fps? But I noticed once I got back from the benchmark that it magically shrank my VRAM?? So now I can't run the game with ultra textures, so I'm like alright let's try high. Don't. Just don't. ""High"" settings literally look like unloaded PS2 textures. So I go in game then to mess around with some settings, lower settings due to the magically shrank VRAM so I can get the bare minimum Ultra textures (seriously anything below is unplayable and the game doesn't let you choose whether or not to adhere to the games VRAM limit) aaaaaaaaaaaaaand lmao the Vulkan renderer dies and the entire game starts corrupting. You might think my GPU is at fault here, right? Nope, I tried other demanding games and maxed them out and nowhere else does anything even faintly similar happen. So instead I try DX12, and lmao nice pop in goes on for like 30 seconds, not just texture pop in mind you: everything. The world, the characters, horses, decals, textures etc. etc. To put it simply if you wanna watch your PC slowly commit suicide with the help of a terrible PC port then oh boy is this the game for you. There's countless of issues, an infinite amount of issues that others are having and that you'll find immediately with a google search. All issues without any logical reason nor solution. It just is the way it is. It's a shame too because a great number of PC specific features are here making you think that oh the optimization is probably on par and . But nope, it just literally doesn't work. Even for PCs that can get it to work, it's obviously running worse than it should. A 2080ti is miles above the Xbox One X, at minimum quadruple the performance. Yet it only gets double the FPS. Yes, it looks beautiful, like absolutely stunning. But if it can look and perform so great on a console that's the equivalent of a mid range PC (even with console specific optimization), why can't a PC that's the price of a nice car run it not just a little better, but much better? And to top all this off: yeah, Rockstar support is just as bad as they've always been. Tbh even if the game was running perfectly for you, have fun getting wrongfully banned by Rockstar because of some troll/griefer/hacker at absolutely no fault on your own with Rockstar completely dismissing and ignoring you, sounds like GTA V all over again really.

These are issues with shouldn’t happen with a major release like this, so there really isn’t an excuse for it, especially as Grand Theft Auto V’s PC release was fine. After updating to the recommend drivers and tweaking with things, at this stage my game is running very well with no issues.Despite the problems on the technical side, I have really, really enjoyed coming back to Red Dead Redemption 2, doing so in the most definitive way possible. Let me tell you that in a title like this, going from a locked 30 FPS on console to even 60 FPS is an incredible difference. As you would expect, the game is beautiful, and I’d say at times it is mesmerizing. It looks so good I think you’d actually have to put in the effort to make the game look bad. The amount of graphical options is a plus - though the effort some of them have is negligible - which is Rockstar future-proofing.There are instances where I just want to come to a halt and stare into the wilderness, such is the sheer beauty of the world. Whilst first person on console was tedious, on PC it's a completely different story. Both first and third-person perspectives have their advantages and disadvantages, and both seem like two completely different experiences, but first-person feels the best way to experience single-player.The controls are adequate. Mainly it’s movement I have problems with. Characters feel heavy and have lots of momentum, though I am sure that’s the purpose. Also, when riding, because your horse moves relative to your mouse position, pressing A or D can cause your horse to change direction suddenly at 90 degrees if your cursor isn’t centered, though this is fixed with the “Horse Relative” setting under controls. All of this is perhaps more “controlled” with a controller, but for me, I prefer the freedom of keyboard and shooting with a mouse.The open-world is sprawling and immersive, with a myriad of activities and hobbies to undertake outside of the story missions. You can really lose yourself with how much there is to do and see.Now for the story. What can I say? Straight out of a Hollywood film, it’s as western as you can get. It’s dark, gripping, intricate, engrossing, and magnificent. No spoilers here, but it’s genuinely one of the most interesting and fulfilling narratives I’ve seen out of a video game, or any sort of fiction in general. No stone has been left unturned. Quickly, about the soundtrack/score - you should just experience it for yourself. A perfect companion to the narrative and world you live in.As for Red Dead Online? It's fine. It's very much Grand Theft Auto Online set in a different era and not as ridiculous... just yet anyway. It's certainly not the reason I bought the game, but it is a bonus.So, I guess what it comes down to is if I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 or not. Well, I’d say there is a little bias here as I am absolutely a fan of anything Rockstar Games produces, but provided you can run it OK and this title is on your radar, I would tentatively recommend it at this stage. The asking price is already steep, and the technical issues are glaring, but there is so much to do here and so much to be impressed about.This is Rockstar’s opus magnum, though they will look to better it with their next title, as they always do."

Fine. put those players on a different tier than the average joe.-Pay to win/micro transactions. Hunting, fishing, and side missions will earn you gold and money, but you will be grinding for hours just to buy a pair of pants, let alone a better gun. Of course there is a handy dandy market where you can spend more of your real hard-earned money on virtual gold. Of course there is.-Where did my camp go? This is a known bug, where either your camp moves, or disappears completely. Moving isn't really a big deal, but when your camp is gone you have to pay AGAIN to have it set up. And for as stingy as they are with currency, this bug really hurts the game.-Transported to seemingly random places, and left there after events. I did a horse race in Blackwater, which is close to my camp, but when the race was over I was left in Tumbleweed, one third of the map away from my base. This has happened to me a dozen times in 20 hours of gameplay. You either spend hard-earned game dollars to transport back to your camp, or take a long and time consuming walk. HOW ABOUT PUT ME BACK WHERE I STARTED?!?I'm frustrated, really. I want to like this game. It's very pretty, even with medium graphic settings. There's lots to see and do for you and your posse.

Its like i want to wine back the time just to be able to experience the story once more.Ive learned to love some of the characters that ive hated, and ive come to hate some that i loved. The choices ive had to make are choices that made me think about the consequences. Every good story should make choices feel like are doing something. Something to the world, the people around you. To There is not alot of games that leave me with the feeling that i really care about the characters. About Arthur, the gang and my sweet white arabian horse Troja III. She rode with me for the majority of the game all the way until the end. Completing the game makes me feel like ive lost friends and pets, and thats how a well written story should make you feel. Red dead redemtion 2 tops the spot on all counts of how to make a good story. I wanted to take my time and enjoy the world and not rush the story, doing some side missions here and there. Meeting people that actually felt alive and living in the world i currently was a visitor in. But i always wondered what would happen next in the story. I always found myself back in camp donating food or just fooling around with the other members of the gang just to be able to say Well more nights than others, that bedtime never really came. The story of RDR2 has had me hooked like no other. And i just want more. I dont want it to be completed. I want the fresh experience of not knowing what will come next, what will happen if i did this, or what will happen on the way to my next destination. The world of RDR2 is soo full of life that goes on even without you, to stumble upon old acquaintances and hearing whats been going on since we last met, you somehow forget how this is a game. There is so much to say about this game, that it is leaving me speechless. It is like psychedelics, its one of those things that you just have to experience for yourself to fully understand.

Rockstar seems to habitually disconnect; and if it doesn't the game crashes in a consistently anyway. I've tried many a fix suggested by the RDR2 community, but I still get errors that cause me to disconnect from Rockstar servers, or the game will just crash.(These connection issues are not nearly as prevalent on the PS4, and I have yet to have the game crash on that platform either.)If Rockstar can fix whatever these issues are: This game is a must buy."

If you can launch the game but have some rough performance than I highly suggest following a guide that you can find online that goes over what all the advanced settings are and how they effect performance. following one of these allowed me to play the game with ultra textures and effects just by changing water quality graphics for negligible looks for much more performance.For me this was a great buy and I would do it again anytime.

I'm 73 hours in and the game is expertly crafted... mostly. There are a few ""what the hell was the developer thinking?!"" aspects to the game. For example the button to talk to someone is the same button to point your weapon at them if you have your weapon equipped. So I've ruined a few encounters that I can't go back to because I accidentally threatened people. Also many aspects to the game are not intuitive. So for a lot of things you don't really get the joy of figuring things out because you have to find so many walkthroughs online in order to get by. You just get used to looking things up, which generally just makes you tempted to read walkthroughs with spoilers. I think my biggest beef with the game is that it doesn't feel like you're accomplishing anything. It just feels like you're grinding out achievements.

You can do this by running boring AF repetitive missions for 15 hours (this is on average how long it would take to get 15 gold), or you can spend money to buy said in game gold.

If you can get it working this is a game worth playing.It looks stunning.But this is 2019 and we are about to step into 2020 so this level of quality is almost a given these days.I can't comment much on the story,I have barely begun but what i can say is that the characters so far are excellent.They have realistic motivations.They are somewhat relatable. And honestly I cannot say that about most games that have released on PC this year.As far as gameplay goes ,This is not a Grand Theft Auto or something fast paced like Fortnite.So If you are the kind of player who wants fast paced action in their games,Steer well clear of this.There are long segments where you will just be riding your horse.Now obviously that is not an issue for me but i can see how some might find that boring.Don't get me wrong, there is definitely Action here,It is not as over the top as in GTA.This game overall is a masterpiece and proves that not every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game needs to be an RPG in order for it to be a good game.Kudos to Rockstar for having that sense when companies like Ubisoft simply do not.As far as the performance is concerned it is a right mess,There is no two ways about it.It crashes randomly(It has crashed 4-5 times in the 11 hours i played) It is littered with bugs, Using Vulcan may give you a few more frames but it breaks the game as it induces Audio issues Stuttering etc.If you want to play use DX12,That is my advice.Since Steam doesn't have any other rating than a recommend or not it is very hard to rate this game.That being said I would recommend this broken mess because when it works it is fantastic. And sure it takes a bit of effort to get the damn thing running smoothly but it is still worth it.If i had to give it a score I will split it into 4 partsStory and Characters(Thus far): 10/10Gameplay: 10/10Music: 9/10 (It's great but I've heard better)Performance: 2/10"

So many missions just consist of you walking, very slowly, for several minutes. The exciting missions all play out the same (escape an area while you shoot down dozens of people). Plus everything feels extremely clunky for the sake of realism. You eventually stop doing stuff like hunting and looting because nearly everything has to feel like a mini-cutscene. I want to like this game because there are elements I love in there but too often I find myself bored with the bad gameplay decisions Rockstar made.For what it's worth, I think the story is great, the graphics are obviously phenomenal, and if you just want a slow paced immersive game with decent writing then RDR2 is good. But for me when a game is this massive it shouldn't have gameplay this slow, clunky and uninspired."

Of the almost unlimited things to do in this perfectly crafted map, nearly none of it matters, and offers no progression other than cosmetic. It always feels like its just about to get better right around the corner, then never does.The characters, and the premise of the story are excellent, however the pacing is dead slow and contradictory at times. All of the missions are on rails and the player has no real control over any event in the game. This disconnects the player from all immersion and emotional investment in the game, when there should be so much drawing you in. It's all in there, but fails to deliver. IMO this game is terribly over-rated. All of the components are there to be a near perfect masterpiece. A mile wide, but an inch deep."

Also somehow telling me that I played the game for nearly 4 hours when I played it for less than two, so at some point it must have been running in the background without my knowledge or consent.EDIT: After playing the game for quite a while, it is a great game, but unfortunately I will still be recommending against it due to Rockstar's greed and incompetence. The game is plagued by constant bugs and glitches that take the experience to a 10/10 to an 8/10 at best and I'm not sure if those are exclusive to the PC version or not, but what I can tell that is exclusive to this version of the game, is the fact that it's a God awful port that runs terribly, crashes frequently and requires the Rockstar launcher that always seems to break and prevent you from playing the game. All of this for a port of an year old game that they are still charging full price for. Absolutely unacceptable."
1653,socco,https://steamcommunity.com/id/starrysock/,4,,1,138.1,May,"16,",216,0,1,"TL;DR The story is great but linear, the actual gameplay is kinda lacking.I haven't bothered with RDR Online, this is only a review for the singleplayerThe actual game itself is great. It's a huge open world with a lot of care and detail put into each character. Unfortunately it is pretty linear, you don't have a lot of choice, and you basically can't really do anything if you go to an area earlier than you're supposed to, but despite that the story itself is pretty great. A lot of the quests feel very cinematic.Unfortunately this game suffers from your standard console port symptoms though. It's not very well optimised (albeit not the worst I've ever seen), and the controls are pretty awful and nonstandard. You do get used to them eventually, but it can be really clunky at times. The UI is pretty bad too, everything is buried under it's own little tab. It doesn't sound that bad, but when the game is constantly unequipping your weapons and you have to tab through a list of 15 guns while you're being shot at, it gets pretty annoying. Movement in general is also pretty slow clunky at times, it can be hard to do anything precise, and it's annoying to die just because your character got caught on a little piece of geometry or won't stop spinning around when you're trying to go through a door. There's also Rockstar's launcher too as an added bonusThere's also the survival mechanics. You have your usual health/stamina/etc meters and ones for your horse as well, but also more unique ones like wearing warm clothing or brushing your house. Ik some people like survival mechanics, but all of them are really easy to deal with here, food is very plentiful, you literally carry a brush for your horse with you at all times, etc. So dealing with them is never something you actually have to worry about, it just means you have to pause what you're doing every so often to click on a button in your inventory. It only takes a few seconds, but waiting for Arthur to slurp down a can of beans for the 100th time so you can get back to playing isn't really my favourite. To me it just felt like more of a hassle than anything elseThe game also tries to stuff you into a lot of hunting/fishing/etc type activities. Thankfully most of them are optional, but you do miss out on a lot of crafting if you choose not to go around grinding for pelts, since there's no real alternative to it. Some people might not mind, but it's something to be aware ofAll and all it's a great game, even despite a lot of it's flaws I'm still enjoying the vast majority of my time with it, and I definitely recommend it. I've seen a lot of people say this is the best game ever and an absolute 10/10 masterpiece, and while you could definitely make a case for the story alone, the rest of the game still has plenty of issues for me.If all you care about is the story, definitely get it. If you're looking for a great gameplay experience with great shooting, maybe wait for a good sale"

I just feel like writing a review atm. (You probably already stopped reading)The game is about being a cowboy. You are in a gang of other cowboys and complete robberies and missions to help each other out and gain money for the amazing future.The game has one of the best storylines I have ever seen in a game. This is the best storyline from all the games I own. The game has a lot of cutscenes. All of them can be skipped. I wouldn't recommend it but it is possible. You can skip the cutscenes and still understand the point of the game. This is mostly happening while you're on your way with a teammate, riding to the location of the mission. You will start talking with the teammate so you still understand the goal of the mission you're about to do.The game asks a lot of your pc. My friend had issues at first setting it up. He had a black screen with sound. I told him to google it (he isn't very good at that, might be the reason why it took him 2 days LOL). He eventually found it and fixed the problem. He was able to play the game like everyone else. The game can require a lot from your pc and this makes it one of the most beautiful games I have ever seen. The sunrise and down are beautiful. The scenery, the animals, the grass, it is all there.Let's get back to the missions. The missions in the game are easy and guided. The NPC's that are on your side will most likely tell you what to do. There are A LOT of missions. In the Chapters 1 to 6 you get a lot of ""Side Missions"" as well. These are marked white. I recommend doing the most important ones and the ones that are somehow linked to you and your gang. This is due to the fact that you might not be able to do these missions in the epilogues. (these come after the Chapters 1 to 6. (There are 2 epilogues))The game includes hunting, stealth, love, animals (and taking care of them), and robberies.Let's talk about the robberies now.You and your gang will earn the most money by the robberies they commit. I really enjoyed the robberies. Sadly, when you've finished the game, you won't really be able to do those robberies as you're used to. For example, you can't really do robberies in Online. At least, I couldn't find a way to when I tried this. The robberies (like every other mission) are filled with choices. You can choose to blow something up, or you can choose to just try and crack the code. The game is filled with these choices. You can help someone, or not.The game also contains a lot of violence. There is more blood then we're used to. You can shoot a leg, arm, head off. I wrote to much that I don't know what I wrote at this point.I will just say what I think about the game and give one last opinion. For me, the game felt like a movie. I turned on subtitles to make it easier to remember and understand what the characters were saying. When looking back at the game. I remember everything so well. I really enjoyed it. The storyline (as said before) is the best one I've ever seen! The scenery and overall looks of the game are amazing! I can name a lot more things. The game is worth the money. The gameplay feels so big and huge that you just know that it was worth it. I recommend this game to everybody. This is something you don't want to miss.(oh yeah, the online feature, it's really bad, I don't know what, but it just misses a lot. When you first complete the story mode, you're used to a lot more violence and robberies for example. Then when going online, it isn't possible there. You then sort off bored.) I am just going to end this 1023012371283129321912309 characters long review here. hahaCya, pls comment on what you think of my review. I'd like to hear what I missed and if you're curious about how and what...~Merlin"

No more need be said.Red Dead Online, just like GTA Online, is a cancerous growth on the ass of the gaming industry, a beacon of all that is wrong with modern gaming. A sandbox designed solely to get the player to spend more money, a ""free"" multiplayer with all the fun of a malware popup. >_>Fortunately they're separated, unfortunately the garbage multiplayer gets all the preference for post release content, so no story DLC, new weapons or outfits or horses or gameplay added to the part of the game that is worth playing...Still, the base game is great despite Take Two being Take Two.*addendum and mild spoilers: after having played it for 200h now, and gotten to Chapter 6... I hate to say that while it started off super strong, the game is really starting to lose me now.RDR2 unfortunately seems to suffer from a mild case of Game of Thrones/Walking Dead syndrome... meaning it is so bleak at times as to be genuinely unpleasant. Though it is no where near as crippling to its own narrative as those two. It's moreso that RDR1 is already a super tragic and bleak game, so with this being a prequel and me knowing where it is all going it just began to sap my will to keep playing over time. I dreaded it being a prequel going in but the game won me over, only to completely lose me and prove my fears right. I've never played a game that I loved so much, that I freely admit is worthy of all the acclaim, that I ended up being utterly apathetic about. Bleakness in a story needs to be paired with the right amount of hope, otherwise it can become just a miserable experience. RDR2 for me dipped into that by chapter 5.But I do still wholeheartedly recommend it! Especially if you're not as worn out by miserable stories as I am. And when I was enjoying it, it was great fun. I honestly do think the game would have been served better had it had a happier ending. It didn't need to be The Sound of Music, but when RDR1 ends how it does, having RDR2 go the way it does made me kind of just want to go play something else..."

If you wanna buy for Multiplayer - STAY AWAY (Massive hacking problems)I want to give it a thumbs up because the story truly is incredible as everyone else says. I have played it on PS4 and again here on PC. However I can not give it a thumbs up if you ever plan to play multiplayer. This game is plagued by hackers the same way that GTAV is. players will teleport to you, kill you, kill your horse, take all your items, drain all your money by spamming your camp fees, they will force you to fail missions.I changed servers 8 times and every time I was instantly targeted by hackers who would spam kill my horse and myself.For me personally, multiplayer is 100% unplayable. the second I finished the intro story of multiplayer is when I began getting hit by hackers.It is beyond me how after the massive success and revenue that GTA had, how rockstar could be so incompetent when it comes to their online games and community. the hacking in RDR2 is the same if not worse than GTAV and the hacking in GTA is the exact same reason why I never persisted with the multiplayer.its very annoying to deal with such rampant and unchecked hacking. it is not even worth the effort to try and play normally online.

So I don't recommend Player VS Player game modes, But a huge up is how beutiful the game is and how you have to actually think about what you do with cleaning weapons and less money if you kill someone with a bounty on them you get less money that a live bounty. I can really get lost in the game truly a master piece if I had to rate the game it would be a 8/10 mostly because of the controller and people hunting you for no reason until you find a new server.

1679,McGoldenblade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/McGoldenblade/,4,,1,241.0,August,"12,",57,0,1,"One of my favorite games of all time, easily in my top 3. I absolutely adore this game and all the effort Rockstar put into it. Now, despite me saying that, it's not perfect, and whether or not I recommend you buy this game comes down to many factors, so I'll just list the pros and cons and elaborate from there.PROS:-Huge immersive open world-Some of the most beautiful graphics I have ever seen (if you have a good enough PC, I'll get into that later)-Amazing soundtrack-Easily the best writing I have seen in any video game, and probably one of the best written stories in all of fiction period. The story is actually straight up that good.-Incredibly well-written cast of lovable (and hateable) characters-Loads of realistic and immersive details that make the world feel so incredibly real-Low-key has the best hunting and fishing in any game I've played-The Deadeye mechanic is ridiculously fun if used correctly-Great Horse MechanicsCONS:-Poor optimization, basically requires a NASA supercomputer to run without any fiddling with the settings. If you have an RTX graphics card I HIGHLY recommend you use DLSS, or else the game will run like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.-Very slow gameplay, specifically animations. Personally doesn't bother me, but it can and will bother a lot of people who prefer games with faster gameplay.-Controller support is finicky. If you play with a PS4 controller the interface will show Xbox controls for some reason. Not a huge deal breaker, but it can be annoying.-Lots of unskippable cutscenes and dialogue. Again, doesn't bother me, but will definitely bother a lot of people.-VERY linear story missions.Also, this isn't exactly a pro or a con, but it's very important to understand that this game is LONG. Just look at my play time at the time of writing this, that's how long it will take you to beat this game if you choose to do most of the things worth doing. I really only recommend this game if you plan on spending most of your free time playing this game for at least a month or two. It's a HUGE time investment, and is very much worth it if you're able to push through it. If you don't like spending a lot of time completing games, this game sadly isn't for you.Now, who would I recommend this to? If you love good stories in video games, are patient, and enjoy open world games, you'll fall in love with this game as I have. There is so much this game has to offer and is one of the best gaming experiences one can have. However, if you're impatient, don't like long games, or don't care about story, you might have a hard time enjoying this one. Also, you need to have the right specs and the right know-how to get this game working. I mentioned earlier how the game is absolutely beautiful on it's highest settings, but ONLY on it's highest settings. If you have the texture quality set to anything but Ultra, the game will look like ass. But if you don't have a monster of a PC, the game will run like ass if you run it on Ultra. It's a catch 22. I mostly blame the port for having awful optimization, as on other platforms you don't have to worry about graphics or framerate at all. So I recommend buying on other platforms if you don't mind being forced to play with a controller. However, I think keyboard and mouse is they best control scheme for this game (and this is coming from someone who played both on PC and on PS4). With all that being said, I still recommend buying this game regardless. It's incredible, and definitely worth playing."

I never rush to finish the game and unlike other games I try to do everything I see. Even a seemingly simple thing will surprise you so don't ignore anything. Because the world of this game is alive and does everything to make you feel in the wild west. I'm afraid the game is over and I don't play much to avoid consuming it fast. I don't understand how time goes by every time I open the game. If you haven't played this game yet, you will regret playing it late like me.

The gameplay and graphics are both amazing, optimalization is great too. Character writing is oscar-worthy, world is huge and there is no ""lost"" corner, there are AIs/NPCs everywhere giving you unique conversations or even tasks. Everything you do has consequences, you cant just go around and shoot people, and even if you win a fight against cops and run far away, you will still need to pay bounty in the city or fight cops again. It is just amazing, how they make players regret every bad thing they do. Also, doing crimes or saying something bad to strangers is lowering your honor which leads to people hating you randomly on street or cops wanting to follow you. Game is slow-paced, but you will never get bored and there is always something to do even when you dont fight, shoot, rob, live outlaw life.10/10, would recommend to everyone."

Rockstar has once again showed us that the entire video game industry is doing everything wrong. This game has the most immersive world and characters graced by media, there are more animations for a horse in this game than the average main protagonist in any other game. The story was written by literal god fable tellers that have descended from the divines to pleasure my brain for an over 100+ hour story mode that has themes everyone could take a note of. The gameplay has me dodging in real life with the weight of the guns in this game, when I shoot my Schofield revolver I get kicked back in my gamer chair from the vibration that comes out of my controller, I see bullets breaking holes in the wooden barrel I take cover behind, smoke and gunpowder flying around the gunfight like its the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ civil war again.

The graphics and scenery in this game made me feel like our world was black and white in comparison, the beautiful landscapes of America before it was covered in smog and grime, unexplored paths and forests that cover entire mountains.

When you play it you know and notice perfectly the 8 years of development, because this work simply has no rival at all levels it covers. A game set in the western, in the year 1899 in the interior of America, is the time of the decline of the old west, and I love this.  Technical design, graphics, physics, masterful soundtrack, setting, narrative, characters from the entire campaign with their own character and a wonderful independent charisma, very top artificial intelligence, a crazy fauna, a world totally alive and with limitless exploration, it does not lack mystery, gameplay and outstanding entertainment. The Spanish dubbing would have been cool but when you play it you understand perfectly why it is better if it is not translated into any language, the level of care and pampering that this game has is excessively demanding, and dubbing the title in a certain way does not go with the narration of the title. Everything that is said about Red Dead Redemption 2 is little, you don't really play it, you live it when you play it, you get excited and you always want to be Arthur, you don't want to abandon him, you empathize so much with him that it makes you angry to leave him.  A true simulator of being a cowboy in a totally alive world and realism in its purest form. It is not a matter of personal taste to say that it is the best game in history to date, it is objectivity, preference is one thing and being objective is another, and objectively there is no title that unfortunately casts a shadow on it."

Even if you have an older machine, you can lower your graphics settings and the game will still look beautiful (as long as you keep textures at ultra).

It was hard being patient enough to not only wait and play this on PC and not just PS4 but to also wait until I upgraded my rig to do it justice. Gotta say it was so worth it!

Great story, great acting, amazing graphics and atmosphere.All the rest of my time has been spent online.  I also HATE playing games online.  I have always been a single player guy(for the most part).  It is a bit of a grind but I have been able to enjoy myself and pretty much relax and play cowboy.  The paid for currency (gold) is not very hard to acquire as you gain more roles.  Gaining more roles and leveling them gives you more opportunities on the daily challenges(which you can and probably will become a slave to).  As you continue doing daily challenges and keep your streak going, you will get a multiplier.  I think at day one I would get .2 per challenge but now I am at .5 so I can normally get a few gold bars a day without doing anything too difficult or time consuming.  You can use the gold to make in game purchases that you don't have enough cash for(it is gold or cash though, not a bit of both), but it is better to save it until you get all the roles first.  They are all worth getting as well since they grant you new skills to use.As far as multiplayer issues, I only ran into a couple griefers, 2 hackers, and had very low connectivity issues, but I also was only getting sessions with maybe 4-5 players at a time.  Now every session I get into has what I can only assume to be full lobbies and more griefers and hackers.  This would be because of the Halloween patch.  I also rarely had any connectivity issues, but have been losing connection and having trouble gaining one lately.  Usually a couple attempts at connecting though, so not a huge deal.This is one of the few games I have purchased in the last couple years that I did not immediately refund so it was highly worth it to me so I would certainly recommend it to everyone else."

Starting with the Story Mode part of the game which is my favorite part  , The graphics are just stunning! The overall detail of the game is beautiful I find myself alot just staring at the scenery rather then actually playing the game lol , But when I do buckle down and focus on the Story it tells one of the best Story's I've ever played in any game across any platform and that's saying alot , Its just a Very well told story with very connectable characters.As far as the Online part of the game I do really enjoy it as well and you still get those same amazing graphics/detail , With easy/responsive controls and lots of tasks/missions/and game modes to keep you wanting more , I really enjoy hunting/fishing but also find myself playing around with the lasso alot with the locals , Quite Fun lol.So Yes I Highly recommend this game to anyone."
1836,SpecialD3,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198867788293/,4,,1,677.0,September,"16,",213,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that I truly consider as one of the best games I have ever played. However, it sure has a lot of things that make the game boring and repetitive.Firstable, I will talk about the graphics, world design and character models. Rockstar once again achieved a quality in these aspects that are stunning. I just enjoy slowly riding the horse through fields or just leading it in swamps without using the map. Even the animals and the movements of the NPCS seem realistic. That way, I truly felt immersed and delighted by this (Graphics quality and others- 10/10).In terms of gameplay, Rockstar actually disappointed me. The controls are clunky, the combat system with guns is repetitive. Nonetheless, I actually really enjoyed the melee options when using fists or other melee weapons against enemies (besides the clunky controls in it, obviously). Gameplay- 8,5/10.Now I will talk about the missions. This is worst aspect in the game. Rockstar used this missions syetem in many games: Start in point A, go to B, follow NPC, hear NPC talking, kill NPCS and finally, the most boring aspect, DO ALL THIS BY FOLLOWING ONLY THE GAME'S INSTRUCTIONS. The missions really pissed me off, since Rockstar doesn't let you choose your own path in a normal mission. They all have these rules, repeating each rule in almost every single mission (Missions system- 5/10).Regarding the main story, this is what really shines the most in the game as well as the graphics. I will not spoil anyhing, but when you reach the end of chapter 4, you will be amazed by the whole rest. If you look carefully in the map, you will find a lot of side missions, (some remarkable, others just boring due to the lame tasks the NPCS tell you to do) as well as secrets, letters, strange places and NPCS, easter eggs and loads of entertaining random encounters ( story- 10/10).The sound effects in the game are a great aspect. The voice acting is incredible. The actors had great accents and really did well trying to show the emotions and feelings the game characters were feeling in certain part. The fact that every sounds like a real animal, the footsteps while walking,  the different sounds in the many environments, the horse when riding and patting are just some of the amazing sounds you will find. Besides, it is really well done the many ways you can interact with NPCS by defusing, greeting, antagonizing or even helping them (Sound quality- 10/10).The final point is the online mode. The online mode takes everything I find interesting nd innovative in the story mode. It takes you the option to talk, the story is just unnecessary and the realism is all gone. The only cool and new things in the online mode is the amount of clothing, weapons, and the roles you can get. Oh, I didn't forget the economy. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ economy! You know, the fact that everything useful in online cost a lot and you must earn damn GOLD BARS to get roles or other good stuff are just Rockstar's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ interest in money. Online mode is just a reskinn of GTA5 but in the wild west. Besides, you can't even rob a store, bank or a random NPC which you could do in story mode. However, I played online for a little more than 30 hours and after I learned everything to earn money and be rich, it just turns quite easy to earn gold bars and have loads of good stuff. In my case, I did not pay for the ultimate or special editions and I already am a bounty hunter and a collector. Final Verdict:Story Mode- 9,5/10Online Mode- 5.5/10I hope you liked this review.

Betrayal of gang members is painful and angry, and even wants to kill Micah him own.The first time I wrote such a long review, I gave the game 10/10,which satisfied my dream as a cowboy, let me enjoy all kinds of beautiful scenery ,intriguing narrative t, each plot has a unique animation and tasks makes game so fascinating.One last wordRaging happiness often foreshadows violent endings, that happy moment, like fire and gunpowder, a kiss is fleeting.

It's a very immersive world with tons of content, marked and unmarked alike, a massive bestiary, plenty of weapon and clothing customization, as well as a nice but not overboard sense of reality to it. Combat, while relatively slow, is very enjoyable. You can almost feel the impact of every shot you land, or thrown fist you connect. With things like detailed bullet woulds, bruises, scratches, stab wounds, and even full on dismemberment, combat can range from very clean altercations to gritty bloodbaths. As mentioned before, the bestiary is huge. With almost 200 animals in the game, there's always gonna be some new creature to discover in the course of your 60-80 hour playthrough. Hunting is also pretty satisfying, with a perfect kill and pelt system, as well as advanced tracking of your prey.Cons: Completionists are gonna have a hell of a time. There are 90 challenges total which must be completed in order to get 100%. Some of them are insanely grindy, and others rely on pure luck, which kind of defeats the purpose of a challenge. On top of that, you can't legitimately complete every challenge until reaching the post-game epilogue.Speaking of the epilogue, although it isn't horrible, it has its flaws. For starters, it way overstays it's welcome. All the content could be compressed into one two hour chapter, but instead the epilogue is split into two very drawn out (and at some points, pointless) parts, giving you a few solid missions, and about 5 or so hours of boring filler missions. This ultimately takes away from the emotional ending of the main portion of the game, and honestly feels like a different game after a while. That's everything though. RDR2 is a great, massive game that you should at least give a try, but just like every game, it isn't without its flaws."

It wasn't the cheapest, but it was money well spent.I don't think there was a single thing about this game I didn't enjoy. From the amazing graphics, animations and weather system to the depths of Arthur's story. I will agree that it is very slow paced - you feel almost compelled not to just focus on the story, but explore, go around hunting and just roaming the countryside (that's what I did most of the time lmao). All parts of the explorable map are meticulously designed to make you drawn into this exploration. And even though some areas are relatively similar, they never feel repetitive or boring. Plus, there are many chance encounters - some are funny, some sad - which makes them kinda realistic.Second thing - there is so much to do in this game. The numer of challenges to complete and collectable items to acquire provides a source of gameplay for so many hours it is amazing.Last but not least - the story. I'm not really good at reviews but let me just say this - when 'That's the way it is' started playing I was crying like a little child, and I'm not easily moved by this kind of thing. Last time I was that emotionally engaged in a videogame was I think when I played the witcher 3 for the 1st time. So it does say something. Especially if you take the time to understand the characters, their past, their motives, and actions. At the end of the game, the game really encourages you to think some stuff through, and I loved that. Arthur, John and the vast majority of characters encountered in RDR2 are not just characters, they feel genuine and relatable, like real folk you can run across. They are outlaws, killers and thieves but most of all, they are Sorry fot this chaotic review, tl;dr playing rdr2 was the best choice I made in a while!"

If not, you may need to grind at some parts.Great game, get it for the story mode as getting it for online might frustrate you with the abysmal support Rockstar gives to this compared to GTA Online (not that one deserves more support than the other). Special and Ultimate edition doesn't give you anything new besides making the initial grind in Red Dead Online a little easier and a few story mode side missions that's not very worth the extra $20. I'd suggest waiting for a sale as this game goes on sale often, but still a great game even without a sale.EDIT: Yes, there are plenty of horses to ride, incase you were wondering."

It is very much well deserved. I'm going to talk about this in two partsGameplayAlthough this game is not meant to be played on a keyboard, I believe the transition is smooth, and the controls are very enjoyable once you get used to it. There is very few bugs, with me only experiencing only one or two small graphical glitches through the main story. Gunplay is by far one of the highlights. In this game, you will never be bored. Strange, fun and rewarding missions, characters, and mini-games populate this world. The world is something straight from a western novel with romantic visions of the west combined with the looming sense of society approaching this beautiful yet forsaken land. The forests, swamps, mountains, and beaches feel alive. I truly cant put into words just how immersive this world is. Story** POTENTIAL SPOILERS**I came into this game expecting a bullet hell western, but my expectations were flipped. Although you are still a bad-ass cowboy outlaw, this world is full of battles from within the characters. Arthur Morgan is one of my favorite main characters of all time, and every member of the gang has a unique perspective and attitude. Your actions as Morgan have an impact on the world. The progression of the story is mesmerizing, and this is a true tale of humanity. ConclusionI truly believe that Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best Triple A games ever made. The amount of detail and care put into the world is truly astounding. This game is a beautiful and fun journey. Everyone should at least try it out."

1908,Thoma$,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AncientCS1337/,4,,0,108.1,January,"2,",230,0,1,"I really wanted to love this game but ended up almost hating it. I was extremely hyped for this and played the first game a few months earlier on my sisters PS3 for the first time, a little late to the party but i still had hopes for a PC version. ;)RDR2 is an extremely immersive and realistic game with wonderful graphics and voice acting. But as a game it just falls flat most of the time, 95% of the missions end up in shootouts (even in stealth missions, whether you want it or not.) While the storytelling and the cutscenes are amazing, the story itself is just stupid (the plan is to make as much money as possible, yet every plan/heist just ends up in a disaster.) At some point i just wanted the more reasonable men like Arthur/John/Charles to take care of Dutch and take over the gang. He's a charismatic dude and i know this is a prequel but at some point you just have to stop following his stupid plans imo.The whole game is about money but at the same time money barely matters in the game world. I bought an elite horse once and thats about it. Can i improve my lame guns or buy hunting maps or something? Nope.I ended up investing 3000 bucks into the camp and had 1500 for myself at the end of the game. Side activites are generic and irrelevant because you don't really need the money. Fishing and hunting are incredibly tedious and frustrating, i don't understand how you can defend this. Sure, it's supposed to be realistic but this is just too much. I got all the perfect pelts, except for the panther which never spawned for me. I didn't even bother with all the legendary fish because it's too slow and annoying. (I wasted roughly 15 hours on hunting, fishing, and other stuff essentially.)The AI is one of the worst i've ever seen. If you commit a crime in a building, people magically can see through walls and know that you commited a crime and the lawmen are after you just because that's how the AI is programmed. You put on bandanas to hide your identity but the game takes it off during heists/story missions just to put a bounty on your head (i mean, just keep the bandana on?) Also, if i kill all witnesses there are no more witnesses so no one knows of the crime, right? At least, thats how it would work in my world...Rockstar wanted to make a super realistic game and added artificial slowness to the game which just ruins the gameplay for me most of the time. Call me old fashioned but i want to have a great time with a game and feel like an outlaw badass. I can't even count the times i wanted to loot dead bodies and my AI partners stormed the front and died. Why bother having RPG elements like looting if the game isn't built around it? Sure, i admit it's an OCD but i just love looting so please let me do it. (Especially when the game is about making money.)If i look back at my 100 hours of gameplay, i remember being toxic most of the time and cursing Rockstar frequently. I barely ever enjoyed anything in this game tbh. The missions lack variety and there are way too many enemies and scripted events happening. The ""epic"" story just doesn't make up for it. I also had like 15 crashes to desktop and annoying fps drops mostly in cities (with an RTX 2070). And while the epilogue is a cool idea and way better than the one in the first game, it's painfully long and dragged out with 5 hours.If you're looking for an immersive and realistic (Western) game and you are a patient person, go for it. Otherwise, wait for a sale and then give it a try. Those are my honest thoughts, and if i reduce the game to its core that's just what i felt. Maybe i expected more, i just don't know why it never clicked... If i had to rate the game, i'd probably give it a 7.5/10 or something but steam only has the two thumbs. Which just proves that ratings and numbers are overrated anyway."

The protagonist is an anti hero, you play him and decide whether you wanna be a good person, or a bad person.Being an open world game, you are given a vast world for you to explore. The world is big enough, for you to take a while travelling from one side to another side. The towns in this game are like rural areas, while there is one town that is already more civilized. Aside from that, it is all wilderness, plains and mountains and forest. Despite having to travel for awhile from a place to another place, you will occasionally met some NPCs with their horses or wagons along the way giving some life into the game. Also there are some random encounters and animals to hunt.However, the game will take a hard pull on your graphic card. Those with low end computers might have to lower their graphic options. Mind you however, the graphic of this game is so damn beautiful. There are lots of moments that I just stop awhile to cherish the moment since the world is beautifully created paired with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful graphic. There will be fogs and some kinda a bit of dust, these will make your fps drops if you do not have an adequate hardware.Story wise, the game has a good story. If you enjoy previous titles by R*, this game would be a fun ride for you. Yes, there are emotional roller coaster here. Yes, there are choices that you have to make during gameplay, whether you wanna be evil or kind. You can dress up your character into more handsome man. Level up the abilities for better gameplay. However, I personally a bit pissed by the story as Crash? Yes it happened.The first time I bought this game during its first week release, I got it. but I refunded due to not able to start the game. I bought it again after being discounted and now I already finished the main story of the single player.During game, so far I get like 5 crashes. This is due to the graphic takes a lot of spaces to run and my laptop cannot handle it. Thus the crash.I put about 55 hours into the single player mode to finish the story. This is done by ignoring the side quests and encounters as I focus only in the story. Do I have fun during that time? Hell yes.What about online? I have not put much into the online gameplay as I rather get a lot of disconnects during game, which is annoying since I have to redo the quests that was supposed to be finished but the game decided to kick me out during save.is it worth it?If you enjoy single player stories and previous titles of R*, especially RDR 1, you will truly enjoy this one.If you are looking for online, anarchy game with mindless grinding, fingers crossed, this might be for you"

In the rare event you would survive this your first instinct would be running to that same horse and making sure his knee is okay, kissing it to get better.Small details that happen random, when you least expect it make your stay in this world enjoyable and fun, a world that is living breathing and not really caring about you, busy chasing that gold. There is something to do and see in each city, even interacting with random NPCs can create opportunities for work or money, items, secrets, it can lead to quests or brawls and shootouts. The wilderness is exactly that, no laws, no rules - get hailed by a shot woman asking for help only to get surrounded by 5 men ready to rob you, or find a man up a tree surrounded by wolves, save him and find out he is the heir of a rich family from a mansion nearby, making you a richer man. Someone really annoying you? Tie him up with your lasso, take him to the train tracks to catch a train or make a gator sleep better with a full stomach.It elevates open world games to that next level, bringing you an immersive story, graphically enhanced with lifelike animations paired with smart AI and a heavy dose of world building realism, but letting you decide how you want to play in it. Still has some dated Rockstar game mechanics, mostly tied to the story missions, but doesn't hurt the overall experience. It certainly isn't for everyone, long horse rides, lengthy conversations and slow progression is probably not something that an average player who comes from GTAV wants, but if you want a more chill experience losing yourself and hours in this world, this game is very rewarding at that."

You get sucked into the game from start to finish. Characters are well-made and interesting, voice acting is top-notch and everything emotions are displayed as they should. At the same time however, I miss a big overhauling objective to the story. It feels like you’re doing a bunch of random smaller chores. And although there is a reason as to why you’re doing most of them, it just misses a real important goal at times. And because of this, after a while the game starts to feel unnecessarily long. I do think it’s much better if you free roam more and do the campaign in between, but if you’re the type of player that just focuses on the main story first, you might feel the same as I did.Now this is not to say I didn’t have fun playing through the story. Missions are well done and fun to play, there is a lot of diversity and again, the storytelling / and character development is great, and you really do get sucked into this game. It grasps you and does not let you go until you see the credits scrolling by. It’s also great that you can choose which main quest you want to do yourself, instead of following a strict path.Now on to the world itself. It looks amazing, it feels amazing to travel through and the ambiance is like nothing I have ever seen before. It’s so immersive and alive. There is something to do in each small town, there are random encounters / side quests throughout the world and activities like hunting, fishing and playing games are really fun to do.Talking about gameplay, it’s great and makes the game feel like a movie sometimes. Cover shooting works good and interesting with NPC’s is perfect, but it has a classic Rockstar feeling to it as well. It’s a bit slow and clunky. You can’t react or shoot as fast as you want to and some things just feel like they’re being forced to look cinematic. Something all Rockstar games have if you ask me. The same goes for navigating menus & inventories. It just feels outdated.So should you buy RDR2? Hell yes. It’s one of the best games I have played in a long time. It has an amazing story, beautiful scenery, a great soundtrack and zero to no bugs. This together with a compelling story which is quite lengthy (it took me 46 hours to complete) makes for a great all around experience."

I feel like I have no agency. You spend a lot of time watching. And it's more than just the cut scenes. Every mission has only one way to be completed. There is no scouting out and deciding how to engage a fight in the missions... unless the game tells you to.Aside from riding your horse while people talk to you (a good portion of the missions), you can also do a number of seemingly fun side task and quests. I have not found a single one of these with any depth. Fishing looks great - but you basically do the same struggle-reel action on a set time interval. Have to catch a criminal? You walk up and initiate a cut scene, then press the right button really fast.The other huge failure is that 30 hours in, you have everything you could ever want or need and little motivation to do anything other than meander through the story.This game is amazing in many ways, but IMO it's missing the central things that make a game good."

1965,mantequilla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/calradians/,3,1,1,539.8,November,"26,",270,0,1,"Micah Bell III was born circa 1860 to Micah Bell Jr., a ruthless petty outlaw. When Micah was 17 in 1877, he and his father were on the run for the brutal double homicide of Roscoe and Jean Briggs, who were hung from the rafters with their throats slit. It can be assumed that he was his father's partner-in-crime throughout his upbringing, although evidence suggests that he also ran with his brother, Amos, for a time. Micah would later have a falling out with Amos, who, by 1899, is repentant of his actions and lives in California with his wife and daughters, whilst making it clear to Micah that he wants no contact with him and that he'll kill him if he's anywhere near himself and his family.Micah became acquainted with two outlaws named Cleet and Joe at some point during his criminal career, and also mentions being involved in a failed bank robbery down south with Norman. In 1898, Micah met Dutch van der Linde in a bar at Crenshaw Hill. Dutch tried to sell gold that his gang had recently stolen, but the deal went sour, leading to an altercation where Micah stepped in and saved his life.[3] As a result, Micah was accepted into the Van der Linde gang. Despite being an experienced outlaw who was respected for his skill in combat, Micah was generally disliked within the gang; in particular, Arthur and Hosea saw him as argumentative, reckless and hot-headed, with Dutch alone taking a liking to him.After five months, Micah set his sights on a ferry in Blackwater as a potential robbery. Although Arthur and Hosea had their own lead, Dutch instead chose Micah's option, which promised a bigger reward but also riskier. The heist turned out to be a complete disaster, however, and a huge gun battle with the Pinkertons ensued. Due to this, the gang was forced to flee and eventually managed to lose the law by entering a blizzard on the snowy mountains of Ambarino. The failed robbery notably caused the deaths of Jenny Kirk, Davey Callander and his brother Mac Callander."
1966,PlasmaVoyage,https://steamcommunity.com/id/plasmavoyage/,4,,1,143.7,January,"1,",297,0,1,"An absolute masterpiece, honestly.The story is sort-of typical wild-west but the plot and characters really rocket this game skyhigh.I have never seen such amazing animations (especially facial), voice acting, and well written characters like in this game before.Top notch, love it._________________________________________________________The few criticisms I have about the game are:- The Quest design is confusing as hell. Especially towards the end of the chapters you notice the situation getting really tense and then you have several missions marked on your map and from the plot it feels like any one of those missions is going to carry you to the next chapter, because of how important they all seem. In the end you have to do all of them anyway, but I think Rockstar could make it clearer as to what you're getting yourself into and maybe only have one Main Mission up at a time and also give the player an overview of the plan of the mission. As soon as you approach the NPCs giving you the missions, it immediately starts. You have no option to go ""Oh wait, I don't wanna do that right now."" But maybe it's intended, who knows. I feel like it's confusing as hell.- The AI Behaviour is awful. I have lost so many ambient quests because I accidentally ""bumped"" (it wasn't even a bump) the NPC's horse with my own horse going slower than walking speed. And they immediately freak out and run away and the quest is failed.Same with NPCs in towns and cities. You cannot be mean to anyone because you will ALWAYS pull the short straw. An NPC talks ♥♥♥♥ at you unprovoked, you talk ♥♥♥♥ back to him, he immediately starts a fight or pulls out a knife. You knock him out and immediately some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ runs to the sheriff to tell on you and you either run away or it escalates.Or that NPC straight up starts shooting at you in the middle of the town and if you shoot back, you're the wanted guy. The NPC that shot first, seemingly gets no punishment from it at all.- The Honor System. This one is not too important because it doesn't really do all too much and obviously, in a game like this, technically you are a mass murderer every time, no matter how honorable you try to be. And also the fact that you can just go and ""Howdy-Pahdna"" everyone in town and gain all of it back easily.But I think if Bounty Hunters come after me and they send bloodhounds that literally rip out my throat if I don't shoot them, I shouldn't get a honor penalty for doing that. I'm just trying to defend my life.And last but not least: There are some corpses to be found that have letters on them. You loot those corpses and all is fine. Other corpses don't have letters on them, you loot those (since you don't know whether they have anything or not) and you get an honor penalty. It should be made clear which corpses are ""ok"" to loot and which aren't.Again - not a big deal since you can just say Hello to every living creature and get your honor back but it feels like I'm being punished for exploring the game and trying to uncover its' secrets.And finally and most importantly:- The Technical Performance of the game. It's godawful on PC. Funny enough the first 30 or 40 hours went fine with just one crash to desktop. But suddenly after those hours, the game started acting up a lot. ERR_GFX_STATE is the one error I always got and it crashed the game to desktop and asked me to reboot my PC. Rebooting didn't help, starting the game in Safe Mode didn't help. Google'd some and deleted temporary Vulcan files in the Documents Folder and that didn't help either. The game immediately crashed after the loading screen.The way I managed to work around this was to delete only the temporary Vulcan File with the largest filesize, then boot up the game in Safe Mode, then change the graphics settings to my normal settings (Safe Mode starts the game with grahipcs settings set to super low) and then it worked again for a while.____________________________________________________________All in all: An absolutely masterwork of a game, loved every minute of it. If you're looking for a playable Tarantino or Eastwood movie, this is it."

And while I could write an essay about how the characters, story, and world drew me in, many other reviewers have already done that. Ultimately I decided that I could offer no better endorsement than the number of hours I have sunk into this masterpiece.So I guess the best advice I can give is: Remember to slow down and enjoy the ride.

1999,RoltCain,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210022420/,3,,1,185.1,June,"25,",227,0,1,"Sometimes you've got to take a step back and ask yourself; Is Rockstar one of the last company capable of actually delivering a true to form AAA game nowadays? In my opinion this is, quite sadly, an unequivocal yes!   The amount of attention and care that went towards crafting a masterpiece like RDR2 is mind blowing, especially with all these bland and generic pseudo AAA titles by pseudo AAA studios. You see, what makes the difference really is all of these little details Rockstar seems to focus on. RDR2 is just a mastercrafted, fine tuned piece of art. A game that commit to its choices and vision brillantly. Finest game in the west pal !• Immersion is off the hook, everything makes sense, looks like it belongs.• Visuals are great, the world map is beautiful, a perfect condensed lil ol'america. • Great acting, some really interesting narrative choices.• Most characters are memorable, charismatic and will make you feel a certain about them. • Just the sheer amount of attention brought to flora and especially fauna is nuts.• Overall all these nuances, details, subtleties, wether it's from a narrative, gameplay, atmospheric, visual, or sound perspective, really are the perfect sauce that brings the dish together.  Aside from the main plot, RDR2 really is about moments I feel like. I still remember this one time, it was right after sundown, a crazy thunderstorm was tearing the skies. I was rushing through the rain on my loyal steed, trying to get back to town before the butcher closes shop in order to sell my pelts. When suddenly... I noticed a lone ominous horseman standing atop the hill a few dozen meters on my right. I Immediately thought to myself : ""No sane man would let themselves get soaked like that, alone gazing into the storm"". I was obviously curious, a few seconds after I passed him in the distance, I instantly decided to go back and investigate who the hell was that guy ! And you guessed it, in a matter of seconds, just like that he was gone with not a trace to hold on to. A week or so passed, never saw the guy again of course, but realized, while randomly looking through the same vicinity, that the horseman was overlooking some mangled body down the road, with some cryptic message the killer must have left on the dead fella, a message eluding to some sort serial killings. I started to think that horseman might have been the crazed murderer, and still wish I caught up to him that one gloomy night.  See, just roaming around hunting or exploring can bring the most intriguing scenes and moments. Who doesn't remember getting absolutely mauled by a panther coming out of nowhere or stumbling into those freaks in that cabin who try to lure you into a presumed incestual threesome !!! • ONLY CONS In my opinion:   1. The gameplay can be frustrating, movement considered clunky and on the heavy/""realistic"" side. Although it suits the game's vibes and can even contribute to immersion, some will have difficulties getting used to it.   2. The weapon wheel is a nightmare and in a more general sense, weapon management is really annoying, for some reason you can't keep the same loadout, it keeps getting switched on you ! I love when I'm suddenly rocking a varmint rifle in the middle a of a shootout even though I meticulously grabbed my shotty before the cutscene...  3. The ""ALWAYS ONLINE"" stuff is just plain shameful, I mean this typically is the kind of games I'd like to dive back in when your internet goes down or whatever the case is...To sum up I'd rate Red Dead Redemption 2 an . I know some people will be annoyed by the pace and or sluggishness, but if you really get into it RDR2 is a pure treat. Anyhow, I loved this game, truely a cut above from the rest, no doubts. If you're still reading this, props to you."

Immediately I was amazed with the aesthetic of the game and how alive the characters felt. And once I could free-roam I just went on a long trip to explore every part of the map and fell in love with this masterpiece. So much so that I ended up getting 100% completion, did every side mission, explored every nook and cranny of the world, got gold medals on all mission, filled my compedium and basically every single thing that the game offers. Can't say anything about the Online experience because I never tried it and probably never will. But just for the singleplayer experience alone, this masterpiece is worth every cent you give!"

This game is a masterpiece ,a must-play title, from unrealistic graphics to unsurpassed and emotional story. I never expected to experience the same feeling again after the second playtrough of the game, which proves that story of RDR2 is one of the best written stories ever. I enjoyed the story so much and became attached to the characters and with their life traits and fate, it felt like I was in the movie. Until the second playtrough  I didn't realize  how much content rdr2 offers  and how many things I hadn’t gone through. There's a plenty of secrets and easter eggs that are waiting to be discovered and I am looking forward to the new insights and wonders that this game offers,""I Gave you all I had.

2010,m2ntaa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/danfieldcomms/,3,,1,262.5,June,"15,",52,0,1,"Decided to rewrite my review that I made when I first completed the main story (39.9 hours) and I was yet to complete the Epilogue aside from a few missions. I greatly rushed through the game, and didn't take time to appreciate the things around me. I never got to meet Hamish Sinclair, Find the crazed scientist Marko Dragic or teach Charlotte Balfour to survive in the wilderness. It didn't feel like I'd accomplished much. So i decided to start all over again and clock in a further 90 or so hours into the game.I can't guarantee this review won't be void of any spoilers, I'm making this up as I go along, truth be told, but major spoilers will be using a spoiler tag I'll start off with the story itself. Absolute masterpiece. There is no questioning it, that RDR2's story is, in my opinion, the greatest story I have ever completed (and I played the Lego Movie videogame so I know a damn good story when I see one.) As time progressed during my time playing, I dropped impulse actions of shooting and robbing everyone I met, and resonated with Arthur, I started to do things that I thought he would do himself, especially in Chapter 6. The gang members all felt unique in their own ways. I'll never forget drinking with Lenny, he's my favourite gang member. Even some of the more forgettable members, in my opinion, had their moments, like hunting for crabfish with Pearson or doing Strauss' stupid ass debt collector missions. Those missions are actually the most impactful for me, not for the obvious reason of  but actually because over time Arthur is more against them in Chapter 6 than he was in Chapter 2. It really shows his 'Redemption' The environment is also something to behold. The level of detail in the outside world is something I can't fault. It is more than a desolate wasteland, there's a true atmosphere to it. With little rabbits and squirrels running about, streams of water flowing or herbs and flowers to pick. The town's as well are also absolutely gorgeous, especially Strawberry to me. I love Strawberry the most. I love how the river flows right through it and the town is along two sides, built into the hills with very lovely bridges.I do have a few gripes to the game, which in my opinion are very minor:- The mission format isn't great, it normally has you hop on a horse, have small talk with another character, then complete the mission and split off, with a few exceptions of course.- Hand to hand combat is rather boring, it consists of spamming 'F' to hit and 'R' to block until the enemy gets knocked out, and there are a good few instances of these fights that do drag out for a long time like the bar fight with Tommy in Chapter 2- Skinning animals sometimes just doesn't have an animation, one second there's the skin and the next its gone and in Arthur or John's hand.- Looting is a pain, since theres an individual animation for every little thing you open, take and put away. It would be nice to have a 'Loot All' button- Online is a cashgrab, but you expected that I supposeBuy for the singleplayer, not for online. An absolute masterpiece of a game. In my initial review, I spoke of how there should be a Red Dead Redemption 3 in the 1860's at the peak of the Wild West era, but I think the Red Dead Redemption franchise should be retired, this game and RDR1 are all the 'Redemption' saga need, but another game under the 'Red Dead' name would be welcomed.9/10 because -1 point for ruining my social life and worsening my exam performance."

Posse member: ""iF yOu SiT aNd wAiT tHe TiMeR oUt YoU gEt PaId MoRe"". I don't want to wait, I want to do stuff and get paid to do it.Oh boy, bounty hunter again, everyone goes to the location, search for 5 minutes for a single guy taking a leak on a tree.Oh boy, steal a wagon from a convoy of guys. Bring it back to your camp, or your contractor for a measly couple bucks.Oh boy, do a free roam mission. Deliver the mail? Steal the wagon? RIVAL PLAYERS CAN STEAL YOUR MISSION. Get ready for anything. Realize the game put you in a solo session.Oh boy, Trader! Hunting is cool, hunt stuff, deliver stuff, run wagons and be ready for an attack, nothing, or steal a trader wagon from a player only for them to leave, yell at you for playing the game, then leave, or you actually fight them, thank goodness, Yay! Excitement! No real reward for stealing though. Get materials lol.Oh boy, Naturalist. go to harriet, get sprayed, leave, forget naturalist for a sec, kill some animals, remember naturalist, get sprayed.Oh boy, Moonshiner! Upfront cost is wild, tell yourself the return is worth it, run your moonshine, run over a pebble, break a bottle, 50% of value lost. Moonshiner revenue agent camps replace gang hideout spawns. Broken sabotage/poison the batch missions. Only 5 total moonshine story missions. 2 are broken. (Moonshine shack with your friends is cool though)Oh boy, King of the Castle! No one plays objective, or a Modder does.Oh boy, Dispatch Rider. Whole lobby leaves and stops trying, get $10 for winning.Oh boy, Railroad Baron. two good players actually fighting to get on the train, the rest of the lobby complaining in voice chat they're stuck in spawn when they're just staying in spawn, killing each otherOh boy, horseback kills challenge. Everyone is shooting each other. Kill a few players horses on accident. Get charged $16. Make only $10. Leave at a loss, even though you won.Oh boy, horse races, dead lobby.Oh boy, showdowns, dead lobby. (You can't host a match so no one ever searches at the same time)Oh boy, treasure maps, broken pickups.Oh boy, Blood money Capitale missions! ♥♥♥♥ yeah. Try to get capitale, Find no capitale, realize there really just isn't much at all in the missions, realize that capitale is just crapitale, finally save some crapitale, do 1 of only 3 repetitive ""Opportunities"" you can complete in literally 5 minutes if you wanted to, sit and farm it hoping to get a bunch of money, get less money than a 1 star legendary bounty.Oh boy, Story missions in Online? Sounds promising. Play them, realize it ends on an unfinished cliffhanger. Think to yourself the missions were kinda good though. Go to play them again. Make $13.Oh boy, collector, broken pickups, items missing, get to Madam Nazar, Processing Transaction...Oh boy, player bounty, accept it, nothing happens, ""huh? guess it didn't start"" It starts, 1:30 remaining.Oh boy, working player bounty, player stands there, player leaves.Oh boy, killing a bunch of cops and get a bounty! disruptive, discourages you from doing so with either starting a ""Mission"" to ""Kill the bounty hunters"" instead of it being like a wanted level, or having a bounty above $10 locks you out of most content.Oh boy, a new horse, his tail is gone, his mane is gone, his head is stuck sideways, realize this is a game breaking bug that's been in the game for a year.Oh boy, a vehicles section! I can buy and own my own wagon? Wagon customization? No. Bounty Wagon, Hunting Wagon, only usable on roads. Inconvenient.Oh boy, new outlaw pass! New outlaw pass?Oh boy, modders, modders everywhere. Peer to peer exploits, being able to literally close your game if they want to. Session following, teleporting, ruining PvP with invincibility and anything else they are around.Oh boy, mexico is literally in the game, you can see it, you can glitch out there and go to it, realize they're never adding mexico or updating the game again.Play single player, don't touch Online."

First up, the graphics are probably the best I've experienced in any game I've played so far, sometimes more realistic than reality. As a horse lover, it ticks that box 110%. I'm playing Online as well as the main story. Combat and missions are fun, AI enemies pretty intuitive. Although I tend to play as a ""Lone Ranger"" type, joining a Posse briefly Online was hilariously fun. I'm only about a 1/4 way through the main story because I'm somewhat addicted to the Online at the moment. My impressions of Story mode though so far are pretty good. Arthur is a sympathetic character, not really the typical the outlaw I was expecting. Dialogue and voice acting excellent. Overall this masterpiece of a game is a real pleasure that I'm still savouring. 10/10."

2048,Sasori Kigaru,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SasoriKigaru/,3,,1,184.8,June,"28,",511,0,1,"So please note before reading, I am recommending the singleplayer aspect more than I am the online aspect of the game in this review. I also don't write reviews often so, don't expect perfection either. The story in this game is amazing, and the interactions between all the characters feels so natural and definitely has some entertaining moments whether it be in a story set piece or just the characters idly chatting to each other or you during the game. The main story missions are very engaging, and very fun to play so props to the guys that made them, and there are A LOT of them too so it'll take you awhile to finish. It will take you even longer if you spend time doing side missions too, some of which are random encounters that you find just by wandering around and exploring the wilderness or the towns in the various areas of the game. The side missions though can be missed however, so be sure to explore often if you want to make sure you don't miss any or look up a guide if needed. The characters in this game are extremely well written, and two of them in particular are my favorite because of just how well the actors handled the characters. The two I mention is Arthur Morgan and Micah Bell. Arthur is a great example of a character development, especially if you play low/middle honor at first and then high honor later on. You can see him grow, his experiences slowly shaping him more into what he wants to be rather than what he has been. Not once does he ever call himself a good guy either, cause he doesn't have to be. He is an outlaw, a goodhearted one for sure, one that has earned my respect.Micah on the other hand? Hate the guy, but thats what I love too. He is the kind of person you love to hate, because the way he treats the 'family' had always been with a sense of 'I'm only here till you aren't of any use to me anymore'. Always felt good to antagonize the guy, and for reasons I won't spoil that a good amount of you probably know already? He deserves every single moment of being antagonized. Seriously, props to the actor for playing a character so well that you hate him for who he is and not because of something stupid. Dutch always has a planFind Lenny The gameplay is very enjoyable, and the environments are beautiful and full of life. You can hunt, fish, or just mess around with random passerby's you come across whether they be on horseback or a random encounter. The gunplay is pretty good too,  though I can only really compare it to GTA V since I've only played that and haven't actually played the first RDR. Regardless, it IS fun but I wouldn't say its the best. There are some issues however when it comes to the button prompts. Those these issues are more so prevalent on the online portion of the game rather than the single player since they're okay when you're on your own and don't have to worry about other people.  This is personally a big plus for me because I love being able to take screenshots in game of beautiful environments and either keep them as is or edit them some till they look more like a painting. I've a few on my profile that I consider my favorite. Seriously their environmental detail is pretty damn high up there, though can be graphically intense so it varies depending on the specs you're running with.OnlineOkay so the online portion of this game is.. okay-ish? Its really fun at first, but I do have gripes with it that I'll now go over. I love being able to create a character in game, but the way they did it in this game while functional, is not very user friendly. I had a damn hard time figuring out how to make my character actually look good. Now to be fair, if I wanted to look like I was part of a certain bunch of inbred psychopaths then I'd be all set since thats what it appears to be great at doing. But if you want to make a character that actually looks good? Especially if its a female one? Be prepared to do a lot of trial and error or look up a video on youtube. Additionally, it'd be nice if you weren't limited to one character only, but maybe that'll change someday? Who knows. Aye, there is actually story! Problem is, its not all that engaging, you're literally a character that never speaks so conversations are one sided. The main problem I have with it though is how hard it is to actually do them. I don't mean difficulty either, I mean that unless you're trying at a specific time or there is some kind of monetary event regarding the story missions, you'll be having a hard time with matchmaking. This issue is gone if you play with friends, but personally there should be solo options. A lot of people including myself play that way, since playing with randoms while it can be fun? It can also be stressful especially when its hard to communicate with them. Now now, before you start setting me on fire, I know that you can use a mic to communicate and occasionally maybe I'll do so. But I shouldn't have to be forced to use it if I don't want to. I could be having mic troubles, not to mention the fact that some people just don't have them at all. Text chat is severely needed in this game, because the gestures you have in game are a bit hard to navigate to and you can't have many equipped at once. Only a select few, so trying to 'signal' what you're trying to accomplish is just about impossible. Perhaps its a console thing, which while understandable I don't see why they can't have the same option. Might be slower for them, but I still see no reason for it to be implemented. Now I play with a PC, and unless cross-play is a thing I don't even know if any of the people I'm playing with are on the console so that point may be redundant anyway. It is thankfully not GTA V levels of grind, at least not that I can see yet. Still, making money in this game is very grind heavy. You can supposedly get quite a bit to start out with if you do all the online story missions, but you've already read my bit about that so you can very likely see the issue there. I had to spend about two weeks or three of grinding stranger missions just to make enough gold in order to start up the trader role which while it pays nice its still a slow start. Additionally, in order to make the max amount from a stranger mission you HAVE to wait until the last 30 seconds. It actually pays you less, if you finish it quickly. I didn't like that. Still, you can use the extra time to do other things, just don't forget about the timer otherwise you'll fail the mission. Like GTA V, there are script kiddies in game that will more often than not, completely ruin your fun. Whether its during free roam or a random free roam mission, they will screw you over. Although I've only met one so far in my hours of play, there are multiple people in the forums complaining about the amount of them in the game. Your experience may differ, you might get lucky and never encounter one or you'll have the worst luck and find yourself surrounded.ConclusionTLDR: The single player aspect of this game is amazing and is definitely worth playing. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF, you are only interested in the online aspect. The online portion of the game needs a lot of improvement which it may or may not get. However, if you're mainly interested in the story? Then by all means, buy this game and enjoy yourself! I know I did.I also don't write many reviews so yeah, hopefully this has been helpful!"

The story is amazing with a lot of characters with different personalities  and characteristics. The graphics look amazing and the world feels realistic. The game makes you feel like It could live without the player inside of it, you can always get lost in the world and find something interesting to investigate.  There is much to do in Red dead 2, from hunting and fishing to antagonizing a stranger until he threatens to kill you to robbing a train. That's it for the story part.Now for the online part of the game, it sucks. Unless you like doing boring deliveries and collecting plants to get money to purchase upgrades and then do more of them. Sure you can do bounties, but even that gets repetitive and it doesn't even pay much. As of today Rockstar hasn't added what almost every Red dead player wish was in the game, heists. How come do you make the best Western shooter game with a story mode wich involves shooting good and bad guys and robbing everything that comes in your way, but when it comes to recreating the same thing but make it online, you only let them collect flowers and do boring deliveries?"

Ever since it came out back in October 2018, I have put it at the top of my favorite games list. To me, this game defines the word ""masterpiece"", it's honestly beyond the point of just being a *game*, this is my favorite piece of art by far. First off, the story and writing is unlike anything I have ever seen in any Movie, Game, TV Show, etc. The story means so much to me and has genuinely impacted the way I think. Arthur Morgan is the best character in any piece of fiction to date. I have yet to see a character written with as much realism and depth as Arthur Morgan. And then obviously there's Dutch Van Der Linde, the most compelling antagonist ever written. Everybody needs to play this story just to experience it, this kind of experience is truly once-in-a-lifetime. The graphics are obviously beautiful, everybody knows that, the voice acting is unmatched by any other video game, the sound design is beautiful, and I still listen to the soundtrack every single day nearly 4 years later. I am honestly unsure if there will ever be another piece of media that will even come close to how much this game means to me. It's not even fair to give this a ranking, so I'm just going to rank this Priceless/10. Please buy this if you haven't already."

2069,Havinstroke,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Havinstroke/,5,,1,47.6,December,"26,",193,0,1,"(Single Player Review)Like with the first game, RDR2 just about invalidates the need for any other western games to be made. Besides covering every aspect of the wild west fantasy, there's also a pretty great story to experience. However, this is NOT the typical story you might expect from Rockstar. The story is not going to be for everyone, because it's actually much slower, more serious, and more cozy than what they often make. But the sense of comradery you feel with the characters of this game is as good as it gets for a game that isn't an RPG. One of the best parts about the story is how much extra context you are given for the first game, to the point where you could play either game first. Moving on from the story, the next best part of this game is its sound design. Every single thing you hear in this game comes together to make one of the most noteworthy audio experiences I have ever heard. The timing of the soundtrack, the sound effects, and the voice acting are all absolutely perfect. ALL THAT BEING SAID, the one problem with this game is that it lacks innovation. I've played Rockstar games all my life, and yeah, their games are great, and if you haven't played one before then YOU ABSOLUTELY SHOULD, but...At the end of the day, it is mostly an experience I have had many times before. So while I can sit here and say that every aspect of this game is perfectly crafted, it just isn't done in such a way that inspires all that much excitement. At least from me. And I mean, the game still gets a [FINAL SCORE: 9/10]"

If you have ever wanted to really get the feel of being an outlaw in the wild west there is no way this game wont fulfill that and then some. I have no problem with calling this the best open world game I have ever played. Huge variety of areas to explore from musty swamplands, grassy plains, and even the snow capped mountains all of which are filled with a seemingly unlimited number of different species and subspecies of animals to hunt. There is no copy and pasting going on here. The various towns and cities in the game feel more than alive with NPC's that dont just feel like walking mannequins used to fill up space but instead like actual people going about their daily business. The story, oh my god the story. If I told you every thing that I enjoyed about that story this review would be as long as a Harry Potter book. To cut it short: its a breathtaking roller coaster of emotions with lovable (and not so lovable but in a good way) characters and a plot that digs deeper than your run of the mill shoot em' up cowboy game. To help you along your way you will also of course have access to a healthy array of western weaponry, keep it classic with a Colt revolver and Winchester rifle or maybe switch it up and bring a Lemat revolver and an elephant rifle and if you really want to go the extra mile make custom ammo like high velocity rounds or even explosive rifle rounds to really make sure they're dead, you will never run out of options when it comes to combat.My final conclusion for Red Dead Redemption 2 is its as close to a perfect game as I've gotten so far. If you enjoy having a huge breathing world to explore and a beautiful story to back it up there is no way you can go wrong with getting this. I would pay just about any price if it meant experiencing a game of this caliber for the first time again, its truly in a league of its own.   10/10"

I've only played multiplayer for 2 days at this point, but it seems that you can do most of the same things in multiplayer as you can in single. I thought they would have had to strip away all the awsome elements of the game in order to make multiplayer work, but nope, I was glad to be wrong. There are even features in multiplayer that are unavailable in single player, and plus you get to make your own avatar. The character customisation is really in depth, from jaw bone and eye socket shape, to weather discolouration of the face, rashes and scars.If you're the type of gamer who has to rush through everything as quickly as possible in the name of progression, then you might miss a lot of the aspects that this game has to offer.

I would just rather have an open world to run around in and do what I want, rather than having areas like New Austin locked out until the Epilogue is reached, and other mechanics locked out. It would be nice to be able to have personal wagons and character customization that Red Dead Online has.The online mode is hot garbage. Everything is ten times more expensive than in story mode, and you earn about 25% of what you would in story mode. Most other players are a--holes and key mechanics and advancements are locked behind missions that require being a group, or disabled completely (like being able to capture and keep or sell wild horses). The Dead Eye mechanic is essentially useless in online, because there's no time dilation because you can't have that and have all of the players synced.Truth be told, I really don't even want to play online or with other people. The ideal game for me would be to have all of the open world/go anywhere, do anything capability and character customization of the online mode, but in a single player, offline game."

Only cons are some missions early in the game are quite limiting. The first chapter is pretty linear and kinda boring imho but it acts as a tutorial.

With such amazing voice-acting talent, heartbeating soundtracks and high fidelity cinematics, it's easy to get hooked on this game. Personally I love variations in video games. If you need a break from the main story, go play poker! Or hunt and explore around the vast different majority of cities. There is always something to do in RDR2! Walking the streets of small town Valentine compared to big city Saint Denis really makes you scratch your head and wonder if you are still playing the same game. The terrain and cities have great variety.200 hours into the game I would say my favorite function in the game is the Cinematic Camera. Sitting around the campfire and listening to one of Hosea's crazy stories? Just hold [V] and it suddenly gives more life to the atmosphere around the story being told.

I can't go ONE session of playing this game without running into some game breaking bug or issue, and I NEVER have.

It makes you feel good, strong, the world makes sense. The second, a giant, petrified turd roughly buffed into the shape of a diamond and set into your scepter in a way that you can't get rid of it.The single player game is so well crafted, so detailed, and so much thought was put into it. It was an incredible experience that I couldn't help but play until the end without stopping, and I really empathized with the characters, which is something very difficult for me to do in a game. It's in my top ten. It's a love letter to westerns and a pinnacle triple A title.The multiplayer, though, is a predatory mess that roughly uses the same systems to make a chore simulator that encourages you to spend real money to break up the tedium with even more tedium. It baits you with the single player and then draws you in to the same daily tasks week after week that amount to folding your laundry or making breakfast. There *are* some story missions here, and some interesting gameplay in the form of legendary missions, but otherwise its designed, like any other online rockstar game, to make you grind and encourage you to spend more money on TOP of the $60 you already spent for the game. It's only good if you have someone to play with you, and even then most of your tasks are going to be broken up by monotonous travel that lets you hold down a button for a second or shoot some people at the end. You better really like your friend.I can't condone pairing such scummy game practices with the masterpiece that is a single player, and that's why I'm recommending that for those of you who really want to experience it, borrow a copy. If you have a friend and want to play the multiplayer with them despite those warnings, play the single player in its entirety first, otherwise your experience is very likely going to be spoiled."

Never felt so enamoured with a story. Each character is unique and beholds an interesting backstory. The mechanics are very well presented and bring a unequivocal sense of fun and exploration. It follows a great deal of depth, encapsulating many emotions. Prosperity, hope, greed, disillusion, leadership; yet the list continues. Combat lacks in a sense but that is to be expected with Rockstar, whilst it is de-emphasised, it is enjoyable thanks to the Dead-Eye feature, allowing for cinematic kills. The online is very poor and a generally lacklustre experience. The heavy emphasis on micro-transactions ruins the experience. With a severe lack of content and excitement to be had, it is worth a miss in my opinion. The story alone in RDR2 makes it worth purchasing, and the online section of the game should not even be held in the same regard. It is easily one of the best games ever produced."

2119,Majkel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Majkel_poland/,3,,1,323.1,July,"18,",45,0,1,"I just don't know what to say. This game is just... perfect. It has everything. Insane and mind blowing details, very good graphic level that is hard to find in other games with that good performance. Heart breaking story, and many activities to do after end game. Thats what i'm saying. As always next words will be a bigger review with no spoilers and at the end is summary.Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to start discussing it.It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story.The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not.The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it.At any rate, it’s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me.IT'S JUST A MASTERPIECE!

The amount of details that was part of the game makes it worth the 540 million that Rockstar has put in. The map is massive which features cities, small towns, deserts and snowy mountains. The graphics of the game is insane and sometimes you can't see the different between it and real life. Red Dead 2 feels more like a movie than a game due it is brilliant story line, sad but often realistic.Spoilers: When Hosea died, it was when everything was going bad, like how Arthur said he missed his Wisdom. Dutch started to get fooled by Micah. When I heard Arthur had tuberculosis and it wasn't possible to take a rest and get to places warm I was depressed that both the game is coming towards an end and Arthur is dying. When I found out it was Micah who told I was really angry and pissed just wanted to kill him. I thought Dutch would always be on Arthur's side, but i realised things has changed now Dutch is no much the old Dutch, he doesn't care about his gang anymore he is like Micah. I was despaired when I saw Dutch walking toward Micah. I cried at when Arthur said you are my brother to John and also when he died, his true Redemption.

If you're interested at all in the Wild West genre then this is the game that trumps em all. I highly recommend to use ReShade and find a decent preset on Nexus Mods. It changes the game into something photorealistic. (Haven't used it on Online so I can't say if that'll ban you but I would turn ReShade off if you were playing Online)Only complaints are that this game requires an internet access to start, which doesn't make sense as I only touch the amazing story, and a bug that seems to have appeared from the latest Online mode patch that makes it so that everyone at camp will keep telling you to wear warmer clothing despite wearing the warmest of artisan coats. Also originating from the previous patch, when starting up the game the audio for the game is at the lowest point which is annoying but fixable by going into the volume mixer.EDIT: Seems the cold bug and audio issues were fixed with the recent RDO update.Other than that it's an excellent experience and it is not often that video game characters can teach you something.10/10 Story mode.P.S Check Hardware Unboxed's optimization guide for the best experience."

2129,TheLordBailish,https://steamcommunity.com/id/illaturos/,4,,1,102.8,January,"4,",199,0,1,"I started playing this game sometime last June or July and got about 18 hours in and then gave up on it. Even though I was really enjoying the story; it was moving too slow for me, and the gameplay grated on my nerves.About two months ago, I decided to pick it back up again. I downloaded it and launched my save, but when I started playing, I had no idea what was going on or even how to play anymore. So I decided to start over.I still struggled with the slower pace of the game. The cutscenes were long, and even though I enjoyed the character interactions, the gameplay—specifically when dealing with looting and such—was irritating because of the slower animations, and the fact that the game actively punishes you for being a prick. (I was playing as a bloodthirsty monster who killed everyone I came across)So at some point, right around the time you finish things around Valentine, I decided to just slow down. Just relax and enjoy the scenery and story.And that’s when this game clicked for me.I’m so used to playing games where you constantly have stuff trying to grab your attention, and there’s constantly things going on. So in this game, when things aren’t happening constantly, it gets kind of boring.But when I slowed down and tried change my mindset, this game really showed it’s strengths. The point of the game isn’t to run around doing whatever you want, killing innocent people and robbing everyone you see (though you can). The point is to immerse yourself in the characters and their story.I decided to really put myself in Arthur’s shoes and experience the world as he did. I started doing everything at a slower pace. I started actively trying to be the “good guy”, and helped people I came across instead of killing them immediately. It became obsessive to the point that I was more concerned about being a good person than helping the gang.When I did this, I started to appreciate the all the things that annoyed me before. I really felt like I was the one going through this story; like I was Arthur. Where most games it feels like you’re just an observer.And I gotta say, this game blew my mind. The story had me sucked in all the way through. It was surprisingly emotional to me.One scene that comes to mind specifically is one of the missions with Mary.  This mission in particular stands out to me for a couple reasons. It really showed the emotional stakes to the story. was much more emotional than I expected.The other thing it showed was the amount of effort the development team put into every facet of the game. The theater had actual acts that you could sit and watch that legitimately entertained me. Most other games I’ve played would have just had a cutscene of them walking in and then back out; but Rockstar actually voiced and animated it all.The other thing that I loved about this story was the gradual shift in dynamic between The whole final act with After Anyway, this whole game is just a work of art and I was blown away by how much I enjoyed it.

From the beggining of the game, I could say, that I'm going to spend huge ammount of time in this game. The Storyline is just a masterpiece. The graphics are just F****** beautiful, and the huge world.... ohhh man . But because of the beautiful graphic, this game need a very solid PC. What about the soundtrack ? They just matched the in game music perfectly w/ a cowboy themed game. I've got to say this game is truly one of the best games, we'll ever see.Pros:+ Awesome soundtrack+ Cowboy themed game+ Huge open world+ Very interesting Plot+ You won't be able to stop play this game+ Characters are very memorable+ Hunting ( There are so many species... You can basically hunt anything )+ The shooting is really nice+ You will never get same quest+ You can still play, even after beating the gameCons :- This game costs a lil bit too much- The requirements are so huge- Sometimes Rockstar Launcher crashes- Yes.... we need ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rockstar Launcher to even play this game- Online isn't that goodFinal rating: 8/10"

Within hours of release, the first signs of bitterness begin to surface on the internet regarding a short, unsatisfactory ending to BioWare's otherwise beautifully crafted series.  I was upset too.  How could a beloved company create a trilogy so immersive and entertaining, and then misjudge the last fifteen minutes so poorly?  Rightfully, thousands of fans were calling for an update, asking BioWare to give their story a proper send off.  I remember responses from several developers; ""BioWare shouldn't cave in to this pressure, video games are art, they need to be respected as the artist's original vision.""I had a very agitated response.  It was laughable to me.  Video games are not art.  Video games are meant to be played and enjoyed based on several merits including graphics, gameplay, animations, story, and several more based on the genre.  It's ridiculous, as with any product, your goal is to make the consumer happy, and if you didn't do that, you failed.  McDonald's can't put out a horrible new burger and hide behind claims that it's art and satisfy the public -- it's the same for games.The year is 2018.  Red Dead Redemption 2 is art."

The story starts off slow but amps up once you get past the basic tutorial sections you will be left laughing, crying, crying some more, and feel like justice has been done. I binged this game all 47 hours of mine (so far) in about a couple of weeks because I wanted to see how it ended. Highly recommend it. It is similar to GTA in a way but with a much better story and an honor system which I really liked. In GTA games you can pretty much kill or steal whomever and nothing happens but in this game doing anything like that will lower your honor and will change the way the story goes and how it ends. The characters are probably the highest point as everyone has fully fleshed out personalities and you do start to really care for them and what happens to them.I do want to address all the comments about the game not running on their PC due to the game not being optimized. I ran everything on high settings, had a constant 60 fps and never any stutter or frame drops ever. I will say that I do have very good specs on my PC (Intel Core i7-6700K 4 GHz, 16 GB of RAM, GTX 1070) so that definitely helped so I can't compare my experience to others. Looking at the other comments with it not running if your PC doesn't have great specs I would skip this. You could always try it and find out and return it on Steam if it doesnt work for you. Hopefully R* will fix the optimization on this game."

Look's like they've got to made a quite good amount of work here, but decided to release it earlier to keep cash flowing, get some free QA reports from users, that actually paid for complete game (not for the pre-release beta) and then fix the bugs later, during sales. I've waited for a steam version for some time, than kept waiting few more weeks and decided to buy it, hoping they fixed a lot of troubles people reported at start. I've installed the game and first 3 launches caused crashes even before game's starting screen loaded. Then I've reseted game's configuration using rockstar's safe mode and get into it. After ~16 hours of game experience I've got ~15 crashes refered to my graphic adapter (RX590) due to error screen info. I've lost 2 saves, when game crashed at the end of different missions when it used to save, look's ike save files were corrupted and loading game using them caused infinite loading screens, so I've decided to restart my story mode again - this story teached me to make some saves by myself from time to time. I've also spotted that one of side missions was causing repetative crashes when I was tring to explode dynamite at the pile of ♥♥♥♥ near Granger's house - the same moment of crash, exactly at the moment of detonation. Then I used to read forums and I've spotted that most of my crashes were caused by Aorus Engine and usage of Vulcan settings for graphics - game doesn't work properly with overclocking tools, as well as with Vulcan, especially when they're combined. Using DX12 I've been able to pass Granger's mission succesfully, avoidiong most of other crashes during 2 hours of playing. I would test it further, but for now:I'm not recommend buying this game at it's current state - I think developers got to fix most of the major/critical issues, as well as few I've described earlier. It's sick releasing such a great game with such a great price and such a great bugs. Just wait for a fixes and enjoy it as it should be. Let them do their job they've got to do earlier before game's release on PC.UPD1. I've seen an amazing thing - settings I've done last time for graphic adapter were randomly changed after reboot. Now the game is uplayable and starting with 7-8 fps no matter what I try. Wonderful!UPD2. Most of the issues fixed and the game is waiting for you."
2155,supernaut,https://steamcommunity.com/id/supernaut/,3,,1,220.9,December,"14,",465,2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a culturally significant work of art that should be preserved and archived. It should be backwards compatible with every equivalent device and OS that will be released in the future, so that it doesn't collect dust in said archive or be available only to a select audience as the original Red Dead Redemption. It's time that we bring the same level of care and respect to video game preservation as we do with motion pictures. I would name other titles that should get the same treatment, but comparison is the death of joy. This is bigger than Take-Two and Rockstar Games, it's not just an IP that has sold over 50 million units, it's not shareholder-porn or a toy for children, it's art. From Pong to RDR2, there's a bit of a leap there, so in a way it's the result of over 45 years of trailblazing. If a banana taped to a wall is considered art, then this is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ art. Red Dead Redemption 2 takes an honest and self-reflective look on a young nation through a personal journey of a gang of outlaws. The outlaw way of life very much lives on today, but these people saw themselves as a dying breed in the face of lawful civilization and the industrial revolution. Romanticizing gangsters or outlaws is not everyone's cup of tea, which is understandable, but I believe most people are not beyond redemption. If Vince Gilligan made it possible relate to Walter White, then you should be able to relate to Arthur Morgan. While bestowing it all of this praise, I'm not suggesting this is a perfect game. The game's inventory needs refining, there are too many collectible strands and I need reasons to own and spend the tens of thousands of dollars I accumulate, to give you a more personal list. Open world games are a difficult balancing act and Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the closest to a perfectly balanced open world experience. Be it an indie game made by one or two people or a game made by 3,023 people, to get the necessary funding, the talent and ideas together in time and produce a landmark, generation-defining title is the result of an obscene amount of luck and there are no winning formulas to keep a genre from stagnating. Every developer should ask of themselves: ""What are we saying with this game?""It's hard to write about the characters and the story without going into spoiler territory, so I'll do it in more broad strokes as best I can. Continue at your own peril. This is a prequel to a game with a different protagonist, John Marston, who's also introduced in RDR2 in a big way. Arthur Morgan is an iconic character that rivals its big-screen equivalents played by Eastwood. Arthur's facial animation clearly gets the most attention here; Roger Clark's performance is pivotal in bringing this highly detailed world and its great story together. Arthur is the counterbalance to Dutch, the gang's leader, Arthur's father figure, a narcissist intent on digging his own grave and willing to bring down everyone with him. But he's not alone in that, his mind is further twisted by the snakes around him. Arthur is loyal within reason, ultimately kind in his unlawful ways, if that's the path you take. He's uneducated but has wisdom, he takes time to think, but is helpless in trying to keep a dysfunctional family on the right path. He's not alone in his attempts, he gets help and guidance from Hosea, Charles, John and Lenny, while Sadie Adler could easily have her own spin-off game. Dutch has the allure of a seasoned preacher and the looks of Colonel Sanders in negative. He's the man with the plan and he tells everyone to have faith in his plan. No one is held prisoner, in a 'sinking ship' sort of way.If you're going to invest 50-200 hours in an open world game, at least one of them ought to be this one. It doesn't overstay its welcome or careen into monotony and soulless completionist exploration. It's immersive as Skyrim and Witcher 3 and in many ways more so. As Witcher 3 it looks better than most games released today, which is not bad for a 4+ year-old game. It'll still look amazing another 5 years from now, so as you upgrade you can push it further. I got genuinely emotional playing this to the end, alongside hours spent on fishing and hunting, simply because Arthur Morgan is so beautifully realized as a character and without Roger Clark, who was robbed of many a award, this entire Western adventure would start to crumble. I don't mean to undersell Dutch van der Linde, played by Benjamin Byron Davis, cos one doesn't exist without the other, but they really lucked out with Roger Clark. One person simply can't make something on this scale and detail, so for now it takes a village of 3,023."

It is not my favorite game, and I do partially understand why a lot of people have some problems with it but I honestly can barely process how good of an experience it was, even on my low spec PC.The game presents peak storytelling matched with a very appropiate and solid soundtrack, an unparalleled graphic aspect, incredibly inmersive world full of details and complex NPC interactions like we've never seen before (and have not seen again since, to the day I'm writing this), powerful intense action and equally strong slow paced touching moments, full of well written dialogue, flawless voice acting, and beautiful scenery.RDR2 is not perfect, and it will at times restrain your options whilst trying to make you believe that you are free to make any decision. It may hold your hand a lot through it all, yes. But if you let the game guide you through the astonishing world it features, a world that seems to never stop showing you new things when you thought you had seen them all. If you take your time to hear what is being said. If you take a minute to behold the world around you. In summary, if you play along...You will get a great journey, one of the best I've ever played through"
2178,||,https://steamcommunity.com/id/noilitoc/,3,1,1,70.7,December,"28,",626,0,1,"A cowboy game that really lets you horse around, pun intended. Unless it's the story missions. TL;DR: It's really good, but the gameplay is at odds with the story, which could have probably been shorter. If you like wild west media in general or open world games, it's definitely worth a try even if you are just going to mess around and not finish a story(only 20.3% of people did on Steam actually). Visually, it's (mostly) beautiful, especially considering how huge the open world is, with some worse textures here and there. A lot of care went into animations, the cutscene animations are especially worth mentioning, and many little details that make the world seem more lived in. Apparently horse balls shrink in the cold, but as I am not weird, I haven't actually checked.  Though admittedly, being an 2018 game, it's showing some age. It's also worth mentioning that game uses checkerboard-rendering, which causes visible artifacts in hair and fur. The only solutions are to either use TAA(which makes everything blurry and makes it look worse) or much higher rendering resolution. The DLSS isn't that amazing in this game and makes the hair artifacts worse.Sound-wise, I have nothing wrong to say about this, everything is essentially perfectly spot on.The gameplay by itself is good, though dated with some more immersive elements like looting animations or skinning or animal as well as some survival mechanics such as eating. The survival mechanics are pretty shallow and really more for some immersion like I said or minor roleplaying.What also helps roleplaying is really wide array of customization options - hair, beard(both growing in real time) or clothes. And boy, there is a huge variety of clothes to choose from as well, so you can play the cowboy dress-up game too if you want to.The world is beautiful, with a lot to hunt and explore. It has quite a few side story missions that are usually pretty funny and nice diversion from the main plot. The story is about a gang of more noble outlaws during the ending years of the Wild West, as the country was becoming more and more civilised. The fact that you can't fight the progress and change is a large thematic part of the game, whether it's the the law trying to end the outlaw life, or the gang itself being against old values such as slavery.It's well written for the most of it, but sometimes characters killing 40-50 people during as story missions feels really off for the kind of story it's trying to tell. Other times there are some AWFUL story conveniences that are just straight up irritating with villains escaping in awkward manner. Though that did sound more negative than positive, the story is definitely worth experiencing, though could probably be bit shorter to be paced better.I haven't played the multiplayer component, as I heard it's pretty grindy and I already have an actual job, so yeah.If you can buy it on sale, which is lately usually 50% off, it's a really good deal. I don't think I'd want to pay 60 for it."

It's easely the best game I've ever played.It took me a while to consider buying the game as there were a lot of launch issues on the pc, and I've heard the game was ""too realistic"" in the sense that some stuff is just... grindy and repetative (e.g. cooking, crafting). Man was I wrong.I bought the game, and started getting along. In the beginning it's some getting used to but the game sure shows it's graphical beauty. I started fiddling with graphical settings to make the game look really good yet not /as/ demanding given that my poor RX480 only gave me 21 fps when I maxed out the game. I managed to still get a REALLY good looking game running at 40 fps. The story.... It made me laugh, cry, angry, and so much more. I won't go into detail but the story is straight up 10/10. Some characters are forgettable as in they're not oftenly encountered or spoken with, however all characters are unique. Most characters though will stick in your mind and you'll actually feel some bond with them. I experienced maybe 2-3 crashes of which 1 was annoying because I had to re-play a mission but other than that it ran pretty stable. P.S.: I didn't look up anything before playing the game and just jumped in, and I reccomend everyone to do the same. You'll get to experience an emotional rollercoaster that get's you 60h of high quality content (story) and possibly even more."

I perfer single player games, and it is an atrocity that I can't play it when their servers are offline. I'm really sick of this idea in gaming that everything has to have an embedded multiplayer setup.

There's far too many bugs for a far too high price.

The game is now enjoyable as was originally planned, Looks great on 4k. It seems some optimization has occurred as well, I run an I7-4930K, 6 core 12 thread (OC 4.4ghz) with an EVGA 1080ti on full custom water, and I get averaged just over 50 fps in 4k while playing single player. Have spent 2 hours trying to get the game to launch without crashing. You must have the rockstar launcher in order for it to work, which defeats the purpose of Steam entirely, so I'm glad i waited the extra month for no reason. When the game opens, it crashes because it cant connect to the Social Club, even though everything is connected outside of game. I was hoping this would be fixed for the month of ""FIXES"" Rockstar has been claiming they've been doing, and an optimization probably would be beneficial since people with 1080ti/2080ti and 9900k's cant get more than 40 FPS.

However, there are 2 elements in this game that make it one of the best I've ever played.Firstly, the story. It's honestly like playing out a movie. Masterfully written with a consistent tone and a damn gripping plot. The characters are all rich in intrigue and personality, your band of outlaws FEELS like a family. The cast of VAs are exceptional, the dialogue makes every interaction feel exciting and refreshing.Secondly, the world itself. I'd never played a video game where the environment didn't feel like a game at all, and instead it felt almost real. Until I played this game. The landscape is gorgeous, and changes perfectly as you're driven from region to region. There's wildlife everywhere, fellow travellers on the road, towns, mountains, valleys, lakes, and one random dude who somehow always manages to get bitten by a snake (gotta suck the venom out for him every damn time). 9.5/10(It's really THAT good)"

After that I usually just alt+f4 and then go wash my hands and sit and be sad. But I just played several hours in a row and I was just into it and both enjoying the visuals and the story. The graphics are lovely but there are a decent amount of physics issues in the game even though I played it on ultra which kinda breaks immersion at times, but not too often in my experience. The story is lovely and the side quests are absolutely lovely and I found myself doing all the sidecontent I could find.

2245,A2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashishcw/,3,,1,72.6,December,"31,",185,0,1,"TL;DR : If you are looking for a game which can offer you an massive open world, full of adventures journey with random events, massive set of quests and treasure hunts with western outlaw style, this is the game for you.Also, I have few non-spoiler game-play tips at the end, so if you are interested, take a look.================ Detailed Review================NOTE :This review is done only from the single player/story mode prospective. All the points mentioned are strictly my opinion only and my take of this game. It may or may not give you the same experience as mentioned here.============== My Experience==============On 26th December 2019, Along with this game I bought and installed few other games too, but since then this is the only game I ended up spending 17+ hours and still counting.========= Pointers=========To put it in 3 words, ""A Rare Masterpiece""The game has 2 different modes,1.	Story Mode/Single player2.	Multiplayer/OnlineIn Story mode, the game revolves around main protagonist, named Arthur. You play as Arthur who is an important part of an outlaw gang.What this game has to offer?Game has huge offerings, in terms of player engagement.1.	Main Story Driven Gameplay : For Story driven fans2.	Quests : To help player boost/unlock some attributes3.	Side Missions : To make available few items/skills earlierBesides the vanilla/default game mechanics?what makes a PC game more fun? ""Mods"". Though Rockstar doesn't officially support mods, they also do respect the creativity approached by their fans to the game, as far as it stays in offline/story mode only.Source - ============ Pros & Cons============Pros.1. Open-world Massive and Beautifully crafted Open-world(From Icy mountains to muddy swamps)2. Story - Amazing & well paced story line3. Player Attributes - Well balanced player characteristics and attributes and practical at the same time. E.g. If player is in snow surrounded area and doesn't have winter clothes on it will affect it's health and cores.4. Interactable Objects - Tons of Guns and Ammunition, Horses(your primary medium of transportation), Tonics and edibles, Loots etc.5. Gameplay - Smooth and versatile. Game doesn't forces you a character oriented story, but rather lets you decide, who you want to be.5. Apart from Main Story line - Tons of things to do apart from missions(Hunting & skinning, Fishing, Horse Riding, Crafting, Cooking and much more)6. Optimization - Very well optimized for PC7. Music - None other than ""Woody Jackson""(aka composer for Red Dead Redemption, GTA V, Max Payne 3, L.A. Noire). Great situation and world adaptive music. I would say, its one of those games, where the BGM/and other sound effects takes the gameplay to the whole new level, Try it with Headphones8. Random stuff in the game - Very well done in this regards, Imagine, you are on your way to start a new mission, and you have a stranger asking for help in the midway, Do you really want to help? It could be a trap, or are they genuine?9. Realistic Touches - Be that your beard growth, be that your hair growth, be that a hunt you have skinned leaving a bloody spots on your right/left shoulder. One just can amaze to see how much work does Rockstar have put into. One of the most realistic games I've played. And loved it.10. Apart from default game-play - Still looking for more? Single Player / Offline Mods? Does that answer the point? There are limitless possibilities with this section, as community has so much to offer and people are awaiting for a lot to grasp to.Cons.1. Key binding - If you are playing it on PC, I would very highly recommend to play it with keyboard and mouse. As game-play can be really frustrating at times if you are playing with controller.2. Hard Mechanism - ""Easy to learn, Hard to Master."" The game is a whole eco-system in itself and grasping everything at once can be really tough. There are Ledgers, Documents, Skill trees, Diary, Inventory System and much more.================ Final Take-away================Well, if it's not clear so far, let me repeat, the game itself is amazing and really one of a kind. There are few restrictions and the game is very hardware demanding, but again, it has to be that way. The game has so much to offer to.The has massive open-world, There are literally individual systems made for each aspect, Player characteristics, Skill tree, Camp and it's requirements, NPCs, Livestock(Including your horses, which has bonding mechanics, just like real-life),============================ Do You Recommend This Game?============================Yes, I absolutely recommend this game. I only recommend if your hardware meets minimum specifications. This is more kind of a game, which one needs to enjoy it while exploring and playing.================= Non-Spoiler Tips=================Here are few of the tips I found very helpful myself, and thus sharing it here. It may/may not help you in your game-play.1. DO NOT RUSH INTO THE FINISHING THE GAME - Sorry about the caps, but I've seen many players who are just in a rush to complete the story mode and to reach to an end. I would very very highly recommend do not do that. There are many side missions which are associates to the main story mission. What I mean by that, once you complete story missions(Marked with Yellow area) the side missions(marked with White area) might not be available later on in the game.2. Try to Explore the world  by Horse-riding - I would suggest to explore the area and complete your journey using your horse/s, and not by using fast-travel or any other types. Due to 2 specific reasons.    i. While exploring the area using horse/on foot, there are many random events you run into, some of them are really very important at the early game stages    ii. The beautiful scenery is one to fall in love with.3. The game becomes tedious? - Well, the game takes practical approach so it has to be tedious. You being the part of the group, you have few responsibilities. In order to make your group survive, you have duties to feed the camp(By Hunting), to provide the medical resources, to provide the money, to provide the guns and AmmunitionAnd the game exactly becomes tedious here, as most of the player end focusing just one approach. They either will try to finish the game and all the missions and later will end-up only hunting or fishing.Instead, I would suggest to mix and have the perfect blend of approach, here, how I play, i. I usually start from my camp in the morning by completing few of the chores at camp(Emptying Bucket full of water etc.) ii. Then I go up to campfire to have a bowl of stew, This helps restoring the cores and attributes iii. Then up-to horses, I start by cleaning them(by using brush or by riding it threw a water source) and then by feeding them. iv. I usually take 2 horses(one I ride and the other one follows me) iv. After that, I pick side-missions(if there are any), or mission v. Ride to that mission(by completing random events if there are any) vi. performing and completing the mission(this usually end-up consuming 1/4th of the day, so around evening in game-time) vii. Ride back to the camp site(again, by completing random events if there are any on the way back) viii. Interesting part, either hunt on the way back to camp, or hunt somewhere near the camp, This is why I take 2 horses out. Each horse can carry 1 big/medium scale animal(Deer, lambs), 2 small kills(rabbits, chickens), and then I carry 1. So basically on my way back, I usually have 7 kills and then end-up donating all to the camp. It fulfills all the camp food needs 1 go If you are reading this long, then thank you so much for taking the time out read it and I hope you find this review helpful."

Back in 2018, when this game came out, I picked up Assassins Creed Origins for my PS4, I was extremely hyped because I'm a pretty big AC fan, and saw this game on the shelf - full price - all i knew about it was that Rockstar delayed GTA6 to finish this game (which I'm not entirely sure if this is true) and I was like: ,,Wtf is this cowboy garbage?,,- And i picked it up...full price with the idea that i will hate itBoy I was wrong.This aint a simple game, this is a whole experience. I played it more than i played AC Origins, more than i played GTA V, more than i played Overwatch and Team Fortress 2.It has a unique way of getting you into that 1899 vibe, it doesnt feel like the world was made for Arthur and the gang, it feels like they're part of it- which is kinda rare these days in games.I got attached to this game in chapter 4, and i was slowly falling for it. I finally understood what was all about, and what they were standing for, when i was the most into the game....it ended. The end gave me the feels.I didnt really like to play as John, since i didnt play the fist Red Dead Redemption, but i really wanna play it. But it made me feel like i really lost someone, it wasnt like it died a game character- it was like a friend died.I played it like 3 times, enjoying every single mission and side mission, every stranger encounter and random little details, because Rockstar really knows how to tell a story and immerse you into it.On the technical side: this game feels better on console, i enjoy it on PC as well- but the true experience was on my PS4. Maybe its subjective but i feel like this is a console game. Even for a console it has great graphics, imo, and the atmosphere is incredible and very well executed. The light, fog, shadows are really nicely done.Online is kind of a let down. I really enjoyed it for a couple of months, but it gets too grindy, and it lacks content. It sure has potential, but they are not going for it for some unkown reason.All in all this game has a special place in my heart and, to me, it was way more than just a game, it was an experience."

Enjoyable main story and characters, and there are lots of side missions and tasks to do. Something I'm enjoying the most is hunting for perfect pelts and legendary animals. The landscapes are too pretty to miss so I'd recommend foregoing fast travel for the most part.My biggest criticism is about the game is Chapter 1. It's a glorified tutorial where you're stuck following your fellow gang members around. The real fun of the game is the open world so I hated the idea of being locked into what are essentially escort missions. I highly recommend making use of the cinematic camera to speed up them up.The performance is fine and I haven't experienced crashes. I have a fairly good computer (i5-9600k, 1660Ti OC'd, 16GB RAM) and I only drop to 50 frames when I head to a city like Saint Denis and there are lots of weather/lighting effects. I normally get 60-70FPS @ 1440p, w/ Ultra textures/16x anisotropic filtering and other settings med-high. I've noticed stuttering unrelated to framerate, but it isn't terrible.For those interested, my GPU clock goes up to 2070MHz and memory clock 13080MHz. Never seen temps reach 60*C"

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to get this game and see if I could maybe play alongside him. Loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me. Loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.Thank you <3"
2289,ZuriVolante,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zurivolante/,No,,1,29.5,January,"15,",71,0,1,"AUGUST 2022 UPDATE:I'm now using a new custom build desktop and everything worked perfectly fine with none of the steps in the original review. Launched just like any other game. For the original review, I was using an Alienware m15 R2 which used the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650. Of course, I did all the standard driver updates, which I didn't mention in the review. When I was researching the problem back then, I found plenty of other people reporting the same issue, which is how I found the iGPU workaround. Everyone seemed to agree it was a video card issue.My new build uses the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050. So perhaps Rockstar fixed the issue, but more likely, it was an issue with the video card the laptop was using, or maybe some other nonsense I didn't discover. And I could't swap out the card without voiding my warranty. Yet, I also noticed much less launcher ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this time around. The 10 hours of gameplay between the original review date and now was entirely troubleshooting and testing to fix the damn issue. Nothing worked. Moral of the story: don't buy a gaming laptop, build your own machine. It'll be cheaper anyway.Changing this to a positive review. Original review:This game uses the Rockstar Social Club Launcher and that causes nothing but problems. In order to even get that launcher to work, I have to launch it by itself and have Steam closed. Once I figured that out, I thought the game would work. Nope. It won't launch from the Rockstar launcher. It seems to try but nothing happens.I found that you can fix this by disabling the iGPU. I did this for a while and that's how I have any playtime. However, re-enabling the iGPU glitched once and I had to re-install Windows and set everything back up. I tried to get a refund for the game and received the standard ""you played too long"" response. So, now I have a somewhat pricey game that I can't even play unless I roll the dice with disabling my iGPU. I'll keep updating the game and the Rockstar launcher, but I'm not hopeful that this issue will be fixed. If the issue is fixed, I'll change my review. It's a fun game, but Rockstar using their own launcher is absurd."

The game was already sold 1 month prior to Steam's release and also discounted by quite a bit, yet we neither received discounts nor pre-order bonuses.It does render me a hypocrite to a degree, but I could not wait anymore to play this game. But bare this in mind if you consider supporting this company.Also remember that the online mode is built around heavy grinding or microtransactions."

I can't believe it was 5 years ago...Red Dead Redemption 2 is an unforgettable masterpiece that has left a profound impact on me. From the moment I started playing, I was completely immersed in the world of the game, and the emotional journey of the main character, Arthur Morgan, had me hooked from start to finish.Throughout the game, I found myself deeply invested in Arthur's story and his relationships with the other members of the Van der Linde gang. As the story unfolded, I felt a genuine sense of empathy and compassion for Arthur, and I found myself rooting for him even when things seemed bleak.The game's attention to detail and its immersive world-building created an experience that was both beautiful and heart-wrenching. The game's depiction of the American frontier in the late 19th century was breathtaking, and the characters and their stories felt incredibly real.But what truly sets Red Dead Redemption 2 apart from other games is its emotional impact. The game tackles difficult themes like loyalty, betrayal, and mortality, and it doesn't shy away from showing the consequences of the characters' actions. The game's final act left me feeling devastated, and I found myself thinking about it for months after I had finished playing.Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a truly unforgettable gaming experience. It's a game that will stay with you long after you've put down the controller, and it's a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming. It's a game that will break your heart, but it's also a game that will leave you in awe of its sheer brilliance."

Only in Chapter 2 but a great game so far.Edit - 6/30/2020 after having the game for about 5 months.This may well be the best game I have ever played. The story and voice acting had me more invested and engaged than I have probably ever been with a game. I finished the single player campaign almost two months ago (you can keep playing after finishing the story).Came back a couple of weeks ago, just intending to mess around in single player, and decided to try Red Dead Online. I'm hooked yet again and so many new things to try and explore as well as random players (good and bad).I often look at prices of games much like I would a movie for time/enjoyment factor. This is a great example of a game that you are getting your moneys worth and then some. My hour counts are always a bit skewed because I will leave a game running, sometimes for hours, while I'm away, but I have still sunk a ton of time into RDR2.Try to avoid spoilers to the single player story. I cannot recommend this game enough.Edit - 11/25/2020I'm still playing online fairly regularly. They have continued to release new content (some of it's not great but you can't win em all). Great game!"
2308,Loba ❤,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alineloba/,8,1,0,493.5,December,"28,",335,0,1,"Where do I start? I got the game for Christmas. So I've been playing for two weeks now. The game itself is not the problem. The problem is ROCKSTAR. There isn't one day that I played that I didn't encountered at least one hacker. And all you can do is jump to another server. Your hunts? forget about it. Once they start, you can't even access stores to sell stuff. Either you are being summoned somewhere miles away from where you were, and everytime the salesman is dead or disappeared. It's frustrating, it's really frustrating. It's even more frustrating because you know that rockstar is giving SH*T on what is going on. The ''write a report'' itself is a joke, since you can barely have words to explain what the f*ck happened that you had to stop everything to report the player. You know how I know they don't care? I'm pretty sure a lot of people that came to play RDR2 played GTA V, so you'll know what I'm talking about. Well...seems like the same bunch of hackers that kept playing unpunished came to RDR2 online. GTA was launched years ago, and I never saw rockstar do something to discover how they could even do such things and at least try to stop them, and after years they were still there doing everything they pleased. And they are here in RDR2 too. Alright let's go to some examples. I was in defensive mode, in tumbleweed (desert, south of the map), and suddenly was summoned inside a store or a house in Valentine (green mountains and stuff, north of the map). I was traped there aloong with other 'victims' of this hacker. We couldn't even control our characters, they wouldn't respond. Whoever were on horses? horses were there too. And then we all started to catch on fire, horses dying. Mine died. I was so pissed, at least I could know who was doing it, because the name appeared when I was killed by burning. But while I was writing the report I could, my character started flying and catch on fire, out of nothing. I tried to get out of the server but It was like I was trapped there, couldn't even get out. Took about 15min so I could leave. Another example: I was in Blackwater, in defensive mode once again, guy summoned A BEAR inside the store. And then more several bears around the city, and sometimes they spammed beside you. I look in the map, I could know who was messing around because the guy was totally red, and he was teleporting in the map. One time he was right down the T of ''THE heartlands'', second later he was right above Rhodes. And then he started to jump around the map. I reported? of course. But once again...you can't tell much in that JOKE that is the ''write a report'' field. Last but not least: I was hunting a bounty with my boyfriend. I was carrying the bounty on my horse, almost inside Rhodes, ready to deliver the bounty. Suddenly I was summoned west of Glacier (farthest north part of the map), and the place I was summoned were the outer part of a mountain, so I was almost out of the map and there was nothing I could do to get out of there, since everytime i tried to walk, I slipped more and more far out of the map. Guy that summoned me was there, and I couldn't confuse him with another victim because he killed me EVEN THOUGH I WAS IN DEFENSIVE MODE. At least this way I could, once again, ""write a report"".And yes, I checked out, I was defensive mode all the times. I'm not the kind of player that likes to mess with others, I always prefer to play defensive and stay chill. If you are a gamer, please...don't buy this game yet. The game is soo good that is addicting? YES. But the complete lack punishment for those who are cheating is even more FRUSTRATING than how good is the game.  I wish developers saw this review and started to rethink their priorities. Stop developing new ''limited content'' and ''season pass'' for some time, you guys need to focus on annihilate  what is spoiling your masterpiece...this is driving away players and future players."

Haven't really had any crashes either after doing that but I still cannot recommend this game due to the sheer amount of tweaking it takes to get it running at a stable frame rate without constant crashing.

The story, characters and gameplay all tie in to make it an amazing single player experience definitely worth the price, can only imagine how much fun multiplayer would be considering Rockstar made this and GTA 5 online is still poppin."

Not only it features a solid and really dramatic plotline, the amount of details in this game is beyond any comparison. From your first hours in this game you will literally FEEL much love and dedication devs have put in it. Lots of stuff to do, explore and complete. It's interesting, it's enjoyable, its fun. Overall - really deep and really entertaining, very much recommending it, worth it's full price without any doubt. - well, now it becames problematic. It's simply too shallow comparing to singleplayer. In general your gameplay in RDO consists of two things - missions and competitive sessions like deathmatch or races. Even so caled ""roles"" are basically sets of different missions, some of them are nice and interesting, most of them are your typical fetch-kill quests. RDO also has story missions, they are kinda okay, but nothing special either. What's really bad about RDO - its people, who are playing it, since in 90% of player interactions you will be one-shot instantly from a sniper rifle long before you actually see who did this. Which in turn forces even the peaceful players to behave the same and kill first to avoid being killed. Game is full of griefers and cheaters, Rockstar doesn't give a single about them, as they never did in GTA:O. Thus the same ""pull the plug"" countermeasures which worked in GTA:O are working (and recommended) here too. It's also filled with minor, but extremely annoying bugs, the game is really unstable at times. In general - it's playable, sometimes enjoyable but lacks any memorable moments apart from really toxic ones which you won't be really happy to remember at all.Thus, as friendly advice - don't buy standalone RDO, just buy this full version for it's Story mode in mind and you'll be good."

RDR2 is a phenomenal game but its PC release is atrocious.

There is an unresolved ERR_GTX_STATE bug which has not been fixed by Rockstar since its PC release without any present solution which will happen whenever you are playing -- typically at the worst time.  Not being able to play the game for 30 minutes straight without a fatal crash is pretty atrocious for a AAA release.As for Online -- the game play is boring and unrewarding.  The game feels hollow and empty.  It is setup to be an absolute Pay-to-Win microtransaction grinder.  It is completely polluted with toxic Chinese hackers who jabber on voice chat and then use every sort of mod exploit to teleport invincibly, blow you up with dynamite on the other side of the map, aimbot, etc. -- pretty much everything awful that happens in GTA Online.Not worth the $100 price tag.

2345,𝕯𝖚𝖙𝖈𝖍,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drewahicks/,3,,1,295.3,December,"8,",158,0,1,"People often praise this game for the masterpiece that it is, whilst others bag on it like it’s the most overrated piece of trash ever released. In reality, those people are just mad that their favourite game was topped in popularity, scale, ambition, and so much more that contributes to the hate. In this re-review I’ll cover the basics, Story, Gameplay, Graphics, Bugs, Sound design, and more.By far one of the greatest stories ever told, and it’s in video game form, how lucky are we to deserve this? Possibly the greatest bunch of characters ever put to gaming, alongside THE greatest performances, period. Every single person who acted in this game, put a level of love, care, and attention to their characters like never seen before. You play as Arthur Morganon an epic journey through the ends of the Wild West at the turn of the century. The moment you click play, you're sucked into the most gripping title cards ever put to gaming.   In these title cards we can already tell the type of story this game will tell, and it’s a gripping one. With no doubt the best writing ever done for a game, and possibly the entirety of media. The story will take you around 50 to 70 hours to complete on average, depending on how much you like the free-roam, which is one of the greatest worlds and free-roam experiences ever made. The story consists of multiple chapters each of which are brimming with life, originality, and a plethora of new characters introduced. Throughout the campaign you’ll experience excitement, adrenaline, hardship, anxiety, anger, grief, and so much more. I have never been so moved by a video game in my life. It’s by far the most emotional, attaching, and gripping story ever made in gaming and possibly in media.If you've played a Rockstar game in the past couple decades, you know the basics. Love it or hate it, this game uses the Rockstar playbook. The way all the actions and animations blend seamlessly together whether on foot, horseback, or interacting with objects makes for an awesome immersive experience.On top of the basics, there is a mind-blowing number of systems and simulations going on in the game. Everything from bustling cities to the animals in the wilderness make the world feel very alive. Both the weather and climate of your location have an effect on your stats. There are some basic survival elements like food and stamina to consider. Your equipmentcan be maintained for a stats boost.All of this stuff combined allows you to ignore the story for a while and go full on wild-west simulator if you want. However, the survival/maintenance is balanced forgivingly so you can just focus on the story if you want.Weapons consist of the typical gunslinger revolvers, however there is a huge variety of weapons you can purchase at gunsmiths, or find around the world. Each has stats you’ll need to maintain or upgrade for more accurate weaponry.The screenshots do not lie. The game really does look that good if you have the hardware for it. Every inch of this game has high resolution textures, well crafted models, realistic animations, and beautiful lighting. My Dad even mistook it for a movie a couple times, but after playing the game for hundreds of hours he now knows it’s a game.The design of the world also has countless beautiful environments. There are snowy mountains, thick forests, swamps, lakes, rivers, deserts, plains, bustling cities, and every one of the biomes looks gorgeous. I constantly found myself just standing on one spot watching the world go by and taking it in.All these contribute to making the most beautiful game ever made, all extremely well optimised which might I add.Like GTA V, this game will probably be a benchmark for future hardware for years to come.There isn’t really much to cover. The game is one of the most polished I’ve ever seen. Sure you may come across the odd glitch or two, but it’s nothing game changing like in a Ubisoft game. So that concludes this section of the review.The soundtrack is mostly instrumental with a few songs during specific story moments. It nails the introspectivewestern vibe. The whole score blew my mind, and it sets the mood all while remaining in the background. No doubt the greatest score in the history of gaming.The sound effects are amazing which makes for extremely satisfying gameplay. Bullets ricocheting off rocks is extremely satisfying. Shootouts are epic and tense all thanks to the sound effects. The sound design is nothing but spectacular, end of story.Here's where we get a bit negative. The ultimate edition is a 50/50, half feels like a cash grab, whilst half actually adds some cool stuff that seems “worth it”. All new side-missions, clothes, horses, customizations, etc, can all be applied to both Story Mode and Online. Overall, purchasing the Ultimate Edition is really up to you, but if you’re a madman like myself then by all means go ahead, it will not disappoint.No matter what your current opinions are of the company, Rockstar Games clearly know how to make a polished product and are fully dedicated to the craft. They clearly don’t hold back in terms of budget, RDR2 was and still is the most expensive video game ever made, coming in at a whopping 540 Million dollars. You can only imagine what GTAVI is going to be like. I for one am extremely excited."

2359,shez,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shezdogga/,No,,1,47.8,December,"11,",247,0,1,"My previous review for this game was based off of how it ran close to launch. Unfortunately I was one of the many who struggled to run the game without being faced with frequent crashing.While I'm yet to complete the game, here's what I can say about what has changed since then.Firstly, I haven't experienced a single crash in the 10 hours I have played since coming back to the game. Clearly R* has updated the game to a point where it is running much smoother.Additionally, the game would appear to be running better on mid-range hardware. While I am running this on a 6600 XT, I almost never drop below 60fps using my settings (based off of Hardware Unboxed's suggested settings). I have made additional changes as recommended by others particularly to make hair in particular look better, such as using TAA high instead of HWU's suggested medium, and additionally running the game at 1.25x render scale. Adjusting the TAA sharpening to a level which I find to not be overly sharp, hair looks much better than it did before and environments look incredible. Performance would appear to be better than it was at launch. You may find yourself having to adjust settings to achieve better performance, however using HW Unboxed's settings guide as a guide, you will be able to find settings that make the game look both as good as it can for the best possible performance.TLDR: the game no longer has crashing that plagued the launch and appears to run better on all hardware. Game looks incredible, environments so full and lush, character models incredible, much better performance than I can remember at launch. Of what I have played so far, story is great and it's well worth a revisit in 2021 and beyond if you can run it and especially if you were plagued with the above issues closer to launch."

I never thought that I'd love a game this much, it's absolutely amazing! I'm not just talking about the story here, the graphics, the music, the details, the world itself...but man, the story ""CHEFFS KISS"". You can tell that this game was made with love, and passion by overworked RockStar employees (no sarcasm intended). I never thought a game like this could exsist. You might think that I'm exaggerating, but damn it, I'm not! I cried for 2 hours when I finished this game (not the epilogue part, tho that made me cry too). Then I tried explaining why I cried so much to my friends, and I teared up again. I was more depressed, and felt very, and I mean VERY empty for 2 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ weeks, this game wrecked me! Ok, so basically this game made soft, but ♥♥♥♥ man, it's worth it. The side characters, every part of the side missions, every main mission, all fo the songs, every little detail, John Marston, and esspecially the one and only ARTHUR ""the GOAT""  MORGAN were absolutely amazing! I never got attached to a character like this. He became one of my all time favorite fictional characters. I know that the price is a little bit high, but it's worth every penny of it. Definitely buy this game, and not watch story walkthroughs, because it's a whole other experience when you play it yourself. I can talk about this game for hours and hours, but I'm not gonna. So just buy the fricking game, and enjoy it."

Go and play the Story, seriously, it is amazing.The environment is out of this world, the animations are insane and the way that you and your horse interact with the environment is unmatched. If you haven’t played Assassin Creed Origin and Odyssey yet, do it before you play RDR2, otherwise RDR2 will ruin those otherwise great games for you because the level of interaction that you will expect from AAA games after RDR2. (I played Origins before and Odyssey after and I know what I am talking about, I finished Origins but I couldn’t finish Odyssey)The amount of customization, weapons and items is very realistic and plentiful. The fauna and the way they interact with you and with themselves is breath-taking.But when RDR2 Online went live in PS4 it was glitchy and without many things to do, and even thou we were a few of us playing online in PS4, it wasn’t that great and we abandoned it after a few sessions.Now in PC, and after a year of Online content, with four professions and many more things to do, the Online is fun. Out of the 86 hours, easy 80 are online only. I had a lot of fun playing with friends, as Trader (hunter), Collector, Bounty-hunter and Moonshiner, plus the Online Story missions and the many random encounters that happen online, added the causal interaction with other players and how it may affect the outcome of the missions. I don’t know if the online will have the longevity that GTAV had, but it has delivered so far.Still, I can always beat the Story again when I got tired of the Online.One of the best games of the decade."

I find myself not being able to play it VERY OFTEN due to simple errors in the game that could have been fixed. Rockstar had ONE YEAR to fix this game and port it to pc. I genuinely think they didn't check anything as I have had to troubleshoot countless issues. As i am writing this MY GAME IS BROKEN. I get a black screen, and can't run it in fullscreen mode. This is even worse then GTA when it came out. Im so frustrated by this, because this game is so much fun. Sadly, Rockstar won't ever do anything about it because they are lazy pieces of poop. FIX YOUR GAME ROCKSTAR.Update: Okay, so got the issue resolved, but it took me all day to fix, which is not ok. A 60$ triple A title SHOULD NOT have these issues. Period. I don't understand why I'm having to troubleshoot my problems for a game that should be finished. The most frustrating thing though, Is that I was mad I couldn't play this amazing game. That is the main downfall, which is very Ironic. So I provided an update, but still don't recomend this game in its current state. It would be worth a buy if It was 40$ bucks thoughUPDATESo it's been awhile since I posted my review and my thoughts have changed (significantly). So first off, I have around 70 hours in this game, and I haven't even gone half way in the story progression. Also, the games attention to detail and graphics are astounding, and they amaze me every time I play the game. With that being said, i did have monumentous proformance issues with this game. But a few driver updates like I'm mostly seeing stable fps, including a new game update as well. But this game is FUN, both online and in story mode. However, I don't think that this game deserves to be 60$, since it took almost 2 months to have a stable game! So take that into consideration when purchasing this game, but overal I'm going to change my recomendation :)))"
2368,Zerotix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerotix/,2,,1,384.8,May,"11,",289,0,1,"This game is flawless.I don't mean it's without quirks and bugs. I don't think there is a game out there that has zero glitches or bugs. When I say flawless, I mean Rockstar spared nothing when they built this world. There isn't a nook or cranny in this game that isn't interesting, save for facing a wall.Let me start by saying RDR2 is a 3rd (or 1st) person action western. It has hundreds of thousands of lines of dialogue from an amazing cast of actors that make up not only the game's protagonists, but every stranger you meet around the map as well. The game offers one of the best stories one could imagine in a western setting. Coupled with a variety of side activities to do like hunting, fishing, homestead robberies, stagecoach and train robberies; side games like poker or dominos, side missions, and random encounters throughout the world. The game is so detailed, one could spend an hour wondering what's left to do, only to run into several things at once that give a feeling of having too many things to do, wondering which direction to go and what the outcome will be.There is also an amazing consistency to this world that is unmatched. Help an old timer fixing a home up by getting lumber: you can give him money, go ask for supplies, or steal the lumber yourself. This may or may not lead to the supplier not speaking to you any more, or maybe just until he needs your help fighting wolves. The old man and his sons finish building the house and it stands empty. Later on, a stranger lives there and builds a garden. Meanwhile the timber company you've been visiting are just about to clear the rest of the forest and pack up to move somewhere else. The trees making up that forest are now gone, and you get paid for the job. Or you could go in and shoot everyone, the house never gets finished, and the trees stay. However, now you're a wanted man!There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said about this game, but know that it is indeed a masterpiece. Decades from now, this will be one of those games demanded onto the next generation of consoles - along with Skyrim."

The sheer size of the map makes it so that travelling from one corner to the other, full speed on your horse will still take you plenty of time, and taking the scenic route will last you for hours. The visual effects, including the lighting, textures, colours and more are so perfect and encapsulating the beautiful parts of the world, on top of the more nasty areas of the map for what they are.The characters are all amazingly written. The protagonist, Arthur Morgan, is one of the best protagonists in any video game ever, with his character arc being some of the best storytelling I've seen from the video game. Every character has their clear flaws and strengths, and every character has something that can relate them to the player.The only slight negative I would have to say about this game is that the game play mechanics could have used a little polish before full release. At times, you may get annoyed on camera angles or at the fact that your horse sometimes will decide to go off on its own path, while you are riding it.Other than that however, there is so much to explore in this world and without saying anything more, go and experience it for yourself and you'll see what I mean.9.99/10 :)"

From the result I guess little effort, but can't blame them, after all they are doing biz which is making money.DO NOT BUY.Full of bugs.Below is for the Red dead redemption 2 online.Daily challenges some cannot be completed or maybe partial complete.Once in the game (loaded into the game world), go to menu to choose to spawn at other areas will give you infinite loading screen.Some missions buggy and cannot be completed.Some missions never reward you once completed.PC version full of hackers, just like GTA online.Even the game allow free roam killing, but I wonder what is the benefit as it let griefers destroy another person's experience.Take for example trader's role, going for long distant delivery, understand the risk reward thing, but imagine some players spends a few days (in real life time) to gather max 100/100 for delivery and gone in matter of seconds. This online is pure money grab, outrageous pricing of items, the game mechanics to generate money is you need to be online in the game for it to run.Tons of grinding if you like to grind endlessly repeating the same thing over and over.I enjoy some aspects of it, if the game is running flawlessly.The main problem is hackers in the game, they run god mode and or teleport to kill you over and over again.Is Rockstar doing anything to prevent it? I am not sure cos I am not their staffs, but it is truly disappointing.Recommendation: well with all the bugs and glitches if you can put up with it, you can try. Other than that I don't recommend it as the online is pure money grab and full of bugs, my friend was beside me when I played, he said"" looks like the online mode is still in beta version"", which I truly agreed even BETA version is already praising it, I feel like I am the internal tester LOL.If you are going for single player, well go for it, if you got the money to burn.Until they prevent hackers from ruining the game, and fixed most the bugs and glitches, I don't recommend buying this AAA game, which seems like a beta or worse version."
2398,Siihorsu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hquwhjher/,3,,1,83.7,June,"26,",138,0,1,"One of the most beautiful games I have played, hands down. The story that was told from this game is something that I really love, and what I do miss when I played Grand Theft Auto 5; characters that I really care and love. Playing as the rootin' tootin' hunk of a man Arthur Morgan really makes me love the game, how human he is, how beautiful the man looks while wearing his usual outfit...Aside from my crush on Arthur, I do really enjoy the game a lot; even if I complain on it a lot during my playthrough. Gameplay wise, the story missions do felt like you're directed by some invisible director over the sky who has an auteur vision that he wants to be EXACTLY how he sees it, and the guns are satisfying....sort of; if you get headshots frequently which isn't exactly hard since you have Dead Eye Targeting, but if you don't the enemies are tankier than a M1A1 Abrahams tank; same goes to you as well, as Arthur's thicc body shrugs off bullets like its nothing.Story-wise, I'm thoroughly enjoy it. It is a story about a man's loyalty to his family that are slowly crumbling apart due to the times and the awful decisions that they end up taking. I love the characters in this story, I love Arthur, John, Charles, and especially Micah. I always have a joy looking at the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ one-dimensional villain you can make, and Micah hits that spot well. I love hating the bastard, and I always found laughing at him, especially at the penultimate mission with Arthur, where Micah gets his ass kicked by a sick and dying man. The characters in this story are someone you like, and someone you can care of. It does take literally forever to finish, but I can assure you; it's worth it.In technical aspect, I found little to no problems running it on my rig; but your mileage may vary with this sort of thing. My current spec can run this on High settings at around the range of 45-60 fps. The controls on this game are a hit or miss. I do like the gunplay with how heavy it is, but your movements on KB/M are like controlling a tank, or a very fat walrus. Your horse controls requires some time to get adjusted on, but once you get adjusted on it; you still feel like you have little control on what your steed will do. Sometimes, as you ride around the countryside; your horse ends up circling around the road and hit the nearest boulder, throwing you off the mount and go tumbling down to the nearest angry wolf or mildly irritated bear. In other times, your horse will panic and you have to calm it down; but when that happens hope to god you're not near a predator or else you're gonna get mauled or eaten.With that said, this game is an experience that you should have. If you have enough storage, or a good enough rig to run it. It's a good game with a really good story, and I do wish I can experience it again like I had the first time."

In the time I've played the game I've seen more than 7 different ways for the game to crash or freeze on me. This combined with how absolutely atrocious the save system is in the game puts it on the verge of unplayable. You're not allowed to quick-save, you're not allowed to manual save at certain points (like during missions), and missions don't automatically save at certain points during the mission, in fact the auto save system that the game largely relies on saves very infrequently. I haven't had this much frustration losing progress and having to re-do things in a game since the early 2000s. I've probably spent 5-10 hours in this game just troubleshooting problems and re-doing lost progress. Some areas of the actual game play are good but could definitely stand to be improved, but if I were to rate this game based on the game itself I would recommend it, but I simply can't based on how much frustration I've had with simply trying to play the game. 7.5/10 when playable, 4/10 in my experience attempting to play the game."

Let's kick it off by mentioning the hackers. Although they don't harass you all the time, they're there, and can ruin your session without a moments notice. I have seen them teleport all over the map and they'll kill you endlessly, with no hope of escape. Another problem for me which is an extremely annoying bug, is the mount issues. I leveled up my horse to max level, yet every time I join a friends game or load out of a cut scene, it gives me a level 1 horse, which results in me not being able to keep up with anyone. The horse get's tired in about 10 seconds of sprinting and I either have to slow down, or waste a ton of money on tonics and carrots to keep up. The whole situation is minor, but it's complete BS I shouldn't have to deal with. Above that, this game has a complete lack of anything to due after about 10-15 hours, which is pretty bad for a ""sandbox"" game. I have finished the story driven mission, now my only options for replayability is to hunt/fish (pretty boring), do stranger missions, (which are always broken), or start a profession (Could be fun?). Professions require 15 gold bars, which you guessed it, can be purchased through the online store for real money. Pretty much outside of that, you can spend endless time in the dressing room trying on new clothes you can't afford, which will change your characters appearance. After that you are pretty much left with running around harassing people, or getting into pointless fights with npc's, which has no story attached, you just kill them and loot 17 cents. Lastly let's not forget about the random crashes, disconnects, and failure to load that will happen at least a few times per session. All in all I don't fully regret buying this game, because i'm pretty sure the single player story mode is going to save the whole thing. However I would highly suggest waiting to catch it on sale, wait for an update, or just play it on PS4 if you have one."
2419,Ozone,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ozone9012/,4,,1,162.5,December,"6,",680,2,1,"Amazing game! I played it first on a PlayStation 4 Pro so I can't say I was taken by complete surprise by the PC release, but having better image quality and more importantly, higher FPS, is  a bad thing. Now, regarding the more ... important part. The story and characters are phenomenal. Rockstar proves they are not capable of doing only over the top open world shooters, but they can take a step back and produce an experience much more realistic and grounded in reality. Yes, it does have downsides, annoying details which detract from the game, however these are only minor. For example, the main character will automatically store your equipped weapons after a bit of horseback riding. Things like this. Just about everything else is unforgettable. From the exceptionally written dialogue (which you can, as a player, initiate in different ways during both gameplay and missions), to the beautiful soundtrack that fits perfectly with high tension, or relaxing situations, the American western frontier atmosphere, it all adds up to a game you won't soon forget. The gameplay is, as expected, on par with the aspects described above, most of the time. Aside from the annoyances mentioned earlier, I do believe that shooing does get a bit repetitive even for a game like this, and the rules of the ""Wanted"" system are at best confusing and at worst, completely broken. From a technical point of view, the game is also a marvel. It sets the bar so high, I highly doubt other developers will be able to reach it, until well into the next console generation. Every (non playable) character plays their own role in the open world, they react realistically to your actions, they have their own personality and even unique dialogue lines you can initiate, or ignore. The wildlife plays so many roles in the game, everything from killing the player, helping with the survival aspects (hunger, stamina, deadeye) to playing a role in the overall economy. The physics are also, unmatched as of yet, as they can, and will, lead to interesting and downright stunning moments. There is a lot more to say. You can literally spend days and weeks forging your own adventures around the world of Red Dead Redemption 2, while ignoring the story which intentionally starts up slow and gradually building up to a spectacular, wonderful, tragic ending the fans of the series anticipated."

Also if your just looking for achievements hunter, just get em and then forget the online (just like i diid XD still i enjoyed it alot)Please enjoy yourself, happy gaming and god bless you all!!"

On my PS4 I have about 100 hours playing RDR2 and then got it on PC as well after finally getting an RTX card and a 1440p monitor. This is a game you can play both aggressively and if you are tired after a long day's work and want to kick back, play something relaxing. The story really takes you in, despite being on the wrong side of the law we fall in love with Arthur, an outlaw with flaws, yet still tries to do the right thing. This is my second playthrough and I will definitely be playing a 3rd time to explore more. You can get the rumoured Online only RDR2 for much cheaper (again, rumoured), but trust me, you wanna save up and get the story mode version. Few games will come close to providing a similar fulfilling experience."

Even turning down the graphics and resolution, can see pixels dying; probably beating my graphics card senselessly. I can't even request a refund because I managed to play it 3hrs (past 2hr mark) before it started to break itself.

When I first started the game,I though ""This silly cowboy game seems pretty chill"" ,and by the end of it I was weeping tears while being stunned over this wonderful experience. Everything is beautiful in this game,from characters that are so charismatic that you actually feel for them,to landscapes that are so beautiful that I actually paused my missions just to have a look around. The gameplay encourages the player to use the Dead eye witch is very satisfying rapid shooter ability,making you feel like a bad ass every time using it. The music in this game is literally perfect and heartwarming,fitting the atmosphere on every occasion. With all of this attributes combined, and the story being one of the most enjoyable stories I've ever experienced, this is one of the only games that legit made me cry. I'm still looking forward to discover different secrets in the story mode and to replay it,making different choices.I 100% recommend this game to anyone who: seeks a story game with one of the best written characters in fiction,is looking for an unforgettable experience shooting rival outlaws and exploring the beautiful world of New Hanover and New Austin, and for anyone who is ready to ride along with the Van der Linde gang during the year of 1899 seeking for redemption as an outlaw.10/10."

When the news broke that RDR2 is coming to PC, I was ecstatic, and boy, RockStar did not disappoint.The sheer amount of detail that has gone into the game, the world, the characters, is amazing. Graphically the world is stunning, the narrative and direction in the game is brilliant, and it's really fantastic to have a game that is not just about rushing through and getting to the end as quickly as possible.RDR2 was made for you to immerse yourself into the whole cowboy life, playing slow and steady, enjoying the wild west for as long possible, and partaking in everything the world has to offer.The single player story is absolutely phenomenal, and please, to anyone reading this and playing, do as much of the side quests, exploration, other activities as you can early on as it simply makes the game better!The online aspect of the game is also great to play. I know a lot of people complain that there is not a lot going on and it's boring, etc. but there's still enough there to make it very enjoyable, and if online does get boring, then start the single player again for another play-through!I hope RockStar does add additional content as they have done for GTA V Online as well, and they ""expand"" the online world with more roles, and more activities to further enrich the amazing experience Red Dead Redemption 2 already is."

2489,schwarz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asahinohikari/,3,,1,45.2,July,"23,",209,0,1,"I only finished Chapter 2 recently, for me the story is indeed Interesting. I won't give spoiler but I feel like the character development for each character (even the NPC's) are the best so far. The more I play, the more I interested with the story. It also has a dynamic progression where if you start a quest and then you just roam for few days and forgot to do the quest or you didn't do it in purpose, in some case the NPC who gives you the quest just do it by him/herself and then you can still continue the quest like normal.I have no problem with how the gun works on this game. My personal favorite gun is nothing other than Springfield bolt action Rifle. It has low rate of fire and very low ammo capacity (just 1 bullet) but have high range. The deadeye feature for me is just perfectly balanced (especially if I used it for hunting animals). Also The cool thing is now you can use First Person Perspective on a gunfight, just like GTA V. Personally it's 10/10, I just can't describe it with words.For a budget gaming laptop owner, I can't maxed out all the graphic setting, but in medium-high setting I feel like it's good enough as long you played it on 1920x1080p resolution, but I do some have problem on FPS (I still didn't get constant 60 FPS on low-medium setting). But hey, it's not a competitive games like APEX Legends, CSGO, Valorant, ETC, so I don't think it's a major problem for a meantime. Sacrificing FPS for better visual experience is also an option if you have budget gaming laptop like me. There's no doubt that Arthur is the badass anti-hero rather than GTA V trios. For an AAA Games I think Rp640.000 games (Rp320.000 on sale) it's good enough price to paid. Especially if you have a good PC, I would recommended you to buy this game if you like open-world games., the main problem is Rockstar game launcher. I don't know about other player but I feel like the launcher is high demanding on RAM usage, and I also feel like for an AAA games how about just make the account binding for only the first time we open the game, not every time we played the game we need to launch Rockstar game launcher too. I feel like it just take a long time for waiting (Especially if you don't have a good enough Internet like my country does)., for an open-world game, I wish for an option to skip cutscene when boarding trains. Seriously, after 3 times I watched the same cutscene, I get bored and feels like it's consumes too much time. I know it's great for immersion, but after few times watching it I feel bored. Maybe if we can Interact or do robbery when we boarding the train it'll get less boring., I played this game on budget gaming laptop, A Lenovo Legion 5 (Ryzen 5 4600H GTX1650 and 16GB's of RAM) and I still didn't get constant 60 FPS's on low-medium setting on Turbo performance. It only gets 30-40 FPS when inside a Town and 40-50 FPS on less crowded place. That's kinda sad because if I put on higher Graphic it has almost the same FPS (30-36 FPS on Town and Highly crowded area, and 35-48 FPS on less crowded place). I don't feel any significant difference so I just put it on medium-high setting. For non competitive game, I feel like 30 FPS is enough ""smoothness"" but I really prefer 60 FPS if I can get it. Honestly I preferred this game more than GTA V, the NPC are just better and more lively, You can greet stranger and raises Arthur's or John's Honor and do hunting. I know that GTA V released before RDR 2, but from my experience I already get bored on 5 hours of gameplay on GTA V.  That's why I would recommend this game for you to buy. But again, it's up to you to decide."

It is still a good fun game if you have patience but the realistic should be optional. For people who want fast paced game, devs should give a choice to skip chore scenes and allow fast travel at the beginning of the game.. For those who hasn't played the game yet, I would advise to wait and see if Rockstar will have a patch to tone down the wanted system or not.

Yes, playing in a posse in Red Dead Online is a blast.Can I customize my character? Yes, I downright obsess over my character.Why the negative review? Well, Rockstar has failed to update RDO meaningfully practically since it launched, but they have recently shown they simply do not care about this game. -  The daily streak nerfs make buying gold bars (real money currency) even more appealing.-  Players need to buy bounty hunter to start AND again to get the prestige.-  The Outlaw Pass is full of horse hair and camera options, when before it was full of clothing and objectively better rewards.Rockstar has said they won't add anything to the base Red Dead Redemption 2 experience. They released Online as its own standalone game for the money, but they will not add anything meaningful to Online unless something changes. Just look at the daily streak bonus for gold bars as proof; the nerf came out of nowhere, but now it takes two week's worth of time to get something like 0.1 of a gold bar per challenge when that used to be the rate for your first day. Oh wait, it came right before the standalone Online release? What a coincidence, right?If you are a new player looking to play Online, Rockstar is actively making the game harder for you to earn the things that matter so you pay more money.If you are in it for the single player experience, then by all means go ahead, but if you are looking at this with even a chance of playing RDO, you are only valuable for however long Rockstar can tap your wallet for as much as they can force out of you."

The rockstar account that I have and the game is making me sign in to requires 2 factor authentication that I no longer have access to. Currently having to remove it from my account, which if all goes to plan will take 24 hours from this point to actually be removed. The 2 factor authentication is not rockstars fault, but forcing people to download a separate, useless launcher that I don't want just to play a game that I bought on Steam is absolutely ridiculous and the root of my frustration, as if I didn't have to download it and sign in I would not be unable to play the game. Due to the sheer frustration this has caused me I would rate the game itself as a 6/7 out of 10. While the game is good (not my first time playing it) forcing people to download a launcher and sign in when I could just as happily and easily use my steam account is BS. Stop trying to make the Rockstar launcher work, its never going to work, it is just so NOT fetch. Edit: while the game is still held back by the ridiculous rockstar launcher I have ran across yet another issue. And that issue is pertaining to the save files. The game both simultaneously prevents me from saving at certain points, especially in camp after a save. Which leads me to believe it is autosaving. However, it is in fact NOT. Its just being another broken rockstar product and multiple times over the week I have lost hours of progress because it both stops me from saving, and also fails to autosave. The fact that the game came out when it did and somehow doesn't have a decent auto save is as ludicrous and ♥♥♥**** stupid as it requiring the rockstar launcher. I recommend purchasing this product even less than I did before at this point."

(you'll only get that joke if you've finished the story)OK, so I have played most of Rockstar's offerings, and I liked GTA5 a lot, but I never really got into online. Playing RDR2 for the first time I was instantly hooked, as I like story-led action and exploration games. The horse mechanics in particular were really immersive and I felt like a genuine gunslinger. Missions are varied, interesting and most of all FUN. There is so much to do, if you want to get full completion you may be looking at hundreds of hours. Taking it medium slow, I completed my first play-through in 100 hours. I was very moved by the story and could think of nothing else for a time. The world felt a little empty with that story behind me. I decided to start a new play through almost instantly, but then I decided to check out Online too. I was surprised to find Online also has a wealth of story missions (not as good, but then that's not the focus). Online became a total blast when I found someone to play with, and I still have my second play through to look forward to! The graphics are brilliant. The acting is second to none. The characters are fleshed out and interesting. It's funny, it's sad, it's violent, it's silly. It's brilliant. Online mode is also great IMHO even though I'm not an online games kinda-guy, and I have seen almost no cheaters online so far and only the odd griefer, who are mince-meat if you have another player with you who is a high-level gunslinger. There is a good community for both aspects of the game, and basically despite the high asking price even on-sale, if you want to live one of the best and most highly acclaimed games ever made to date, it's worth every nugget."

Very story-rich and has that really sick vibe to become an outlaw. Graphics are stunning in comparison to previous games made by Rockstar. However one thing is for sure this game is NOT WORTH IT at its current price. (Got it from sale for 30$.)Pros- Stunning Graphics.- Great Open-World Experience. (Especially for those more into story mode.)- Lots of things to do. (ALOT!!!)- Story goes depending on your choices.- The game slowly teaches you how to play per mission.- New honor system. (To keep your reputation fine from bystanders around you, actually fun to maintain from time to time.)Cons- Poor Optimization. (Even though I have a decent PC, it struggles to play on higher settings especially when DX12 is on.)- Random Crashing. (Not very frequent, by the time I bought the game it crashes on launch but I fixed it by running it on safe mode, from then on NO ERRORS occurred.)- Price. (Definitely not worth the current price ESPECIALLY without the special edition/ultimate edition of the game, suggest waiting it to lower down over time.)- Rare Glitches? (Very rarely during missions some of the NPCs get stuck to go to the objective, and every time I pause and unpause while on a horse it goes out of direction for a bit then fixes itself back, Rockstar, please fix.)- ALT+TAB Glitch. (Seriously annoying, can't browse through other apps whilst in-game without resulting the game to crash.)Overall I can conclude that this game is a masterpiece, its just that it has issues like every other game during early-release. I know that Rockstar will address the problems soon and they are trying their best to keep the game as fixed as possible.But still its NOT worth the price.~ Still love the game though :)"

And seems like a ripe ground for a multiplayer experience.The multiplayer part actually has you either join a group of other people and play together (the opposite of the main game), or has you pitted against other players in small/contained arenas (again very far off the main game).And any attempt to play the multiplayer game in similar lines as the main campaign experience, shortly becomes futile as the rewards are so minuscule they barely give you enough money to buy the bullets you spent doing the task. And are in fact a HUGE bore/grind. Not interesting, and not fun.I would much rather continue playing the main game past the end game sequence, or start a new game altogether, than waste another minute on the pile of trash which is Red Dead Online."

The story is well worth your money. The online is generally a dumpster fire of misery and microtransactions, unless you're particularly persistent.I got this game for Christmas, and having read some of the things that other people have said, it's apparently a miracle that it even runs for me. Personally I've only had one major issue, and it was with the in-game graphics settings. Apparently the textures apply incorrectly (or something like that) on lower qualities, so if you want to run it on lower settings you can't change the textures from ultra without them looking like they came from a first generation console. I eventually found a fix to this (Nvidia Geforce Experience optimization) but I find it hard to recommend a game that isn't working properly for everyone. (there are definitely worse bugs and errors than the ones that I experienced)Assuming that you're running it without issue, the singleplayer is wonderful, it's got all that you've seen in the trailers; it's got the hunting, the fishing, the outlaw...ing, the everything. I've just got one gripe with it: the bounty system. There's a key detail that the game doesn't tell you. In fact, it misinforms you. Bandanas and masks are near useless in most situations, as lawmen have the power to instantly ID you because of course they do. (thank you R*)Red Dead Online is what I'm really looking at and reviewing. It's starting grind is currently much worse than GTA:O. It'll take you awhile to get any of the roles or businesses so if you don't have friends, if you don't like hunting, and if you're not looking to sink a bunch of time (or money) into it... don't touch it with a 10ft barge pole. Other than that I'm only gonna touch on the combat, as everything else has likely already been talked about. The card sets that you can get (which give you a dead-eye perk + up to 3 passive perks) completely unbalance combat, making you nearly unstoppable with the right build, taking less damage while dealing more. To put it into perspective for those familiar with GTA:O, this is what it's like to fight against someone with a full hand of cards: Imagine... you can only get Bullshark Testosterone at level 120, it's twice as effective and once you get it, it's on forever... and there's only ground combat. --Who needs a MK2 horse when you can 1-tap someone with the first weapon you buy in the game?Edit: clarified something, less sardonic & rant-y"

2589,Lugal Unuga,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198975385770/,5,,0,11.8,April,"30,",99,0,1,"Beautiful, but flimsy, glitchy, superficial, and more repetitive than a JRPG. Atmosphere, visuals, and story are Red Dead Redemption 2's strongpoints, but the rest of the game is padded out with reused elements and easy but tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.For a game that offers so much to do, there is surprisingly little genuine variety.Take for example the lack of any meaningful interactions with NPCs. To be fair, the cutscenes can be really charming, and do capture the feel of a Western quite well, but everything else feels choreographed. Outside of pre-scripted scenes in quests, there are no dialogue options to speak of, save for ""greet"" or ""antagonize"", or (when faced with a moral dilemma) spare or kill. Just two options when speaking to every NPC in the game. Companions have a few more options, usually tied to quests, but that's it. The Elderscrolls series gets a bad rap for its NPC ""arrow to the knee"" repetition, but in Red Dead II it is the player who is effectively a broken record. Everything is scripted like a play, and no emergent behavior is allowed. Despite the technically open world, it seems strange to put Red Dead II in the category of ""open world games"" with actual variation (contrast the meaningful dialogue trees in true open world games like Fallout 3). Having elegantly limited dialogue options isn't necessarily a bad design decision, but Red Dead Redemption 2 was disingenuously marketed. If you bought into the hype and expected Mass Effect-esque character interactions and roleplaying, you will be severely disappointed.Interactions in general are limited as all hell in Red Dead 2. Other than grunting at people (either in greeting or as an angry prelude to beating the crap out of them), the mainstays of the game involve: 1. hunting and skinning animals or shooting and looting people, 2. picking stuff up for collection quests, resale, or to maintain your stats, 3. slowly crafting stuff at a campfire, or 4. undertaking quests. Quests are likewise limited to variations on a few themes: tedious fetch-quests, tedious escort missions, punctuated by charming but inane banter, either while riding to or from a mission, or in the cutscenes that bookend most missions. That's about it.All this would be tolerable if the combat system were more fun. It is fun, for the first hour or so. Then one begins to realize how difficult it would be to lose. The combat system is superficially satisfying but disgustingly shallow. Arthur's absurdly high health, ability to quaff tonics, and the deadeye autoaim system make all battles with NPCs simply a matter of taking cover occasionally or replenishing your stats when needed. If you're a decent shot and smart enough not to stand still in the open, you need not even rely on deadeye. There is no subtlety and scant need for strategy or skill. Arthur the nigh invincible cowboy guns down his foes with such ease that fights become a chore rather than an accomplishment. Dark Souls this ain't. Red Dead's combat is too goofy to feel gritty or meaningful, and not the right sort of goofiness for a Spaghetti Western, either. Frankly, I've spent way more hours, and had way more fun, in janky fan-made Western mods for Mount and Blade Warband, because they feel like actual Westerns rather than just GTA5 with cowboy hats and a better storyline.Another major point against Red Dead Redemption 2 is the AI. Not that the AI is particularly stupid (it is actually quite good in terms of pathfinding), per say, just repetitively implemented. The predictability of AI spawns and lack of variation in AI attack patterns is particularly irritating in the online version. I spent an hour on a spree near the pier at Blackwater, watching as the same pair of lawmen would spawn in the distance every 3 minutes and attempt to hunt me down, alongside one civilian NPC that would spawn next to me on the pier. Easy and boring.In addition, the stealth system is laughably poor and immersion-breaking when combined with AI spawns. There's nothing like finding a victim in an alleyway, carefully checking around for people, and then watching a witness spawn in front of you as you're looting your victim. The post office bounty mechanic is also rather silly.The environments themselves, while beautiful, are also rather closed. In fairness, the natural world is ""open"" and beautifully rendered with gorgeous wildlife. in the southeast, there are swamps and burnt out plantations. In the southwest, beautiful arroyos to meander over, red-gold mesas, and cacti. And in the north there are steep, unannounced cliffs and winding turns that send you and your wagon plummeting abruptly to certain death, as your tough-as-nails cowpoke shrieks like a small child. All in a good days work, and really funny. The towns and man-made structures, however, leave a lot to be desired. The atmosphere and art design is great, but there sure are a lot of closed doors in those little towns. In the story mode this is perfectly fine, but in online play it is rather irritating and immersion breaking to find Saint Denis only has a handful of shops you can actually go into, not much more than any of those rural Western towns.In sum, Red Dead Redemption is pretty and ambitious, but marred by tedious gameplay and misleading branding as an ""open world"" game. It is not worth the asking price of 60 bucks. Come for the atmosphere if you're a die-hard Western fan, but wait until it's on-sale."

The ride horse button is the same button used to tackle a stranger, which may cause unwanted police chases.Whenever the game gets alt-tabbed it exits fullscreen mode, which has to be changed every time in settings. I also got many lag spikes and audio cuts, although this wouldn't be a problem on a decent computer.For anyone looking to buy this game, I think it's certainly worth trying. It has many cool features like characters who remember your past actions, choices within missions, the ability to talk to strangers and the honor system."

Apparently I'm not the only one with this issue and all the 'fixes' just don't work. Rockstars fix just changes the error to 'Unable to start'.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games ever made. This game opened a new path to open world games. The world keeps on going without you, your actions have consequences which you witness yourself during your gameplay, the people and the animals are so real you wont be able to decide easily about their fates and your actions against them. Graphics are perfect even on low settings. Its a good optimised game(not as good as gta 5) but with my GTX1060 6GB i can play mostly on high with some mediums and keep 45-65 fps on 1080p. -NOW THE STORY: One of the best stories that i have ever experienced in a long time. Each and every characters develops throughout the game and you feel connected to them. Your main character, Arthur Morgan...no words. Easily one of Rockstars greatest characters in all their games. During the first hours you will be so bonded with him you wont be able to exit the game. PERFECT CAMPAIGN highly recommended with a solid 60-70 hours gameplay with tons of side missions,stranger meetings,quests,easter eggs,achievements which can keep you busy up to 150 hours more or less.-ONLINE: Its an open world public lobby(no private or invite only) in which you become a cowboy. Good amount of missions,roleplaying which is on point and a lot of stuff to explore such as guns,horses,clothes etc. Its still developing and not on par with gta online but its a different game. Didnt stick to it so much but i will give it some time.OVERALL: This is a game you should play because its a big step up to open world games and offers a lot if you are willing to invest in it. PS I havent played the original RDR so i cant compare them."

You prefer extremely fast paced games and prefer to just rush through them focusing on missions alone.Despite initial criticisms as to the optimization of the game for PC, as far as the latest versions are concerned, Rockstar seems to have finally cracked down on most game breaking bugs and glitches and you should have a pretty pleasant experience with the game now.This game, ladies and gentlemen, is filled to the brim with detail and interesting characters, Rockstar seems to have taken what they learned with RDR 1 and added certain gameplay mechanics to make it even better in RDR 2. Gone are the days when a simple shirt would suffice for our cowboy to make it through snow blizzards and hot humid bayous alike. You didn’t wear warm clothes in the winter? You’ll lose health. You forgot to eat while busy running away from the sheriffs? You’ll lose health. Yes lads and lasses, you have to constantly maintain your character and his inventory to make the best of the game. There’s fishing, hunting, crafting, cooking, the movies, theatre, gambling, drinking, bathing, looting and a heck of a lot more activities to keep you occupied when you don’t want to missions.Another brilliant aspect of the gameplay is the random/chance encounters with people. You’ll be amazed at the detailing and characterization Rockstar has done on these seemingly non-essential NPCs.Rockstar has further polished their RAGE engine for the game which has enhanced things like volumetric lighting, water and foliage quality for the game. If you think GTA V looks gorgeous during sunsets and sunrises wait till you see the amazing vistas of RDR 2. Swamps feel murky, humid and mysterious; the forests feel alive with brilliant lighting, shadows and animals. The major cities definitely feel as they probably did during those times, with the smoke of numerous factories dominating the air and beams of sunlight shining through them. A superb visual atmosphere coupled with brilliant audio work truly makes the game feel alive. Try to run it on high-ultra settings for the best experience.Yes there were criticisms about RDR 2 being not fully optimized for PC users, with many people saying that Rockstar has stopped caring about PC users as the majority of their sales come from console users. I am not here to debate about Rockstar’s business ethics. All I know is that slowly but eventually, Rockstar has managed to deliver a game which in its own right is unparalleled in content and gameplay. Yes it does require a bit of patience to play it as you wander around with your horse but if you love a great story and brilliantly made characters with whom one can resonate, I have only two words for you, 8 months ago i bought this game after saving quite an amount of money, i was truly disappointed when my game didn't even launch even after multiple re-installs and contacting Rockstar support, i refunded it and that was the end of it. (Hence my earlier negative review)Fast forward to a about a couple of months ago, i decided to give it a go again, to my delight I was finally able to play it and lo and behold I was instantly glued to it! Kindly disregard my earlier review!"
2605,Zwaynegus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zwayneurl/,2,,1,161.2,May,"3,",43,0,1,"solid game, great graphics, great story, nice gameplay. It being a rockstar game though there are a couple flaws, for starters as usual the campaign is amazing. The online portion on the other hand might have be born a bit early. Red Dead Online, like Gta online, is primary focused on subtlety making you want to spend money to earn items faster. In my opinion the economy is better in red dead once you start to get things like the trader role maxed out, then money is easy to earn and once you get bounty hunter gold bars aren't a problem either. (the same thing can be said about gta if you get the right business)Although they have reduced payouts of things like daily rewards and hunting since the beta. Another issue can be in the campaign but this is due to rockstars level design. The missions do not blend well with the free roam, they are still similar to the old linear mission designs, this isn't a bad thing but just be warned. Sometimes its nice though to have a heavily scripted satisfying mission thats linear after messing around in the free roam for a while.TLDR,The campaign is definitely worth buying the game for. The online has its moments depending on how you play it, for me the main attraction of online is having a clean slate so you can make up your own story and characters. I will admit though if you have a couple of friends who also have the game just like almost any other online game, no matter how bad, it will still end up being fun because your playing it with friends."

So strong recommendation for the game as of now.Original review before crash/stability was fixed :I am torn. The game itself has enormous potential to be one of my all time favorite games. Storyline, characters and quests are very well written, and the characters seem to be lifelike. The free world is created beautiful, vibrant and full of surprises. But sadly, as it stands, the game is WAY too crash prone for me to really recommend it to anyone... At least for now.On a side note, I really detest that you are made to install Rockstar launcher and create an account to a Rockstar ""social club"" to be able to play the game, even on single player mode. If I hadn't got the game from a discount, I would have refunded it immediately just on that basis.Game crashing this often combined with quirky ""checkpoint"" style save system (could be a nice touch to increase immersion), in a game with long unskippable conversations taking part whilst travelling to quest locations will just guarantee frustration.Sometimes game runs smoothly for couple of hours, and sometimes one needs to wrestle with deleting graphics settings files and verifying game files for multiple times to get over it.Hope it gets fixed soon, tho it probably will be too late for me."

The graphics are extremely demanding and even with the best GPU on the market, you'll barely be hitting 60fps average on 1440p (Ultra settings). G-Sync just makes it look  better and eliminates performance gaps. Secondly, make sure you have your NVIDIA drivers updated to at least version 441.41 to eliminate crashing, stuttering, and launch issues. And finally, don't enable DX12.

I am an FPS junkie, I looked up a guide on how to optimize and am getting approximately 70 FPS (GTX1070, 32GB RAM, Intel i7 4770K 3.50GHZ), really wasn't that difficult. As for people complaining about their Rockstar Social Club account, sorry you can't remember you used an old email. Crashing, haven't had any crashes.Usually I am very strict on convenience that a developer needs to provide. I would love if the game gets some optimization down the line, but as long as the framerate continues to stay steady, I am fine, it's the jarring framerate fluctuation in games that usually causes issues, and I haven't seen any of that here. Story draws you in, and is a nice slow burn so far to teach you the ropes. Can't wait to see how online is. I will update this review as I progress, but I am already getting a fantastic first impression that this could be in my top 10 games of all time. Felt the need to weigh in because the game should not be sitting at Mixed because of people either not being able to troubleshoot or having outdated rigs that can't run the game on High settings. Sorry but sometimes PC gaming requires some tinkering (again I read a guide here on steam on optimization, took 15 minutes), if you want to set it and forget you can play on console where everything runs on 30 FPS. If you have a decent rig you will probably get somewhere between 50-60 frames just running the game on high settings.Update 1:Still great, have had 1 crash in almost a week of playing, and a couple hiccups connecting to a friends session online. Have spent most of my time online now. I personally have enjoyed not knowing what to focus on and what things do. I have basically just gone out hunting, stumbled upon random events, and have been trying to save money to buy new clothes. Been a blast to play with a couple friends online. Thunderstorms are mind blowing, I don't know how they pulled off the draw distance on the effects. Seems like there is a ton to keep me busy online. Hopefully the missions provide plenty of action, currently they are plenty of steady fun but I would like to see a horde mode similar to some of the co-op missions you could do in GTA Online, where waves of enemies just come at you. Just in case there are some nights where we want to jump in and just start blasting. One of the rare games where I am tempted to get home and immediately ditch any responsibilities I have, that hasn't happened in a while."

It has a fantastic story, world, and an impressive amount of detail. If I were reviewing it on that alone, the game would be a 10/10 easily. But we cannot forget about the GAME part of a GAME. That is where RDR2 struggles. It's stuck in a weird place in between favouring realism, and gameplay. There are some aspects which are quite nice, including the cover system, horse riding, and firearm maintenance. Pretty much everything else feels tedious because of this weird in between state the game is in. The animation for picking things up is far too long and drawn out, really taking me out of the game, the walking speed is far too slow many times, resulting in long treks of boredom, and the shooting has this stupid sway that makes me want to avoid gunfights entirely. So overall, I would recommend you play RDR2, but I do not think it is the masterwork some people label it as."

It's probably also the game with the best story I have ever played. If you have think about playing the whole story (first Rdr2 and then Rdr) I'll recommend it, there will be a quiet different between the graphics, but you also have to think about Rdr is 10 years old. Rdr2's world/map is very very big, it's bigger then GTAV's map, so if you have a low end pc, you should be prepared to run it with low fps, I have a Rtx2070 and a i7-8700, and I run Rdr2 with 65-85 fps with very hign/ultra settings. This game is also about exploring, and you can fast end op using 20 hours or more by just exploring, so if you're the type of guy who dosent link exploring and search a lot of houses, this game is probably not for you. Now let's go to one of the bad things about this game. Rockstar have made Rdr2 very realistic, there is just some few problems/annoyiong things about that, let's say that you have bought a horse for $1250 (which is a lot in Rdr2) and you fall off a cliff, and you and your horse die, then you will not spawn with your horse again, you will have to buy it again!But all in all this a masterpiece from Rockstargames, I'll highly recommended this game to people who have a high end pc and love exploring and stroy games"

2689,Moon Illusion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonIllusion/,5,,1,117.3,October,"29,",245,0,1,"There are two parts to the gameplay in my opinion, there is the cowboy sandbox experience where you explore the Open World and rob people, hunt in the wilderness etc. And the second part is just the massive shootouts throughout the story. Now I love the Open World sandbox, and everything you can do in it. The shootouts are ok, and in some moments can even be great. I do think that the cover system is pretty dated feeling, and aiming your gun is sometimes un-intuitive especially since your gun aims itself by locking onto enemies. Even with that said though, I like it. I find it makes it easier to portray Arthur Morgan as a super cool gunslinger cause he is. This is what elevates the game past just something that you enjoy for 50+ hours you spend playing it. I have thought about this game's story so much in the past few years since I first played it. It is hard to put into words without spoiling the story how much I love it. My best attempt to speak it's praises is that Rockstar managed to have nearly 30+ characters, nearly 20 of them being apart of your camp, have them all be unique with their own personalities and motivations. Every character grows and changes throughout the story, their motivations might change, an aspect of their personality changes as well. Your character affects them in the story, and Arthur changes throughout the story. The story itself is one about friendship, family, insanity, revenge, love, betrayal and of course redemption. All of these aspects are done perfectly, and really resonate and makes you think long after you play through it. And the ending is absolutely perfect, which making a good ending seems to be a rare aspect of story nowadays, making it all the more impressive here.The sounds is amazing. Some of the best I have every heard in a game. There are so many examples to give that I have trouble even pointing to one sound I enjoyed in particular. The soundtrack is superb as well, the combat music keeps the rhythm and intensity up, and in some serious moments in the story songs with lyrics creep in the background making moments that would have just been Arthur riding on a horse have so much weight and impact.I don't even know how this game is possible graphically. It is too good to be 4 years old now and as big as it is. This in my opinion should be the industry standard in terms of graphical fidelity for realistic styled AAA games. The lighting and environments are also the best I have seen in modern games as well, the only games that come close at all are games like Elden Ring, and games made by Naughty Dog. If you have not played this game, please buy it and take a couple of weeks just to experience everything this game has to offer. I recommend this game even when not at sale, it is one of the few games that are actually worth the 60 dollar asking price. 10/10"

I am somewhat disappointed during my experience and if anyone is planning on playing just buy it on a game system. PC is not applicable if this issue continues to occur. I have done many workings to fix the issue but the results were all the same.Thank You Rockstar for the bad experience,"
2700,Gay Fungus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hugrf/,2,,1,602.4,July,"16,",91,0,1,"So since this game game came out, I've been very excited to play. For a while now I've had a lowkey interest in western stuff like cowboys, deserts, etc, and have even been (very slowly) attempting to write a book with that theme. I couldn't afford the game, both because PS4's are expensive and the game itself is expensive. So, I waited until it got on PC, and lord was I hyped when it did. I had to wait a while still tho so flash forward to about 2 months ago when my brother bought it for me as a surprise gift. I'm gonna get a little sentimental here because frankly I can't be more grateful sometimes that he gifted me the game.This game is everything I wanted for over a year, and more. I avoided spoilers and all content on it like the absolute plague, and really my only knowledge was ""cowboys, the main protagonist is Arthur I think?"" and that was it. And I'm really glad I did that cause experiencing the game completely blind was worth it.I like to state cons/flaws first though, so I'm going to do that, but I'll say the pros definitely outweigh the cons. A game this big is bound to have cons, and I'm not going to ignore that, especially with the one I'll list first.CONS- The hillbilly in the swamp encounter. Y'all know who I'm talking about. If you don't, look up Sonny from RDR2. This really is something that either should've been expanded on as an immensely traumatic experience for Arthur or just cut from the game completely if it was just gonna be... like this? It just seems like a joke at this point with how it's played up, and quite frankly it's disgusting. I don't want a damn rape joke. It would've been interesting if it was explored on a deeper level rather than just ignored like it never happened, but that's what they did.THANKFULLY though this encounter is optional, so at least there's that?- Linear missions.This game is linear, and that's not a bad thing, but... Well. NakeyJakey's video titled ""Rockstar's Game Design is Outdated"" does a better job explaining this than me, so I'll leave that there.Those are the biggest cons I'd say. If I have anymore, I'll add them later. I could say Micah, but then again he's a very well-written and well-executed character. Still hate him though. :3And now, the pros.PROS- Fantastic story. The story is about a gang trying to survive and avoid being captured and/or killed by Pinkertons after a ferry heist gone wrong. After that, I'll try not to spoil, but as vaguely as I can manage it: there are some ""good, bad, and the in between"" themes with the protagonist throughout the story. You choose if he is (or stays? idk) a bad man if you go Low Honor, or becomes the best he can be if you go the High Honor route. The way they do this, too, is something that I very much so appreciate and enjoy with how complex it is, how the character is, no matter what, not black or white.Also the story is the equivalent of riding in a shopping cart down a hill that slowly gets steeper and steeper, so have fun with that.- CharactersThe gang has a LOT of well-written characters that I love. Usually in stories there will be a character or two I'll latch onto, and I won't like the rest too much? But I /love/ these characters. Arthur is the protag, and probably the best protagonist I've seen. I love Hosea (and had a dream where I was Arthur and he gave me the most comforting fatherly hug possible but that's besides the point). I love Charles, he's my favorite after Arthur and Hosea. I love how incredibly complex Dutch is as a character. I love Sean, Tilly. Reverend Swanson is a guilty pleasure of mine. I love Kieran. And there's more but there's so damn many gang members, and it's honestly really cool how they wrote so many, all who act as a family (maybe with some exceptions, but they're getting there).- Pace & ImmersionSome people get pretty impatient with the slow pace of things but honestly I really enjoy it. If it's a world you can get immersed into, then a slower pace only helps that. Then again, I do have a lot of free time on my hands, so I can understand why this can be frustrating sometimes for other people? For me though I love it. I love the attention to detail, with an animation dedicated to skinning (and as someone who has done it before, and this is not a complaint, the animations are VERY quick lol but they're realistic enough and I honestly appreciate that), looting, eating, pretty much everything. Again this really helps the immersion, and on that note -- RealismGoes hand in hand with the pro I listed above. Probably one of the most realistic video games to date, at least so I've seen. I've even seen screenshots of the game before where I had to take a moment to evaluate if it was a screenshot or real. A lot of the environments look very real and gorgeous. Even the desert that you unlock in the Epilogue.The people look real. The environment looks real. Even the animals look quite real. Hell, your horse looks real. God I love Buell.Anyway I can say ""love"" 100 times more and keep repeating myself but those are my main points and probably everyone else's main points. I appreciate this game, it holds a special place in my heart, it came at a time in my life where I needed some of the lessons it taught, and also it's very fun :) I very much so recommend itOh, and also, you can punch bears. That's my favorite activity."

But the controls are so clunky it get's really frustrating to play. It's hard to interact with items and at times you're fighting your horse just to get it to move around a damn tree. Or you'll be taking on enemies trying to aim down your gun sights, but if you're standing too close to your horse your character will just focus on the horse while you get shot up trying to aim your weapon. The online game occasionally has server issues but looks like they've taken care of them for the most part. But when they do occur you can log back in to find all the resources you just spent time collecting are gone.Because they've at least fixed the online server issues, I'll go ahead and recommend this game. BUT ... expect to have some frustrating times dealing with the controls. If you can get past that, it's a pretty nice game."

Due to my experiences I would like to have seen more content in RDR2 instead of update to GTA V however some part of people can get bored at the beginning to find out this marvelous game because beginning of the game process really slowly. Even after I had finished game but I had felt like characters were my relatives for a long time. Naturally besides all praises I got some complatins for RDR2Story and all kind of stuffs are work fine but since the game released, controls have delay problem well this is could be hard to get used to with it at the beginning. For me at least unfortunately I had chance to play with low-med settings at acceptable fps furthermore it made me to have more delay problem but its okay as time goes by playing it. Another thing that I criticize is story ending. I mean with should this bad-good cowboy bar affect ending of the story? I have discussed this thread for many times with my friends but I couldn't find anything that makes sense for me. It's well-designed system for world events but it shouldn't have been affect ending. Another thing is our gang camp upgrades and etc. Gang camp should have been more highlighted to the game, I hadn't even stop by to camp unless I was heading for quest. But sometimes after quests ending lines you to camp to have celebration, it gives real mood to us however personally I couldn't catch the camp atmosphere much. Besides the bad sides I should explain good ones. I mean whole game cannot be explained with 3-4 sentences. It is totally package that includes simulation, action games. If you're looking for hunt, fishing game? just go for rdr2. If you want to find peace by gun-shooting? you could find the most relaxing shooting game ever in this game.And the last thing. This terrible content shortage in Red Dead Online makes people angry. I still don't understand with all of this fantastic atmosphere, graphics, mechanics etc. why would you let it go to stay game itself. No markable content update or ♥♥♥♥. Instead they spammed more content to GTA V Online. After Rockstar saw the big chunk money were flowing out from GTA V, they must have changed company policits for sure. Especially last three remaster ♥♥♥♥ of nostalgia gta games show us something went  and could be going wrong on rockstar side. After all RDR2 is great game.I hope micah's mom went to hell for giving birth him.9/10-1 for lack of content in online ffs"

They managed to capture atmosphere of different zones - from cold north, to hot south. It looks so good, that you want visit USA after playing this game.Attention to details is insane: animals and people react to character, camping, best horse mechanics and riding I've seen so far, world full of Easter eggs and events (some can be repetitive - one guy was 3 times bitten by snake). Modern physics - objects can be destroyed, fire from molotov can burn whole house, stones slide down from hills if you step on them, good ragdolls and collisions.World feels alive, especially in camp - reminds me of Gothic 2.Fishing and hunting can be addictive - spent 2 hours hunting legendary fox.Game can be chill\calm (one of the reasons why I didn't used fast travel) and full of crazy action with train robberies and chases.Crafting is good, but can be improved.I think shooting compared to other aspects of the game looks weak. It didn't go far from GTA - point, click and enemy dead. You don't ""feel"" weapons (apart from Double barreled), duels could be much more detailed, dead eye is boring - you press button, time slows and select targets for your character to shoot at.On the bright side - good animations, visuals and wound marks. Hats can be shot off from heads, horses drag dead bodies etc.One of the best stories in gaming. It makes you think not only about the game itself, but about real life and people that surround you.Cool characters - all made very well and interesting (different point of views, stories etc.). Atmosphere in camp changes based on events in game. Some are guarding camp, other are cooking and work on different chores in camp, leader is planning, and drunk Uncle sleeps under a tree."

I have not played any single player, only online, so that's what my review reflects: My specsThis game is buggy as hell. It constantly disconnects you, your camp randomly just disappears and then can't be reset anywhere until you restart the game several times. Doing the various role missions, other than trader, seems to crash the game about 75% of the time upon completion and you get no rewards. Randomly will get stuck in infinite loading screens. I'm playing with 3 other people and we all get some or all of these issues. For me, the random disconnects seem to be the main issue.Looking through posts online it seems I'm not the only one. I've tried all the various ""fixes"" people have posted (forwarding the dozen or so ports the game uses, disabling various windows network management features) none of them work. Which makes me believe the problem is solely rockstar's junk servers. There are also rampant cheaters in the game, people flying around through the air, invulnerable, one person had some kind of hack where if you aimed your weapon at them it made you immediately holster you weapon. Even without all the above, the online play is also extremely grindy. You want to get different clothes? Most of them require you to be lvl 50+. They don't offer any real benefit, just fluff, but you still can't buy them. You want to learn how to craft your own ammunition? lvl 70+. Better saddle? Pay real money. Buy better ammo? Lvl 50+.I've played over 40 hours dealing with all the crashes/bugs and am about lvl 24. When the game actually works, it's not bad. The bounty missions are fun, especially the legendary bounties. Just wandering around exploring is fun, general hunting/fishing and stuff is also fun. But the game is just so unstable that it makes trying to progress really frustrating."

2748,stmpunk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/profilealreadyinuse/,9,1,0,782.9,April,"4,",105,0,1,"(this is not a ""online"" review, for I refuse to even open it, I've read so much about how bad it is that I prefer to stay clear of it)UPDATE: Tried Online out, it's cancer. You either inject the equivalent of 3 full game releases in real money or grind for a month playing daily just to get started. It's garbage.Okay, I've endured a little further into it, it's a constant grind, at times whenever in any PvP mode, it feels like you are playing with 1500ms ping, some players make plays that seem like blatant cheating (but it could be the in-game broken mechanics, like allowing auto-aim for controllers), and to top it all off, there's this random and very common ""Error: 0x20010006"" which disconnects you mid match, depriving you from rewards, basically killing your efforts and forcing you to waste more time.Error: 0x20010006 can be fixed by using VPN as reported by multiple players, but any decent VPN that doesn't lag costs you more money.So, conclusevely, the Red Dead Online really is cash-grab garbage, modelled after greedy models like Korean and Chinese MMOs with ""almost-p2w"" and everything in the game focused solely into cashing-in extra bucks, with zero support or actual service being delivered to the players...Update: It's been a week since I've started experiencing the MP aspect of the game, and it's much worse than I've thought. The grind is insurmountable, the time it takes to do anything is ridiculous, and everything that's quick, is unrewarding, kinda buggy, and unbalanced. It is in fact, very very very hard to have fun in this mode, given that it's too strict, lacks even basic things from SP, and on top of it all R* insistently tries everything they can to push people into Microtransactions. It's possible, but unhealthy, to get things for free.Seriously, horses die due to glitches, so if you have a fancy rare horse, you're ♥♥♥♥. Opportunity heists are not opportunous due to this plus a massive amount of amounting factors.The game is cool for it's ambience, it's atmosphere, and overall it's art (including sound fx and it's Music, not just the looks).That being said, the game mechanics are all half-a**ed, most stuff feels incomplete or simply the result of incompetence pertaining the people in charge. In-game story-walls that basically create a loophole where you can't complete the game as the protagonist. Locked content before you advance but punishment for advancing isn't a really smart thing to do.What people in R* do not get (since GTA 4) is that their games are not movies. To this date their single master-piece was GTA SA, everything before that, and after that, is just dull. GTA 1 and 2, which were pristine, were not made by them. I've heard that RDR1 was pristine too (much like GTA SA) from some friends, but I wouldn't know because them a*holes never made a PC version (and I simply can't stand consoles). Still, I've paid a small fortune on this game, and it feels like a indy game going through some rough Early Access, all while the graphics, price and it's publisher and developer are AAA. It's just schizophrenic.I don't mind playing it a lot though, because I'm quarantined (in Italy), but I'd likely get a refund after feeling their clumsy controls given I'd be super busy to waste time in a game that feels bad (UI and UX wise), yet I've endured that only to find out that the game core design itself, surprisingly, is just as clumsy as the controls. Even Skyrim (2011 made by Bugthesda) has a better ""bounty"" system/performance with a couple of mods. I'd figure a game that came much later from a big dev like R* would've made at least something alongside that, but no, it's just the same clumsy system from GTA 3 to this date, with a few slapped-in scripts to make things seem different, but in the end it's all the same.Another thing that bothers me a lot is their saving system, the autosaves are out to sabotage us, sure, they're needed, and I mean NEEDED, because the game crashes sometimes, other times because you need to reload before a mission due to one or two things, but whenever you're onto side-content, the autosave will deliberately sabotage you by saving whenever a permanent in-game dmg happened, like your horse dying due to some ridiculous AI combined with glitched hitboxes. Worse than that is the fact that you can't tell the horse to stop following unless you are looking at it and focusing it at the same time, I mean, that's just lazy development. Even in Skyrim amateur modders have managed to implement more complex tasks to mounts in a game that isn't even focused on mounts. Bah...Adding salt to the wound, there are tons of unrealistic behaviors coming from the AI, because the point in this game is to make the AI cheat while you grind your a** like a fool for hours just to stay alive. Meanwhile a small town manages to summon an entire platoon of lawmen under 10 seconds, you wipe them out, and here comes another platton 10 seconds later, all of them having x-ray vision and as accurate with their rifles as Vasily Zaytsev. I've honestly killed more lawmen than there are people in this game. I really can't feel a smooth progress here, crafting sachels was a pain, a real pain, but I've did it because the inventory space is unnaturally small. I mean, they've piled up things to annoy the players as much as they could. Challenges locked to the Epilogue, killing the protagonist needlessly, etc. I'd rather play as the guy from RDR1 the entire game than being forced to switch characters. (and I didn't even got there yet, I've learned about this killing because I was trying to complete side content first so I wouldn't get bothered by countless icons on the map screen) Then I've learned that I have ahead of me: locked challenges, locked trinckets, locked outfits, all for the Epilogue, the question is, what is the point? Once I've finished the game, why would I keep grinding? I know I will until this lockdown ends (the whole Coronavirus thing), but other than that, what is the point? If you're not locked up at home, why would you waste so much time on a game you've already finished? Even GTA SA I would start anew, play stuff with a different weapon and vehicle choice, make a playthrough as a fat guy, another as a digital version of 50 cent, another as a skinny crackhead... In rdr2 nothing really matters since the character dies anyway, and you lose your mounts, so you have 2 choices, you either ""lock-up"" the game incompleted and do all side-stuff without ever progressing the main story, OR, you progress with the main story without doing ♥♥♥♥ of side content so you don't lose stuff (and time) with a dead-man-walking.Anyway, enough rambling, I'll keep playing, but had to get this out of my chest. R* is a really mediocre developer, even though they've made the most expensive games when we talk about development cost. It's impressive.PS: I'd even dare to say that this game is a prime example of wasted potential. I wouldn't bother playing rdr3 after seeing this poor port. Overall I think this game deserves a 4/5/6 in a critic score, for many reasons, varying on the overall reviewer quality priorities. If we take game design, it's a 4 (which's my cup of tea), if we take overall experience, it's a 5, and if we take more superfulous features as a priority it's a 6 (at most).Given that fact, and knowing how complex tastes for games can be, I'd say this game isn't for some people, but IS for others. So I do not recommend it, nor do I think you should avoid it. Just think before purchasing.What I don't recommend without conditions is buying any of the editions, just get the standard game, the ""editions"" are just a greedy move that gives you nothing in return, much like the in-game ""Get Rich Book"", the editions are a over-priced scam."

The game itself is a great concept and could have been one of the best of its kind, but unfortunately, in my opinion, was poorly implemented.If I could sum up my Red Dead 2 experience with one word, it would be: Hackers. So far, of my +230 hours in game, there has not been even one single day I've logged in without hackers affecting the gameplay in some way or another. Some examples are:* Teleporting everyone from the entire session to the same spot, at the same time, then blowing everyone up* Randomly getting blown up while zero players / NPCs were around* 10+ bears / cougars / <insert aggressive animal here> spawned by a player on top of my character * Players being invincible, with unlimited ammo / items, flying around in the air killing other players* Players teleporting themselves all over the map, even up into the air* Players using the above methods to kill other players then forcing the game to blame the kill on another innocent player* Even changing online ""sessions"" doesn't get you away from the hackers most of the timeI will admit, this review is primarily based on my experience with ""online mode"", but that is the aspect of the game which appeals most to me. Furthermore, ""online mode"" is arguably one the biggest, if not biggest, aspects of the game. I happen to enjoy the open world PvP this game offers. In online gaming, there is little that is more exciting than a PvP skirmish when you least expect one. The hackers just turn PvP into an impossible to win against scenario when there is zero way to fight back. Far too often, it also seems that little is done to stop the hackers. However, in ""Story mode"", none of the stuff mentioned above would be encountered. So, if ""online mode"" isn't your cup of tea, then by all means, ""story mode"" is a fairly enjoyable and relatively bug-free experience. However, a review should be based on 100% of a game, and unfortunately, hackers ruin +50% of this game. If they would be dealt with, I could fully recommend this game.If you can't play by the game's set rules, then why even play?Anyway, I digress./soapbox off"

Or the gunslinging skills.But despite my lack of cowboy credentials, I have to say, this game is pretty darn impressive. It's like a Wild West simulator, complete with horseback riding, shootouts, and even some good old-fashioned cattle rustling (or as I like to call it, ""moo-napping"").The attention to detail in this game is mind-blowing. I mean, have you ever seen a virtual horse poop before? Because I have, and let me tell you, it's a sight to behold. And don't even get me started on the facial hair options. I've never had so much fun styling my virtual mustache.But let's be real, the real star of this game is the horse. I mean, I don't want to brag or anything, but I think I've formed a pretty strong virtual bond with my trusty steed. We've been through shootouts, horse races, and even some cliff diving (sorry, Mr. Ed). So if you're looking for a game that will make you feel like a true cowboy (or cowgirl), Red Dead Redemption 2 is the game for you.

When I first started  playing RDR2 I killed people randomly and indiscriminately. As I went through the game I really felt that the story was calling to me to tell of how pointless violence is.  I really grew to like Arthur and I recall that near the end of the game once I learned of his fate I tried very hard to gain as much honor as I could so that Arthur was able to pass in peace. I felt by the time I reached the epilogue a really heavy sense of sadness.  The sadness has never gone away anytime I attempt to play the game.Something about this game feels so real and weighs really hard on you.  If I could point it out I would say the story is written well enough to display the cruelty and unfairness of life and how we all will be forgotten and left in the wind someday.

Arthur Morgan is quite simply, THE best video game protagonist I've ever had a chance to play, and I think this game might just best The Witcher 3 as my favorite of all times.

I played the original RDR on Xbox - the biggest flaw is that the earlier story is in RDR2.. I feel that is a redundancy. But what a beautiful game, that takes us back to the start and helps us relive those moments we were always wondering about. What I now wonder is, weather we'll play Arthur when Dutch and Hosea first met him? Maybe even go forward to Jack again and see what he ends up doing in his adulthood. Can't wait to see what more beauty and story we end up seeing from Rockstar. The game, yes. The game is beautiful, you can admire so much detail, and such enjoyable hunting environments. It has a crafting system in currently, but it's not like you can build your own campsites out of logging or something fun like that (I'd like to see that in a distant game).Rockstar could have quite a franchise here by maybe going into a full on ranching game, instead of cops & robbers for every game they make. There looks to be a lot of experimenting in this game with that, more so than RDRevolver and RDRedemption One. I am keen to see what else Rockstar release."

Visually stunning, some interesting mechanics, but overall just frustrating and not really enjoyable. The second you think you get to do something awesome, the game just screws it up. The game will take all the long range weapons off of you each time it reloads. So you are out and about and need your guns? Too bad, you have to get them from your horse. Sometimes you have to press E, sometimes it's R, sometimes it's F, even had U or H. There is no clear pattern to follow or get used to. Riding after a target? Be careful not leaving the track, your horse might turn or spin around riding off into the completely wrong direction and it completely ignores your input. Also you need to right-click to interact with someone. When you rightclick it centers your focus in that direction, so you will literally run or ride into someone that you just wanted to interact with. Or maybe you still had your guns out, so rightclicking will make you aim at them, instead of interacting with them, which will antagonize them or scare them off, so you can no longer interact with them. It is just so damn frustrating having some piece of gameplay that looks fun and interesting be ripped out of your hands as soon as you attempt it. BTW: Most of what i complain about here are actual design decisions. The result of it is a clunky experience where you don't get to play the game how you want, but how the developers envisioned you to suffer. Brilliant. Waste of money and time."

The game world is beautiful, characters interesting, story line both engaging and emotional, music atmospheric. Arthur Morgan is a great character. When I was a child I wanted to grow up to be a cowboy and Red Dead lets me fulfil that fantasy in a way no other game has ever come close too. There is not enough cowboy games out there  and nothing anywhere near as engaging or as detailed as this game. Play the single player and lose yourself in a story of regret, remorse and ultimately redemption. Then create your own character online, ride alone or with friends and make the world your own. As mentioned before, it isn't perfect. Controls can be clunky, there are glitches, and the online world has cheats and griefers like most online PC games do. It would benefit enormously by introducing dedicated servers, private lobbies, and more activities for players to engage in but its not as bad as many say and the community is generally friendly. There are always going to be a few bad apples in the barrel but you can always block them and change lobbies. The reporting system could also be improved and Rockstar investing more time and effort into improving the game and fixing some of the bugs wouldn't go amiss. They don't seem to care about it much and focus on a corporate model by pushing sales of gold and making tasks grindy with little reward. But none of these flaws detract from the overall experience.

The benchmark was not very representative of the quality I actually get in game. One of the most infuriating issues I've encountered is that both the Vulkan and DX12 graphics APIs seem to be broken in different ways, so I have to chose which problem I want to deal with. Vulkan doesn't allow me to see my mouse cursor, so navigating menus is a nightmare, while DX12 does seem to have a cursor, but treetops flicker in and out of existence to the point of it being nauseating when riding by on horseback. In my first few hours of play the game crashed infrequently and ran acceptably, at this point in the game I am experiencing consistent crashes that have made the game effectively unplayable. I have 2 story critical missions available, and they both reliably crash at the same part every time I have attempted them.  While this game may work fine for some, in my experience it has revealed itself to be a broken mess that at the best of times I would describe as ""somewhat functional"". Most of the time though the frustration with the litany of issues this game has outweighed any redeeming characteristics in my opinion."

A beautifully realized and realistic world that truly feels alive, probably more so than any other game I've ever played. I don't know if I ever used fast travel because I wanted to see what I'd encounter as I rode between the towns. It truly does feel like a living, breathing world and is absolutely outstanding on this level.The story is also quite good. A gang of outlaws, of which you are part of, following a strained leader through a series of hard times. You meet many interesting characters, partake in tons of missions, and get drawn in to the well-woven story about Arthur and his struggles.Even completely ignoring the online functions, there's such a huge breadth of content here that you'll get more than your money's worth in gaming hours.I really can't recommend this enough."

Griefing is fairly common, cheating isn't nearly as rare as it ought to be, and you're left with absolutely zero power to control your exposure to this.

To solve this problem, I recommend playing in borderless fullscreen, although the UI may be pushed too far to the left and right of the monitor. In fullscreen, the UI is placed in the middle, which is much more comfortable.Aside from this issue, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an incredibly beautiful game with a well-developed storyline. Every detail, voice line, and mechanic in the game is thoughtfully developed, just as if an enormous amount of work has been put into it. Story mode is great, don't make your decision on first start the game, it gets more and more interesting with changes.Iit is definitely worth time spent."

Red Dead Redemption 2 could stand toe to toe with any of the greats. Between the vastly expansive and seemingly alive map, to the incredible attention to detail that Rockstar has become notorious for. But above all, the graphics are absolutely breathtaking. Every face has emotion, the shadows are so well done that at times this game can seem almost like a movie. If you have been thinking about playing this game, disregard any experience you've had with a Rockstar title and just jump in, I promise you you'll absolutely love it. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention that the incredibly detailed and addictive story to this game is roughly ~70hrs, that is if you don't get caught up with the endless side missions, activities, and hell just sight seeing. 120 hours in on my first playthrough and I can already promise I'll be playing through this title time and time again for years to come."

There are some issues like crashes, but nothing game breaking.For the online part: there are tons of content, pvp events, roles, daily challenges etc. But without scripted events of single player mode, online version of the world itself (free roam) feels a bit empty. There is also no such thing as p2w as people complain.. You just jump in everyday, do your dailies and you get everything you need in no time. PvP is mostly skill based: if you are good with your aim, then rank or any consumables doesn't really matter. All it takes is a single head shot. There are cheaters here and there, you just avoid them and you are good. Connection issues are also there, sometimes it ruins your missions, but since no mission lasts more than 5-10 minutes it is negligible.To sum up: RDR2 is clearly one of the best game ever released."

Perhaps I should have given it a few months (or years) instead.I can launch the game, so that's a good start considering so many people had issues with the launcher.  I read a number of articles about how best to configure the game for stability, looks and frame rate.  Once configured, I ran the benchmark on my i9-9900k with an RTX 2080.  It ran well with a resulting 84 fps average.That's where the good news stopped.  Trying to play the game results in constant crashes.  I can't play more than 5 minutes without it crashing.With over 2 dozen AAA titles installed I don't have an issue with any of them crashing.  Ever.This title is still broken.

Entire sidequests can be rendered pointless with no reward for making the wrong decision, or a mistake, with no way to undo besides reloading an older save. Some interesting encounters can be lost and difficult/impossible to find again if you die during the encounter.-Some parts are ""too realistic"" Example: Cougars are stealthy and instantly kill you. This can happen while you're out trying to track a legendary animal or doing something else important.-Very long horse rides that require constantly tapping the same key in a rhythm to reduce travel time. Game could've used more fast travel points-Not much weapon variety. You can fully customize your initial revolvers and not much will ever be better than those.For the above reasons, I definitely recommend playing through the main story and hitting up any side quests you come across, but I can only recommend doing legendary hunting and tertiary objectives(bounty hunting is the best if you want to do any of them) for completion if you absolutely hate yourself."

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a really engaging story and game. Like Rockstar Games hit Grand Theft Auto V the game uses its surroundings and story missions to make cool action events. The large map lets you see side events and other side quests making the world feel more alive. Red Dead Redemption 2 has an amazing story and great gameplay and I strongly recommend playing this game.[MULTIPLAYER]Red Dead Online is not as good as its story but still has up's. The game is best when going through the story with your friends working out how to finish the mission. unlike grand theft auto online the game lets you complete the story without any paywalls.

The story mode is SUPER fun, great acting, cool side stories, enough to keep me satisfied. It's an outstanding game, considering you have the hardware to support it. However, Rockstar is still running this game on PC like an Xbox game with zero **** given about getting up to par with PC gamers. Online mode crashes all the time. The software is not friendly with my machine, which is a top notch gaming computer, and I wonder if other people have this issue? I'm getting up to 94 C and that is likely because the software sucks and hasn't been made to be compatible with PC. No other game do I have a problem with this. Also, the people who play online are racist to black characters,  and the whole thing is just a huge cash grab from Rockstar, who could really give a **** if this software runs smoothly or not.

It's not a bad game, it looks and sounds stunning, the world is astonishing and the story it tells is fascinating. However the open world loses a lot of its purpose as soon as you realize how restrictive the game really is. You would expect that such a massive world created in a modern game engine would let you do whatever you want and see what happens, but unfortunately that's not the case. Instead this game is stuck in this ""worst of both worlds""-state where it's frustratingly realistic about aspects one couldn't care less about, while not being realistic enough in actual fun or productive ways. Note: Some things might only apply to red dead online, as I've spent far more time there.Examples:1. Nearly everything you do needs to go through some detailed but lengthy animations. Sounds okay at first, but when you're stealing some supplies and an angry mob of workers is after you you're still going through the same long animation when stowing the supplies on your horse as if you were just out in the wilderness with all the time in the world, as if your character wanted to be beat up by them. At least give us hastier animations for heated situations.2. You can lasso stuff ranging from enemies to animals and you can even drag corpses behind you while riding, however you'll soon come to realize that you can't do that with anything you want, but rather only the stuff Rockstar Games wants you to lasso. You can drag a deer carcass behind you, but not a coyote one. You can drag a dead bounty target behind you, but not a hogtied one. The physics engine is clearly able to let me do whatever I want, yet I'm not allowed. And please game let me be stupid and lasso a tree branch while riding at full speed to dismount myself! You don't need to hold my hand all the time, the massive aim assist on the lasso is already enough to make me feel like I'm barely responsible for a good throw.3. Many animals spawn in pre-determined locations and it doesn't take long for the player to notice. One could argue an eagle has a favorite spot on this very bridge it often sits on, however I can kill the eagle and there will be another one in the exact same spot, reacting the exact same way the next time I approach. Plants and lootable items are the same. Everything is pre-determined and a more dynamic spawn system could really add a lot more atmosphere here. I'd love to find some mushrooms in unexpected places because the spawn mechanism instead of having pre-determined locations would use semi-simulated temperature, humidity, sun/weather conditions and so on to determine where they appear. I wouldn't mind if a bird sits in an awkward spot every once in a while if that meant they could in theory sit everywhere, regardless of where Rockstar thinks they look good.4. During missions or encounters it's a coin flip whether or not you can still do any side activity. You might still be able to buy ammo, but anything else you really just have to pray for.5. Horse physics and AI are really hit or miss. A lot your horse can do makes absolutely no sense, yet sometimes the tiniest rock on the ground gets your horse in the mood to come to a full stop. Usually the AI will try to avoid collisions, except when the horse feels like needlessly running into things and sometimes the AI will make it feel like you have very little actual control over the horse, which can often even be the cause for crashes.6. The honor and wanted systems aren't really smart, impactful or interesting. I can murder people regularly and easily make up in the honor system just by taking proper care of my horse and being resourceful with the animals I hunt. When you commit a crime with witnesses around they will usually report it and get you wanted. Unfortunately this witness system is kind of a mess. I can be in the middle of nowhere and kill someone who happened to just ride by. The game will now try really hard to spawn another person nearby just so they can be a witness and get me in trouble. This has happened way too often to be just a coincidence. Furthermore apparently witnesses are just impossibly sharp, because somehow they can look at a dead body and tell whether they were innocents that I murdered or criminals who tried to kill me. Speaking of honor, how do murders that no one knows of affect my honor? And why is it not murder if I kill what the game considers enemies during a mission or activity? Why is it okay to kill the people who ambushed me, but if I sit on one of their horses for one second it's horse theft? None of this makes sense, but fear not, the honor system is pretty pointless anyways and the wanted system doesn't even try to make it subtle when it spawns another set of law enforcers right in front of you when you were just about to lose them.7. Your inventory makes no sense. You are only allowed to hold a certain amount of each item, so if you kill 10 wolves you won't be able to hold more of their meat, yet if you kill just basically any other type of animal you can carry their meat just fine, because it's a different type. Or you can have 10 cooked meat seasoned with oregano, 10 seasoned with thyme and 10 seasoned with mint but you can't carry 11 uncooked pieces. No biggie, but still odd.8. No consistency. There are campfires you can use to cook and ones that somehow don't inherit the super power of heating up food. Want to see what happens when you put your horse on a train? Well too bad, it's just not possible. You want to put up your camp here? Well we can't do 'here' but we can do nearby, on the next spot we deem 'valid'. Want to sit on this bench? Sorry this one isn't suitable for sitting, try one in a saloon. You want to approach this mission in a slightly different way than we intended for you? Sorry, can't have that. You want to stow animal carcasses on a wagon not specifically meant for the player to do this? Well you can try, but our animations and physics will make it as hard and glitchy for you as they possibly can. You're hunting multiple animals from a herd? Better make sure not to run too far, because otherwise we'll despawn the animals you already killed! Sorry you can only pull out your fishing rod while standing directly next to water and when you do you lose the ability to run until you put it back in your pocket, too bad.And then on top of all this there are still plenty bugs and small annoyances. I'll go ahead and say that I don't like the gunplay in Rockstar Games since GTA IV. The aiming feels sluggish and delayed and in a lot of cases it just seems like it's truly balanced around controller+auto aim. PvP isn't very fun either in my opinion and just the slow nature of the game in general, where realistic character movement and behavior is way more important than player control doesn't really suit me. Instead of me having control of a character it most of the times feels like the character and game has control over me, where certain actions and animations need to play before I get my control back. Selecting weapons or fending off charging enemies in melee range, none of that really feels like I'm the one doing it. I'm just waiting/hoping for the prompts to show up and hit the buttons, often times not entirely sure how I even got a certain action from my character to occur. I just wish we could go back a little more to how things used to be in for instance GTA: San Andreas, where I select a weapon with the scroll wheel and it's simply selected. I can select it basically at any time, I don't have to wait for certain animations to finish before I can select it. If I get hit in melee I don't have to select it again. And when I move it feels like my character is responding immediately to my inputs. I don't mean we need to scrap everything we got since then, because in a lot of ways the newer games are also a lot better, but just dial back that realism slider a little more back toward direct player control."

Anyway, along with all that the scenery in this game is stunning and you might just be prone to wandering about for an hour or two soaking up the place.

Arthur Morgan is easily Rockstar best protagonist in a video game and for me is the best protagonist in any game ever. His character arc is compelling and emotional, and the actor did an amazing job voicing him. The open world is the most believable and alive open world I've ever seen and I have played a lot of them. The amazing attention to details that Rockstar put into the map as well as the AI that is head and shoulders above other open world games is present and better than ever in RDR2. Hunting and fishing in this game can be as fun as hunting and fishing in full fledged sims. There is an absurd amount of mini games and customisation that keeps you immersed into the game.in conclusion, this game is a masterpiece unlike anything we have ever seen before and definitely something I would highly recommend"

It's a good game, but has the same qualities and issues as the Grand Thief Auto games.Pros:-Graphics are crazy good, I have a high end computer and all I can say is ""wow"".-Voice acting is done well, and there is more spoken dialog in this game than the whole Lord Of The Rings trilogy.-Social ""AI"" done well. The way other character interact with you seems natural. Really notice this at the camp.-World is large. Well setup for a period piece game.Cons:-Missions seem to be too much alike. Due to the restrictions of being a period piece, they can only do so much. Also honestly, this is a flaw of the ""GTA"" formula. -Illusions of choice, the game has an ""honor"" system. Do good things it goes up, bad things it goes down. Doesn't seem to make much difference however, other than shop prices. Plus, when you do the story missions you are locked in, and pretty much act like a murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. However your honor is unaffected by these missions. So you rob a bank and kill swarms of police? No worries. Loot a dead body in cave with no one seeing you? Honor goes down.Overall, a good game but held back by the limits of the ""GTA"" formula. I also think they had planned to make this game have more depth but never got to that point. Prime example is the camp. It's implied you need to collect money for it and can use this cash for various upgrades to the camp. For the most part it's a total waste of time. In fact, the whole camp maintenance system is made to appear to be important, but really does very little. The game also suffers a horrible enjoyment curve. The first half is crazy good, then once you realize it's not really going anywhere and your on a rinse and repeat cycle for here on in, it goes from crazy good, to just ok."

The creators must have poured their hearts and souls into this game, because I felt it in every line of dialogue, every animal and every placed tree and rock.

The story and circumstances surrounding him made me feel connected to him, even as he/I was mowing down hundreds and hundreds of people with guns. To me his is a top 5 character of all time.The horse riding will ruin every other video game horse for me, nothing matches it and nothing ever will for a long long time.

But the story / campaign and gameplay is good too.  A step up from RDR1 for sure. Online is questionable at times, definitely would recommend with another player. Its still fun but i feel like RDR1 online was a better game for online mode. I think single player is great but wouldn't really hesitate to recommend both. I would definitely say single player is more enjoyable / better long term then online but as said, both are fun."

On the one hand, the writing is brilliant and many of the characters are colorful and endearing, making some of the stories through the game very moving. The scenery in some places is gorgeous, the hunting, fishing, and exploration aspects of the game are amazing, with many of the best stories simply lying in wait around the world. My favorite two involve a Chicagoan widow and a Balkan inventor, who both live in the northeast corner of the map. On the other hand, there are multiple moments throughout the game when the player is robbed of their agency in order to create a ""cinematic"" experience, and that's the crux of it. RDR2 is equal parts movie and game: each half is done well, but on several occasions the two clash and it absolutely sucks to play in those moments. If the writing weren't good, I would have stopped playing the story completely. Still, you can't help but get emotionally invested in the lives of Arthur and the gang, even if the twists are predictable.3/4"

GTA Online seems stable compared to this. Lots of random disconnects that boot you out of multiplayer. I can't progress the online story missions as they disconnect me before the end of the mission only for me to completely retry the mission from the beginning. I have yet to finish this 1 mission.Free-roam is more stable than missions, with hardly any disconnects happening.When I first got the game, I had a lot of trouble trying to start it up. It would crash on startup and you have to go online to see the fixes.Having to frequently delete rockstar launcher files just to boot this game up from Steam is pure frustration.I have deleted this game and will not return until significant patches that address the stability of the game and its online aspect."

It plays like an indie game developer rather than AAA. Until more content (Criminal, Heists) is added, better anti-cheat software is implemented, and bugs are fixed...I don't recommend buying full price just to play Online.Another note, don't listen to Youtubers, Gold and Money Online is very easy to earn. Got all Roles, Black Arabian Horse, Cosmetics, and Business Upgrades in under these 300 Hours. Where some have claimed it took 300 Hours to get 1 Horse.

For me, this has got to be the GREATEST OPEN WORLD VIDEO GAME in the HISTORY. I don’t know where to begin! First of all the game is a masterpiece and have the best story Rockstar have produced yet. RED DEAD ONLINE is what makes this game my favourite. There are incredibly beautiful landscapes, beautiful horses and incredible graphics, a huge open world with other players and animals, but all this dilutes a big minus because of the the developers, for some reason they do not update the game as they give updates to GTA ONLINE and they barely add anything new, the missions are quite monotonous, deliver or steal goods while fighting off the bandits, but the game is truly golden, it lacks attention and updates, I hope this game is does not die due to lack of support towards it."

Changed from ""wouldn't recommend"" to ""would recommend"". The single player story is one of the best parts of this game, so if you're looking at it for that reason, absolutely pick it up. That alone is worth the price tag if single player RPG and one of the best western stories out there appeals to you. The online multiplayer part of the game is where the trouble begins: it is littered with a lot of bugs while hackers run rampant. The hacker problem seems more common than GTAV, or at least that's been my experience. Every day I've logged on to play, I've encountered 1-3 hackers who do things from spawning cougars/bears on top of you, to spawning tornadoes of dynamite around you. Once got attacked by a two-headed skeleton which was at least funny at the time but only shows how far this issue has gotten.As far as the bugs, I've read things like fishing lures having a chance to just ""disappear"" and have experienced skins/pelts disappearing frequently. Animal carcasses also vanish off my horse, though that's a more rare occurrence. As soon as an animal is skinned, the pelt vanishes. I've encountered weird glitches where a friend sees my character being attacked by the town's guards on their screen, but the town is empty on my screen. The game definitely has some kinks that need to be worked out.As of now the online multiplayer part of the game hasn't received a proper update in quite some time, but the good news is that Rockstar has recently revealed an upcoming update with a new role. It was a bit of a meme in the community with dressing up as clowns in response to Rockstar leaving its community in such a state, but now Rockstar's finally come out of radio silence. You'll also definitely want a controller for this game. Keyboard/mouse controls are sub-par, especially when it comes to things like fishing.I'd also recommend new players turn Defensive mode on in your online options to help keep other players from attacking you on sight for your first few ranks. It helps a lot, and you'll often find other players attack or try to steal missions from you. It can be frustrating if you're new and a more experienced player outguns you with rifles, dynamite arrows and other high level weapons. Some are griefers, but others are just playing out the more rival aspects of the game. Defensive mode lets others know ""hey I don't want to fight"".If you want a good single player experience with one of the best western stories out there in a game, pick this up. If you're looking for online multiplayer in a Rockstar game to chill with friends, I'd still recommend GTAV over this. If you prefer the taste of a western and are ok wading through bugs and hackers, then you'll still be able to find the diamond in the rough that this game is."

The majority of the graphical settings I set to medium, the ones I don't care about are either off or low and very few I set to high.All in all this game was a great experience an worth every penny.

Don't. I loved this game. I still do. But Only the single player at this time. Red Dead Online is plagued with cheaters using mod menu's and aimbots as well as teleporting the entire session to one spot on the map and firebombing or spawning bears and cougars on everyone until they leave the session. Stop giving us stuff to do and give us private sessions instead. This game and the time my friends and I spent on RDR Online, for me 120 or so hours, has been some of the most fun I have ever had with my friends in the near 10 years Ive known them so It really is upsetting to see Rockstar care more about forcing us to play with random people and ignoring cheaters and hackers and not fixing all the problems.

Worth every penny, tons of play time and that is just in the single player. I haven't even reached the online portion yet and I'm 97 hours in as of writing this. Have had a few crashes, but very very few, not enough to turn me away.The Online experience is a lot different...* Things that where available in single player are now behind grind/paywalls or don't even work at all anymore (Such as you can tame horses online, but you cant sell them or keep them as a mount, they cant even enter the stables).* People playing with controllers get a free in game aim bot, and I'm not talking about your special ability. They get an aim bot that snaps their aim right to the targets chest, allowing them a quick upward tap to get a head shot.  Keyboard and mouse, users don't get that or stand a chance against a console player because of this. However, you can avoid going up against aim bots by changing your aim assist settings to free aim while you are in single player. For some reason you can't change that setting while in online.* All players near you show as dots on the mini map at all times so no one can really get the drop on anyone. Also if you kill someone, they re-spawn near by with almost no delay and can usually jump you again before you can do anything else like loot their horse."

You can brush, pet and ride your horse. There are heavy horses which is a PC way of saying fat, and there are smaller anorexic horses. You can customize the length and color of your horses tail and mane. Only problem is I saw a white horse I wanted and I took it and got shot?? Assuming it's a bug. Sometimes bad guys will shoot at your horse and you have to protect it. Don't worry though, there's a potion you can buy to revive it. There's lots of different food you can feed your horse including sugar cubes and carrots. My horse right now is called Stardust and we have just achieved bonding level 4. We are working on his stamina.Kind of sucks that you have to listen to a bunch of guy drama when you're just wanting to brush your horse. Also you can accidentally shoot horses which isn't ok and I hope it's censored soon. I also hope in the future they will add special horses, like Unicorns. I had one issue where I was riding a 4 horse buggy and the back horses ran over and killed the front horses. Still not over it."

I've thought about it many times, and have yet to come up with a single aspect of this game that isn't perfect. This game will forever be a masterpiece, and one that I hold all other games up to. Honestly I could go into great detail about everything that makes this game so good, but I would run out of characters with the first topic alone.   There's so much to do. There's so many places to go. There's so many people to meet. Every time you strut into a town you've been in before, or a road you've travelled more than you can count, you know that at any moment something new and exciting can and will happen to the world around you. Whether it's a poor, unlucky soul stranded on a road, a gang set out to rob you, or a patron being thrown out the window of the local saloon, there's always a new piece anchoring the world down around you on a level of success I've never seen achieved.    As a man whose wife refers to him as an emotional rock, I've had more than enough experiences with playing through an emotional game and feeling little to nothing. This game is NOT one of those experiences. By the end, I was so attached to every character in my story that I felt like a completely different person. The writers behind this game are truly in a league of their own.   This is an experience you don't want to miss."

The bugs are out of control.2. Hackers ruin the game and seem to be everywhere.3. The Micro-transactions are really in your face and greedy for an AAA game.1. Bugs.... I've had graphics glitches and such things as horses not being usable. But the worst one for me is this game HATES multi-monitor and will crash constantly. It can't stay on one screen and flips to the other. It hates being minimized and won't let go of the mouse (so forget browsing or anything while you play. Random disconnects - usually well into missions (which fail and reset). Stuttering and lag /frame freeze every few seconds) will suddenly become a problem well an hour into gameplay for no reason. Missions need to be multiplayer (not possible to solo)  but the group finder will timeout constantly. Sometimes you can die just by being lovetapped by a horse or falling down a gentle slope. This game hates you in a lot of ways basically.2. Hackers firebombed me in town IN the stable. I died and reload to be.. firebombed. Apparently now I'm killing myself. Over and over every time I respawn massive firebombs fall from the sky. The first time was definitely a hacker but maybe the firebombs just got bugged? Oh Yeah my horse died. Hackers can do anything they want in this game since it's P2P. They spawn un-killable animals and can fly etc.. do whatever they like with no consequences. Apparently Rockstar doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥. There is no anti-hack worth a damn in the game.3. If you want to waste 100s and 100s of hours grinding mini-quests  you can do that.. or fork out about another 50 or 60 dollars ON TOP of the game you paid to actually get the rest of the online content. Everything online happens by gold bars - and each one is worth about 40 dollars in-game currency (Not 500 like the single-player game). Realistically you can earn maybe a gold bar every few hours if you REALLY know what you're doing. Its greed on an epic scale. I would also score negative points for the female character creator: They WANT you to look like a crack ♥♥♥♥♥, and even if you do manage to create a girl that doesn't look like she has been sucking Meth all her life, there is absolutely no similarity to what you created versus who you get: She still looks like a cranky meth hag. It costs 400 dollars (10 gold bars)) to experiment with this so prepare to blow lots of money in a futile attempt to have a character you can stand to look at if you are someone who actually cares about that sort of thing."

Atmosphere is amazing, voice acting is good and motion capture is definitely used well. Characters seem interesting and I heard they have good character development.But I have a hard time enjoying any of that as this game is filled with technical issues that a 2 year old game shouldn't have and I didn't expect a game this well respected to have.So here's some issues that I can recall while writing this review: -the game caches a lot of files to RAM but doesn't ever clear anything so eventually all your RAM will be allocated to the game and Windows will start giving virtual memory to it. If Windows cannot properly manage virtual memory, your PC will freeze. Fun. -UI is terrible for mouse and keyboard and often UI elements cannot be clicked with the mouse -keybinds are terrible and unusual -controls freak out if you alt tab while riding a horse -controls sometimes freak out if you save while riding a horse -manual saving is hidden inside a menu inside a menu and it takes way too long -autosaves work nicely while doing quests but they might not work at all while just exploring or hunting.While some other open world games autosave every x minute this game might not autosave for hours. Better not die after a full day of perfect animal skin hunting when the game spawns a pack of wolfs on top of you!Uninstalled. Might reinstall some day if I get drunk enough"

The control feels a little bit slow because of the realistic character movements. The graphics are mind blowing which makes this game very demanding hardware wise. After the PC launch, the game was unplayable for many, I faced performance issues and many people faced different kind of issues. In the time of writing this review, Rockstar patched the game several times which fixed many issues including performance issues. The game runs fine for me now.This is a prequal to the original Red Dead Redemption which focuses a Gang of outlaws and their quests. You play as Arthur Morgan who is a member of this gang.This game has multiplayer which is Red Dead Online. The multiplayer is good and there’s lots of things to do as Rockstar keeps giving online updates. They even added Story mission as well as Stranger missions in Multiplayer which is a nice touch.The issues my friends and I faced is  Every now and then. They get this error after 10 mins of playing together but if we play solo, we don't face any errors whatsoever. It is very annoying and still yet to be fixed.()60fps+ constant in Open areas.

However, asides from that, this is a work of art.The story, even though it has quite a simple premise, is engaging and the character development is really 5/5. Voice acting is top tier too and truly makes each cutscene and encounter really captivating. The story is this game's strongest point by far and that's mostly due to the characters feeling so real and full of emotions.The gameplay is also very good and there are tons of things you can do in the world, like hunting, gang activities, going to the theater, bounty hunting and more, along with many (MANY) side missions. My main complaint is that the controls really don't feel so precise at times- other times they just feel plain clanky. Also, there are a few too many 'follow x person' missions (main or side) which you can fail if you go too fast (the companions will sometimes ride or walk at the lowest speed possible..).Overall, this is an incredible game and one of the best I've played. However, it makes me wonder, how much better the single-player experience would've been if R* hadn't wasted resources and time on the development of a subpar and grindy multiplayer experience.**TAHITI**"

3005,MENTOR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mtsullivan/,No,,0,225.1,February,"3,",574,3,1,"(Updated on 12/01/20)First time I've done this, but I'm updating my review and flipping it from Do Recommend to Don't Recommend. Why? Today's patch (the 'Legendary Bounties' update on 12/01/20) shows a level of antipathy from Rockstar (or its parent, TakeTwo) toward its players that I'd normally expect from EA. Today's patch has both halved (yes, halved - a full 50% reduction) your ability to earn Gold Bars (the game's premium currency) through doing Daily Challenges while simultaneously introducing numerous (and intentional) gold sinks. These new sinks include needing to pay 15 Gold Bars to unlock the new Bounty Hunter legendary tier (you still have to pay for the base tier if you didn't already have it), a bunch of hyper expensive cosmetic items you can only buy with gold (like a pistol or wagon skin that cost 20+ gold EACH), and a new (and very thin) 100 rank season pass that now only rewards 30 gold through leveling it instead of the normal 40. (The pass itself costs 40 Gold Bars.)Instead of adding actual content (like the ability to rob stores or trains, which you still CANNOT DO in this game about being an OUTLAW IN THE WILD WEST), a new area of the map, or interesting new weapons, Rockstar is giving you a watered-down shot of whiskey and asking you to pay for a full glass. If you are a new player looking at the Red Dead Online-only release, you should think twice. The grind in this game is now as bad as those you'd see in Chinese mobile games, and Rockstar is intentionally making it as grueling as possible to earn gold while simultaneously rising the prices of Gold-purchasable items to annoy you into spend real world cash on Gold Bars. It's shameful behavior that doesn't deserve your time or your money.(Older, original review follows below)The single player campaign and game world, minus the game's ending chapters, are an amazing achievement. The attention to detail and authenticity is incredible, and this crosses all layers of the game. Gameplay is a very slow and deliberate experience, weapons feel and sound heavy and impactful, and the melee combat is suitably visceral. The writing and acting are quite good, as is the usual for a Rockstar game. The single player experience took me around 40 hours and was well worth the price of admission.Red Dead Online, however, is less enjoyable. The single player's clunkiness can't be avoided via the bullet time in Dead Eye, enemies can instantly kill you while absorbing ridiculous amounts of damage, and it's all to common to have your horse take a header off of a 2' embankment and send you flying. Combine that with the oppressive 'budget airline'-type economy model where basic clothing items and guns cost hundreds of dollars, camp upgrades cost even more, haircuts cost $50, and so on (while the average mission returns are $10-$15 for 12-20 minutes of playtime), and it just feels like the game is constantly taxing you and frictioning things to get you to buy gold. All of this says nothing of the bugs and disconnection errors, which are numerous.Come for the single player, but don't expect much other than frustration from Online. A shame."

When it does work, there is currently a good chance you get into a game with a hacker who teleports you and/or sends you flying in the air on fire. The 4 professions or ""roles"" are also locked behind gold bars, (Red Dead Online's currency, purchasable with real money). Detailed review as of 1/5/2020: I don't recommend buying if you want to play Online. I haven't played the Singleplayer, hopefully it works better than Online.. There are currently so many bugs with the online game, it is difficult to keep track. Don't get me wrong, when the game works and the servers are clean, I have a lot of fun playing (84 hours, all online). But those times seem few an far between. Ill go over some of the more frustrating ones that I have seen. Plus it seems the hackers are out in full force lately this holiday season. - Constant disconnects from the servers. Meaning you lose progress, fail missions, and everything on the back of your horse is gone. Makes being a Trader rough.. I'll go out hunting for 60 minutes and then all of a sudden get disconnected and all those animal hides and pelts on the back of my horse are gone. Nearly a total waste of time, minus the few items that fit in your inventory. Would be great if they made it so things on the back of your horse got saved like your inventory does. - Can't move your camp sometimes. For the Trader role a camp is needed to do anything. Often, I will load into a game and have no camp on the map, despite choosing the option to start at my camp. When I try to move camp, the option is unavailable and it will say the camp is being moved. Even if you wait hours, the camp will never appear and you will never get the option to move it. Imagine spending an hour hunting, only to find your camp gone and unable to spawn it again.. I have fixed this by starting and completing a legendary bounty. You then run the risk of losing everything on your horse if you get into an infinite loading screen, your horse dies during the mission, or if you get disconnected. - Infinite loading screens or loading to a black screen. Pretty self explanatory, requires a restart. Worth mentioning that even though you may be stuck loading, that mission you just started is not. So you paid good money for that Mash, got your flavored moonshine made, and ready to start delivery? Well, if you get stuck loading while starting the delivery, you just wasted your money and need to make a fresh batch. For this reason, I have not gone back to the Moonshine business, as it forces you to pay for materials to brew the moonshine. I have also seen this loading bug when trying to join a friends posse, requiring a game restart. - Joining a posse with friends to do a mission is also buggy. I spent about 40 minutes last night just trying to get into a posse with my brother so we can finish his story mission. Every time I tried to join his posse, it would fail and give me an error. I restarted my game multiple times, no change. Got stuck in the infinite loading screen a couple times. My brother restarted his game, and it finally let us posse up. Game loaded me next to him and we were right by the mission. My brother starts the mission, only to find out that we aren't in a posse and matchmaking only started for him. So despite choosing the option to join his posse, having the game load me next to him, and being right next to the mission, we were not actually in a posse yet. We finally figured out he has to invite me twice. Once to load in next to him, then again to join his posse. For an online game centered around playing with others, this is atrocious and completely unacceptable. - Bounty Hunter profession may be bugged for some. It is widely reported online that some people are not getting any money, or EXP for doing bounties. Making it so they can't progress in the role or use it as a means of income. I haven't paid too much attention to see if I was affected. I only did some legendary bounties just to fix the issue with getting my camp to spawn.  - Collector seems to be the best working role. Too bad I find it to be the most boring. It seems you just go around digging or searching for rare items with dead-eye. I've had it bug out when I find the rare item. The map doesn't update or give credit for it, even though I get the item in my inventory. I found restarting the game has fixed this for me. Also one of the more annoying roles to find because every day the Collector NPC is in a different spot and moves around.. - Hackers are in full swing. Maybe a holiday hack sale and too many children got money for gifts. The popular thing now is to teleport multiple people to the same spot, and then send them all flying in the air on fire. This kills you, your horse, and destroys your wagons. Since it says you killed yourself, you end up having to pay for all the fees to get your horse and wagons back. Plus you have no idea who is doing it, so have nobody to report for hacking.This has really been a piss poor launch on the PC Online. I didn't even mention all the issues people had at release just trying to get the game to download or start. From what I understand those issues have been largely fixed now. There were also some bugs/exploits early on that allowed players to get money too fast for Rockstar's liking. This was fixed with urgency, because having players earn money too quickly cuts into the profits Rockstar makes off people buying gold bars.. Oh also, you are REQUIRED to use the Rockstar games launcher, even if you purchased the game on steam..Of the 4 roles, only one of them functions on a level I would call acceptable (collector). The other three either have bugs themselves, or are affected by game bugs that cause a lot of lost time, money, materials, and sanity. Had I known this before, I would not have spent that gift card I got for X-mas on gold bars to buy all 4 professions.. At the time of this writing, I believe the Trader role is 10 gold, Collector and Bounty Hunter are 15 gold each, and Moonshine is 25 gold (65 gold total). It takes awhile to grind the amount of gold needed for even 1 role. After completing ALL of the story missions, I only had about 8 gold and was earning like .15 gold per side quests. So they really try hard to compel you to buy gold bars to get the roles started.Still hopeful that Rockstar can turn it around and make this an amazing online game eventually. But I am not going to change my review if that happens. Maybe ill write another counter review if the game is that good once fixed. I believe companies need to be held accountable when they release bug ridden and nearly unplayable games. By removing reviews, it kind of gives them a free pass to fix things later. This is why I dated the review at the top. I would much rather companies delay releases of games/patches until more polished. Rockstar, ALL of those player you burned with a bad first experience are players who are less likely to come back and spend real money on your gold bars. I for one, would not have, and will not again until your game is fixed. I also can't in good conscience recommend your online game to anyone in its current state."

Content wise its slightly about OK,there is plenty of things to do and Rockstar are fairly OK with adding offers and other incentives to keep you leveling and playing. Sadly its all over shadowed by the pure lack of interest in the longlividty(?) of the game. The servers are terrible,you are bound to waste hours on camps that dont spawn,bounty boards that dont let you interact with them or bounties you spend time doing,only to not give you any reward.

Acting, writing, dialogues, characters, everything story-related are on very high level, and R* does know how to make a good character-driven story.July Update: So, rockstar released an update after 7 months of silence, but it was a good one. Most of the major bugs which were occurring every time is now fixed, save for a few new bugs introduced in this update. I don't care very much about the actual content as long as I can play the game in the current state without headaches. RDR Online now plays, for the most time, as it should. Disconnects are rare, camps works for the most of time, and the overall experience is now good, and that's why I am changing this review, as promised. I just have to say that the performance is still poor, an there isn't a lot of love for the end-game players on RDRO, which I expect R* to address in the next updates. But you will probably have a good experience until you reach endgame. Single player campaign:Fundamental problems with the looting system, if you have lots of items near you, you can't simple cycle through them, and if you can't carry anymore of a specific item, the others that are close to it can be nearly impossible to take. Sometimes the cycling option appears, but it doesn't show all items near you;Just like Max Payne 3, the game constantly unequips and changes your current equiped weapon at random times (its very annoying), not to mention every single time I pressed right click to aim my weapon while on combat and the camera just turned to my horse and I couldn't pull my weapon; This makes combat when you are near your horse also very annoying as well. This also happens when playing Online;Red Dead Online:The game makes a distinction between players who play with aim assist and those who don't. If you play without assist, you get a bonus 20XP on every kill. The option to activate aim assist is specifically inside the controller options, and the keyboard+mouse menu doesn't have this option.So, if you never connected a controller and only ever played with a keyboard and mouse, then the assist will be disabled, right? Not really. When I realized I was being matchmaked with people with aim assist I was already level 60, I had killed more than 4,000 times (there's a reward for every 1000 that you can reset), and lost about 20xp for each and every kill I made. That's more than 80,000 lost xp. For reference, I need about 5500 xp to level up from lvl 70 to 71.I almost quit playing when this happened, since almost every single thing in this game have level requirements, specially when some players (like me) keep grinding XP in order to unlock all items.To disable your aim assist you have to actually choose controller options and deactivate it there, as I said, even if you never connected one.Also on Red Dead Online:This and the problems listed bellow are the main reason why I'm not recommending this game. Sync issues inside missions and on free roam activities;Hackers (albeit not as common);Weapons disappearing/unequiping just like the single-player campaignLack of general QoL updates and long times between them.I listed above only the worse of the game I remembered now, but there's also a lot more minor bugs/Qol changes that could (in theory) be easily done by rockstar."

What lets this game down though, is Rockstar's DRM/Game Launcher. When it was working, it would take a good couple of minutes just for the game to start, which is bad enough in this day and age. But recently, after 55+ hours already invested into the game, I can't even get past the launcher anymore.There's probably a technical solution for dealing with this issue, but a customer shouldn't have to look for solutions just to get a game they paid for, working. A truly brilliant game, let down completely by Rockstar forcing you to use one of the worst DRM systems I've ever experienced.Looks like I'll start playing Spiderman now... at least Sony knows how to do a PC-port right."

3037,Smartik1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Smartik1/,13,,0,2.0,May,"14,",255,0,1,"Another console game with absolutely terribly ported controls. Can't even get into it, dealing with annoyances every few seconds from the very beginning.- Movement is bad - It is designed for a controller stick, not a keyboard. This means that your character will randomly start running a circle or running off to the middle of nowhere instead of going where you are pressing. The same applies to the horse. While riding with your group, he suddenly starts running a big curve away from everyone or backwards and then you have to fix it and catch up.- Volume is quiet - This is a known bug, really had to boost all my volumes to hear dialogues. This is particularly annoying when the camera is far away as volume is also tied to distance from characters.- Camera is bad - To get around tragic horse controls while trying to ride with someone, you can toggle cinematic camera by holding V, which causes the horse to follow the path on autorun (no other way to do it). You can then cycle through different angles/distances with C. The problem is, the game doesn't respect your choice. Even when you set it up just how you want it, within 5-10 seconds the game will switch to something else and you have to cycle through everything again to fix it. This means you miss half the conversations, because the camera suddenly zooms far away. The camera also can't be freely turned in this mode, so you end up missing all the scenery because it is aimed at the ground or some tree on the side instead of anything meaningful.- Button holding - Every interaction needs a button hold, not a button press. There is no PC game that does this. There is no toggle for it. This makes everything you do painfully slow and super annoying.- Animations are slow - Everything from walking to picking up items is like a grandpa doing it. In terms of looting chests, you need to hold the button per every single item you pick out and wait for the whole animation to play out. Needless to say, every chest will take you quite a while.- Keybinds - The game uses half your keyboard for no real reason. Most games use either E or F consistently for every interaction. This one can't even decide whether looting alone is E or R because it uses both randomly so you have to constantly pay attention to the prompts, completely breaking any immersion.- Saving - This is the first game I've ever seen that doesn't have the Save button in the main menu. It is buried in a submenu. Had to google to find out how to save. Not that it matters, because the game pretty much always stops you from saving manually anyway. Already annoyed by this as I tested the game when I got it and quit to continue the next day. Had to rewatch the whole intro and skip the 4-5 cutscenes manually one by one when they finished loading before I got back to where I was.- Rockstar launcher - Great way to slow down loading of a 100+ GB game by another 30-40 seconds.I haven't even gotten that far, but you can't go few seconds without being annoyed by all this. Almost feels like they never played a game before. In terms of Quality of Life features, this game has none."

It consists of perfect details, little details which make it so much more enjoyable. The sound track adds to the atmosphere throughout the story. I found the game was easy but hard enough for me to actually have to try but therefore it was an enjoyable play through since i wasn't getting angry at dying all the time. I love the missions, story and side missions, it was enjoyable to take a break from fighting and go on random missions that don't require a whole bunch of shooting. It was also enjoyable to go hunting from time to time to just take a break and try hunt stuff. One of my favourite aspects of the game is the fact that your decisions actually have weight, you help some hunter caught in his own trap and he might just help you or you can leave him. I wish the story was longer but i know the devs are only human and can only produce so much (Im not saying the story is too short its just so good i wish there was more). Because now with the story done it feels completed and i dont think ill play story ever again, just because now i know the ending its not as exciting and captivating as it was when i was first exploring and playing. However there is still online to play which i will. I hope for a quick release of rd3 however i know that wont be since for it to be as near as good as this it will take years of development.

Real talk, it's worth the purchase just for the story. The controls......I have some difficulty with the controls. They aren't as responsive as I would like and can feel clunky at times when you need to interact with an item on the ground or a dead NPC, etc. also the shooting can feel a little clunky with the aim assist not selecting the right person or not locking onto someone when you feel it should.  I will contribute some of my frustrations to me being used to FPS games with very precise and quick controls/movement.The content......This game has playable content that will last you months.  I can see it already. There is so much to do and so many ways to handle a situation, that if you really enjoy exploring a game and changing variables in how you attack a situation to witness a potentially different outcome......this is the game imo.

But it makes you feel like as you're playing as Arthur, you are Arthur. You're going through these problems as you're being hunted. Things pop up left and right. Its so amazing how everything happens. This gang trying to get by with everyone breathing down their neck. I truly couldn't get a better experience out of any other game that I've ever played.

Doesn't fail to entertain me even after finishing the main adventure, since it offers a big world with lots of stuff to discover. The story is incredible and deserves the praise it gets. Lots of up and downs and beautiful moments that are memorable even after finishing the game. Especially how they manage to portray Arthur, because he feels like an actual human, which charges the whole experience with a very deep emotional heavy feeling - in a positive way. I love all characters, their dynamic and the diversity they create. The epilogue rounded the main story off very pleasantly and gives the player a very peaceful way to process what happened and makes them view it from a different and more uplifting perspective. A big con is definitely how very slow the story feels during one of the early chapters, but it gets better and it gives you time to bond with your partners and explore the map. Red Dead Online is also uninteresting to me. Having to ride on your horse through the map for long times could be an issue too, I personally didn't mind it because I like the surroundings and atmosphere of the game and how ""realistic"" the horse riding feels."

Really I did not expect to have a scenario so interesting and complex. You really get attached to the main character, Arthur, you understand who he is and how he sees the world and his place in this world. The first chapters are a bit slow, but in one hand  it gives the time to really get to know the protagonist and his gang and in the other hand you can explore this really rich world. The ""side quests"" are really cool too.After the firsts chapters, the story gets really intense and, well, be prepared for the emotional rollercoaster.When it comes to the online game, it is more of a mixed review. The first few hours I've played were hell, lobbies full of cheaters, etc (honestly just switch lobbies and it'll be fine, i haven't met cheaters in a while now). As I was nearing the end of the story mode, I was a bit sad to have to leave this beautiful world, so I gave online a second chance. If you don't know anybody, the game becomes rapidly lonely and dull and meeting people in-game is really difficult as it is voice-chat only. Thankfully I found a posse after posting about it on the forum and since then it has been really fun. A posse also helps you level-up much faster, alone it is verrrry slow."

Riding out with your posse searching for that specific animal for the daily mission. Or fishing at a secluded spot.The legendary bounty hunter missions are pretty good (have only tried a couple)Most of the content is locked behind a paywall in the form of gold bars. Gold bars are earned from daily missions or most other content. At first i was bummed out about having to grind to get more content.But as time went on i earned my gold at a decent pace, and it gives a sense of accomplishment when you get that role you want.Red Dead 2 is truly an amazing game, and the online part is great if you enjoy doing the daily missions (i do)Hanging out with your friends goofing in the cities is allways fun, and ive really enjoyed my time in RDO so far."

The story is compelling, the atmosphere is brilliant and the open world - the wilderness between the missions - is a game unto itself. I went in very skeptical, not a fan of ""late"" console ports. By the mid-point, I was surprised how emotionally invested I became in the main plot and characters and, on the flip side, how much fun it was just to mess around and do challenges or explore. I don't have 100% completion just yet, but it's very likely I'll keep coming back until I do (something I never cared about in previous Rockstar games).That said, the multiplayer... is a missed opportunity. From what little I played it, it's still better than GTA Online, but it could've been so much more. The missions aren't incredibly interesting. You start off much weaker and everything's a little off compared to single player, with every aspect clearly designed to be a money sink. And PvP is everywhere whether you want it or not, though griefing wasn't as bad as I've heard it could be.But I treat multiplayer in this game as an optional add-on. That's not where this game shines and don't expect it to. It's the single player experience that's a masterclass in game and production design. I'm genuinely surprised Rockstar was capable of this."

That's it. Just don't. Well, you simply CAN'T but even if you could, just don't bother. Just don't. The community is more toxic than ground zero of the Chernobyl incident, and the game is so obnoxiously paced that they purposefully spread missions across the entire map to force the player through 20+ minutes of horse riding. Pay for fast travel? With what money? Missions pay a pittance and the guns/clothing/gear costs a small fortune individually. Want to do stranger's missions? Nope, don't bother with those either because players will be alerted of your 'fun' and entire teams will run up to stop anyone stupid or new enough to attempt those missions.Oh the single player?

These issues are unacceptable and should be fixed ASAP, tons of people are having problems with the launcher and the game itself. If you're not having these issues great but you could still get random crashes later on."

Makes you verify an email before you can even play. Game is overall fun but still extremely buggy, over a month after release on their own platform. Looting is an absolute pain sometimes, especially on horses. They went for ""realism"" of certain mechanics that just waste time. I don't think anyone wants to spend 15 minutes crafting bullets individually, or roasting a single animal. Drawing guns sometimes feels extremely unresponsive, and often times Arthur swaps to guns I don't want, or pulls guns out on people because Rockstar felt the need to put 3 functions on a single key.  The menus are god awful in this game. Clunky cannot even begin to describe them. The good: The game can be magical when you get bouts of game-play unmarred by bugs, or crashes. The world building and random encounters are fun, and enjoyable to explore.  Story missions are pretty fun."

I'm continually stunned at how beautiful this game looks. Looks more real than real, at times!The way the game plays out puts immersion before everything. Every moment spent playing the game is tuned to suck you in and make you feel like Arthur Morgan and it is done brilliantly. There are immersion breaking elements like dead-eye and the hunting mechanics, but the game benefits from their implementation, overall, so they didn't just go crazy and blindly focus on immersion. It was done intelligently. They knew when not to overdo it.Keyboard and mouse controls are horrible. Please use a controller if you have one. I'm forced to use keyboard and mouse at the moment, but on-foot movement is so bad that it's a constant issue for me. You can't just lightly run. It's: walk, run fast, or run even faster. Very strange. Also there's a million keybinds for interacting with the world. R to open a drawer, but E to close the drawer. Weird stuff like that.As for the story, I really can't comment too much on it. I'm 10 hours into the game, but I've really been mostly exploring and doing story missions on the side. I am interested in the story, but the world is just as interesting to me.I got this game on sale, but would be fully willing to purchase at full price."

To the right.""The mouse controls are so good, I can actually aim at things.Unfortunately, people have been having serious performance issues. Not to dismiss those problems, but I haven't so far.

I loved the first RDR, but this one...I don't know. It's kind of boring if I'm being honest. Online is even more boring and it's not clear at all what you're supposed to do. When you have to watch long drawn out youtube videos to figure out what to even do in a game, you've designed it poorly. Even GTA Online is more fun. At least it's clear on what exactly you can do and how to start missions. With RDR Online, I'm just standing there looking at a giant map and walking around a world I have no idea what to do with. There's nothing to indicate how to start a mission. I just wanted to make a character and do some missions, but that's asking too much.I wish I didn't buy this game."

Many words to describe this game but one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb has to be the amount of crashing. I'm not sure if it's because I have an RTX card, it's not lag my frames don't really dip. Usually it's a crash that freezes my game a random time and just boots me to the desktop, no warning whatsoever. Through these 11 hours I have currently played I have probably crashed maybe 6-7 times, and these random hiccups make it a little difficult for me to just maintain focus on the story. I still recommend this game but beware of random crashes I hope they fix it but I'm not sure how often they update this game.And yes I have changed my graphics settings, changed direct x12 to the only other one besides Direct x12 but it still crashes."

3187,Rain,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rainmanbg/,3,,1,153.9,December,"7,",391,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC, more importantly on Steam, is finally here. And it looks amazing, nothing short of it. It is a massive upgrade from the console versions regarding the quality of image and the amount of frames. I think I can say that it is the best looking game in the history of gaming so far. And I really mean that.The only thing that worried me was all the bug reporting - the most common one - the game fails to start at all. For me, I bought the game on steam, I logged in the R* launcher and then when I started the game, everything was totally OK. I really feel bad for the people who can't get it to run at all for some reason or the other - but in my case - smooth as a butter from the top.Next thing, that worried me a little less, were the graphical settings, since I read that in some cases there were reports of bad frame drops, lags and stutters. Now, in the 125 hours so far that I logged in the game, I haven't experienced that at all. Game runs smoothly in 60 FPS. Of course, I don't have all of my settings on ultra, most of them are on high with exceptions going to medium or ultra. I am aware how demanding this game is, and I am not expecting that I can run it maxed out. (i5-8400 3,8 ghz, 16 gb ram and rtx 2060).As for the gameplay, it is still what it was on the console versions, but with the addition of mouse and keyboard support, so that alone brings the experience on a whole new level. Still if you like to use gamepad like me, that will work great also.As for the game itself - come in prepared. This is a slow paced game, with slower tempo than usual games, so don't expect to rush through RDR 2. Take your time with it, be patient and enjoy. This is an adventure first and foremost, so if you can - turn on your zen mode and just relax deeply immersed in the story, in the nature, in the world that almost feels lifelike, more than any other open world in gaming.Atmosphere is amazing, characters are very memorable, even the ones in smaller encounters. Arthur himself is a fantastic protagonist (once you get to know him), and for me he is the best main character that R* ever created (sorry Niko). Sound design, voice acting, weather conditions, flora and fauna- everything was done with really incredible amount of detail and variety. Production of the game as a whole is definitely on the top of the gaming industry.So, we just got the best looking game on the best possible platform to experience it. Your experience may vary, but this was mine so far.  I see that the most of the negative reviews are based on the fact that the game can't even start, I decided to put this out so you know that there are also people who have the game running from the beginning without any issues, and are having fun in story mode and also in online.So, saddle up, and brace yourself for an incredible journey that is in front of you. We are talking about one of the best games of the decade here."

You'll be drinking in bars, bounty hunting, fishing, animal tracking and hunting, cooking, and even tasks like taking care of your horse and guns on occasion all while running the chance of finding random strangers along your travels that lead to all sorts of situations. Having memorable characters and almost excessive amount of detail to the open world, this is definitely a game you can get immersed in deeply and just lose track of time spent doing side missions or just generally exploring to hunt and discover whats out there.  If you're looking for a good wild west story with a gang of criminals on the run then you've found it in RDR2.If you are more interested in multiplayer, I can't say you will have the same kind of experience. While you still have the open world to explore and interact, content at the time of this review is still anemic compared to what is offered in single player. You have a few roles that offer missions beyond the general open world's events and its rather short story missions, but I recommend having a decent team for most of that content and even then you'll find yourself doing mostly trade routes and collecting to grind for any decent money. There is of course news that this feature is still receiving ongoing developments and will have more to offer in upcoming updates, but expect to find a lot less in RDR online right now compared to single player.Overall, I recommend this game."

It demands a bit from you, pretty much every single action requires input, you need to maintain your weight, hygiene, your clothes, your horse, your camp. Hunting requires you to know what type of weapon to use as well as what type of ammo to use. It can be very overwhelming but if you're the type of person that likes games that take immersion to the next level, this is it. The performance could be better, but the story, the writing, the visuals, the gameplay...it's pretty much world class. If it weren't for the god awful launch and performance this game had, then the ratings would be better. But as far as I'm concerned, it's a good game."

I don't feel like having to edit the whole thing all over again, so here's a link to my full review off-site and an extremely abbreviated version underneath:It's a very pretty game with a lot to explore and a very moving story. It has some technical issues with things like the AI and control interface but they were thankfully never anything game breaking. Overall, a wonderful title that I do recommend.  However, the steam versions also has always-online DRM and makes you install secondary software (rockstar social club) just to play single player. I don't know if the console versions of this game are free of such things, but even if they're not, I'd recommend getting a used copy for consoles so as to not give rockstar money for pulling a sleazy DRM move on their paying customers."

As a game, in the campaign itself? It sucks, it feels like you're playing a shooting gallery from the early 360 era, rockstar has the weirdest fail states you'll see in a game (YOU SCARED THE FISH, You didn't stare long enough in the shootout for rockstar to be pleased with the dramatic tension). The open world stuff is detailed and rich, and nice to poke around. The story and visual design are top of the pile. If they made the mission design kind of exciting, it'd be one of the best games I've ever played but uh, it's bad so RDR2 is just really good."

Not that pile of hot mess where you grind a mission for 30 minutes over and over againTLDR : =As much as i love this game from all my heart, it breaks me to say that this game gets repetitive. Im not saying the game as a whole is repetitive. but man, The mission design sucks deep.Ride to Point A, Talk to NPC A, Walk with him/her till Point B. *Accidentally* start a GENOCIDE labeled as a shootout. Ride / Run to Point C together. Disband the group, Go back to your Camp / hideout which is Point D.     *Mission Accomplished Screen* Rinse and repeat for 109 MISSIONS. 109 Missions playout the same way as i've explained above.Otherwise its a MasterpieceRDR 2 Summed up. AND......... *I GOT A PLANNNNN.* *ONE MORE SCORE ARTHUR, A BIG ONE. THEN WE'LL BE OFF TO TAHITI*Now the pros : This game never fails to amaze me with its completely rich and detailed world R* has provided us with. I Absolutely love just riding in the swamps, the mountains, plains, cities in different times and weathers because it completely changes the overall feel of the place. The Swamp in Bayou Nwa will completely change if you come around dusk, the fog will be everywhere and it will absolutely blow you away. Come back when its raining and its a different story altogether. Saint Denis gives a different vibe altogether if you come at night, Valentine manages to hit the same feel too.The hunting aspect is really fun, you cant really expect hyper realism at that but again if you shoot a bird with a double barreled shotgun it will obviously Obilterate every meat particle, so you cant expect to get a perfect or good skin after doing that, switching over to a bow will do wonders. The Bounty hunting is actually fun, you have unique missions in that to some extent, sometimes slowing down and trying to stealth kill everyone seems to be the easier part, you cant go guns blazing in every bounty. The Fishing is a fun aspect although i dont like to fish in general in alot of games so i've always skipped over it. but it is fun.They could've focused more on the stats like feeding your horse or taking care of it, like there should've been a mode if you wanted to turn on where if you dont feed your horse properly, it runs away or just dies of starvation, but ive tried not feeding it for weeks and the bad boi still keeps going. same goes for Arthur, you can not feed him for weeks and he'll live. just with a reduced heath and stamina. Either they should've made it hyper realistic or these things should be just cosmetic. not this middle thing. where it affects you slightly but its enough to ignore completely. Huge amount of exploration and replayability is possible if you're willing to do that after the game has finished. not to mention getting 100% is a fun part too. i am also trying to do that currently sitting at 81%.LOVE the ragdoll physics. Its like they ported it straight from GTA IV, and not V which makes crashing your horse on purpose in a tree so much fun.One tip who has read all the way through and wanting to buy the game, DO NOT UPGRADE YOUR GUNS. its just cosmetics and not really worth the money, you are better of buying new guns then upgrading the current ones.Because i used to upgrade my gun and then i would get a newer and better version just by playing the campaign.Rating : 9.25/10. I would've given a complete 10/10 If it had a better mission design but it is what it is.A GEM of a game, A Masterpiece <3*May I? stand unshaken - plays in the background*"

These words do not come with poor judgement.I've been a long-time fan of Rockstar's products, since GTA 2 and have purchased every major game of its grandiose fleet such as: Bully, GTA, Manhunt and Red Dead Redemption. It's really inspiring how RED had first come to production with the very first big game incorporating the elements of the Wild West and introducing showdowns and even multiplayer shooting! A very first what-if version of GTA with horses transcending to Red Dead Redemption 2 ! So in general: Graphics: 10/10Gameplay: 8/10Story: 100/10Music: 10/10Game Design: 10/10This game could have won game of the year in 2018 -EASILY- if it had a little bit polished combat...  The story is probably the best I've ever seen in a while. Tearful moments and larger than life characters that give this feeling that you really invested on their struggles and got to know them and really be a part of their life. Mesmerizing graphics overall and really really huge amount of content! Gotta be neck to neck with TESV: Skyrim and Witcher 3 in terms of replayability and personal investment! Thank you Rockstar !

Edit:- After playing a 100+ hours more after writing the review and on steam's continued  insistence, I definitely want to add that this is a great game! Its one of the best games I ever played period.If you thought GTAV was good then this is better at least in the Singleplayer Storytelling and writing department. GTAV may have more side activities that can be termed 'fun' but that is because of the Urban setting of that game. In this game, they obviously have to limit themselves to variations on Banditry, Hunting, Fishing etc because of the time period and setting. Still GTAV goes more for whackyness whereas this game, tries to tell a more serious and sombre tale about Arthur Morgan and his gang of Outlaws.The problem still is the port, Its infuriating that they take an extra year after the console release (without even announcing a PC port) and then after a year, go to Epic for a month and then release on Steam and the game is still not in a perfect or a near perfect state!!!I told you about the controller issue but there are other big and small imperfections too and it really depends on the person if they are acceptable to them or not.Also the lengths to which this company is willing to go to maximise their profits (making some idiots buy twice, once on console and again on PC by not announcing PC port and delaying it, Epic exclusivity AND a super Pay2Win online mode both in this game and GTAV) and then not even bothering to put in the effort to make sure their game runs fine on Nvidia cards or not at all on many systems is just next level ♥♥♥♥♥♥!!You may have heard this game is a hardware killer but no its only a killer of Nvidia hardware. It runs much better on AMD graphics cards which however are still a smaller minority in the PC market despite AMD becoming quite strong against both Intel and Nvidia. Go look at some benchmarks for this game if you don't believe me. Just type in Red Dead Redemption 2 PC benchmarks and watch a couple of videos or visit a website. You will see for yourself how Rockstar didn't bother to put in the effort to optimise for Nvidia's architechture (both pascal, the 10xx series and turing, 20xx and 16xx series cards) which they know very well is still used by a majority of PC gamers!Rockstar/Taketwo is definitely EA level ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in my book now because of all the greed they display and their continued Anti-PC stance since many years.Hopefully this is the last time I give them any money!Specs: Ryzen7 2700x CPU16Gb RAMZotac 2060 GPU"

I'm only playing it on medium, but it still looks amazing. I wish I could up the settings a bit, but the optimization is way too bad for that. Which is a bit of a letdown since GTA V's optimization was incredible. Be wary of this if you have a low-to-mid range PC.If the optimization was better (Akin to GTA V's, which could run on a toaster), then the game would be a solid 10/10."

I was not prepared for that. Rockstar did a phenomenal job in getting me to care about the characters in this game and getting me to feel more emotional about a game than I remember in quite a while.

Unexpectedly deep characterisation, lots of fun things to see and do, compelling narrative and, as an aside, a surprisingly detailed and engaging hunting mechanic that's somehow leagues better than most hunting simulator games. Unexpected, but delightful.My particular favourite touch is the bonding mechanic you have with your horses, and the horses behaving like actual flesh-and-blood horses, and not like, say, a peculiarly-reskinned car; just like you yourself, your horses must be fed, rested, kept in a basic state of hygiene, and given medicine when required.

I was very excited when I heard that RDR2 would come out on PC but man... what a thorough disappointment it is.The game looks nice, runs awfully and is way too long, but that's all secondary to the big complaint I have about the game. This is the most constricting game I've ever played. In almost all missions, you're accompanied by one or several NPCs, and it's almost like it was designed to limit the things you can do. They will keep yelling the same dialogue, and urge you on to complete the mission in a completely linear and unimaginative way. About 90% of the gameplay consists of glorified QTEs, walking around slowly and listening to dialogue and basically turret sections, where you're riding a horse on a very specific path and shooting at enemies spawning all around you. The linearity of the missions would be funny if it wasn't annoying. The game will force you to hold a button and basically just watch a cutscene play out, as in, you're walking somewhere, but you can't even walk left or right, you can only hold W. What's the point of dialogue prompts if there's only one choice of dialogue, and if you don't press the button, your character will just say it anyway. Hunting, fishing, collecting herbs, it's all horribly slow and made to waste your time, and the new 'survival-like' mechanics like hunger seem pointless and are probably just made for multiplayer, to force you to spend real money on microtransactions. The interface is also bad, to get from cooking a meal to walking again, I have to press F to stop cooking, then backspace to leave the crafting menu, and then escape or something to leave the camp, it's just dumb. There's more characters in the game than in RDR1, but they're all shallow and mostly just obnoxious. I didn't care for any of them honestly, and it even made me care less about John Marston (the protagonist of RDR1).That basically sums the whole game up, a dumb waste of time. Quantity over quality. For the last 40 hours of it I just hoped it would end already."

3259,ThePHiLsTeR [¬º-°]¬,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAMThePHiLsTeR/,2,1,1,317.6,December,"8,",710,4,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is a masterpiece that has an amazing, gritty, and emotional story. Playing RDR2 is nothing short of an adventure, and a cowboy one at that! The environments are absolutely beautiful. Characters have realistic facial expressions and flawless voice acting that has won awards. You play a member of a gang of outlaws and gameplay consists of robbing trains and banks, escaping lawmen, bar fights, and fire fights with rival gangs.*No Spoilers* RDR2 has an emotional story that has brought many people to tears. It is the prequal to Red Dead Redemption 1 and will be an absolute treat and fan fare to fans of the first game. Although veteran players will appreciate small details referring to the first game and its characters, newcomers will have a unique perspective. Newcomers will have a blank slate and major story developments will shock and surprise while veterans will already know some major things that will happen and the overall direction of the game. Since RDR2 is a prequal, playing the first game is not required to fully enjoy RDR2. That being said watching a video synopsis on the first game after beating RDR2 may be worthwhile.You’re a rootin’ tootin’ cowboy and outlaw who should never ever travel without his cowboy hat. RDR2 is a third-person shootin’ adventure. You’ll be using the guns and equipment of 1899 which include dual revolvers, repeaters, rifles, double barrel shotguns, and lassos. There is a “dead eye” mechanic where you slow time, mark enemies, and shoot. This is especially handy when you’re heavily outnumbered, saving a fellow gang member whose held hostage, or trying to take out a fast-moving enemy on horseback or predatory animal.There are many mission types which include infiltrating a rival gang’s base, robbing a train or bank, saving a gang member from captivity, escaping law enforcement, hunting an animal, capturing an enemy, bounty hunting, gathering intel, and vandalism. Some segments require stealth by moving while crouching and using silent weapons such as bows or throwing knives, but most segments you’re the quintessential rootin’ tootin’ cowboy cappin’ fellas firing dual revolvers from the hip. To add to the drama things can go really wrong making some missions hectic but in a good way.Rockstar focused heavily on realism in RDR2. Guns get dirty and need periodical cleaning. Rockstar, however, went the extra mile and your character and horse get dirty as well and require cleaning. Your horse can be called by whistling to it, but only if it is in range. To increase your horse’s health and stamina, food and attention (by periodically patting it and cleaning it) will be required. It can also permanently die if you don’t heal it in time after taking mortal damage. Eating food is required which can be bought at the shop, but the most satiating food, cooked game meat, takes time to cook. Concocting special tonics and items from ingredients require time. RDR2 is overall a slow-paced game.An optional part of the gameplay includes hunting and fishing. Animals come in different qualities from poor to perfect and will net differing amounts of money. Hunting, though optional, will be required to make special items from animal parts. For example, making a volatile dynamite (which has increased damage radius of a regular dynamite) will require a regular dynamite and animal fat while a dynamite arrow will require a regular dynamite, an arrow, and a bird feather. These types of items I found unnecessary but worthwhile and enhanced the gameplay. Animal parts are also required to upgrade your satchel which has a limited inventory space. The default satchel will certainly get you through single player but the extra space is nice. Animal skins can make nice clothing for your character and decorations for your base.RDR2 has an honor system where you can play dishonorably or honorably. Your level of honor will affect how others treat you and some outcomes of the story. With high honor, NPCs will treat you nicely and shops will give you discounts. While negative honor will net more money when looting the dead and allow you to shoot up enemies and civilians with little remorse.RDR2’s world crosses a pretty large map which will take about 30 minutes to travel from one side to the other by horseback. It sports a variety of different landscapes from frosty mountains, swamps, small towns, deserts, and an upscale city. The wild environments are what you’d expect a landscape relatively untouched by humans would be with treacherous mountains, narrow trails, creeks, and caves. Wildlife are littered throughout and include everything from squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, snakes, and deer to wolves, bears, and cougars, and much much more.RDR2’s landscapes I describe most accurately as a moving painting. It is especially beautiful at night when the moon’s light reflects off every blade of grass, tree, and lake. While riding, you can see all the distinct muscles on your horse and its mane eloquently moving with the wind and each tread. In the snowy mountains, you can see all the snowy mist flying through the air, and the incredibly realistic tracks in the snow made by your horse, feet, and other animals.  You can see the water vapor as it condenses out of each character’s mouth as they breathe. Characters and NPCs move realistically with realistic facial and bodily expressions. It is akin to a movie with superb actors immersing you into its world.I have nothing bad to say about the sound nor anything amazing, except that it serves its purpose. The music captures the wild west and an adventurous tone. Notable music plays during the story’s most emotional moments and those impacted will forever associate the events that transpire and the songs that coincide. For players of the first game, RDR2’s music is in my opinion slower and calmer, while RDR1’s music is more exhilarating.The crashes sadly are what’s stopping people from buying the steam version and the cause of mixed reviews. Troubleshooting the game might require disabling anti-virus, tweaking settings, updating graphics drivers, running the game as administrator, and more. And even then, the game might still crash and the best you can do is limit the crashing but never completely solve the problem. It is such a shame because RDR2 is truly a gem of a game and I’m sure its crashes have soured many people’s experiences.Red Dead Redemption 2 is worth every penny at the full price of $60 and offers potentially hundreds of hours of content or at the minimum 50 hours in single player not counting the extras. However, it should come with a buyer-beware tag as players can experience crashing anywhere from none to an unbearable amount."

In order to actually start making money in the professions, you have to grind for gold. However, the rate of that you get gold at is painfully slow as to encourage you to spend real money to purchase the gold outright from the rockstar store. Furthermore, after grinding for cash and gold, endgame purchases tantamount to clothing (which is extremely expensive), shinier guns, and slightly faster horses. Essentially, the same gameplay you have had the whole time just reskinned, which I do not consider worth the massive amount of effort required. I cannot speak for the new moonshiners update but I have not been incentivized to even bother because of the amount of grinding I presume is needed.Would not recommend to anyone who is coming from GTA V and expecting a similar online experience, but hey, at least its really pretty.Wish I could get a refund lol"

Mrs. Yi was very kind. gave all of us delicious barley tea and dumplings. she later died peacefully of old age as many older people do in china because of our good healthy lifestyle. eating bokchoy has many health benefits. we drink good tea too. game made me think deep and made me tear up. but i like dota 2 better because i like competitive games more than single player story mode. i also like that they named the game ""RED"" dead redemption. red is color of china. very cool. probably not coincidence."

The Gang of Dutch has people to remember, my favorites were Charles, Uncle (almost the times), Sadie (ily <3), John's Family, Sean and Kieran, those characters have a special place in my heart <3. Through the game you can see how Arthur is more skeptical about Dutch decisions, making 2 sub-bands, but all this carries to Arthur's Redemption.

3289,Qain,https://steamcommunity.com/id/onomatopesha/,3,,1,65.7,November,"16,",791,0,1,"Ohhh this is a tricky one.....TL;DR: This is the gaming equivalent of tantric sex, if tantric sex lasted 65 hours and had a 45hr foreplay session.Red Dead Redemption 2 is, in and of itself, a huge undertaking by the guys from Rockstar; i'd even dare to say it's their Magnum Opus in terms of scope, while attempting to deliver a story focused game within the systems of an open world game much like GTA V, but with a much serious tone to it.Let's start with the graphics. The game is absolutely stunning. If it weren't for some particular environments, i'd say the game appears to be raytraced, because DAMN the lightning in this game is just stellar. It's hard to give off the feeling of a dimly lit campfire while singing with friends in a densely fogged up swamp, but these guys managed to do so beautifully. It helps a lot that the team has pushed the engine to its (current) limits to achieve so, which means crushing performance when pushed higher than ""console settings"". Suffice it to say that pushing the game to its absolute ultra setting is still a hard thing to achieve even with current hardware. The sound is thankfully there to accompany the visual experience, and other than some specific characters who feel a bit forced, their performances really do sell their distinct personalities.The story of the game is not something easy to judge however, for several reasons...The game transports the player back to 1899, to a time when the wild west was nearly tamed by industrialization and the dawn of a new civilization. Younger people learnt the ropes and adapted to the new times, but old dogs just couldn't learn new tricks, as the saying goes. Among them we have Arthur Morgan, member of a gang of outlaws who are constantly running from the consequences of their stealing and murdering, but also of the new civilization which constantly pushes them aside. Of course throughout the game *stuff* happens and suddenly the plot thickens to one of betrayal, love, old age, fraternity and more violence, and this is where we need to put a big asterisk...The story in and of itself is.... nothing short of brilliant, at least in its conclusion; but the path to its conclusion is so diluted through time that it's very difficult to actually CARE about it for a minute. For starters, the first half of the story feels like Groundhog Day, with one of the main characters just repeating something as if it were a mantra which, in the beginning hypes up the player of this majorly eventful situation that simply never happens. Later on, the story unfolds beautifully, but that comes after me forcing myself to play sessions of an hour or two of gaming. Worst thing is that I don't think this is a problem of the story missions themselves but rather the road that leads to them....See, the game is set in a rather large world, maybe smaller than the one in GTA V sure, but big nonetheless. The problem is that, in between certain points of interest, there is a vast nothingness that just.... needs to be traversed. Sure there are sidequests and activities to do in between, but the time they detract from the travelling from one point to the other makes them pointless unless you are one of those completionists. Personally, I tend to complete them as they come, but in this particular game, they posed absolutely nothing for me to gain, and only made me waste time. In the end, they, together with the travelling itself, became a padding that, if removed, would most likely shave off a few hours of time.It doesn't help that the shooting mechanics, while working great, are matched to a shooting STRUCTURE that reminds me of these old western movies where enemies would just come out of the woodwork and become cannon fodder. I mean sure, it fits the game but... is it fun? The beats of every single mission are so predictable you'll see yourself pre-aiming your dual wield revolvers. What doesn't help either is the myriad of systems Rockstar has implemented. From horse's balls shrinking when its cold to a tracking system, foraging system, character progression system, beard and hair growing through time, weight system, horse relationship system, dynamic weather system, weapon maintenance, ammunition creation, all paired up with their own animations. This sounds absolutely mind-blowing, if not for the fact that, coupled with the enormous padding of the travelling and long winded story, it would almost seem that Rockstar just dove right in a journey of self-indulgence, as if it's asking you to stop and gawk at how everything works together..... I mean sure, great the game is screenshot worthy and everything works incredibly well for a game of this scope but.... what's the point? To stall for time?Anyways, I've ranted enough, let's get this over with....Is the game worth it? If you find a discount on it over here, I'd say yes.Just bare in mind, it's not a fast game, it's repetitive, it can get tiring and it's pretty to look at and listen to, but once you reach a certain point in the game, the story draws you in like no other to a beautifully crafted series of endings."

Story is really above average and they added a lot of fun new mechanics and distractions/diversions.  I've only thrown 10 hours into this game (as of this review) and i've thoroughly enjoyed my time so far.  Looking forward to throwing in another 100 hours and going for the achievements. My only gripe so far maybe is that if you don't have a beast of a PC, it may no run great.  I had to downgrade from 1440p to 1080p in order to run the game with maxed out graphics, but the 1080p downgrade isn't a super big jump down from 1440p, and I'd rather have the higher graphics fidelity+framerate over the higher resolution+lower framerate.   All things considered, I'd give this game at least an 8 out of 10, if you have a very strong computer definitely a 10/10 worth playing with everything maxed out."

The game is stunningly beautiful, with an enormous world that is incredibly detailed, and packed with content.The story is gripping and emotionally charged, with characters that are well-developed and memorable. The game's themes of morality, loyalty, and redemption are explored in depth, making for a truly immersive and thought-provoking experience.The gameplay is also fantastic, with tight controls and a variety of activities to engage in. The game's open-world design allows for a great deal of exploration and freedom, with plenty of side missions and activities to keep players engaged for hours on end.However, the game's online multiplayer component is a significant disappointment. The multiplayer mode lacks the depth and immersion of the single-player campaign, with a lackluster progression system and limited content. The game's microtransaction system is also a major drawback, allowing players to pay real money for in-game items and advantages.Overall, ""Red Dead Redemption 2"" is an incredible game that is well worth playing for the single-player campaign alone. The game's storytelling, world-building, and gameplay are all top-notch, providing an immersive and unforgettable experience. However, the game's multiplayer mode falls short and is not recommended for players looking for a robust online experience."

And everyone knows, Rockstar is one of the best in the business when it comes to providing a single-player experience that is unparalleled in it's ability to immerse the user, and not many studios can say they've managed to expand that single-player story into a multi-player experience. While multiplayer is not personally for me, I can see why people are willing to pour money into both Red Dead Online and GTA V Online.The main reason why I do not recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 is not because of the quality of the game at all, but because of the lack of attention that goes into the holistic product.This game repeatedly crashes at exactly the same spot in the opening sequence for me, which renders it unplayable. Just as I'm about to enter a cabin about 10 minutes into the game, I get an error, ""ERR_GFX_STATE"", with the only thing I can do is to exit and re-open the game. The ""fix"" is extremely ridiculous, requiring the user to manually delete game Vulkan files, and to start and stop the in-game benchmark. This game has been out for years, and this is a known issue - why hasn't this been resolved?There is intrusive always-online DRM which runs with the game, Rockstar Social Club. Why do I need to make a Rockstar account if I just want to play in single-player mode? Why does my game need to constantly remain connected to the internet? Just authenticate my license at boot, and that should be enough.I would love for Rockstar to apply the care and attention for the product that they do for the writing and direction, but it seems the people in charge have no interest in improving the experience for the players."

The game runs horribly choppy with the inbuilt render (it helps to change to Direct-X 12 which isn't documented anywhere in their support forums) and regularly Crashes from being ""Out of Resources"" (even though I cut the resolution to 1080p and 'Low' textures etc).  This purpose built gaming PC plays almost any game flawlessly, I haven't seen a game this poorly ported to PC in years.  It's nearly unplayable.  There are thousands of forum posts around the internet of people struggling to make the game run, have decent video performance and not crash.  Rockstar should fix this or stop selling it for PC."

The game's attention to detail extends to its characters, who are all well-developed and have their own unique personalities and motivations. Players will have the chance to form relationships with these characters and even make choices that will impact the course of the story.In addition to the main story, the game also features a variety of side quests and activities for players to engage in. These range from hunting and fishing to collecting items and playing mini-games such as poker, blackjack, and five finger fillet.

If you are looking for a story-rich adventure game, this is definitely a must-play. NPCS have lots of dialogue- even after hundreds of hours playing I still feel immersed in the game. PC controls were intuitive and easy to learn. The graphics and animations are beautiful and ran smoothly. The puzzles and treasure maps you run into aren't *too* difficult to solve- do yourself a favor and don't spoil things for yourself!Captions on this game are good overall. There were a handful of points where the text did not match what was being said, but it did not happen frequently. (If you use captions, I'd highly recommend turning on ""Speaker Name.""

I'll start by saying this game is slow, I'm 120 hours in and I've not completed the main story yet, as a matter of fact I am not even close. The feeling of ""I've barely scratched the surface yet"" really punches you in the face for at least 20 or 30 hours, even more. Red Dead Redemption 2 is Mind-bogglingly beautiful, the game is so aesthetically pleasant it's impressive, like I've never seen in any other game. NPCs feel like they are alive, so much so as of right now I would crank it in my book as the best game of all time. Back then when we 'was' a little boy we used to equip Link with a bow and ride a horse called ""Epona"", it revolutionized gaming as we knew it and this game right here is one of the blessings of results we could potentially have almost three decades later. The amount of work people have put into crafting Red Dead Redemption II is shocking. Strawberry a small town inside the game is the most beautiful city of the entire gaming history and it's not even close to the second place, which we could argue it is inside this game as well.     You're really buying an experience, feel it, don't rush it, dive in it. Is this worth it? Yes, easiest yes of my entire life. Is it worth to buy a whole rig to then be able to play this? Yes, I can say it now it was worth it every penny. Thank you for reading. 25th October 2022 Review."

I live at 308 Negra Arroyo Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico, 87104. This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn.Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

A flawless example of video games as an art form, with stunning vistas to look at in awe, a captivating narrative that rivals the best films ever made, and unforgettable moments that will have you sipping your whiskey lost in thought.As a massive fan of the western genre, it hits all the right spots, with a slower paced story that builds up, giving time for character development and for attachments to form. The gameplay doesn't let down either with every moment being a joy, whether its getting in gunfights that feel straight out of something Clint Eastwood or John Wayne would get into, hunting down big game to make money selling hides, or simply exploring the vast open world and seeing what I can find. I almost never used fast travel, as every second on the road with my horse was another second I could appreciate the beauty of this game. Cannot recommend enough.

A couple of advises for the beginners without spoiler.When you begin the game first thing to do to buy every Health Items for yourself and for your horse. Always better to be prepared than be sorry. Take your time in Chapter 2 and 3 and focus on upgrading your camp fully.Do not be afraid of spending your money you are going to earn more than you need. Instead of buying a saddle, hunt a Bear with Perfect Pelt and craft the saddle (Bear Dakota Saddle) in the Trapper. But if you want to buy you can buy The Gerden Trail Saddle or Gerden Vaquero Saddle (Improved). Improve your saddle bag.I know that at some point in your game you are gonna want to ride a Shire.. okay enjoy your Shire but change it to a Race horse whenever possible (You don't need to buy a horse until Chapter 4, you can find / loot / steal the horse) Although Shires look magestic they are not fast or strong enough to ride farer withough letting them rest. Doing camp chores will give you + Honour and Dead Eye.Press Alt to learn your location / hour / bounty on your headPress J for your journal and L for missions. When you have a perfect pelt on your horse - do not die. Either give the pelt to Pearson or sell to the Trapper asap. Do not go to missions with your perfect pelt.If you lose your Legendery Animal pelt, no worries, your pelt is safe in the Trapper.Good luck."

I know it says I have less than 30 hours on it, but I played for almost 500 hours on PS4, and there's a very good reason for that. The story is truly the best story from any game, movie, book or series I've seen. Please, if you haven't played it, do. And also, the game is just pretty. The graphics are really the best graphics I've seen from any game PERIOD. And I'm not only talking about the ""realism"" of the graphics themselves, but also the prettiness of them. The sunrise covered with clouds each morning is literally one of the most beautiful things I've seen in any game. Overall, I can't really find anything to complain about. It might really be a ""perfect"" game, at least to me. 10/10"

When I played the first Red Dead Redemption many years ago I was so amazed by what Rockstar could achieve but now that I have played the latest I am so blown away, no game could compare. It seems as if Rockstar took note of the mistakes they were making in GTA V and made this game perfect.From the insane quality to the open world landscape in which you can do what ever you want when you want. The characters movements and speeches are so perfect. The beautiful terrains make this game so enjoyable to explore. There is a story mode and an online, obviously the story mode would follow a story with lots of fun missions, however most people get the game to play online because that's where you can make your own story and choose to do what you want; I would suggest trying both, the story mode can be really fun and exciting, like watching an action movie but your the one making the decisions.If you have not gotten this game yet I highly highly suggest getting it. Although it would probably be best to get it during a discount or black friday because it is quite pricy."

3519,MadBone12,https://steamcommunity.com/id/madbone12/,2,,1,387.3,July,"26,",489,0,1,"(Review for single player only)Red Dead Redemption 2 is at its best when you are just roaming the world, exploring, doing side missions and dealing with whatever random encounters the world has to offer. It is at its worst when you are doing quests, as suddenly things become very linear and you just turn into a button masher doing whatever the game tells you to.The world design and story of RDR2 are incredibly good. The characters are interesting with compelling backstories and interesting progression, as well as amazing voice acting. The world is an absolute blast to explore, and I can see myself playing it again just for this.My two biggest complaints:Story quests - while interesting in content - are very linear and it often feels like you are just pressing a button whenever the game demands it. This game LOVES taking choices away from you during quests, down to the speed you can walk at, what weapon you can use, if your inventory is available or not. It was often a very frustrating experience and I was annoyed at being constantly railroaded.The second complaint is that a lot of items you can get are unlocked by challenges, made worse by the fact that the progression of those challenges often makes no sense. For example, two of the final challenges for the Herbalist questline are to collect plants and then make one particular item and use it. However, you would have done that dozens of times over by the time you get to this point in the challenge progression, but your earlier actions don't count until that challenge becomes active. I felt like my time was not being respected.I have other minor complaints, such as the clunky and unresponsive controls. However, I still recommend this game for the world design, story and characters, and the exploration / crafting / survival mechanics this game has to offer. This was a very fun game to play when it stopped getting in its own way.Final note: this game is a prequel to the first game. Since RDR1 is not available on PC, PC-only players interested in knowing what happened to the main characters of RDR2 will need to watch a 'let's play' online or read a summary."

I don't know how many thousand hours at all, but it is a quite huge amount of time.And I had one rule: do not buy the same game twice.Why had? Because this game broke this rule.Not so many story games were finished by me twice. I can count them by the fingers of two hands.BUT I HAD NEVER BOUGHT ONE GAME TWICEUNTIL NOWMy first meeting with RDR2 was in 2018 when it was released on PS4 and Xbox. It was not a pre-order, just release day buying, for the full price of 60$ (for the first time). I didn't know if my PS4 Fat was able to launch this masterpiece and mostly it was a great challenge for it because sometimes its coolers worked like them launch a rocket into space. But generally, everything was all right, the game gave me one of the best game experiences in my life. Great graphics, gameplay, story, additional activities, open world...Everything creates a separate world where you can transform into a cowboy and escape from reality.Once upon a time, I decided to buy this game again for my pc. And OMG IT IS AWESOME AGAIN.The only difference is that it can be playable in 60 frames per second with better quality graphics. And I think that it's enough to pay $ for it and to finish this storyline again, maybe with another morale role (no spoilers).So I'm going to ride my new horse and become a bad-ass cowboy in the Wild West again!God, bless DLSS technolohy!IwHtH's score:10/10Graphics:5/5Gameplay:5/5Story:5/5Optimization:5/5"

The story can be emotional, so it used to happen that I even shed a few tears at some moments. Also, the plot twists are excellently made and change the course of the plot in a fresh way.Red Dead Redemption 2 is a really emotional and decisive game that starts with a classic western plot and ends with many questions about life and who is really our friend and who is our enemy.In conclusion, I would recommend this masterpiece of a video game to anyone"

I purchased this PC version a little while back when I got my first PC, however I played this game when it first came out on Xbox back in 2018. First off, the graphics are literally better than my local national park's view. Second, the story is like an actual movie that I am surprised doesn't exist. Like honestly, this could be nominated for a movie award even though it's a video game. And lastly this, in my opinion, is Rockstar's best work, by far. This didn't have many annoying gameplay mechanics that I can think of, there were some bugs at launch but they're fixed now, and they went all out and spent over 8 YEARS DEVELOPING IT! That is some serious dedication there. In conclusion, I totally recommend this game for full price, or even more! Best game ever."

My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone."

The game is designed in such a way that you enjoy each and every moment of the game from having a sip of beer to cutting your hair or beard . The game play is simply superb. The environment completely blends providing a real time experience rather that a game feeling. Even the music is fabulous .Hats off to the creators for such a masterpiece.

3587,KuriousKiwi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kuriouskiwi/,2,,1,157.7,May,"2,",18,0,1,"I would highly recommend this to everyone. I finished it the first time through in 120 hours, with a fair bit of free roam involved. This game is truly the best I've played so far. The world around you truly lives, every person you meet has a life, it really feels like that. The character development is stunning, the story is just absolutely wonderful. I have no words to express how much I enjoyed this. You really get sucked into the story if you allow it to, it just might take a bit of time, but as you progress through the chapters, it just gets better and better.I have to mention that this was the first open world storyline RPG I have played and needless to say, I was stunned by this. At first, before buying (I bought it in sale, for €30) I was quite hesitant. I had never really played a game like this before and I feared that the world might be too open for me; that I was overwhelmed by the openness of the country and that I wouldn't know what to do with it all, therefore sticking mainly to the story. When I finally bought and started the game, none of that proved to be true. The game is amazingly balanced in my opinion and going out hunting and exploring actually makes sense. You've got to survive in this world, making it necessary for you to go out and hunt. Meeting strangers could happen at any moment and Rockstar did absolutely not shy away with it. 26 stranger missions throughout the whole course of the game might not seem like much, but I did not even get around to playing or finishing all of them in 120 hours of gameplay. The stranger missions make the game so detailed and they absolutely add to the idea that the world around you is living and evolving while you walk through the streets. They also make you go and explore the country, explore the world, which is great. I had a lot of fun and I'm sure I will play through this a couple of times more. Overall, I would definitely recommend this to everyone. Even if you might not fancy the open world too much, the main story line is just too great to ignore."

Would I recommend this game to someone who wants an immersive world with a lot of free roam options, some choices here and there, excellent characters (some better then others, but pretty much everyone good) and some damn fine looking graphics and guns? HELL YES. The singleplayer free roaming is easily the best part of this game in my opinion. Beautiful landscapes, forests, rivers, etc. to the snowy mountains and hills up north, to the bustling streets of Saint Denis. Game looking SHARP. Characters, excellent voice acting and animations for all characters and NPCs, though sometimes you might get the occasional glitch or maybe someone doing something weird, but everything is pretty solid. The details from the forests to customizing your gun styles is beautifully done. If you want this game for a singleplayer experience, BUY THIS GAME.NOW ON THE OTHER HAND....Multiplayer is a damn mess. Some people like it, others do not. I lean on the I don't like it, but I do play it with some friends, so it isn't TERRIBLE. However, there are a lot of people who might just flat out kill you if they so much as look at you, missions can feel pretty repetitive and grindy, almost leaning towards paying for stuff like gold bars to get you special jobs like bounty hunter, moonshiner, etc. Combat is a bit of a crapshoot, since there is this kind of deck type of deal going with deadeye where you pick some things that help with your deadeye like you do more damage on horseback and other little things. If you are playing with friends, I would probably be cautious of it, but it can still be fun just to ride around, do missions and shoot people. Doing it solo? Ehhh it isn't the worst thing in the world, but they could have clearly done it a lot better.So in short, yes if you want a singleplayer game that takes a long time to beat. Maybe to no if you are mostly looking to sink time into multiplayer and such."

There are certain slight annoyances, and if you acknowledge those and deal with it, the game rewards you with a great experience.There are a lot of tiny gameplay , and for those mechanics, a lot of button prompts.  Ranging from stowing, brushing, leading, punching, guarding, drawing, many others, all within contexts like camping, or near your horse, and so on.  At first this can be overwhelming and off-putting, but just be patient and note the prompts, then perform the action.  What kept me playing is the world itself.  It's an absolutely amazing detailed  and what made it stand out from other games was the .  Wake up one day, there's a gorgeous sunrise, sometimes rain, sometimes clear skies.  You'll be walking through a forest and there's shafts of light hitting you as you walk.  Sometimes there's a haze and it pervades the air everywhere you go.  Sometimes fog, sometimes chills and your breath is steaming.  Sometimes a frightening thunderstorm passes by, and sometimes you can see it in the distance.  What incredible work they have put in to bring this in game. The weather effects existed to perfectly complement the environment. There are  areas, hills, deserts, swamps, forests.  It's amazing to travel through all these places and see the attention to detail and how realistic things look.  Of course this may not be the same view 10 years from now, but as of today it's really well done.  I took a lot of screenshots.  Don't just take my word for it, have a look at The map is huge and in this environment are scattered about, various towns, people, shelters, cities, hamlets and little cottages.   In between are vast, empty spaces where you are mostly by yourself.  You travel the land, camp, hunt, fish, and experience the wilderness.  You can get ambushed.  You can get lost.  You can meet random people and experience small parts of their stories.  You can turn off the navigation compass and just follow your nose!  It really felt like a great recreation of an , which fit in nicely with the themes of the story around the dawn of the modern age.   I liked it so much I found myself avoiding cities and taking every opportunity to travel between them instead.  And there's a lot more to do.  There's time to spend at camp, side quests, hunting for collectables, tame horses.  A lot of these are optional so you'd only do them if you really wanted to, and you don't get punished for not doing it.  The  was decent, definitely not a cut-and-dry black-and-white good-vs-evil type, it's presented in a somewhat realistic and natural pace, and just like life, there are loose ends and what-ifs.   I liked the subdued,  - there isn't a lot of music playing all the time.  There will be environmental music playing softly sometimes.  And once in a while when an actual song plays, it feels impactful.I should also point out that despite the description and appearances, this is quite a , gory game.  The slow, relaxing exploration will be punctuated by brief periods of intense violence as part of stories or ambushes, and you headshot multiple people in sequence.  There's a mechanic called 'dead eye' which makes combat really satisfying and at the same time a bit too easy."

Amazing setting and scenery. Wandering about was breath-taking and I still have many hours  of exploration ahead of me. Pure genius. Thirdly, the plot. ** SPOILERS **The story itself is written in an amazing way. It is very grasping and it is very hard to take any breaks. The progression and development of characters blew my mind. When Arthur died at the end I was gutted. I have never felt anything like that in a game. I felt emptiness after finishing the witcher 3 and kingdom come deliverance, but nothing quite like that.The only ♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing is I cannot play it fresh again. Worth every penny.

Rockstar always does a great story game in my opinion. The graphics are beautiful and on my high end rig can give me low fps at times. It's a great looking open world game with every corner having as much detail as the other, this will hold the standards of modern gaming for years, just like GTA kinda does.Online is just an incredibly watered down rdr2 made for grinding your ass off while chinese kids crash the server or snatch your IP address.Over all, 7/10.

This doesnt mean its bad thing, thanks to that they had less work and they could focus on other thingsNow time for cons, there are just small useless bunch of them.Fishing/hunting, for example hunting legendary animals. In reality there isnt any big motivation to hunt them . Only motivation  I had was crafting, you can make some special trinkets (some stat. boost)... Well hunting overall is if  want to craft like some cosmetical things or visual things in your camp. Legendary fishing is also there only for a collectible purpose/missionWell, no more cons for me .

Now I've played poker, dominos, and hunted more squirrels and animals then I've ever imagined, spent hours playing blackjack for certain hands and some other hours collecting and admiring plants, all in order to achieve 100% completion. 194 hours is what it took for me to achieve 100%, admiring the game along the way. I think that should tell you all about how much content is in this game. That drive to 100% a game hasn't come in a loooong time, and honestly I have to credit it to the phenomenal storytelling and beautiful game.

I highly highly HIGHLY recommend it! It's genuinely a STEAL on sale and I would say is still definitely worth it even when purchased for full price! This game has become my favorite game of all time shortly after starting it. I have fallen in love with some of the characters, I legit care way too deeply about pixels on my screen. It is a roller coaster of emotions, it manages to be simultaneously hilarious, fun, badass and also hit you right in the feelings. A truly immaculate experience that I don't know if any other game will manage to surpass and that I believe every single person should experience for themselves. I can already feel the emptiness that will come after finishing this game, that is why I sometimes postpone playing it because I truly don't want this experience to ever end. It has completely consumed my heart. In conclusion... just simply buy it, you won't regret it!Edit: THIS GAME HAS CONSUMED MY LIFE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL EVER RECOVER. I NEED HELP.

I hate the fact that I can't play the game right now because their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little servers are down. It basically means I don't own the game because I can only play it when they so graciously allow a mere peasant like myself to play it.It also pisses me off that while their crappy launcher is jerking off in the background, it may be harming performance and I could potentially increase some settings and get the experience I paid for.Putting a small warning about 3rd party DRM on the store front isn't enough.

However... This game is so well made and beautiful, and instead of glorifying this time, it depicts humanity for what we are, disgusting bandits, greedy sleezebags, or just poor folk trying to survive in a world that feeds on weakness. One can skip the online part completely since it's a Rockstar game. I didn't even bother starting it. I get the theory behind it (wild west with your friends yeeehaaaw), but after stepping into a Rockstar online universe once, never ever again will I make that mistake. Rockstar can create amazing games, but I have never seen a company fail so hard at online gaming as they. Even Fallout 76 is a better online game, and that says a lot."

The level of detail is mind-boggling, from the way the light filters through the trees to the way the dirt clings to your boots. It's as if you're really there, living and breathing in this incredible world that Rockstar has created.And what a world it is. The open-world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just a game, but a living, breathing world that exists independently of you. From the bustling streets of Saint Denis to the desolate plains of New Hanover, every inch of the map is meticulously crafted to create a sense of place that is simply unmatched in any other game. The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just a game, but a work of art.But it's not just the world that's so incredible. The story of Red Dead Redemption 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece. It's a sweeping epic that takes you on an emotional journey that will leave you breathless. You play as Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, and as you travel with him on his journey of redemption, you can't help but become emotionally invested in his story. The characters are so well-drawn and fully realised that they feel like real people, and their struggles become your own.The mechanics of Red Dead Redemption 2 are so satisfying, so perfectly crafted, that you'll never want to put the mouse down. Whether you're hunting game in the wilderness, robbing trains with your gang, or just exploring the world, the game is always rewarding and never dull. And let's not forget the horse riding mechanics, which are so immersive that you'll feel like you're really galloping across the plains of the American West.And if all that wasn't enough, Red Dead Redemption 2 also has an amazing, slightly controversial, multiplayer mode. But once you start teaming up with your friends to take down bandits, competing in horse races, or just exploring the world together, the multiplayer mode is endlessly entertaining and offers countless hours of fun.In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just a game, but a work of art that transcends the medium. It's a masterpiece of storytelling, world-building, and gameplay that will leave you in awe of what a video game can be. If you haven't played Red Dead Redemption 2, you owe it to yourself to experience this incredible achievement in human history."

At the moment I'm aiming for a 100% completion both in game and on steam achievements and I genuinely feel that I will be dead inside when I eventually achieve this. I've also started to play the online, (originally for the achievements) while not too polished - is fun. I can see myself playing it a fair bit before tiring of it. The game runs really well on most PC rigs, but make sure to take some time figuring out what settings work best for YOUR pc to truly get the best out of the visuals. But the story is really where the love lies in this game for me, I came from red dead redemption thinking no protag could best John Marston, but Rockstar really hit the nail in the head with Arthur Morgan's character and the supporting characters, story and environment. There's a lot to this game, you can speed through the story if you want to but you can only first experience this game once and so, I'd recommend that you take your time with the story and exploration. Do all the side missions, talk to all and everyone - go and look for strange things in the environment or even take the time to just sit on the edge of a cliff and watch the scenery. Maybe I could blame the pandemic for my absolute love for this game and for allowing me to be ""outside"" while most of us couldn't be, but truly this is Rockstar's 'hidden' gem of a game and I will continue to recommend it to anyone that considers playing."

And I don't use that word lightly.This game was perfect and has set a new level for open world games to achieve. I would have happily paid a full price for this game if I knew this is so good. Also Rockstar, if you keep releasing such an amazing game once every decade, you're forgiven for milking GTA Online and for the trash GTA Trilogy Remastered.So, about the game, I don't know how do I praise this game more so I am just going to state some facts.- This game is probably one of the best looking games out there so I don't think anything more needs to be said about how beautiful the graphics are.- It has the best open world you will ever find. You can interact with anyone you like (even animals). You can rob any train, any person, any carriage, anything. Your behaviour decides what kind of world you create around yourself. You help people? It will be rewarded in the future in some way or other. You harm people? You will have trouble in the future in some way or other. The world feels immersive, alive and is full of interactions everywhere you go.- There are 4 endings, out of which 3 are easy to come by according to your choices (I have finished one, as of writing this review). Halfway through, it picks up the pace, it will keep you on your toes and you will always want to go for that ""just one more task"" feel. The story is so good that I haven't even watched movies this good. It will take time but it delivers. All your questions will be answered so please don't google anything about why something is happening (I did, and I regret it).- Your gameplay and choices actually matter. The world that I am playing in might be totally different from yours. There are tiny elements in the game which decide a lot of conversations around you and how the world reacts to what you do. A lot of small things which you do will have an impact on the world in ways you couldn't even think were possible. It almost feels real.- Optional missions are something I tried to do as many as possible. I am one of those who hates optional content. I usually skip all of that and speedrun the story because I am here for the story. This was the first game that I have played which gave good optional missions with their own little story going on. The stories were polished, fun, emotional and sometimes even sad.- IT IS HUGE. The content in this game is so much that I don't know if I will ever be able to 100% it. Hundreds of flora and fauna to discover, so many items to look for and craft, so many places to discover (I discovered a whole new place in the last 15 min of my story). There is so much to do that I guarantee, just exploring will provide you tens of hours of fun.Rockstar, if you are going to do something like this once a decade, I don't care what you do with GTA. You're forgiven for blatant scamming."

Ciri was always the lovable daughter, Regis, Dandelion and Zoltan were always the loyal friends, and Vesemir was always the graceful mentor. RDR2 on the other hand is all about challenging that. As Arthur, you witness the making and the breakdown of relationships in a way you never believed was possible; you're forced to cope with death and farewells, struggle with identity, question human nature, and of course, find redemption. Rockstar has managed to push the boundaries of RPG story telling once again with its unique style."

The amount of content alongside the visuals, soundtrack and story is absolutely incredible, a masterpiece. Everything compliments itself very well to create a wonderful immersive experience. The open world itself is massive and there is much you are able to do that it is quite impressive. The games presentation of a pre 19th century world is quite accurate and tells a story in itself. Towns are packed with things to do in them along a plethora of dialogue between the people in it. The sheer amount of character development within the story, side missions as well as just open world things makes you connect with the main and side characters on a different level then most other games. The beginning of the game starts off slow, but once it picks up, it becomes a roller coaster of pivotal moments in the story that keep you on the edge of your seat.Wish I was able to play this game for the first time again and experience it all. It truly was a wonderful experience. I would recommend this game to anyone, full price. Thanks for reading."

The open world is really fun to explore, and has a lot of things going on, throughout my time playing, both on PS4 and PC, I've never gotten bored of it. The story is interesting and has believable characters, totally worth going in with minimal spoilers, a hard feat nowadays, but worth a shot.The multiplayer is a grind, but one that I found a lot more fun than GTAO. The gunplay feels a lot more weighty and impactful than GTA's, as well, the world has more going on. The open world has been nerfed some from singleplayer, but that's mainly small things, that would be nice to see, but aren't defining factors in the enjoyment of the open world.Overall, both the full game and buying just the online are fine options, and honestly, totally worth it to experience the game, I'd recommend it to anyone wanting an alternative to GTA, or for a fun online experience with friends."

I'm actually more of a nintendo and indie game type of person. But I won't deny I liked the game's story when I got introduced to it. But my word, when I actually got a chance to play someone else's copy for a bit... I was hooked. I got it for myself and I haven't been able to put it down very long.I love that the game lets me go at my slow detailed pace. I love the bits of humanity and cruelty that are on display throughout it. <3There are so many reminders of cruelty and beauty in the world. And as someone who shares the same personality type as Dutch... oi does it serve as a warning for me. Also dang it Arthur, I love how complex yet simple you are. Again, normally I'm more of your Artsy, Indie, Creative games sorts. So the fact that this game gripped me eventually is a huge statement to the quality of such a thing. Oh yes, and it's also been really nice to actually find a healthy way to deal with my gun phobia I got from child-hood trauma. I've never actually felt happy with a gun, but when I got to customize one and it actually felt like my personality... it was such an odd mental switch. Now my friend who loves (but is a stickler for safety with) guns can actually chat with me about it and I understand him. I actually am open to working on my phobia with him now that I have a basic interest, but again, he and I are gonna take it carefully and step by step. Glad this game opened a healthy way for me to finally be willing to tackle my childhood fear there."

Me paying way more than I should for this game each time should tell you how much I love and value it.  RDR2 is one of the most immersive games I've ever played and has one of the best written stories I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Along with the main questline are a crazy amount of Stranger Missions(Side Quests) scattered all over the game world which all are very unique with stories that are on par and sometimes even better than the main storyline. The many characters of RDR2 are very well written and you are guaranteed to fall in love with Arthur Morgan and all the other people he journeys and meets with along the way.  The amount of details in this game are also nuts! RDR2 may be an open world story game but it also passes as an actual Wild West simulator with real world simulation. Your clothes get dirty if you don't bathe, not eating has negative affects to Arthur and can cause him to lose visible weight, NPC's will react to almost everything you do and remember you for it, leave an animal carcass you've killed and watch it slowly decay over a few days, and so much more. Hell when your horse goes into the cold, their balls shrink! There is so much little details in this game that has no purpose other than making you feel immersed and actually in a real world Wild West simulation. That alone is worth the price.  Now for Red Dead Online. This is coming from someone who pretty much no lifed Red Dead Online at one point in time. HARD SKIP! Online is fun for the first few hours with friends but after finishing the few co-op story missions, all the other activities become very grindy and repetitive. If you buy Red Dead, you're mainly buying it for it's singleplayer story and not really the online component.  I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2 to anyone who is looking for a very immersive escape into the Wild West or who wants a really well written story to experience. Go have fun being an outlaw! 11/10"

(Tried multiplayer only briefly but wasn't for me and it kept crashing).The game is a roller coaster. It got me hooked from the first few minutes and I just came back for more.It also had some downright infuriating moments that had me just quitting the game. (Like horses deciding to give up on life so they casually walk into a campfire and burn to death, thus making them permanently die and leaves you stranded with your saddle.)Its riddled with bugs and archaic design and the game feels more rushed the last third of the game.Characters and enviroments appear and dissapear in just a few missions and the mission design feels like it gets more and more strict. Also your allies does not know what cover is so if you leave them for 5 seconds to loot something real quick they will die and fail the mission.I also had some issues playing through this game that hadnt been solved since atleast 2018. Things like having the wrong gun or ammo type into a ""Duel Event"" which forced you to restart events. Character also got stuck at crucial moments so had to just sit there and watch them fail over and over again until i finally got permission to skip it.Game also resets your loadout so if you prepare with certain weapons you suddenly have some other ones and since you can't call your horse on some missions you are stuck with weapons you didn't pick.The sound is top notch, the environments and attention to detail is some of the best i've ever seen. I loved most characters and how they interacted with eachother. It's enjoyable riding around to explore and I quite enjoyed doing some hunting.The world feels alive and lived in and the people you meet feel authentic.It's definitely a game I recommend despite its many flaws."

The character development is so good, you'll remember most of the npc's. And you'll learn to love your gang. You'll understand why each character does what they do. The story combined with the music is surreal. You will come to love Arthur Morgan and his gang. This is a legendary game. It is worth full price.

RDR2 is the world champion in the field of shallow game mechanics. All the 'survival' aspects are as simple as refilling your health/stamina/dead-eye. Keep clean to maintain stamina, sleep to refresh stamina, eat to maintain health, its all a slight twist on mechanics we've seen a million times over. The game also controls like ♥♥♥♥. Rockstar's commitment to animation is awesome for storytelling within cutscenses and a hinderence to your ability to control Arthur. The shooting mechanics are ancient. The game's main and side missions are ridiculously restrictive (I once failed for going back 10 feet to my horse for a different gun). The actual video game stuff is ripped straight out of PS3 era games.Luckily the game is first class in sound, visuals, the open world itself, and story/characters. The soundtrack provides so many perfect tracks for key moments. The game is beautiful. The world is a blast to explore at you leisure. The real selling point here is the story and characters. Each character is dynamic and distinct. The story seamlessly integrates the game's wide array of thematic material while keeping the characters and their development as the central focus. This is a good as story-telling has ever been in a video game. So, in short, I do not think this is the most immersive video game ever made. But, it offers something at least as good. A wonderful story that you won't forget full of great characters set in a perfectly realized world bolstered by world-class sound and visuals."

I enjoyed nearly every moment playing this game. The story is amazing and the mechanics and graphics make it better. The combat is incredible in this game. The only bad side of the mechanics is that sometimes your horse might start randomly going in a different direction then where you want it but that doesn't happen very often. If you are playing through this game for the first time, do not rush through it. The actual story is 48 hours long but for me it took around 61 hours. Also do not skip any cutscenes. In my opinion this game is a 10/10. If you haven't played through it yet then I think you should."

Red Dead Online has different roles you can unlock like trader, bounty hunter, moonshiner, etc. Also the game has a beautiful atmosphere that makes you really feel like your in the west. The online downside is that Rock star games are greedy bastards and make all the roles only accessible by gold. Which is very hard to get and the only way to get gold quickly is to buy it with money. In conclusion I give it a 8/10."

I barely wrote any review on Steam, this might be one of my first one, but I feel the need to do it, especially after over 100 hours spent playing this masterpiece.Well, the first thing about this game that really made my jaw dropped is its OPEN WORLD. Hands down this game has the best open world graphic ever. Weather effects are on point, wild animals reaction is above and beyond also. I once left my game idle for few minutes and even saw a black bear trying to catch fishes near the river. Birds got scared and flew away when you're passing by on your horse.....everything is so real in this game. And not just the graphic and its open world, the story is awesome, it feels like you're watching a movie. Game soundtracks are TOP NOTCH.But that's pretty much all the positive reviews of this game is about. I'm not saying the gameplay is bad, but for me, it aint great either. The gun fight is not intense or challenging at all. the character control, house control is just.......meh. I couldn't keep track of how many times I got myself stuck in places that Arthur or his horse couldnt even move or perform any action. Horse control is straight up horrible also, riding it in Saint Dennis is a nightmare cuz bumping into one person can lead to whole lot of troubles. To sum it up, the control in this game doesn't match its beauty.In conclusion, this game is still a true masterpiece if you don't seek any extreme gaming experience and just wanna lay back on your couch and enjoy the story line with easy, relaxing gameplay. P/s; I hope this helps. And sorry my English is horrible."

Has a great western feel to it.The AI is one of the best I've experienced in an RPG with hardly any glitches. Almost none.There are tons of side missions and things to explore and find throughout the really large map.One of the best aspects of the game is the hunting. This game blows The Hunter: Call of the Wild out of the water.There are seemingly hundreds of different animals to hunt and it's really rewarding. It's easy to load up the game and just go hunting without doing any missions what so ever and feel satisfied. Proper hunting techniques for different animals is rewarded as well and unlocks lots of unique attire and accessories. The weapon options are fantastic! And weapon modification is good as well as customization.The game starts out a bit slow but it's really good and gets you up to speed and helps you understand the game better.Once you finish up the main story, there is a rather awesome surprise that is revealed. And the game is virtually endless and playable for hundreds of hours with the hunting aspect etc.There are a few ways of travel throughout the area but horseback is by far the best. It is very satisfying and also allows you to find and experience new things all the time. Oftentimes finding unique events along the way.Definitely a very well made and thought out game, highly recommended to any RPG fan and western fan."

Upon realizing it has no effect, it transitions from a peaceful rain into a violent storm in a desperate attempt to erase the man's suffering, only dispersing on realizing the man is completely dead inside and is beyond hope. These lyrics seem to reflect on Monsoon's own life from his early childhood as a survivor of the Cambodian genocide, leaving him the nihilistic and hopeless man when encountered in the game."

Whatever it can be said about it, won't be enough. Rarely a game can leave me aching to play more - a new mission, a side activity, a stranger with an odd request. It grasps you and throws you deep in its world of late 19 century. The world of Read Dead Redemption 2 is so lively, believable, vibrant, beautiful and grotesque at the same time. As much as the real one. The characters are amazing, as made of flesh and bone. Slowly, you get sucked into it, attaching you to Arthur and van der Linde gang, craving to see more of their backstories, what life has for them just around the corner of the next day. Arthur Morgan is probably one of the best protagonists, and not only in a video game. And that speaks much of the quality of the story telling and character building.This is a game which will leave you both in love and heartbroken, and you will want more. Just a tiny bit more.

I've lived off of the land for six years in the past, and the way things fit together is nothing short of masterful. Another seemingly small factor is the attention paid to clutter; most games have stock clutter piles that just get re-arranged over and over to combine into less obvious repetition, but it is usually quite evident what they are; not so with this game--every room feels hand crafted. That kind of attention to detail is emblematic of everything in this game, which approaches perfection in RDR2."

3967,SpyTurtle49,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198355379986/,2,,1,5.7,March,"17,",171,0,1,"Red dead redemption 2 is a catalyst, a push to establish videogames as serious pieces of media that are capable of telling thought provoking and dramatic stories. Red dead 2 is, and always will be my favorite game. The cinematic tension rockstar provides to this story of a gang of outlaws on the run from the law is astounding. Every mission is thoughtfully planned and executed with perfection, every stride and adventure the player takes aren't distinguished from main story content. The richness and saturation of the open world proves to deter boredom from long horse rides, and these side missions prove to strengthen the dynamic of Arthur becoming further disillusioned from dutch, and the way things are paced proves to convey Arthur as a changed man. But no game is perfect, and red dead redemption 2 is far from it. The gameplay becomes increasingly thinned out after chapter five. What makes missions full of combat and shooting is the context behind them, there is always a reason or rhyme behind every mission. And this plays beautifully into the immersion of the characters and gameplay. But after chapter 5 this context is dropped, senseless bloodshed and death every mission becomes extremely tiring. But, I think this was a conscious choice by Rockstar. As Arthur becomes disillusioned with dutch and the gang, dutch becomes less a man of mind and more a man of insanity. And the senseless bloodshed is a part of the story, like Arthur, we too feel as if there is no reason behind all of the killing. And that dutch is leading his gang into a pit of doom. This is no way excusing the lack of pushing cinematic shootout missions within the later chapters, but it at least gives context. Regardless of its faults, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an exceptional piece of media and it is the greatest story ever told within a videogame. Every part is masterfully executed and perfectly incorporated into the plot, the music, the voice acting, the story, it is amazing. I HIGHLY recommend you buy this game, and enjoy it to its fullest.By the way if you can please play this on the PS4, all actions feel more weighty and the aim-assist helps establish Arthur as an experienced and hardened gunslinger ""Be Loyal To What Matters.""5/5"
3968,BootySweat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/quanvuive/,4,,1,397.8,March,"5,","1,151",0,1,"The best game I have ever played, the story is incredible, the characters are brought to life by very good writing and acting. Arthur Morgan is easily Rockstar best protagonist in a video game and for me is the best protagonist in any game ever. His character arc is compelling and emotional, and the actor did an amazing job voicing him. The open world is the most believable and alive open world I've ever seen and I have played a lot of them. The amazing attention to details that Rockstar put into the map as well as the AI that is head and shoulders above other open world games is present and better than ever in RDR2. Hunting and fishing in this game can be as fun as hunting and fishing in full fledged sims. There is an absurd amount of mini games and customisation that keeps you immersed into the game.However, there are still some negative. Despite having the most amazing open world to date, Rockstar continue to use the same mission design that they have been using since GTA 4. Story mission are very linear and involve a lot of just walking and shooting and generally feel very restrictive on player's freedom. Rockstar put a lot of emphasis on realism in this game, but did not fully commit to it making the game feel awkward at times, such as hunting and skinning an animal in an realistic manner but instead of setting up a campfire yourself to cook it the game automatically set up a camp for you. While the weather such as heavy rain and snowfall are some of the best looking I have ever seen, they dont really affect the player such as making them sick if they dont seek shelter. However, I understand that this is a AAA title that need to be accessible to a wide playerbase, hence Rockstar's decision.In conclusion, this game is a masterpiece unlike anything we have ever seen before and definitely something I would recommend"

The roles are:-Bounty hunter -> bounty hunting. costs 15 of gold for lvl1 and another 15 for lvl2. lvl2 suggested for full experience.-Trader -> sell goods like gta online. To build up your stock you have to hunt for animals. Cost: 15 gold bars-Moonshiner -> like the trader but more passive. Price: 25 gold bars-Collector -> find precious treasures while exploring the map. price: 15 gold bars.-Naturalist -> hunt legendary animals. price: 25 gold bars.Total: 110 gold bars (or 50 euros, if you dont want to farm)Online it's not as good as the singleplayer mode.

It reminds you of those old Spaghetti Western film from the 1930's. The set pieces are fantastic and beautiful, you have a variety of environments ranging from cold, snow capped mountains, to wide open, dusty plains and everything in between. There are so many random events and encounters that it fully immerses you in the game. The attention to detail is also fantastic. Ok this may sound weird, but I love looting in this game. It may seem like a chore to others, but how you pick up and inspect items is really detailed. The story. A truly expertly crafted masterpiece. The characters and plot is fantastic. The way you dash from town to town, each with its own aesthetic is so cool. The map is huge and expansive as well. The heists, missions, side mission, activities are so fun, I keep replaying them. Fishing, hunting, DOMINOES, poker, and five finger fillet, are all so fun. Overall, a masterpeice of a game."
3979,Bonzi Resurrectikkake,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BonziBukk/,2,,1,526.0,February,"22,",100,0,1,"9.5/10Probably one of the best games I've come across in my time on steam.  The story is top tier and the most immersive experience you'll ever play.Characters: Very rich in personality, even the random strangers you encounter in the world.  They look and act like real people instead of NPCs.  Each have their own set of troubles, tasks, dangers that they encounter.Camp: Heading back to camp after a day of hunting or fishing feels so relaxing and comfy.  The characters in the gang all have their own unique dialogues you can encounter, and if you stay in camp for a little while you might find something new.  There's favors you can do for them if they ask you, and there's some chores to take part in.  You also have to keep track of the camp's Food, medical, and Ammunition supplies.  If you keep all those three stocked up and upgraded, everyone in camp will not only be happier, but you'll get more donations in the box to resupply. Honestly very relaxing to be in.Gunfights, Exploration, and Gameplay:  Some people may get a bit tired of how the gunplay mechanics work, but honestly in my experience, it's very satisfying and rewarding.  The blood and gore is super realistic and since you don't have any full automatic weapons in there, besides the maxim gun which can rarely be found and used, each shot counts.  Rockstar games on PC eliminate the auto-aim mechanic, so free aiming is what counts.  It's a really beneficial way to improve your aiming in video games, especially playing this in first person.  The movement that you have to take note of, the tactics your enemies use, all that make each gunfight really unique.  Hell, going to a random town and starting a shootout can be a fun little hobby to pass the timeThe exploration is a big point to where this game shines.  It's a very calming journey traveling on horseback, especially with the ambient music behind it.  As there is so much to explore and take part in.  There's challenges you can complete for some upgraded gear, there's animals you can hunt to skin their pelts for upgrades and cool clothing, and the stranger missions you can encounter are 10x more fun and realistic then the Stranger missions in GTA V, and each one is more unique then the next.  There's over 200 animal species to study, hunt, and witness as you explore, as well as an abundant of plants you can harvest for tonics, and spices to improve your cooking at campfires.The game play is very fluid.  Although in the story there's a lot of """"""trailing"""""" missions, sometimes the game will skip the boring sections for you, and if not the dialogue during those moments makes up for it, as it feels really nice hearing the characters all have a conversation about different topics and the events that are about to take place.  I personally never got too irritated with the moments, because I'm pretty patient when it comes to dialogue.TL;DR, a very enjoyable and timeworthy single player experience and probably one of the most immersive experiences you will ever see in any video game. Once again, 9.5/10. Worth every penny!"

I'm really enjoying the story line. The characters are well fleshed-out and the attention paid to realism is truly amazing. HOWEVER. This is the worst PC port I've ever experienced. There is a different. button. for. everything. A button to open your bag. A button to mount your horse. A button to skin a deer. A button to pick up your hat. A button to blow your nose. A button to untangle your necklace. A button to fold laundry. A button to go rollerblading. It truly never ends. It is really hard to stay focused on the game when I am constantly looking down to figure out which button I need to be pressing. The weapon/item wheel is also very counter-intuitive and just overall clunky. Each time I boot up the game, I have to go into my volume mixer settings to adjust, or else the game plays at 8% volume. It constantly slows down my mouse settings on its own, so I also have to adjust for that. I've updated all my drivers/system and do not experience these issues with other similar style games. I know that some of these problems would be solved by using a controller, but I feel like if the game was released on PC with keyboard/mouse control capabilities, it's valid for me have certain expectations of said port. As it stands, YES I would recommend this to anyone playing with a controller or on console, but NO I would not recommend it to keyboard/mouse gamers."

The campaign is beautifully written, with engaging characters that make it nearly impossible not to get deeply, deeply attached to. The cast of characters are passionate, beautifully voice-acted, and are either extremely lovable or hateable (and that’s a great thing on both accounts) thanks to the superb writing.As for the world itself, it is absolutely riddled with levels of detail I’ve never seen before in an open-world game. The world truly feels alive thanks to all of the activity that occurs in every corner of the map. The large variety of NPC’s for example live out their day-to-day lives in a realistic manner, engaging among themselves and the player in a way that is unique and entertaining. There is also an incredible variety of animals that realistically roam the map and behave just like their real-world selves, from where they’re located to their hunting/feeding habits. There are many side activities found throughout the world that allow you to live out the rugged old-west lifestyle you hear about in spaghetti westerns, all without the consequences of the government breathing down your neck because you single-handedly drove an entire species of carp to extinction thanks to you relentlessly throwing dynamite into the town’s only source of food.The online component is no slouch either, being available to players as a standalone for much cheaper. While I recommend the full game to experience the incredible campaign experience, the online component is a very, very fun experience. The same vast world is available to you with many of the side activities found in the campaign, but now you’re able to experience the world with friends and rivals alike. When not actively engaging with other players, you can still find the same feature-rich activities found in the single-player campaign, such as hunting, fishing, stranger missions, and more. There are also features that are specific to specific “roles” that grants even more gameplay features to those that purchase it with the game’s premium “gold” currency that can either be earned in-game or bought outright through microtransactions. These roles offer more money-making opportunities while offering fun gameplay mechanics such as bounty hunting, fur trading, moonshining, and more. The only caveat to the online being that the sheer amount of work needed to get to these roles can be absolutely daunting. From what I understand, the earlier versions of this game were far, far worse. Today, there are plenty of money-making opportunities given to the player sure, but earning the game’s premium currency to buy into the much-needed roles can be taxing. The best advice I can offer if playing online is to enable 2FA to get the much need 10 gold bar head start, and to link Prime gaming to get the $1,000 that may or may be available as of right now. All in all, an absolutely fantastic game as a complete package."

4057,myopigonic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/monkerd/,2,,1,151.4,December,"24,",159,2,1,"Note: Light spoilers aheadI've recently completed RDR2 and felt obliged to review it by merit of the ongoing award season as well as the effort put in by the developers. It's certainly a game with much finesse and appetite, though, to mixed outcomes. For the sake of thoroughly assessing it's qualities, I will be continuing this review in a homage with a segmented paragraph format.The Good: The story is quite likely the best produced by Rockstar to date. The plot progresses fluidly and with unrelenting disregard for emotion over substance. Rockstar excellently smothers the player in the atmosphere of the world around them.  When you make a choice in the story, it isn't forgotten. When times are joyful, you're showered with lighthearted praise and friendly banter. When times are rough, you're subjected to irrational outbursts and pitiful pleas. Every character reacts dynamically to how you behave and operate. The gameplay co-opts this with intervals of squad mechanics, unique actions and self-aware combat for immersion in the brutality. Said brutality is also portrayed quite well for the medium, with a realistic depiction of the faults and merits of the Wild West. The game draws on the Western Revisionist tendency pioneered by films including the likes of Soldier Blue and El Topo. This is particularly prevalent with the implications of domestic abuse perpetrated not only by the uncouth barbarians roaming in rival gangs and on the frontiers but also by the ""protagonists"", including John Marston and Dutch; whom the devs took strides in showing the development of.  Perhaps more sensitive and contemporary is the depiction of the plight of indigenous peoples, which becomes especially prevalent in the later chapters of the game. You're made to writhe and squirm as they do, with an allegorical take on the abuse of their goodwill by demagogues and manipulation by would-be saviours. During this subplot, you're urged to aid their cause in varying forms but with virtually no tangible outcomes; quite aptly resembling how many feel about the present abuse of natives. Further moral dilemmas are explored in the Stranger sidequests, brilliantly expanding upon the themes of ""I Know You"" from the original Redemption. These all tie back into the honour dynamics of the main plotline, with some permanently affecting the manner of comeuppance for the doomed gang and it's legacy. Rockstar has truly come bounds from the humble beginnings of humoured killings and media outrage that defined it to craft an enduring narrative. The Bad: I'd like to dissect what I feel is the foremost issue in this game and what kept it from reaching total acclamation from myself and many others: the player is given a false sense of choice in execution. Upon indulging in commentary from NakeyJakey, Ahoy and Destructoid, I found my sense of relegation to a lofty conduit vindicated. To clarify, the player is often made to carry out tasks in a predetermined, superficial way during nigh on every mission; I recall about 7 out of the 109 mainline missions where the player is given the initiative to determine how they are carried out. This is a tragic departure from the nonlinear execution Rockstar practically invented with GTA III and improved on to practically having perfected in San Andreas, IV/The Episodes and Red Dead Redemption I. All of the aforementioned titles thrived on utilising gang combat and alternative routes to the utmost extent, so it's sad to have seen Rockstar contracted in this way. I also take issue with the karma/""Honour"" system the story is built upon. Just to polish some blemishes before delving into the matter, I finished both stories with full High Honour and siding with John, subsequently researched alternative outcomes and appreciate that it is an improvement upon the system in the first game. The most glaring flaw is that simple actions in the world do not matter. As a proven hypothesis, if you were to massacre all the NPCs of a town but then performed several charitable actions, your previous infraction would not matter at all and you could finish the game with maximum honour without it bearing any impact on your character.  In terms of the story, I feel the devs backed themselves into a corner by opting for a standalone prequel. As the conflict escalates and Arthur, the primary playable character, starts to think for himself, you are given a series of choices that determine your final leanings and subsequent ending variants. This would be brilliant if it wasn't so selective. Case in point, you are at one time allowed to choose whether you indirectly challenge Dutch's impulsive mentality via aiding the tribe and stealing medicine. At another opportunity when Arthur is questioning Dutch's plan to confront a mortal enemy and stoke conflict, the player is given no autonomy in determining whether or not they follow him despite Dutch quite literally asking for a decision to be made by Arthur. Intersecting with the aforementioned approach restrictions, there are several points in the game where you will be forced to lower your honour via robbing to progress in missions and one particularly frustrating instance of linear game design in a sandbox that forces the killing of a subdued enemy in a raided homestead barn against all rational thought for the sake of moving the story along in a particular way. For the record, it is not supposed to be a meta commentary on integration of violence in games as forced killings in Spec Ops: The Line, SUPERHOT and MGS3 are. Amongst other sporadic gimmicks with untapped potential, (i.e. dynamite setups, hostage-taking) the variations in endings stand out. There are two premises to the endings, the paths determined by a last-minute choice. The ultimate conclusion of each differs slightly based on the honour of Arthur but are essentially the same and mostly inconsequential, save for a few dialogue changes. While satisfying in their own way, they lack a fundamental divergence in action and remembrance that makes them feel somewhat meaningless in the scope of the strife endured. To the credit of the developers, it's a difficult navigation in a time where standardised karma systems prevail in ""non-linear"" games over the more fluid choices in titles ranging from Silent Hill 2 to Chrono Trigger.The Ugly: As you've all likely heard, the latest iteration of Online is an unmitigated disaster. What will be frustrating to the many playing the game for the peak quality of the story, however, will probably be some quirky bugs that break immersion. I often found that whenever I'd pause for urgent matters, especially during missions, I'd unpause and find that the galloping of my horse with my weapon drawn would abruptly cease and turn into my horse involuntary pulling 180s for the next minute as the camera jittered erratically, this would sometimes occur even without the pause trigger. Another persistent issue was the player characters pausing in their treads whilst running during open combat as I'd turn the camera. For the many who bought this game to enjoy the graphical fidelity it offers, be warned that your framerate and texture quality will sometimes drop rapidly despite the game's own assessment claiming all is running smoothly in the menu. I don't yet know if this was a fault of my PC or the game but it seems to be the latter given my high-end specs that I spent a couple years worth of savings on and similar reports.Overall, I'd say the game is a worthwhile experience. Despite exacerbated attempts at being ""cinematic"", it provides a truly compelling story that's broken ground in the medium and deserves to be remembered in spite of particular flaws that are outdone by merits. Thank you to anyone who bothered reading through this review and please vote for this as the Outstanding Story-Rich Game of 2020 because I busted my ass off on this and the devs slaved on this game ayup."
4058,✞ 𝒂𝒍𝒑𝒉𝒂 ✞,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlphaL33T/,2,,1,88.0,December,"23,",84,0,1,"is a sprawling Western tale of loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do, so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to start discussing it.So let’s start at the beginning: It’s 1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story. It’s a self-contained and linear introduction but it’s a clever one. The slick cinematics make a hell of first impression, embedding you in the gang and bringing you right up close to the characters who are doing their best to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead Redemption 2’s early controls and systems, which heightened the impact of having the full map open up to me a few hours later. The conditions on the mountain are almost claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow trapping Arthur’s feet. Being set loose in the true open world after toughing it out in this intentionally oppressive environment really underscores the incredible feeling of freedom the full map offers.And what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more varied than the one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game’s map are also included). There are snowy peaks and dank, alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus. Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and rustic charm, and then there’s the imposing city of Saint Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing short of remarkable. does an exceptional job at slowly rationing out reasons to visit every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to areas of the map I hadn’t yet visited even in the closing stages of its 60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards are kept up its sleeve, the joy of discovering new parts of the world is maintained throughout.The ability of this game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V, it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people to interact with (and potentially help), and places to scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or not. I’ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of Arthur’s story; it just helps build a world around him that made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that few – if any – games have before.The slower pace of  compared to something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur needs to physically manhandle a body to do so. Single-action pistols need to be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ before firing. Guns Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it.I suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as chore-like, but I really dig it. There’s something methodical about it that really helps ground Arthur in the world, rather than have him feel like he’s gliding through it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical process of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action rifle via a second pull of the fire button – you can even pause for dramatic effect halfway through. Rockstar’s designers didn’t need to factor that in but I think they understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle control like this subconsciously seat me into the world as Arthur even more.The unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for goodies is an interesting design decision but I quite like the risk versus reward loot loop, to be honest. Do I dart around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or do I just get the hell out of Dodge? They’re consequences you have to be prepared to accept either because your attention is needed elsewhere or because lingering around the scene of a crime naturally puts you at further risk of being discovered. Bounties don’t always come cheap. Did one of those fellas have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you’ll never know.About my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I was previously carrying are regularly swapped out for others. Oftentimes it’s clearly mission-related to ensure you go into a task with a scoped rifle or bow when required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I end up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the game trading out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of time it takes to swap back did elicit the occasional grumble from me.At any rate, it’s seriously worth settling into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because there’s just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique, one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve been privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of the world at large, a place with people going about their business and interacting with one another completely independently of you. I can’t understate the genuine feeling of life this injects into the overall experience for me.Elsewhere in the world there’s still plenty for those who care to stop and smell the roses. Newspapers sold on street corners touch on the aftermath of Arthur’s exploits, as well as other things going on around the world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take in some old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum. There’s simply too much to list."

But my review is mainly for the online as i mainly played the Campaign on PS4, the online doesn't feel as paranoia inducing as what GTA Online did this game is so much more relaxed and people just completely ignore you when passing by.And there is so much freedom you can do anything as you please, sure they have had a big nerf on the daily challenges and missions in general but it doesnt feel like as much of a grind as what GTA Onine was.With that being said i would much rather put hours into this than GTA because it actually feels like I am making a benefit with every little thing I do at my free will. And not just buying useless cars that can fly and bases that apartments that don't offer much more than an aesthetic change up..."

Absolutely beautiful not only graphics wise, but also story wise.This has nothing to do with the non-sense of GTA. There are some absurd side quests and some comedy in it, but overall it is a great drama. The story is set right before Red Dead Redemption 1, so for those who got the chance to play it on console, it's an explanation of how things escalated to the point of RDR1. For those who didn't played it, there's no problem. In fact, may be even better to play RDR1 after RDR2, so do it if you have a chance.Overall, a must play for gamers."

4085,mossfan1,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mossfan1/,2,,1,149.9,December,"1,","1,517",0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a wild western tale of loyalty, fear, drought, and infamy.This is Rockstar's most lovable and sprawling world ever, with an endless amount of things to do, hundreds of activities, countless of people to meet, thousands places to adventure to. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just Rockstar's greatest game to date, it's a wacky game with so many things to say about it that it becomes a surprisingly big hurdle to decide what part to decide discussing it first.With the game's start taking place in 1899, at the end of the cowboy-era for gunslinging maniacs -- you and your cowboy gang are on the run from the law after a goofed heist.With a retreat to the snowy blizzard mountains, it causes a surprising start to a cowboy game. And I think that's one of the things Red Dead Redemption 2 does best: its surprises. You'd expect to start in the middle of the desert, in the vast field of cacti and the coarse, rough, and irritating sand. NOPE! It's that shocking kick-start that almost thrives you to keep going, to see what else kind of a twist the game will send at you, what wackiness is ahead.I truly think this is a self-contained albeit linear introduction which I feel is done awfully well considering my description. It's a clever introduction, with a heftier push into staying alongside your cowboy friends causing a thicker bond than otherwise obtainable if you could just hop away from the instant you gained control. It also heightens the impact of finally getting the full map just a few hours later. It manages to make the world just feel that much bigger & grander, by its prime introduction.And what a world it is, even wider & varied than the one from Red Dead Redemption 1 by an omega margin. As said there are elegant snowy summits, dank crocodile infested swamps, humid forests, barren plateaus, comfortable homesteads, and grand plantations, even narrow streams and huge lakes, dusty mesas and dimly lit caves, the scary jungle of Guarma, to the muddy yet charming livestocks of towns, alongside the imposing grimy metropolis of Saint Denis... The vast assortment of ecosystems & environments seamlessly stitch together and form this remarkable & impressive world of Red Dead Redemption 2. All-together it forms this cataclysmic world and its many unforgettable adventures.So much of the world just feels so alive to just walk around in, it feels like if you never even opened up the game the people of America 1899 would still continue their lives without you, like you're nothing more than just another gunslinging cowboy in its masses from an outside perspective.It captures this by the undeniable constantly active & sprawling world of not only the game's people, but also its wildlife & nature. There are endless amount of content to interact with or even scrutinize & seemingly infinite characters to talk with and potentially help or sabotage.With the slightly laid-back & slow pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 causes this almost relaxing & comfortable experience to be held, it encouraged me to slow down physically & mentally to once-in-awhile grab a drink or setup a tent. It made it all feel less like an expedition and more like an adventure; like I didn't need to run all the time, like I could just sit down and relax sometimes. This is further supported by how you have to manually slowly loot bodies after kills, and slowly pick up items, and slowly reload your gun, or slowly cook your steak, or slowly feed your horse, or slowly clean your gun... I wasn't bothered by any of this, I almost never felt like I was in a rush or had to hurry up and do something real quick. It became very relaxing... until...GUARMA.Guarma is unironically one of my favourite parts of this game, this is due to just how intentionally stupidly paced it is compared to the rest of the game. In the fifth chapter of this game you accidentally visit Guarma -- it's singlehandedly the most annoying, tedious, and fast paced part of this game. With such a sudden jump it once again comes at such a surprising shock that almost completely catches you off-guard with your jaw hanging. Guarma is such a restricted and dangerous part of the game, with no side-missions and only non-stop constant shooting & action, with horrible people all-around & depressing circumstances it's at a complete opposite compared to the rest of the game. You get pushed into this almost unbearable section where you feel so restricted and tired of main-mission that it all turns into this sorta constant drought. You'll be craving something to do, something that doesn't kill you instantly... but it's just not there.Sounds bad, ey? yeah, it is. After finally getting through the short act of Guarma I was nearing my limit, I was so tired of main-missions & action that when I finally returned to America that I began to respect both insanely much! Guarma felt like a big ""NO!"" to push me into playing side-mission, to do other stuff, to just relax. Its trigger-throttling pace ALMOST broke me, just enough that I was hurt, but not pushed away. I began to respect the game as a whole lot more just due to Guarma, even like ~80 hours later I still am affected by the effect of Guarma. Never before have I played a video-game that intentionally went out of its way to annoy me into loving every other part of the game even further. wow. bravo!With an epicly composed soundtrack made from the talented Woody Jackson behind Red Dead Redemption 1 too, alongside tens of other skilled people brought in to help. It perfectly captures that same sorta wild west experience audibly once again.From the charming sounds of the ambient music, to the triumphant upbeat marching drum-heavy action sounds of gun-smoking blastings; they all sizzle in almost unnoticed due to how seamless they flow into the game-play itself by reproducing the same feelings using extremely smart music-theory -- and yet when removed it becomes easily noticed. The best sorta sound-design & music is the kind that you almost don't notice is playing. They all essentially become one with the game itself & yourself.THEN out of nowhere they pull out fricking D'Angelo from the grave! WHAT THE?! He just comes in suddenly like 🎵Did I... Hear a thunder? Be, bah... I hea-bah, bu🎵As usual, totally unexpected, totally bad-ass.Woody Jackson became so invested in his own soundtrack that he even begun checking whether his music was effective by listening to the music while shooting at targets using a gun from the game. He even purchased multiple of Wrecking Crew's instruments to perfectly recreate this beautiful western feel from the classic movies, and his resorts were not in vein as I believe the Red Dead Redemption 2 soundtrack is one of the bests from 2018, up there alongside Celeste's.Red Dead Redemption 2 has been my unforgettable masterpiece, and while I must admit I do not care about hunting & fishing as much as I'd've loved to, it still managed to capture me throughout its hundreds of epic twists & turns, with its flaws only striving me into a further love towards the game.It's an impressive title, and an even more impressive experience.For anyone who's capable of getting captured in a fascinating & wild story with constant hoops through an amazingly refined world with many hours worth of content, I beg you to check this game out. It's not a game for everybody, but it's a game that most will either love or hate with barely any middleground; and I believe the chance is worth the roll.Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favourites in its genres, and has supplied me with endless amounts of hours worth of enjoyable content.Also please just make a Red Dead Redemption 1 port for PC already :("

I've waited for this game to come on PC for a time, I actually didn't expect to be this GOOD!-STORY and Character Development: Arthur Morgan is one of the best characters that I have ever played! Why? It's simple! Because of the development that he gets trough the story: In the beginning he was just an outlaw (maybe with some good deep inside his heart) and he started to notice how the world changes how the most precious thing to him it's starting to disappear.. the life he had.. with the gang.. with the so called family but after he is been put trough some tests and like all heroes he passes them, and in the end he pays for the bad things that he done in his life (because that's all he knew) with GOOD things! In my book in the end he comes like a clean man, and you know why? Because he stood for what he believed and because he got smarter! Like all humans, he learned from his mistakes and he gave his life to remediate them! Arthur Morgan will live in the hearts of the people who helped (or not because you have choices to make Honorable/Dishonorable but most likely he's HONORABLE at the base so if you choose differently you are getting the bad ending which does not counts)-GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS/FREEROAM [For this I will put it in two paragraphs Multi/Singleplayer]1.Singleplayer: It's such a vast map with so much details that literally will make me spend so much time to explain what you can do, I actually think at this moment there's only one game comparable with this or maybe two( Witcher 3 and TESV:Skyrim ).Obviously there has been put a lot of work into this and it makes it feel so big and open.. it makes you feel FREE!2.Multiplayer: I like the idea but I think is not been made for this.. for me the online gameplay is boring.. why?.. because it doesn't reward you for the IDEA of being an outlaw, what I mean about this, you need to progress so slow that doesn't feel like you are committing crimes for a good living only after you spend a lot of time.. and even then you still get payed real bad, you better work as rancher for ♥♥♥♥ sake.. It feels like is consumptive you on deliberately.. which is true because they get a lot of money for this so you can get that GOLD, you either pay with a lot of time making the gameplay boring as hell or you pay.. so yeah! IT IS PAY TO WIN"

Perhaps the greatest video game I have played. A game everyone should play. Masterful storytelling this game has one of the best stories ever made, Oscar worthy voice acting, a soundtrack you could listen to over and over, an open world that feels alive but wants you dead, characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle, graphics that have truly set the bar for open world games and an experience you will never forget like never. Once again Rockstar games manage to out do themselves. You can easily sink 100's of hours in this huge experience exploring the vast beautiful world of the west in early 1900's. There's so much to do & that's just the single player experience, when you've finished that, there's 'Red Dead Online'! A huge open world with friends and foes alike! A true gem! I truly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real cinematic games and without hesitation, just buy it. Its worth every penny.I give this game 10/10. Go for It."

Энгийн үгээр бол хуучин баруун Америкийн Cowboy-той тоглоом гэж хэлж болно. 📌 Red Dead Redemption 2 тоглоомын хувьд өмнөх 2010онд гарч байсан Red Dead Redemption тоглоомын Pre-Sequel буюу зохиолын хувьд хоорондоо уялдаатай байх юм.  Бидний гол дүрийг Arthur Morgan гэх бөгөөд тэрээр Van der Linde-ээр овоглосон гэмт хэргийн бүлэглэлийн үнэнч гишүүн. Надад Arthur-н зан чанар, хэрхэн бусдыгаа асуудлаас гаргахаар хичээж байгаа болон тоглогч гол дүртэйгээ зохиолын турш бий болгох холбоог маш хүчтэй болгоход хөгжүүлэгчид үнэхээр анхаарсан нь маш их таалагдсан. Мөн түүнчлэн дараа дараагийн үйл явдлуудтай яг цав уялдаж байсан нь зохиолч, найруулагч нар хэр сэтгэл гаргасныг харуулж байлаа.   Red Dead Redemption 2 тоглоомоос өмнө Rockstar Games нь GTA5 тоглоомоо гаргаад аль хэдийн 5 жил болж байсан ч тоглогчдын хувьд GTA5 тоглоомын график үнэхээр сайн дүрслэлтэй хэвээр байсан. Гэвч RDR2-н график үзүүлэлт өөр ямар ч тоглоомтой жишихийн аргагүй GTA5-с ч илүү гайхалтай болсон гэдгийг амлаж байна. Мөн тоглоомын зохиол өрнөж байгаа он цаг, газар байршил зэргийн атмосфер үнэхээр төгс зохицсон байсныг дурдахгүй байж болохгүй бизээ. Дуу оруулалт болон хөгжмийн хувьд мэдээж маш сайн зохицолтой болсон ба тэр дундаа дуу оруулалт тоглоомын зохиол, орчинг илүү бодит, сэтгэлд хүрэхүйц болгосон. Түүнчлэн тоглоомын арын чимэг болсон ая, хөгжим, дуунууд нь яг л Clint Eastwood-н гайхалтай кинонд орсон мэт мэдрэмж төрүүлэхээс гадна тухайн нөхцөл байдалдаа нягт зохицжээ.  Тоглоомд удаан хугацааг өнгөрөөх явцад зарим нэг жижиг алдаа(bug) гарах боловч энэ нь тоглоход саад болохооргүй.(Намайг тоглоход ямар ч алдаа гараагүй)  Зөвхөн зохиол хөөж, гайхалтай дүрслэлд нүдээ унагахаас гадна маш олон side-activity таныг хүлээж байгаа.(Жишээ нь: ан хийх, загас барих, танихгүй хүмүүст туслах гэх мэт) Бас Red Dead Online гэх онлайнаар холбогдох боломжтой хувилбар ч бий.📌 Дүгнэлт: Эцэст нь хэлэхэд GTA5 тоглоомын томоохон амжилтын дараа ч Rockstar Games дахин нэг удаа гайхалтай нэгэн бүтээлийг хийж чаджээ..👉 Та бидний үнэлгээтэй санал нэг байна уу? Доор коммент хэсэгт өөрийн юу гэж бодож байгаагаа бичээрэй!(No Spoiler) .👉 Бас бидний хийж байгаа зүйлсийг дэмжиж Like, Follow, Award дараарай!"

The amount of detail and immersion that went into this game is pure insanity for instance (I was out exploring one night in the snowy mountains and encountered a deceased wolf and a smaller wolf sitting next to the body as if the small wolf was grieving for his loved one) that's just one example of the immersion this game gives you.I literally use this game to calm down my anxiety it's a great game to just sit back and get lost in."

The storyline is entertaining and there are only several weak spots during the mid-game, which may seem a bit slow-paced. If you don't feel like rushing with the main quests, you can just roam the wilderness, rob, hunt, complete side missions, bet your money in a game of poker and much more. The world is big and full of life. You will encounter travellers on roads, remote homesteads in forests and deserts, wild beasts in mountain passes etc. If you like to individualize your character (as for its stats), this game won't offer you many possibilites to do so. The only way to influence the physical strenghts/weaknesses of the character in the late game seems to be underweight/overweight, which influence the rate at which your stamina and health replenish. However, this aspect of the game was fine for me since there are other ways to improve the ""performance"" of your character - food, tonics, synergy with the horse (a fast and agile horse, or a strong and resilient stallion - the choice is up to you), a favourite weapon which slightly improves its accuracy, range or damage, etc. The only real downside of the game was the lack of possibility to set a different difficulty level. The game just seems far too easy when it comes to dealing with several enemies at the same time (you will more likely die by being kicked by a horse) or obtaining money. (Singleplayer)"

Everything in the game could be mistaken for a movie. The characters are all thought out completely and given a background even if it isn’t explored. Only problems you will have with the game are minor nitpicks and some story beats.Characters / Story	 Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption taking place 12 years before the original following a new character named Arthur Morgan. The story is all about the gang John Marston was part of and its eventual demise. It does a great job of fleshing out the enemies along with the allies. 	Throughout the story the group moves base locations multiple times, every new location bringing new story beats. Sometimes these plots are left unfinished, but the overall story thrives because of it. They help develop the characters and string them all together in a messed-up cobweb until it can’t hold anymore and all falls down in a climatic end. 	GameplayThere are multiple ending to this game all focusing around one of the gameplay mechanics, your reputation. Reputation is a new addition to this game that adds consequences to how you act in the game. If you rob the innocent or go on a murder spree it rightfully punishes you for it. 	This leads to one of the pros and cons of the gameplay itself. The story wants you to be the good guy, but sometimes you just want to be the bad guy. If you want to be immersed by this game and play it by its rules then you will have an extremely fun time; if you like to stray off the path and just mess around you might not have as much fun with this title.	All of the content besides the main missions are optional, but it is all thoughtfully created. There are many missions that you can do with other gang members to flesh out the characters more and give you great missions to enjoy. 	The gunplay feels absolutely amazing and keeps giving you new weapons or upgrades to spice it up ever so slightly. Every fight seemed great even if it just lasted for a few seconds. Overall, the gameplay is absolutely amazing and I am sure anyone could have fun with it if they just give it a try.	ConclusionIn conclusion, this game is fantastic and it is almost a masterpiece. Every character is thought-out extremely well and given character development throughout the entire game. The plot is amazing besides a few story beats that drag it down. The gameplay is well thought out and feels amazing if you immerse yourself in the game and play it by its own rules. Everyone should give this game a try if you have the ability to play it.	If I had to give Red Dead Redemption 2 a rating I would give it a 9 .5/10!"

4222,Dr.Squatch,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Master8974/,2,,1,456.4,November,"4,",92,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its aim to create an immersive and realistic world in which to play out its Western drama. The game is intentionally slow-paced, which some may find off-putting, but this pacing is designed to make you explore, take in the natural world, and discover the various secrets and encounters that are out in that wilderness.This is not a game full of high-energy action every few minutes, but a slow, and often lonely, an experience which captures the pathos of the decline of the frontier and the old west. Personally, I have spent hours simply cantering around the world, greeting strangers, interacting with random events, and observing the wildlife, nothing more than me, my horse (named roach in reference to the Witcher 3), and the wild. It is visually stunning and weather effects and lighting can give even familiar areas a different atmosphere.In the critical reviews, there’s a lot of negative remarks about ""spending most of the time riding"" or ""no fast travel""; I just don’t understand this criticism – Why would you not want to ride through remarkable scenery, encountering random things on the way, while heading to your mission? The hours spent riding through the world were probably the most immersive, most enjoyable experiences I’ve had in an open-world game for many years. Without that riding, I would never have been ambushed by the O’Driscolls on my way back to valentine, never met a crazy old man who tried to steal my horse, never camped in the wilderness and been threatened by a couple of crazy rednecks, never found out about the secret history of a certainly abandoned saloon.If games are only about action for you, then avoid this; If they are about the experience then this game will provide you hundreds of hours of entertainment."

The level of detail is frankly astonishing (I'm sure you've heard plenty of jokes about how realistic the horses' testicles are). The realistic, dynamic surroundings of this open world game is what truly makes this game feel alive. One can literally go on a horseback ride and not see the next town for a while. Just you and your horse. There's plenty to do as well I'm sure, though I haven't played story mode to completion or done much besides a couple jobs online yet. All I'm saying is that if you're looking for an open world experience that takes you back in time yet does all of what GTA Online does right, then please, please, please, buy this game.

The story development is a bit slow (in the beginning) and sometimes you need patience for hunting/fishing etc. But it is rewarding and satisfying when you succeed!I haven't played online much but it is more buggy and more frustrating sometimes lol.

4239,Skylxr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skylxr_/,2,,1,"1,404.5",October,"21,",386,0,1,"Good lord this is not what I was expecting.So 2 years ago this game came out and I saw all this hype around it. Everyone was playing it. I was never a fan of shooters or anything, and from what little I saw of it I thought ""meh, looks like just another shooter"". I was also too into Minecraft to really care about any other games. Fast forward to July 2020 and I buy it just for the sake of buying it. Thinking ""welp, I'm unemployed, can't really go outside because of this deadly virus thing, mine as well stock up on games to pass the time"". Then I don't touch it for like a month. My girlfriend casually mentions that she didn't know I had this game after seeing it in my library. So that night I install it. 13 hours later it's installed, I play it, 3 hours later I drop it after barely making it through half of Chapter 1. Then a couple weeks later I beat GTA V for the first time and I think ""isn't RDR2 just GTA V with horses"" so I play it again. I haven't dropped it since. 227 Hours and 95% Completion on my first save, and I've barely touched Online yet. I honestly think I annoy my girlfriend with how often I mention this game.This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple. I am thoroughly surprised I did not pick it up for so long. The story is magnificent, really tugged at my heartstrings at multiple points. The characters are amazing. The attention to detail for not just the main group, but every notable side character and NPC is just beyond what I ever thought I'd see in a video game. There is so much to do aside from the story, so much to explore, so much to find. Each area in the game is unique, has it's own little challenges, the people are unique to each region. All the animals you can find and hunt act so real and it just adds so much. I used to love fishing as a kid, and I got the exact same excitement in this game when a fish was on the line that I did in real life (although there could be more fish species tbh). You feel like you can just live in this world and it's just so much fun. Now, it does have its shortcomings. Fish species could be more varied, I feel like there could be more customization with outfits (only one bandanna for example), more melee weapons, etc. But these don't exactly detract from the game, and as far as glitches go I have yet to run into many at all, and the ones I have are small things that kinda come with the territory of being a video game.Before Minecraft, I thought all these mega popular games weren't as great as people made them out to be. I was perfectly content sitting with my Sonic and Mario games and being happy. But then I tried it, and I told myself ""maybe I should jump on the gaming bandwagon more often"". After that came Undertale, which I loved. Then Rocket League, which I loved. Then Fall Guys. This game though, this has cemented that mindset. I will never look past a game that hits the mainstream like this one did again.Get this game. It's worth every penny. 10/10 would accidentally hit my White Arabian horse with a train again (RIP Lilliana, you did good)."

I absolutely adored the way the story had been written, although it admittedly had some not-so-well-written part, the overall narrative was amazing, although , which was expected. It awakened lots of emotions inside me, which doesn't happen that often anymore when it comes to games. The game made me feel as if I was living in the world of red dead 2. The fantastic graphics surely made the game even more enjoyable, and I had lots of moments when I stopped to admire the scenery as well as the smallest details that kept amazing me. The fact that some parts of the world remind me of Lapland, Finland, made the experience even more great for me personally. I'm a Finn and used to visit the northernmost part of the Lapland every summer when I was younger, as my family owns a small gold mine there, So riding around areas that reminded me of the golden days of my childhood and teenager years made me feel incredibly nostalgic, in a good way. I actually finally decided to build myself a brand new gaming PC just to play the game in the best settings possible, after playing for 3 chapters on my older computer. I, unfortunately, lost my old safe files as I got my new computer due to an error in cloud syncing. I didn't mind it too much, though, because playing the game from the start on the ultra settings was definitely worth it. I also ended up seeing many more interactions the second time I started the story. I also should praise the voice actors, because they really did a fantastic job. They all fit the characters perfectly, and they clearly knew what they were doing. They made me fall in love with my favorite characters even more. Those characters being Arthur, John, Charles, Sean, Lenny, Hosea, and Sadie. I would absolutely die for Sadie. Same with Arthur. Spoiler alert,  I ended up missing playing as him enough to start my technically third Gameplay right after finishing the epilogue. Now intending to get the game to 100%.The game mechanics were quite good, though there were some minor things I think could have been done a bit differently. I don't have that many complaints about them, though. I definitely recommend this game for everyone to play. It certainly will leave an impact on you. the game is 10/10 storymode wise.Now, to the online side of the game. I have spent maybe 60 hours on RDO, and so far it has been entertaining enough for me, as I have a friend to play with and am not yet done with the story as I have been focusing on the Trader as well as Collector roles for the most part. But I can see how the online version can get bland and boring after a while of playing. There are also lots of things we are missing, and Rockstar doesn't seem to be too interested in adding some of the stuff the community has been asking for quite a while now. It's such a shame. There seem to be lots of missed opportunities. Well, maybe eventually the online part of the game will be improved, at least so I hope. The game really deserves it, and we as a community deserve it. Also if you do play online I don't recommend using your money on it, as in don't waste your money on them gold bars. It's not worth it."

A very charismatic and strong one. Arthur claimed him self up the ladder of my favourite characters in games rapidly!This game is amazing. Hi quality story content with good humor and great story telling just like always expected from Rockstar games. There is so much to do in this game you will lose your self mounting your (highly annoying) horse in the beautiful atmosphere.  Playing this with a 21:9 monitor was a blast and i am very happy for doing that, tho by having a higher 1440p resolution my PC was really sweating.  I have always had 30+ FPS so it didn't bother me much, tho i am used to play 144+ FPS... but oh well. a sacrifice to play on ultra settings ^^I did have a few bugs here and there nothing major. But the horse...... oh boy don't get me started...... it is the only reason i was glad i finished my 100% run not having to ride him/her again xDI did not touch the online mode, nor have any interest in doing so. I do hear that it is not that good. Full of hackers etc. It is nothing new. Same as GTA5 i guess ^^. If you get this get it for the story, for the HUGE and beautiful open world with plenty of activities, for a protagonist that you will really like (no spoilers) and If you have a lot of time to spend going from A to B with a some what slowish horse which  won't bother you than this game is for you.I highly enjoyed and recommend this game.10/10"

Rockstar's classic third-person open world gameplay loop, insanely fun and very simple inventory and tool management system.4. Detailed, interesting, vast open world which is very fun to explore.CONS:1. Unlike GTA Online, Rockstar has completely neglected Red Dead Online and it is pretty much dead, not at all worth the crazy level of grinding you need to do to get to the fun parts.2. Optimization still isn't 100% sorted from Rockstar's end, performance dips are commonplace.3. No Story DLC or any post-release support. The game doesn't have a good Online multiplayer experience, so at least Rockstar can consider explanding the single player campaign.4. Not exactly a con, but I have heard people complain about how slow and tedious the game is, you're mileage may vary though. It is very realistic compared to other Rockstar games.Overall, if you can wait for a steep sale which brings the game's price down quite a bit, you will love the single player campaign on this one."

This game is no exception, once you start playing the game you can tell it's a world that functions regardless whether you're observing it or not. The use of professional actors does pay off, thousands of unique voice lines and even a casual conversation can be overheard by simply observing basic pedestrians.... The game offers a beautiful story line, but don't rush to beat it just yet. With side quests that feel like a harmonious expansion to the main story- there are no side quests. Every side mission is really just an opportunity to immerse yourself more into the story and learn more about characters, whom you will not be able to remain indifferent about. I've greatly enjoyed this game, even after fully completing it. It's the best sandbox the industry of gaming is able to currently offer.Now that were over with the good lets get to the bad and the ugly.The Multiplayer state is just like any other Rockstar multiplayer:A nice 'pay to win' incentive is a Rockstar trademark for Multiplayer games, allowing you to skip the grind and just straight up buy anything you want with real money. While its very ambitious the kind of activities in place, the multiplayer is designed for a Utopian society where-People will never want to bully/flame/impede on others' progress and would always love to cooperate. Turning most of your player encounters into just basic KOS (kill on sight) PVP. (this is written before any mp dlc, not sure how much of that DLC could really change)In addition the devs have removed the ability to install any kind of mods that the community has developed over the years, and now modding your game for SP can be tricky and can also trigger a ban in MP (for cheating), which is sad to see because the mods are a very nice addition to the vanilla experience.With multiplayer experience being questionable be warned that you might be buying the game only for its SP experience(Especially if you decide to MOD the game in any way). I would recommend buying the game with a discount.Overall its an amazing game and you will probably not regret getting it."

The story will keep you bound to it but the pace at which it progresses might not be everyone's cup of tea. The characters are very well written especially Arthur Morgan, the protagonist himself and the world feels truly alive with the ability to interact with every single NPC as you can engage them in a conversation, both friendly and non-friendly and even rob them if you want to. The gameplay is pretty immersive with the introduction of more RPG-like elements, to name one, Arthur will need to be kept well-fed in order to maintain his weight which will have stat boosts accordingly making it more realistic than ever which could also feel like a burden at times. The soundtrack is just a true masterpiece which will certainly enhance your gameplay experience.Overall, Rockstar Games have managed to outperform themselves yet again by giving us another great AAA title which does have its flaws but is nearly worthy of being called a masterpiece.Update: Truly one of the best gaming experiences in all of the industry. Still find myself going back into the wild west just to take a breather from real life."
4329,Me no Totoro,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003586399/,2,,1,329.0,July,"29,",187,0,1,"A little background info and put you in perspective, I was never into cowboys, old western weapons, horses, rugged life or Dutch's damn plans. I really just tried this game because it has a R* logo and I thought my money will at least be worth it with the singleplayer experience. But, just a little over 30 hours of gameplay, it already had me hooked into the genre, I began looking up and learn about horse breeds and repeaters online. THIS GAME delivers you an experience that cannot be replicated. The world(map) is very spot in the sense that it's empty enough for you to feel grateful of how far humanity have come today, and it's also alive enough for you to admire wildlife and its beauty. It also has a huge and rapidly expanding city of San Denis for you to compare and contrast the different lifestyle people live. The jungle and dessert are vast with wild predators lurking in the dark, and despite armed to the teeth, gators in the swarm or cougars in the woods could sometimes take on you by surprise.The weapons are very very well made that you can see the jump from a single action revolver to a semi automatic pistol could mean day and night in a gun fight. You can feel the single action in your controls as you need additional action to pull the hammer back. Same with the repeaters. It is also, in my opinion, a very good change of pace compare to modern shooters or GTA, your aim means a lot more when you are loading bullets in one by one and doesn't have fully automatic weapons that could simply spray and pray. The singleplayer, without spoilers, put you in a lot of choice makings and they do matter in the end. The story itself is not Oscar worthy (unless you compare it to that modern Hollywood trash, then it might as well be), but it does it's job perfectly to hook and capture your interest. Some of you folks might only want the game for Online (I did), but I still recommend the Singleplayer as I believe it will change your perspective to see life in a much different light. The multiplayer is as tragic as Darth Plagueis the Wise; with GTA Online(GTAO) being the billion dollar success, it is only logical for R* to put most of their attentions into GTAO instead of Red Dead Online(RDO). After all, the old American west is more or less a niche market, as I mentioned above, I wouldn't discover it if I didn't buying it for the sake of R* Games. With that being said, it is still being updated with contents, but it's more or less just repetitive grinding that takes advantage of it's solid base gameplay. The are WAY, WAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY less griefers in this game as R* took a huge step to hide blips off the global map and with defensive mode enabled, if people engage you they will receive a debuff while you receive a buff to fight those people off. The majority of the player base of Online are friendly and PvE focused. Do keep in mind that modders will be a thing and they are capable of doing things to you similar to GTAO fashion, but their numbers are much fewer than GTAO as you are gaurantee to spawn in with one in GTAO. The premium currency, gold bar could be purchased with real money or simply by playing the game. All in all, Just grab it, for whatever amount you pay for this game, the amount of content you get is a great deal."

It is a game that is rich in strongly defined side missions, characters are principled and effected by the world. I am not a fan of the Grand Theft Auto series. The way the shooting plays out in that game seems kind of silly for modern weapons but seems to fit beautifully in this era of United States rough and tumble Romanticized Westerns.If you are here for a game with a solid shooter system, that his rich characters that change over time, and emotional investments that consistently shatter. Red Dead Redemption has for me personally been the most redeeming game for my belief in Rock Star Studios. Now for people asking if it is worth $60? Yes if you can get it on sale it was borderline theft. You might as well have a bounty upon installing the game. I personally thought the game ended in multiple chapters at multiple times but the content just kept going. It was beautiful!As far as Red Dead Online, its been a while so it is pretty not alive, but even the online has a mini story you can do which is extremely cool bonus feature for the solo player.

4366,SerinVeya,https://steamcommunity.com/id/serinveya/,3,,1,177.5,July,"6,","1,005",0,1,"Many years ago, I tried to play the original Red Dead Redemption. While I could understand the appeal, and even found the multiplayer suite to be a lot of fun, I just couldn't bring myself to stop and enjoy the game in the same way I had, at the time, played through Grand Theft Auto IV. The game felt overly confused with its attempt at pacing, trying to feel as fast as a GTA game in its gameplay, but its storytelling being as slow as molasses.With Red Dead Redemption 2, I kind of expected the same experience. Significant burnout of interest in the single player experience, given my overall enjoyment of Grand Theft Auto V, but some mild entertainment with Red Dead Online to convince me not to request a refund. I'm extremely glad to say that not only is this not the case, but Red Dead Redemption 2 has become my new favourite Rockstar game to boot.Red Dead Redemption 2's greatest success, in my eyes, is discovering its own approach to pacing. Compared to the first game, RDR2 is much slower by comparison. Which is normally a death sentence for me, given how little I tend to jive when it comes to slower narrative and gameplay experiences. But what RDR2 gives up in speed, it makes up for in fluidity. Horses in RDR1 felt like sports cars with tank controls, but horses in RDR2 feel real and do an exceptional job of reacting to every part of their environment. RDR1's shooting controls felt like a shoddy Gears of War clone in terms of the bizarrely fast character walk speed and weaker weapons more reliant on volume of fire instead of accuracy. RDR2 makes up for this with each movement in combat feeling appropriately weighted, with the player needing to consider their options before making movements. On top of that, the weapons feel absolutely spot-on this time around, with everything having an appropriate amount of punch and feedback. While the game feels physically slower, it feels more natural to move, ride, and shoot because of how much detail there is in the player's movements.The continuing trend of the fluidity of its pacing continues into its narrative. The game's story is relatively slow, as it took me nearly 60 hours to finish the story mode through to the end. But instead of constantly rolling my eyes and wondering,""Oh god, can we just get to the next story beat, please,""I found myself instead enjoying every small activity along the way. It didn't matter that I wasn't riding off to the next big bank robbery or standoff with the rival gang. The best part of this game is the time you spend with your caravan crew. The big moments felt great when they happened, don't mistake me. But unlike Grand Theft Auto V, when I was required to slow down to enjoy the company of my companions, I absolutely enjoyed every minute of it, even if the activity was minor. This is also in no small part to the cast of fantastic characters and the amazing performances of the actors bringing each of them to life. Arthur Morgan is an excellent player avatar character, and his relationships with Dutch, Micah, John, Bill, Charles, Javier, and everyone else in the caravan allows the player to experience and enjoy each of their stories as well.The only real problem with Red Dead Redemption 2 is, ironically, its predecessor. Namely, how much you actually played through Red Dead Redemption 1. This is a very large double-edged blade, since RDR2 is a prequel to the first game. Despite being set several years before the first game and being largely disconnected to what happens in RDR1, echoes of what happens in RDR1 can potentially have an effect on the level of engagement you're having in some of RDR2's highest moments of tension and drama. I, thankfully, never really had any time with RDR1, and that ended up being the best-case scenario for me since knowledge of who's alive, active, and appears in RDR1 didn't get in the way of what's happening in RDR2. But that, inevitably, won't be the same story for everyone else. And I find that kind of a shame, since the writing is very much on point in favour of those who didn't experience RDR1.The final touch point is Red Dead Online. As someone who really enjoyed RDR1 multiplayer and spent a ton of time loving GTA Online in GTA5, I was pretty thrilled with the idea of GTA Online levels of fun, variety, and customization in the same infrastructure of RDR1 multiplayer. And Red Dead Online absolutely delivers. While I made the mistake of logging a few hours in RDO before starting the story mode, as the story mode has a much better introduction and tutorial compared to RDO, I found myself falling quickly in love with it. You make your own outlaw, much like your own character in GTA Online and as opposed to the preset characters from RDR1, and the amount of things available to create your own character identity and look are even more expansive than the options present in the story mode. While it can be difficult to fill lobbies for early story missions, as most regular players have long since played through these story missions, they're still structured quite well and are very enjoyable.The only real point of note is RDO's approach to microtransactions. GTAO is largely notorious for its invasive approach to microtransactions by having its best gear and cars locked behind immense price tags that are most practically remedied by expensive microtransactions. This, understandably, creates the frequent opportunity for a significant gap in power between players who work to unlock new items, and those who shell out the real money for their advantage. Rank restrictions are in place, but the price tags are the real measure of who crosses the finish line first. RDO somewhat attempts to remedy this by creating a separate currency type, gold bars, to separate it from the game's regular money. Gold bars have the immediate, distinct advantage over GTA$ in player friendliness by being restricted to cosmetic purchases. Gold bars can be used to purchase cosmetics without the rank restriction for an inflated cost, and cosmetics restricted to gold bars only for purchase are in agreeable price ranges for those who are exclusively earning their gold bars through gameplay. The system isn't perfect, as gold bar purchase prices are expensive and gold bar payouts for in-game activities are low. But compared to GTAO, this is a far more agreeable system that can easily help with retention.Red Dead Redemption 2 was a game I really, truly wish I played when I first had the chance. It easily would've fallen under the umbrella of my favourite games for 2019 overall, and absolutely has become one of my favourite games of the past decade. It stands in defiance of my usual preferences and wins my heart in spite of fighting uphill to earn it. Despite not connecting with the first game at all and skipping it in favour of more Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption 2 subverted every expectation I had of it and more. It's an amazing game with a fantastic story and some truly engaging gameplay, and I enjoyed every single second of it."

The story it's perfect .Arthur's path  really hits hard , all his regrets , guiding him towards redemption , I'm sure all the other players feel the same . both gameplay and story , 10/10 . However the online it's a different story with many bugs and glitches , hackers , lack of content and all the rest . Playing the online with it's mechanics of making money gets boring but you still have a beautiful ground to explore with your friends . If you have a posse full of players and you're all just chilling , even talking in camp by the campfire , it's worth playing it ."

The main character, the amount of lore that is added to the first game, the attention to detail and how NPCs react to different situations.  All of these things make this game a masterpiece.  Add this on top of incredible amounts of customization for Arthur, his weapons, and his horses and R* has created something that would be incredibly hard to top.  Rare moments in this game which change to how you approach a situation, dialogue that was put in the game that you may never hear if you don't play a certain way, this is what makes this game special.Example: I was doing a bounty for a man who was a criminal.  He was with his wife and kid.  This was my second play-through.  The man asks if he can speak to his son for a final time and then he will come with me quietly.  In my first play-through, I had allowed this and remembered that if you allow him to speak to his son then he will escape off the horse and you will be ambushed on the ride back.  In this play-through, I decided that I would shoot his wife in the face before he asked to speak to his son. This opened up a whole new dialogue.  He screamed at me the entire ride back, calling me a woman murderer, a coward, etc.  The ambush never came on the way back to town.  When I put him in the cell, he told the sheriff that I had killed his wife and that I should be behind bars.  Arthur replies, ""You know this business, Sheriff, things happen.""  Small differences in gameplay that aren't obvious but have been accounted for by R* is what makes this game special."

The storyline is addictively immersive, the gameplay physics are absolutely flawless, the combat engine is probably the best I have ever played in a PC RPG - this is definitely one of the best RPGs that has ever been made."

Its been 2.5 year when this game got out, but who dont care bout fps and can play it on 30 to 60fps there are a lot of Attention to detail. Every thing you see have some really good detail. Awesome thing is freemode and bounty you get for doing bad stuffs in game, you must pay bounty bill to be okay in some parts of the cities or villages.My Ratings for this game:Graphics Quality: 10/10Story Mode: 9.5/10Freemode: 10/10Online: 6/10Game optimization: 4/10 (They literally just transfered codes from consoles to PC, this isnt okay for big company like this)Loading time Storymode/Online: 10/10      /       9/10"

There is so much to it with very little negatives in my personal opinion; * The story is amazing, the characters introduced all feel like they give their all so you as the player gain a full understanding of them and their story. * You're alright boah.* The world looks amazing, even on lower graphics, the map size is incredible too!* Interactions take place everywhere, each one is creative and makes the world feel more alive and immersive. * The easter eggs are pretty good, I would ask for more interactions with them but other aspects of the game make up for this, such as the amount of easter eggs. * The gameplay was never jittery and never stuttered for me apart from once or twice in Saint Denis, but I feel this is to be expected (especially when I was playing on near high graphics). The only downside I'm aware of is the multiplayer, now I haven't played much multiplayer but when I did play I experienced some lag, constant player harassment (no-one wanting to play friendly, such as GTA 5), lack of stuff to do. It is more suited towards those roleplay servers in my opinion rather than to play for fun, especially since you have to grind to do missions etc."

If you are averse to slow animations, immersive interactions and a general slow pace this isn't for you. If you are willing to give it a real shot, to take the time the game asks of you. You'll find something special.Red Dead Redemption 2, is by far Rockstars strongest narrative game.Missions should be viewed as interactive movie scenes as it's less about finding unique solutions to the problem presented and more going through the motion. This might not be to everyone's liking but it's how the story missions are structured. The Open World, is where player freedom comes in.The level of immersion you get from the writing, to the world and how you interact with that world, leaves other Open World games lacking in so many ways. Just the simple act of being able to ""Greet"" or ""Antagonize"" every NPC, seems like such a minor thing but it adds so much to the experience.The amount of talent Rockstar can find for the voice cast and then make use of with their incredible script and direction, is awe inspiring.I beat it on the PS4 after 140 hours of play with 89% completion.Am currently going through it again on PC, sitting at 121 hours of play with 64% completion.This time I intend to leave the game once I see that 100% after about 500 hours of play.If you're truly not willing to buy the game full price but do have an interest, then I encourage you to grab it during any sale event. You will not be disappointed.Performance is smooth though the amount of frames I get isn't in the hundreds. I get frames ranging from the low 40 to the high 60. Settings are a mix of mids & ultra.Even then, the game world and characters look beautiful.So if you're willing to swallow your pride and lower some setting here and there to get that stable frame rate, you'll have a grand time playing this.RIG:GTX 1080ti,I7-7700K 4.20GHz,32GB Ram,2560 x 1440p, 144hz monitor"

Since i can't, i'll just go with a positive one since i feel it wasn't wasted money. To the review:The goodThe best of this game you probably heard already. The story is excellent, the graphics are beautiful, music is incredible, acting is top-notch, there's loads of good content, shrinking horse b... so lets proceedThe badThe ""cream"" of this game is of the best quality, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the pie, AKA its game design. The gameplay mechanics feels like a mess of ideas, as if the developers couldn't decide where they wanted to go with it. There's a constant inconsistency that often left me confused as for what was expected of me, and what i could or not do. To give some examples: -I completed a side-quest where at the end i was allowed choose between capturing some escaped criminals for the bounty or leave them be. Right after, i left to do a bounty mission that gave me a scene where i just felt like leaving the guy be, except this time i wasn't allowed to (i even tried walking away, but only got a ""mission failed"" screen and was forced to restart).-When doing crimes you'll often get recognized unless you wear full face mask and use clothes nobody in the region saw you in (sometimes even that isn't enough). Then there's a mission where you use a ""disguise"" that's just a pipe and a different hat (in a town where you were constantly frequenting) and apparently that does the job of hiding your identity just fine.And thats not even going into the clunky controls that made me choke an innocent bystander woman when all i wanted to do was hop on my horse, that stopped me from aiming my gun when i was being rained with bullets, or the terrible key mapping and dozens of different menus that could have very well been simplified, and why is it fine for random guys to beat me up in front of an officer but when i reciprocate its police gunfight time? There's plenty of other annoying moments born from the game's poor design choices, but lets proceed...The uglyFor starters, the Rockstar Launcher DRM. It requires you to connect to the servers every time you play the game after turning on the pc, needless to say how inconvenient that can be. Then there is to confusing graphical settings. Although its possible to run the game above the console quality with a GTX 1070, it takes a LOT of tweaking and research, with some settings needing to be on ultra (since any lower will look ugly af) while others having to be medium/low (on the risk of eating your fps for basically no visual gain).And then there were the crashes. Towards the end of the game, the game kept crashing randomly in the middle of missions for no apparent reason. All i could do was meddle around with some stuff, pray it doesn't crash on critical moments, then meddle around some stuff again when it finally did.The loading screens, oh god the loading screens, and why i can't pick the save that i want when i start the game?Veredict: There's definitely things to enjoy in this game that you'll be hard pressed to find in other games, but be prepared to deal with a set of annoyances."

I know i'm late to the review party, but the COVID isolation is getting to me and i wanted to make this my first ever steam review. So to my unsolicited review of possibly my favourite game of all time. (potential bias ahead) I have to say to anyone unsure of whether to play this game or not, this is easily one of the best pieces of [shall we say] ""visual media"" that i have ever experienced. Yes the game is immaculately made with some of the best graphics we have seen in gaming, i'm not really sure that is up for the debate, perhaps it is but i'm here to mostly talk about the story as I honestly believe it to be the games best quality. Those that have played the game through to its conclusion will probably understand what i am about to say, but there are some people I know who traded the game in before even finishing the middle chapters! I know, the nerve of these people... I have heard personally from both friends and people online that they found the game slow and boring, at least to start. I reject this completely as i'm sure many others do. Is the beginning of the game slow? Sure, i can see how it is viewed this way. But boring? um, no, i think you are boring lol. If you have been looking to play this game and have heard about the ""hike"" it takes to complete, i implore you to ignore this viewpoint. This game has some incredible storytelling and the rewards for sticking out the world and character building from the early sequences of the game (and of course throughout) are unrivalled in my opinion. Not only is this a beautifully made game, it is so well written and incredibly deep and heartfelt in many instances. This is a game full of exploration, not only of the beautiful world on display, but the characters too. There are several character studies on display and its so well done that you don't even realise the exploration of the human condition from the start of the game and through to the end. Themes such as family, trust, brotherhood, love, loss and everything in-between are all explored in GREAT detail. Anything from the main characters, to the NPC's are all so well thought out and planned that the simulated world you play in feels real. You will find yourself lost in this world and in the narrative served to you on a plate of gold if you just give it the time it deserves. Play this game, Boah! You will not regret it. Love,T x"

There is a deadeye system which basically slows time (in story mod in online there are ability cards you can combine with deadeye) and you can unlock advanced forms of it in later game .Also there is a cover system which works exactly like GTA V’s but in Red Dead Redemption 2 some of the places you can cover are penetrable so you should choose your cover wisely .The horse AI in this game is awful, if you’re new to the game you can’t use jungle or mountain i literally mean you can’t you will end up falling constantly that you will immediately close the game .And one of the most important gameplay feature is camps ,sometimes you can just stay in the camp talk to all the gang members, listen their conversations, their thoughts and the stories they had to share. There'll be times when the gang will be celebrating on some occasions and sometimes there will be campfire songs that will feel cosy.OPEN WORLDRed Dead’s open world is far best open world i have ever been part of. It is a dynamic world teeming with life in every nook and cranny. From livestock towns to marshy swamps to hustling and bustling metropolis to snow-clad mountains to barren desolate deserts the game presents you with amazing and varied environments and vistas to explore. The seamless blending of all these diverse locations as you traverse through the sprawling open world is truly impressive. There are no annoying loading screens which makes it all the more immersive.ONLINEAs the old saying goes everything good has a bad side and in Red Dead Redemption 2 that bad side is online .In online servers there will be lots of server related bugs even most of the time you will get kicked .And about hackers there aren’t that much Modder like there was in GTA V but Rockstar never bans the real cheaters they only care about their premium currency which is gold .If there was a cheater in your lobby with god mode and teleporting you to wherever he/she wants Rockstar probably won’t do anything but if a cheater spawns treasure chest in front of you and if you take them you will probably get banned ,and Modder will roam free because they don’t detect cheats they just look to your gold history and if it seems suspicious they ban you like they did to me .But there is also good sides of online like community ,it makes easier you to make friends and if you like grinding you can still have fun just a little advise if you see a Modder just leave the lobby immediately."

However not too long after it went on sale for a slight discount on the Playstation Store for Black Friday I decided it was time to give it a try. I had no idea what I was getting into. Do yourself a favor and play this as blind as possible. If I had the chance to wipe the memory to play it blind again, I would.It's easily one of the best looking games on PC so far. I don't even know how to begin describing it. Clouds randomly generate in the sky, if you're on a mountaintop looking over the map you can see the shadows cast by them. All the weather effects are dynamic, it'll begin to fog after a heavy rain, roads become muddy, your clothes soak water, you can chase storm clouds across the map, snow has a haze, light shimmers and creates god rays through trees and fog, it just looks so damn incredible. The music is okay. The ambient overworld tracks could have definitely used some work because they just play randomly and some are quite repetitive. The mission specific songs are great, but the vocalized OST is where it really shines. All of them are pretty good on their own, like ""That's the Way It Is"" by Daniel Lanois. Listening to it without playing the game you think it's just a sad song, but after playing the game up to the point where the song is played you realize the true meaning of it. To me, that's the kind of music that makes a game so great. The kind that can make you feel genuine emotions while listening to it. If you spoil it for yourself by looking it up you're missing out. Seriously, don't look at the comments section of that song if you intend to play this game and enjoy it.Without going into specifics about the story, it's a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, and not a sequel as the name would suggest. You play as Arthur Morgan, right hand man to Dutch Van Der Linde in the Van Der Linde gang. It's up to you to help other members of the gang through thick and thin as you run from the Pinkerton detective agency after a botched robbery in the town of Blackwater. After chapter 1 the game world opens up almost completely, save for the entire area from the first game, minus Mexico, and the entire map is MASSIVE. How big is it? If you go from Strawberry to Van Horn, a distance of about half the map, it takes up to 10-15 real time minutes at full speed on your horse. The missing area you can't get to for the first portion of the game is only about a third of the total map size. Every inch of the map is beautifully detailed, from flora-rich forests and hillsides, to plains, industrious cities, and even snowy mountains. Yet for as big as it is, it's never empty. There's always something to hunt,a fish to catch, herbs to gather, strangers to meet, goons to kill, things to steal, it's almost endless. Everything is finely detailed, and you can even fully customize your weapons this time around, from changing the wood type and color to the color of individual metal parts and even engravings and even still the color of the engravings.Even at full price, you'll get your money's worth. I only just completed the entire game for the second time since PS4 and look how many hours I have. You wont find another game this good in longevity and writing for quite some."

Perhaps the greatest video game I have played. A game everyone should play. Masterful storytelling this game has one of the best stories ever made, Oscar worthy voice acting, a soundtrack you could listen to over and over, an open world that feels alive but wants you dead, characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle, graphics that have truly set the bar for open world games and an experience you will never forget like never. Once again Rockstar games manage to out do themselves. You can easily sink 100's of hours in this huge experience exploring the vast beautiful world of the west in early 1900's. There's so much to do & that's just the single player experience, when you've finished that, there's 'Red Dead Online'! A huge open world with friends and foes alike! A true gem! I truly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real cinematic games and without hesitation, just buy it. Its worth every penny.I give this game 10/10."
4520,JSun,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198375186023/,2,,1,170.9,February,"21,",69,1,1,"(I got this as a gift)I really enjoy this game. So far, I am done with the story and there is still more content and stuff to do. I always feel occupied, and when I'm not, I just take in the serene views of the world. It feels like real life, and most everything in the game I like. there are a few problems, and I will try to detail them.Most of the combat in this game is the same. Shoot, dead-eye and then the combat is over. It gets very repetitive, and sometimes you with the story explored more of the physics and possibilities of the combat. however, every combat mission (and there are a lot) mostly focus on the cool gun bang bang action and maybe some of the hand to hand combat. There have been some complaints about the mission layout, and how it is the same every mission, and basically the same as GTA. I have never played a GTA game, so I can't comment on that, but later on in the story, the missions do start to blend together and feel the same. However, that complaint is very minor, and only in the last chapters do you start to feel that sense, and it really isn't a large presence in your mind. Maybe if I played more rockstar games I might have felt it more, but I really didn't feel it. while we are on the subject of the missions and story, it is insane how good it is. Every gang member in the gang feels real and has real feelings, at least that is what I thought. Along with that, the mini-games and hunting, as well as the side quests feel really smooth and well thought out. I spent a lot of my hour time just looking for hunt and playing poker and five-finger fillet. Also, there are plenty of treasure maps and puzzles to solve for more money. And, if you feel like more action, you can go Rambo on all the plebs and go on a killing spree. Back to the story. The story is amazing, as I would sink hours just playing missions and making predictions in my head. The plot twists always felt fresh, and the story never draws any punches. I have heard some complaints that the story is to long, and that is should have ended at one of the chapters. I think this is a complete false. the story could have gone on for at least ten more hours, and I would still love it and play it more, awaiting my next move. But, like I said, this is my first rockstar game, and if I played more games by them then I might have thought differently. Lets talk about the graphics for a moment. I have a pretty low end GPU, and I still would waste days of in-game time just taking in a horses nose and the landscape. There are veins on the horse, and they behave like I would think a real horse would. I have also heard complaints that there are so many unnecessary details, but I think that it really helps build the world. There are a few bugs in the graphics and the cutscenes, like people not saying their lines, and people bugging out. These moments aren't very frequent, and they in no way break the game. I have also experienced crashes and some weird connection issues and error messages. This, for me, is the most annoying part of the game. I just want to play, and I do with they fixed more of these. The map in Red Dead is HUGE. It is filled with minute stranger details, and little details that you would miss on first glance that make the world seem so much more alive. I do feel like there is a little too much of this, however, and it is more manageable in the south. I feel like the cowboy era would be more lonely, not filled with people in the streets. you go into a discreet part of the world, just to envelope the sounds and graphics (which are amazing) only to find that some waiter is there, and wants you to help him find his girlfriend, or free him from a bear trap, or give him medicine, is it too much to ask for some alone time? This is definitely nit-picking, but I do with I could just trot with my horse with no one around. The cities (Saint Denis in particular) are stunning. There are little quirks, like a salesman trying to sell an article about white supremacy, that you would never find in a modern era setting, but also barbers, and street trolleys. There is something so familiar about stepping into a city, but there are also minute details that someone would miss. I would give this a 9.5/10. The story is something to remember, but I do wish there were less bugs."

Seriously, no game I have ever played has come remotely close to this. RDR2 is in a league of its own. The amount of detail and heart that went into this development of this game must've been unfathomable. If you get this game, do all the white missions first so that you get to experience those are they are a big part of this games experience, as those as temporary missions/side quests that can disappear if you do not initiate the event within a certain time frame. The yellow missions are the main story and stay on the map till completed. Don't rush through the game, there's so much to do that you'd end up enjoying it more if you take your time and do the activities the world has to offer.I love everything about this game. Trying to pinpoint bad things is this game is genuinely hard. The voice acting is next level, and the animations are really refined as well. I will never get bored of putting a sawed off double barrel shotgun underneath the chin of a rowdy civilian or O'Driscoll and blowing their head clean off their shoulders. It never gets old.Performance wise I'm not having any issues. Some aspects of the controls and menus definitely show that this game is a console port.  I've had 1 crash the whole time I've played this game. Pushing 60fps at medium settings on a Gtx 980, i7 6700 @4.0Ghz, 16gb ddr4. Also using an xbox controller, game was kinda designed for consoles initially.10/10. Perfection is impossible to reach but RDR2 flirts with that fine line and comes closer to it than any other title ever released imo."

However, in the last two weeks I have not had any additional problems logging in to the R* servers and I have been able to play the game for about an additional 18 hours.  I have to admit - this game is spectacularly good.  I am completely and totally addicted to this thing.  Be warned, however, that it requires a tremendous amount of PC power to run this game.  I would imagine it is one of the most demanding games currently on the market in terms of hardware.  I am running an i7-9700k overclocked to 4.9 GHz and an RTX-2080 on a 1440p ultrawide and even at medium graphics settings I am only averaging about 60-80 fps!  I've been able to max every other game I've played so far on my system, and most run at 100+ fps.  But my god this game looks incredible even at medium settings!ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've only played this game for about 8 hours so far and it seems like a great game, the attention to detail is quite extraordinary.Unfortunately I cannot recommend that anyone spend $60 on this game.  Particularly if you are like me....a man in his 30s who has kids and has VERY LIMITED TIME TO PLAY.  When I have some free time to play, I NEED TO BE ABLE TO.  Otherwise its a complete waste of money for me.  Hence is the case here.  I have not been able to log onto Rockstar's ridiculous server or social club or whatever the ♥♥♥♥ it is they call it.  Frankly I don't care.  I paid $60 so I could play a SINGLE PLAYER game in the very limited free time that I have.  I'm moving onto another game.  I should be getting my money back for this, and if I had the time I would probably start making phone calls until somebody gave me my money back.  But I don't have the time to bother."

Rockstar (for some reason) enabled a lock on changing graphics settings if the resulting VRAM usage is over capacity -- even if the change was to LOWER the settings after it started out too high!PROTIP, if you have this issue and desperately need to get your settings down to play (make sure you understand what you're doing before you attempt): Go to your save folder (in my case, Documents/Rockstar Games/Read Dead Redemption 2/Settings) and edit ""system.xml"" in Notepad.

Teeps:Read your journal from time to time, it gives light to a lot of backstory.Blow the ♥♥♥♥ out of legendary animals, they can't get ruined pelts.Grab an Arabian horse right after the intro (end of snowscape.)Use your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bandanna when committing crimes.Change your outfit to not be recognized after doing said crimes.Crime doesn't pay, treasure hunting does.Embrace the slowness of the game. I assume about 2 hours of my in game time has been animations from picking up flowers. Learn to love that ♥♥♥♥.Press B to eat cooked food, which makes out your cores a lot faster than the trashy biscuits you have at your disposal in the inventory wheel.And remember to have fun with the game! Lasso the last bad guy in an area and set him free on the other side of the map. It's great! Drag a guy behind your horse and feed him to the wolves! Tie people up and throw them in pig pens, horrible sounds to endure. You can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you please with most ""bad guys"", so play an evil kind person for the most out of the game :DAnd remember to turn off the in-game sound and blast thrash metal when committing heinous acts :D"

Music, and many many other things I don't want to spoil.I feel like this game deserves a lot of attention, if anyone out there who doesn't like the Western genre but wants to try this game you should. It has a good story to it and You'd get tied to it very easily. You'd most likely like other stuff besides western to being a western freak like me. But then again I already liked western to begin with.This was such a amazing game from PS4 to PC.I feel like Online deserves more attention to anti-cheat though, cheaters mainly ruin almost everything you plan to do for your game. But then again ROCKSTAR just cares about people buying the in game purchases for the online. So if you want this game for the online I won't recommend it. But the story mode is wayy better."

I don't understand what all the negative reviews are talking about. The game runs perfectly (not even getting FPS drops which other games that are 10 years old still give you) and has since I bought/downloaded it. Maybe the launch was a little rough but, what ever issues they had at that time seem to be fixed now. The game will make you download the Rockstar launcher. (Which is usually the case with RS titles.) It doesn't hinder game play or even stay open after you close the game.Pros- Stunning graphics, beautiful animations, rich and immersive game play Cons- Literally nothing"

That being said there are some serious concerns as far as the online play goes. The reason why I would not recommend this is explained below.The multiplayer was extremely fun at first, but within the past week it has gone very downhill. Almost every server that I have been on has had someone cheating. Whether it was just blatant trolling like for instance, we had someone spawning the geysers under us sending us sky high, or the classic pulling everyone to the railroad tracks where we can't move and then having a train run us over. The thing that really gets me though, are the people who are invincible, and just spawn themselves in front of you while you're doing a trader run or moonshine run, and there is nothing you can do about it. You cannot kill these people, and they're often with a group of people they're likely boosting. The multiplayer is almost unplayable right now as far as money making goes outside of the missions. The concept is great, but their player management and response times for reports have to be unbelievably slow. To top things off, for whatever reason, they keep reports confidential and you will never know if the person you reported was caught or not. This leaves the players with no real idea of what happens after a report. There is no way to track how long it took, whether or not action was taken, etc etc. TLDR the multiplayer is abysmal with the amount of cheaters there are at the moment. Do not recommend playing online."

Relaxing envirement, no stress and just hunting, collecting and surviving. + multiplayer. There is 1 thing that holds this game back and that is the bugs/Crashes.

HOWEVER, if you're buying this for a polished online experience, don't waste your money.R* has proven since the online's release over a year ago (on console) that they clearly don't care about the online experience in this game as much as they care about whatever other ""projects"" they are working on (GTA VII). For instance, I bought this game along with two other friends, and we enjoy it a lot when it works. With that said, we all consistently receive an error message saying that an issue on R* servers has caused us to disconnect from online. This wouldn't be a big deal if it didn't happen almost every 30 minutes (not exaggerating).You can basically ignore all of the reviews saying that the game won't run or it's got terrible optimization; if you have a decent PC and you think you can run it, you probably can. I've had NO issues with crashes overall (maybe 1-2 instances); The REAL ISSUES lie in R* online servers.The moments when you're able to stay in game long enough to experience the content that RDO offers (or lack thereof), you'll enjoy it and want more. Unfortunately, there's also a rather severe lack of content on the online side of the game, but I'm hoping that that may soon change.Overall, singleplayer is fantastic, don't worry about it. You'll enjoy it.Multiplayer is great when it works, but those times seem to be few and far between. There's a lack of content, and even the content that's there seems almost inaccessible because of R* dismissive nature in regards to the Red Dead Online servers and bugs that are present.I really hope this game gets tuned up and polished to the potential that it could be, because I obviously enjoy it and it's a fantastic game, as well as an excellent successor to the original Red Dead Redemption. All we need to make that happen is Rockstar's support and a little bit of time."

Having played the Console version and coming to PC, my preferred platform. A couple things to note that my computer has a 2700x, 32GB Ram and a 2080 in it, the game runs just fine and there aren't any really noticeable differences between running the game at Ultra/Max and dropping a few things to Medium/High, so visually looks the same but becomes less taxing on the computer. Just have to note that Vulkan is pretty unstable it's not a RDR2 problem it's a vulkan problem, but to push Vulkan will pave the way forward so I find it cool, should come defaulted to Dx12 though instead of Vulkan in my opinion and R* could've avoided a lot of ignorant reviews about ""gaMe RUns LIke CRAP"".Visually, the game is stunning. The game really shines if you have a High Refresh Rate monitor in the 144hz+ ballpark, and I haven't observed any FPS stuttering or crashes having switched to Dx12 aside from some heavily populated areas and the snow particles swirling everywhere. Story is the same, meaningful choices and slow storytelling. It's not GTA, it's a big brain game with every minute detail crammed in. I love RDR/RDR2 over GTA , you can tell how much time and effort R* has put into the game.Some negatives that irk me; No character transfer from Console to PC, and that seriously sucks. So I have to do everything again and go through the grind all over again.If you don't spend like an ungodly amount of time, your character is going to look horrendous in online. (Fun Fact, Online Characters have no Eyelashes which really negatively impact the appearance of the characters) It's a far cry better than GTAV where everyone is built like a 6ft professional NFL Linebacker. Clothing could fit better, Namely things like Belts and Bandoliers.   and R* should do away with limited time items in my opinion and just make things accessible. Currently matchmaking is entirely desolate, I can spend 3 hours in matchmaking waiting for at least 1 person to queue up with and get shafted. But then as soon as I quick join for story missions, it's instant but only for the first 2-3 missions and seemingly only those. So level progression is painstakingly slow unless you can grab a few friends and start a posse up. I'd recommend it for now personally because the game isn't unplayable and far from broken, R* just needs to keep the ball rolling and get it going faster but without sacrificing any quality."

4656,InsertValue,https://steamcommunity.com/id/InsertValue/,2,,1,88.7,December,"24,",439,0,1,"I am sorry for anyone having technical issues with the game. I myself am lucky that I had no major issues. I am only 17 hours in the game so far, but only had 3 crashes. Surely I prefer no crash at all, but ~ every 5 hours a crash I can forgive for such an amazing game.Technical issues aside, this game is probably one of the best if not the best Singleplayer open World RPG/Action/Adventures I ever played. Witcher 3 as for many has been my favorite game in that category for years, but this game comes close if not exceeds it. Largely it combines 4 areas that lift this game to a true masterpiece for me:1. Amazing graphics (granted, I have a beast machine, but except MSAA can run the game on Ultra and it looks the part)2. Great Story and Voice Acting: You can make many small and bigger choices in the game and I love that many are not black or white. You are not a good person but you can decide how bad of an outlaw you want to be.3. Immersive Gameplay: From the way you shop by picking and inspecting items from the shelves, to hunting game, brewing coffee, the way the weapons dangle on your back, loosing and picking up your hat, letting your beard grew, reading about your choices in the newspaper and so much more. The game is probably the most immersive game I ever played. Almost every small detail is taken care of to a degree where the smallest flaw (e.g. when Arthur doesn't grab the can correctly) is noticeable because everything else is so well done.4. Hidden quests: There is so many detail in the game that I am afraid of missing the many small things you can discover. For instance by listening to conversations you can discover hidden quests, that are not marked anywhere. As an example: by passing by a conversation I learned about a shopkeeper hiding something in the cellar, upon closer inspection you actually find out that there is someone hidden, who you can then proceed to help, just to learn about a heartbreaking tragedy the shopkeeper encountered. Nothing of that is marked on your map, you have to discover it yourself. All in all this game is an absolute masterpiece. I hope it does well for Rockstar and it is great to see that they are still focused on great Singleplayer experiences, despite RDR2 Online being a thing."

I'm not even finished, as I just started John Marston. The story.. what can I say about the story? One of the best stories in my life. Next to OG FF7 this the best story ever. I laughed, I cried, I wanted to it never end. ""Thank you"" Seriously... that part. My heart man.. my heartGameplay:Really great over all. Has its moments like any 3rd person game where its a little clunky at times. But it makes up for those moments for the sheer amount of stuff you can just do. It can be overwhelming at first and seems like a lot to put in/remember, but the story makes it all worth it.Graphics:Whatca got? Anything good or basic GPU?

It SUCKS but.. The game.. Its worth it. Open Search --> Virus & threat protection --> Virus & Threat Protection Settings --> Manage Settings --> Turn off Real Time ProtectionAlso allow RDR2/SocialClub/RockStar Launcher thru the Firewall, you may/may not have to go and do it manually. ORIGINAL REVIEW:Disappointment is an understatement when it comes to this game. Gameplay and the game itself are GREAT. Rockstar socialclub? utter piece of garbage. My 1st 6 hours of owning the game was spent with support just trying to get it to run. Not a hardware issue, socialclub is just a garbage fire. Every issue I've had has dealt with Socialclub. No other game I've owned EVER have had to contact support more than once. Now I'm on my 3rd time getting intouch with support over this garbage fire. Its really sad, i spent 80 on this game for the full pack and was looking forward to playing. Now I'm just pissed off"

The story of this game is amazing, it looks beautiful, amazing music and many other amazing things. The game is so unoptimised though it is comical. It has crashed twice in 10 hours, so many graphical glitches and a few game breaking bugs. The game framerate-wise actually runs ok, on ultra I get on average 70fps. My system though is rather good, 1080ti, i7-6700k and 16gb of ram. The loading times aren't too long on single player at least, not tried online yet. If you want an immersive world, good story, fun gameplay and a very pretty game, then I recommend this at a discount. The amount of bugs so far though is comical. So far I have had leaves that turn weird and show reflections, the lighting just stopping so the world is black full of glowy things (I wish I took a screenshot, it looked really funny), npcs just vanishing, the world turning half transparent, getting stuck on carriages so I have to restart, animations stopping so npcs and animals just tpose slide around, flickering lights (this one is really annoying and very frequent, and the worst bug so far is loud crackly sound. My headphones work on other games and applications, I tried another pair of headphones and still got the same bug. It isn't constant, but happens after an hour or so of playing. Whether I recommend this game or not I guess really just depends on whether you are willing to put up with that. When the game runs well, which it does, it is an amazing game. As of writing this though the game is so buggy I don't know whether I recommend it. When they fix it, which I really hope they do, it will be amazing. The price I paid, £43.99 as it was on a %20 is very expensive for the quality of the game. This is obviously just my opinion, but while I don't regret buying it, I wouldn't recommend anyone buying it till it is on a better discount. It depends on how much you want this game though obviously. Tl;dr, very buggy but when it works it is really good. Wait for a better discount unless you really want it and hope it gets some serious patches."

(Well I do research sometimes on R* Titles what can I say, i'm such a fool)At first, I played RDO on RGL version, didn't got any cheaters on my way, friendly players kinda stuff, thought to myself maybe Rockstar did something good to the anti-cheat system.HAHAHAHA....I was wrong... Since Steam version released, there's a bunch of cheaters now, from invincible/1 shot kill/teleporting,... ect ect you name it.- There's no invite Session like GTA Online, which mean you will hop into a session full of strangers.- If someone have a controller in the session, they can auto lock on into you, while you have to free aim with a mouse.- You will get disconnected IF you trying to do Solo Public Session like GTA Online or you have a bad Internet or Strict NAT. It wont be like GTA Online, where you got disconnected and then all the players in the session left, no this time you're the only person got disconnect with an error code pop in your face.- Same above, if you got disconnect while doing a sell for your trader role, all of your stock will be lost.- No Text chat like GTA Online, just voice chat only.Overall, the single player is good, just don't buy the game for Online.Edit : Ah yes, there will be a Online standalone version with cheaper price, you could go with that."

Really happy to see this game on Steam.Edit: ok so I realize the controller fix isn’t working for everyone, so maybe it’s best to wait it out and see how quickly the devs fix the problems.

The story is a slow burn but with excellent and gripping character writing, and the gameplay, while initially a little tedious, does its absolute best to keep the game as realistic and grounded as possible. The end result is a game that feels like you're truly immersed in its character's dirty shoes, and that will keep wanting to play more, whether it is to see the band of outlaws further unravel, or merely just to lose yourself in the life of one for hours on end.I guess I should mention I experienced some random crashes for a little while, which was fixed by switching from DirectX12 to Vulkan.

I’m really curious as to what you guys think, but here’s mine to start things off:Story: (10/10) - The story telling in this game is near perfect. Probably the best narrative I’ve ever had the chance of experiencing in a video game. Although I have some issues with how things went (Milton always somehow avoiding death in the shootouts) this was by far the best thing about the game.World: (9/10) - The open world in this game was again one of the best I’ve had the pleasure of exploring. So much detail on such a big map. Flowing rivers with dynamic weather. It’s hard not to feel like you’re actually there. The big disappointment here is that the enemy/animal spawns are ♥♥♥♥. There are almost no predators and the ones that do exist always spawn in the exact same spot. I have over 100 hours in the game and I’ve only seen 1 brown bear outside of a scripted event. Same can be said about enemy spawns. The camps are always in the same spot, and outside of scripted events you are safe to explore everywhere else.Gameplay/Mechanics: (8/10) - By far my biggest disappointment with the game is how little they improved on actual gameplay mechanics. Trains don’t do anything interesting, and carts are essentially useless as well. You can’t rob banks, and the bounty system is broken. There is no bullet drop, and the shooting feels like a lateral move (maybe even a step down) from the first game. Also there are no underwater or above ground components. With such great draw distance you’d figure they’d add in some sort of flying mechanic. Swimming is pretty standard in most other open world games, but I guess they felt that wasn’t necessary either. Most buildings are closed off. Makes sense in Saint-Denis, but even in the rest of the world only like 10% of buildings are accessible. It feels like a big tease.This game definitely lacks a lot of things that would make it more fun, but it is still a top of the line game.Overall I’ll give it a 9/10. Great, but left a lot to be desired"

Ruined by horrible optimisation even after over 1 month after release on the PC and the shadiest ripoff business practice that would normally be expected from the likes of EA. The online mode, utiilising the same amazing looking landscape, generally offers a very nice gameplay. However, while the activities are much freer, the roles which is one of the main activities online can be very repetitive and are in many ways very limited and can do with some serious extensions.ALSO THE ONLINE MODE SUFFERS FROM EVERY POSSIBLE ONLINE BUG - camp not spawning, camp being packed up without it being requested, posse not join-able, posse members joining but not having access to the camp, missions ending in endless loading, missions randomly disconnecting and, among many others, of course JUST PLAIN NOT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT TO ROCKSTAR GAME SERVICES - the online bugs can be gone for a full day or just hit you every 5mins - this just plain needs fixing...

Witcher 3 also had an amazing open world and somehow CD Projekt Red manages to make money despite putting effort into stable releases and a business model that isn't geared to drain the last cent out of people.

If they cut the budget in half and got their heads out of their asses this could be a much better game. Instead they invested money into making ""realistic"" animal rotting and 30,000 ""random"" events that 90% of players will experience. This is having your hand held by an adult, pulled through an art gallery with no intention of letting you see anything on your own. If you don't play how you are told to, you are sent back to the last cutscene and told to do it over. The story isn't some masterpiece like everyone says and I constantly found myself rolling my eyes at different parts of the game. I very much want to like the game because it is very beautiful, voice acting is great, some of the characters are great, and I find the era to be fascinating, but it falls apart as it is. I would go as far to say that it is unplayable without mods that fix the economy, combat, hunting, and law. Even after adding those mods that doesn't fix the tediousness of the practically on-rails story mode, the awkward and slow/cinematic way your character does things, or the sheer amount of clutter in all departments. This game has a cult like community that associates any criticism with people who play fortnite. Bringing up that any tension a scene has is immediately dissolved by the fact that you can use deadeye mode to immediately head shot all 4 attackers at any given part, will immediately result in you being labeled as a kid who cannot appreciate a good story! Not to mention the fact that your character can take about two dozen hits before even considering if he should lose health or not. If you think this game might be fun as a fan of more freeform titles, simply watch youtube videos of the gameplay with a critical eye, whenever the game can't force you to do something it wants you to do, you immediately break any part of the game.While there is plenty more I could say, and I have to friends who asked about it, I can only recommend this game if its on sale at a serious discount, above 50% off. A lot of my hours in game are when I left the game running on my computer, and I only played as long as I did because I was told the story was great, I never could bother with finishing it. I will hold that Red Dead Redemption 1 was a much much better game, despite it having its own issues.Also cope and sneed, this game requires always online DRM, meaning you can't launch the game without an internet connection and a rockstar account. Requires something like 120 GB on your hard drive."

I definitely recommend taking more time to tweak the graphic settings due to the fact that some settings can heavily tax the performance but don't make much difference in terms of graphics. Be aware that the recommended specs from Rockstar are clearly misleading (GTX 1060 can barely archive 30 fps), you'll need at least a RTX 2060 to get 60 fps with good graphics."

Beautiful game and great story ruined by flaky control system and nonsensical+un-fun mechanics, which makes it hard to recommend. Also, I hope you like being labeled as dishonorable scum.[edited to add:] If you're looking for a good story, save your money and watch the many RDR2 clips on youtube, because the story is quite good. If you're looking for a fun open-world experience, then look elsewhere unless you enjoy hours of grinding for pennies and pelts. I burned out after crafting the best satchel and have resorted to just watching the rest of the story on youtube.Pros:+ Beautiful game world; I spent hours riding around slowly just enjoying the scenery.+ Great story and interesting characters.+ Open world is open world (except for a chunk of the southern map).Cons:- Honor system is garbage. You take a huge honor penalty when you kill/harm non-bandits, EVEN IN SELF-DEFENSE. You also can get unlucky and get massive honor maluses just because the system decided to put certain random events in your path. Example 1: was escaping from failed attempt at taking over a small bandit camp. System spawns random encounter of lady trapped under horse yelling for help. Can't stop and help because still dodging bullets = dishonorable scum. Example 2: Helped a kidnapped lady by killing the kidnapper and moving to free the victim. Before I could reach her a cougar/panther spawns, spooks the horse she's on, and kills her. Somehow that also makes me dishonorable scum. Would've been minor annoyance, except these events usually wipe out all honor progress you made over hours from doing chores and greeting people.- Obnoxious hunting and crafting system that tries to be realistic but fails miserably in a similar fashion to the honor system. To craft clothes/satchels/trinkets/something something game mechanic upgrade, you're going to need a LOT of animal pelts in perfect condition, which means a LOT of the following: Decide on needed animal; look up ideal weapon for said animal (online, because the in-game compendium is sometimes WRONG); go spend minutes/hours looking for perfect specimen of needed animal; track and kill it IN ONE SHOT with the right weapon; skin and stow the pelt. Oh, and for larger animals like elk, bison, etc. you can only carry one pelt at a time, so you have to go back and forth to sell/donate the thing before getting more, or you just waste a bunch of them. Also killing (too many?) animals without skinning them, EVEN IN SELF-DEFENSE = dishonorable scum. Also easily frightened small critters + high grass = hours of ""FUN"". Hope you love grinding.- Idiotically specific challenge requirements that often anti-synergizes with the other two mechanics above. Example: one sharpshooter challenge requires you to shoot 5 flying birds from a moving train. Get ready to either risk your life and/or get massive honor penalty, because A) you killed 5 innocent(?) birds, and B) all the guards on the train are now alerted and coming to kill you (even if you used silent weapons like the bow), and defending yourself makes you dishonorable scum. Also all the bandit challenges, because somehow the face masks help you stay anonymous from the law but people still know you're dishonorable scum.- Wonky, inconsistent control scheme (at least with mouse+keyboard, which was what I used) that seems to have been coded up by different groups for different parts of the game and they never all sat down together to make things coherent. Also whoever decided there needs to be a separate button to slow down the horse (instead of just using w to accelerate and s to slow/stop) needs to be shot.Epic fails:-- Requiring online login to play an offline single-player game."

RDR2 serves as a prequel to the first game. I have not played the first game. The story follows outlaw Arthur Morgan. Arthur must deal with the decline of the Wild West whilst attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries.+ Visually RDR2 is probably the most beautiful game I have ever played.+ The game ran without any issues for my system. Never experienced a crash and ran smooth as silk @1440p.+ Bounty hunting is really fun in RDR2. I wish there was more of that.+ The first 20 hours of the game I was pretty immersed in the game.- Lack of a character progression system.- The map is too big and empty. Traveling between locations is a tiresome task.- The story is boring and too long. In my opinion the game should have been half as long. I was literally forcing myself to finish this damn game. With the money Rockstar is making you would think they would be able to hire some fine writers to compose a compelling story. - Money is meaningless. After a certain point in the game () you just have more money than you can ever hope to spend. Not to mention all the weapons feel exactly the same.- Dull and repetitive combat and story missions. The combat at the 60h mark is exactly the same as on the first hour. 95% of the story missions follow the same formula: every mission ends with either A) a shootout until all enemies die, or B) you run away on your horse while shooting enemies chasing you down. In the later parts of the game I had to switch to first-person mode to have ANY sort of variation in combat and story.- Numerous plot details are left unexplained and ambiguous.- Horse controls are absolutely horrendous.- Fast travel is very limited and poorly executed.RDR2 is an okay game for about 20h, but then becomes a chore to play and finish as you grow tired of the game mechanics and realise how bad the story really is.Is it worth the full price? No. If you must, buy RDR2 at a discounted price.I should also mention that I only played the single-player mode. I bought this game for that. I have not touched Red Dead Online nor am I interested in it."

I also validated all the files, which were all correct. I don't know what to do, this game has made me so mad."

This game is essentially abandoned while GTAO continues to be supported. It's a shame that Rockstar doesn't care about anything other than GTA5 Online.If you want a good single player game with some of the best attention to detail, give this game a try. I still am not changing it to ""recommended"" because of the fact the game requires a 3000 series GPU to be playable - something that didn't even exist at the time of release, but I am loving the game otherwise.I have recently upgraded my GPU to an RTX 3080. While the game is playable now, you shouldn't need a $1300 CAD GPU to play a game past low/medium. My original review still stands. The game is a ton of fun, it looks beautiful (if you have an RTX 2000 or 3000 series card), and I will continue to play more of it. Still one of the worst ports. It's seriously such a shame this game is so poorly optimized because it's incredibly fun.An RTX 3080 with a powerful CPU can run this game at 60fps ultra.I'm having a ton of fun with this game, and I am going to continue playing it a ton and having fun with it. However, the only reason I am NOT recommending it at this point in time, is because it's a horrible port of the console version.The PC version of GTA is the best version of the game. The PC release is so incredibly polished and is one of Rockstars best PC games built from the ground up with PC specific options. RDR2 is not this.It's a horrible console port that runs at 50fps on high end computers with graphics all set to low/medium. The key bindings make no sense with pressing E/R/TAB to loot, depending on what you're looting. Why this isn't all the same key is beyond me.So while I am having a ton of fun, Rockstar needs to be criticized for the quality of the game.Specs for reference; i7-8700K, 16GB DDR4, 1TB SSD, GTX 980."

Don't let this deter you though since the game is AWESOME. Love everything about it and honestly it autosaves so unless you're really unlucky you don't lose much. Here's THE GOOD:The gameplay following and ignoring the story is AAA imho. With all the stranger missions, side missions, hunting, crafting, exploring, etc. you have well over a 100 hours of entertainment. I spent a LOT of time hunting and I'm still not really done but I'm also not bored of it.The story itself if fantastic, like you're taking part in an old western with a deep story centered around a group of very interesting people.

I'm loving it, but I'm gonna talk about bugs for a sec.  There's many complaints about bugs.  I'm 35.7 hrs in before my first crash to desktop.  The only bug I've seen is info on items not showing in the buy menu sometimes.  I bought it knowing there would be issues.  I did the same for KCD when it came out.  My first playthrough on KCD was flawless, but my brothers was fraught with bugs and eventually broken, as was my second playthrough.  I guess it's the same for this game, some are fine, others are not.  The way I see it, is there's two options.  Wait for issues to be resolved and buy.  Or buy now and roll the dice on bugs.Some of the issues deal with graphical settings, so I decided not to touch mine.  I'm not sure what they're set too lol, but the game looks great.  Everything I've seen from the game, lore wise, is really fleshed out too.  I haven't seen any blame whitey messages, so that's a plus.  RockStar did a great job on the game, and I have every confidence they will smooth out the PC port.  Incase there's a connections with hardware and crashes, here's my specs:  RTX2080 8gbRam, Ryzen 7 2700 3.7GHz, 16GB ram"

Absolutely outstanding graphics experience comparing to PS4 version. But all the existing bugs from console version are still here. Like your horse will just disappear 2-3 times during the story mode. Plus after 5 hours the game will start to crash (same thing in GTA V - same engine, same bugs). And of course animal hunting is a huge pain in the ass since some animals such as cougar won't spawn at the designated locations, so you have to visit the same list of locations so the script would work and you'll finally skin your big cat. Nevertheless, the game is worth buying. It's the last of its kind game because NOW all the market can offer you is The Last of Untolerated to Ugly Girls 2."

So, I will get right to the point.Short Form:BEFORE YOU BUY: I cannot stress this enough, read the requirements to run this game. This is a PC eating beast and it will NOT be fun for you in any way shape or form if your PC or connection cannot meet or beat the requirements listed. It seems alot of the negative reviews are related to either not meeting PC or Internet connection minimum. I'm sure not all of them, but the majority.Long form:OFFLINE:This game is amazing, both console and on PC. The world has so much detail, so much life it's often very hard to stay focused on just the main story since there is so much to see and do. The graphics are breathtaking, the environments are incredible with their sharpness and detail. The missions are fun, the storyline is immersive and the characters are interesting.The PC controls are actually easy to learn when transferring from the console game. The game itself, at least offline, is stable with minor glitches here and there.ONLINE:I happen to be one of the many that was never able to take advantage of online play with the console and this version had finally allowed me to join that ever growing online world. I have not been disappointed, I love online play! Each server can be stable for hours or you may find one that fails after a few minutes. It is currently a crap shoot. So far, in my experience, I find more stable servers than unstable. Are they all perfect? No. There are still bugs and glitches to work out. The game is new to PC, the servers are new, everything is new. I remember being told the console online play was absolutely miserable to start as well. PC online play isn't miserable in my opinion, but you may need patience to find a good stable server at times. Let's also not forget that online play is FREE. NO SUB. I can have patience for Rockstar to fix those glitches since I'm not paying a monthly sub for the ability to go online and play then not be able to...TLDR;OFFLINE:Bootyful, rich and detailed environments with oodles to do!ONLINE:Not completely stable on all servers but still a ton of fun with friends or even alone with all the missions and roles to do. Not to mention FREE to play online."

I can understand that people on a console might like it because they are used to not being able to do ♥♥♥♥ and a buggy game engine. Red Dead Online is included but to be able to actually play it, you have to buy gold bars (or grind ♥♥♥♥♥♥ missions for weeks and weeks) with real money just to start your ""trade"" or ""role"".There is some complete idiotic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in online where I have mostly spent the time. The different roles are all the exact same thing over and over and you just end up grinding for xp. As a bounty hunter you spend 10-20 minutes riding on your horse to the destination where you kill someone with absolute ease in 2 minutes, and then you ride 10-20 minutes again to pick up a new mission.As a trader, 99% of the time you are out hunting. Playing Red Dead Online is like a very crappy Deer Hunter with buggy mechanichs and hours of loading times. Then after spending a whole night shooting deer and possums with my rifle and crossbow, I got this mission where I had to deliver it with my wagon. Now, you get 22 minutes to do it and other online players can kill you during that time and steal your wagon. And I'm not talking about anything sensible. Like, if you kill them, they spawn 3 seconds later literally 50 meters away from you. How many times? Infinite amount of times. So, if there is even one other player online and you don't have a ""posse"", a group of other players to help you - it's completely impossible. I spent my 20 minutes killing the same 2 players a total amount of over 50 times. Because if I sit up on my slow ass wagon obviously I'm getting shot.Again, as a console gamer - maybe. As a PC gamer used to working mechanics, playing instead of waiting for repetitive useless animations and a very very very monotone mission database - nope."

I was kinda apprehensive about buying it because of everything I heard about the game at launch but I honestly haven't had any other problems apart from those 2 crashes. I haven't messed around much with Online but from what I've played, it can't possibly compare to GTA Online so if you're expecting the kind of depth GTA Online has and only in it for the online aspect, maybe hold off on it a little bit longer.

4889,14ReD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/14Red/,7,5,0,14.3,May,"25,",246,0,1,"I think I am one of the few people who just don't like this game. After playing it for 14,3 hours at the time of writing, I just concluded that I find myself avoiding the game. Not wanting to go ahead with the storyline. And the main reason being, that playing this game is more annoying than doing household chores. At this time, I’d rather take out the trash, wash the dishes and clean the toilet, then continue playing Red Dead Redemption 2. When the game was released in 2019 I was all excited! This looks cool and something I want to do! But since I was into other games, I skipped the launch and waited for the next Summer Sale. Some friends said: Don’t do it, I didn’t like it and neither will you! But it looked too cool and I just wanted to play! So I ignored their complaints and got the game.And there are a lot of reasons to like the game though, don’t get me wrong! The graphics are brilliant. You may even call it stunning. It played well on my rig, no stuttering or bugs as some people claim. The storyline is even interesting. And where in most other games I just “spacebar” myself through a conversation, while shouting “like I care, like I care,”or “blah blah, blah” or “I want to shoot those guns!” I now actually listened to most of it! The theme may be more interesting to Americans. For the rest of the world, most of us don’t really care about the western theme. But I can get past that and be happy that at least it’s not yet another zombie/end of the world theme. The sound, by the way, is excellent! As an audio enthusiast, I enjoyed that even more than anything else in the game. It’s vibrant and alive. The sound in “the wild” is accurate and makes it easy to identify the source. And the sound in towns is busy and makes you feel you’re really there. Gunfights are cool and every gun sounds different. But that all wasn’t enough for me to like the game.And the main reason is that it feels that the game doesn’t want you to win and make it to the end. It wants to irritate you as much as possible and not allow progress. It feels like it’s working against you. It only wants you to give you a fine for everything you do and mostly for no apparent reason.For instance, I walked into a town and some guy started to shoot at me. Maybe because I gave him a bad look or something, I don't know. The shooting was in front of a police station, with a policeman in front of the door, standing right in front of the event. The other guy hit me. The police didn't do anything, so I shot back. Of course I get thrown in jail and fined! My horse was gone, the deer I shot was gone and even more fines added to the list. So much for honest work by hunting!But also, there is a mission where the Van der Linde gang gangs up on you in a town after you break someone out of jail. To get out of town, which is part of the mission, you need to shoot the whole town. I mean every single person that walks there got shot. So you get fined and there is a search party active there. Now that county is a no go zone and maybe, maybe after some time, you may enter again. After paying the fines off course! And that is for doing a mission!Certainly not the least thing that annoyed me, are those search parties. They will spawn at random and try to find you and then capture you because you are wanted! You’re wanted, because of the fines you got from doing the storyline missions. The fines are either paid, but you never have enough money. So you have to take cover and hope they don’t find you. If you get in a firefight with them, you will lose. Thankfully, after some time they will just despawn right in front of you and you can carry on doing chores (and get more fines). Then there are the NPC’s, who’s only reason for existence is being in the way and annoying you. In the countryside some of them have sheep and those sheep will always move in front of you. So, since you don’t care about virtual sheep, you run them over with your horse at full speed. Shouldn’t have walked there, buddy boy! Of course that’s a reason for the NPC to start shooting at you and they will almost always get a near one shot kill! So you start shooting back at him. If you’re unlucky, some other dude sees that, and you have a limited time to shoot him too, because he will run off and tell the police! Then the police will give you, and you guessed it, another fine! So you end up shooting bunches of people, which is yet another chore.Another stupid thing NPC’s do is blame you for everything. In a town there was a robbery and some people on a cart got shot. I just stood still and watched the whole thing from a distance. Didn’t come near it. But still some NPC who stood like 1 metre from the event and saw everything. He could easily identify the robbers. But started screaming at me and, you guessed it, I got a fine! That made me annoyed and so I looted the bodies and shot the screamer. And another fine was given. Happy days.Yet another way to keep you busy is grinding. In defence of Red Dead Redemption 2, a lot of games involve grinding. And I love grinding like in the Assassins Creed series, so I’m up for the challenge. One of the grinding missions is that you can search for dinosaur bones. Finally something to do to make a honest living! And hopefully I won’t get fined (yet I feel that the game will find a way!). But those bones are hard to spot and the map is immense. So, you end up looking at the internet for walkthroughs and grind from there. As you Alt Tab your way from bone to bone you’re bound to be harassed by the search parties. Fun times for everyone!And at last there is the camp of the main mission/storyline. You have to earn money to get to the next part of the storyline and the leader is very strong about this. Earn money! But no one in the camp seems to care! They’re just sitting around, saying “Good day Arthur”! And then get back to doing nothing. At least the women in the camp seem to be doing something. The men are doing absolutely nothing. Some of them do donate some cents to “the good cause”, but when you add dollars you start to wonder what the point of this collective is. The thought “Get off your behinds and do something useful!” entered my head. If I was Arthur in real life, I would just leave and get my own life back on the road. And now I just don’t care for the game anymore. It now feels like a big chore to at least get through the storyline. You know, like one of those chores that you have been putting off for such a long time. Like unpacking that last box from moving, or painting that one window that nobody ever sees or that picture your wife wants you to hang up in the attic. After 10 hours of playing I had to force myself to do this chore, just to get the storyline done. Now, after 14 hours I just stopped caring about the storyline at all. And the game seems to be fine with it. We leave each other in peace now. I don’t care anymore and the game is happy that it achieved its goal of not letting me make it to the end of the game. And not because the game is prolonging the experience by making it fun to play and makes you want to savour every moment of playing, but from being annoying and irritating."

4893,Gesia,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gesia/,2,,1,35.9,December,"13,",449,0,1,"This will be a long review so let me TLDR: It's an amazing game with a bad PC port. Bring time. Lots of it.Edit: Like many people here I don't think that going on sale one week after release is good sportsmanship, as early supporters and adopters are made the fools for showing faith.However, if youre reading this youre wondering if this game is worth the money and it definitely is, especially at -20%, so I will not change the review to thumbs down like all the others.Now I always wanted to play the RDR series but never was a big console player so RDR2 coming to PC made me smile from one ear to the other.I wont talk about much about the premise of the game (outlaw in the last days of the Wild West) or the core Gameplay (GTA with Horses) but will focus on some of the things that made the game a blast to play and some of the things that really need improvement. (Though im sure some of things will never be improved)The game looks beautiful, not even so much technically, but more in terms of aesthetics - The sundown over the hills with the water in the background looks beautiful, even if the textures arent the crispest. The GTA gameplay went very well into the Wild West, shooting feels good, Arthur Morgan is a more likable character that any of the protagonists of the GTA franchise, actually most characters are quite distinct, the missions are fun an much more - basically if youre looking for a more-or-less open world Wild West game this one is for you.So alls good? Well theres some spunk on this otherwise perfect game. For the Story, the only flaw i could find so far is that every character in this game has the moral standard between Trevor from GTA5 and Stalin and will kill without remorse for no reason. If youre a little goody-two-shoes like me, some of the murders YOU commit or actively help commit just feel... wrong.... Theres a metric ton of scenes where members of your gang are ""distracting"" people and you need to ""silence"" them which means some innocent stablehand is talking for literal minutes to a gangmember about how much he likes flowers, his newborn child and not being stabbed in the neck before you have to approach him from behind and unfulfil one of the three wishes. In other scenes youre shooting up entire towns, in a particularily mindboggling moment in the beginning of the game, youre mudering everyone through a town, to get to a house, to murder some innocents there, and then run away murdering some more. The entire way your main protagonist complains about the murdering and how the other guy hes with is wrong for all the murdering, but never stops to reconsider letting anything live.This is especially weird since Arthur Morgan is THEORETICALLY a pretty decent guy, constantly helping people. So after killing hundreds of people you suddenly get the chance to let one person live, then donate to charity and one mission for example actually makes you return a cross to a nun for no reward out of the goodness of your heart.All of this makes the game feel like it was written by quite a few different writers who werent allowed to communicate with each other.Another Problem of the story are the basically invincible gangmembers of the van der linde gang. While a few die during the story (spoiler alert...) youre spending about half the game in shootouts of 100vs5 and win without losing anyone. Your gang hideout gets ambushed by 100 men shooting at it with the women and children playing in the streets? Nope, no one dies. Youre walking into a trap in the middle of town with 100 men shooting down on you from the rooftops? Nope no one dies.This does take a huge amount of urgency from the story to the point where I actually rejoiced every time one of my own gang died cause it felt like it was only fair that after having shot thousands of people we would lose a single one.In terms of gameplay itself I cant find much faults at all, except riding. Now I've never played the PS4 version so i dont know if this is actually a gameplay or a PC-Port issue but my Horse quite frequently just starts turning in circles. I ASSUME this has to do with the ""autoride"" function screwing up. See the button (shift) for ""ride fast"" is the same button for ""ride next to someone at their speed to listen to dialog"".So theoretically during the MAAAAAAANY hours you spend just riding next to someone you dont need to control your horse but just press shift+w and your character rides next to that person while you can drink heavily. nice.but there are few things more infuriating than your horse deciding to do donuts in the middle of a chase!Last but not least the problems with the PC port.The first and worst problem are the crashes. I have clocked something like 20 hours into the game and had 5 crashes to desktop. All of them during end-of-mission-cutscenes. This is extra annoying since in this case the game does not always remember the last checkpoint which is why i had to at least 3 times replay the entire mission, which can take quite a while.The second problem with the port are the controls. Everything needs too many clicks. An example for this would be that if youre riding on horseback and want to aim your gun in every other game you would need to press and hold the right mouse button.You also need to do that here, but additionally you need to click the left button for some reason. Walking up to talk to someone? You dont press E you have to keep the right mouse button pressed and then press E for no reason.Search the drawer or pick up the money? Get that right mouse button ready before pressing the R key...You get the pattern. Once youre used to it, like anything in life really, its not too much of a bother anymore but it still confuses me why this would be how they decided to handle it.All in all I am having an absolute blast with the game and would recommend it. non-leathal takedowns and more stability wouldnt hurt, but i can absolutely recommend it."

Red Dead Redemption 2 is a narrative-driven game lead by an engaging story and a complex cast of characters set in a beautiful, immersive open world. The story is captivating from the start, but is a bit of a slow-burn as the game encourages the players to explore the world and get distracted by random encounters from stranger missions, horse races, shootouts, and much much more. There are so many great things about RDR2, but personally, the best part is experiencing how each character and their relationships with one another changes/develops over the course of the story.The word ""masterpiece"" gets thrown around a lot, but Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of those games that is absolutely deserving of that title. The game expertly pieces together character, world-building, and exploration along with amazing music and voice acting to bring us one of the most polished, detailed games ever made."

But if you're thinking of buying this game just for the online mode, that's a big NO from me since Rockstar is too busy with GTA V that they completely forgot about this game's online mode.I recommend the game only for its story mode, but not recommend buying it for the online mode at all.edit: GOTY"
4909,pduckh.,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083918993/,2,,1,80.4,March,20,67,0,1,"Геймплей (СПОЙЛЕРІВ НЕМАЄ)   Рокстар провели дуже велику роботу над цією грою . Навряд чи хтось хоч наблизився до такої ж деталізації , яка є в рдр . Ви забуваєте, що таке реальність , вона  надзвичайно красива , а технічний стан просто дивує (Мабуть, найкраще, що я бачив).     Багато людей починали проходити рдр , але через її повільність просто закидували гру . Можливо , вона не для всіх . Але ця гра дає змогу насолодитися навколишнім світом , кожною деталлю цієї гри. Рокстар намагається , щоб гравець поринув  в ту епоху , в той світ.  Але думаю , що якщо навіть дійти до 6 глави, то  вже ніхто не буде зважати на повільність цієї гри , так як там зносить голову від того , що починає відбуватися.      Повільність гри обґрунтовується тим , що ми стаємо більш прив'язаними до персонажів і тим , що нам дають змогу розвідати світ , відчути кожну деталь. В цій грі не дають мільйон інформації за хвилину , в цій грі ми відпочиваємо - медитуємо. Потрібно просто спробувати зануритися в цю гру, відвернутися від сюжету,  по подорожувати  по полювати , проникнутися атмосферою цієї гри! Світ гри дуже великий та живий, купа випадкових подій, завдань, купа дрібних, але приємних деталей.    Ви маєте їсти , щоб відновлювати здоров'я , чим більше ви їсте , то відповідно тим гладкішими ви стаєте. Так само працює з конями , якщо коня не годувати , він помре , чим грязнішим він є , тим менша його швидкість. Вам також потрібен час , щоб виросла довіра коня до вас , чим більша довіра - тим краща статистика в коня .   Якщо ви міняєте зачіску Артуру і зістригаєте волосся , назад як в гта ви його уже не повернете , воно має відрости заново. Вам потрібно перегортати журнал вручну , щоб перейти до наступної сторінки, йти в ванну та мити окремі частини тіла теж вручну , потрібно проїздити десятки кілометрів , щоб відкрити нові локації.   Наскільки пророблений табір банди , напевно , потрібно провести сотні годин в цій грі , щоб почути всі діалоги в ньому.     Npc починають будувати будинки в містах , і через декілька ігрових днів чи тижнів , вони можуть добудувати той дім. Якщо публічно влаштувати бійню та втекти, на місце прискачуть законники та приберуть трупи. А якщо прикінчити когось у глушині, тіла почнуть розкладатися. Туші вбитих звірів приваблюють стерв'ятників, причому тварини чутливі до запахів — якщо застосувати жувальний тютюн за кілька метрів від алігатора, і вітер дме у його бік, він зашморгає носом.   Режисура , Світло, Звук , Музика , Картинка - все це також на найвищому рівні в цій грі. Можливо , мінусом цієї гри може бути те , що в більшості випадках ви стаєте термінаторами і вбиваєте всіх і вся , а самі не ушкоджені. Також до третьої глави можна задуматися над тим , як це ніхто з персонажів банди не був навіть пошкоджений за стільки перестрілок то , але після 3 глави гра стає набагато цікавішою і все стає на свої місцяАртур Морган (СПОЙЛЕРИ!!!!)  Ми відчуваємо симпатію до людини , яка вбила сотні людей , але ж чому так? Я думаю , тому що Ден Хаузер (головний сценарист гри) створив найживішого персонажа в історії комп‘ютерних ігор та також те , що його  історія , яким би він не був , стала для багатьох дуже особистою та зворушливою.  Здавалося б ірландець, який спочатку навіть трохи бісить , але через деякий час він стає настільки рідним, як молодший брат , що від такої різкої його смерті аж серце завмирає, те ж саме Кіран , Ленні , Хозея. Ми стали більш прив'язаними до цих персонажів саме через повільність гри. Навіть кінь , який так само різко помирає , виявляється був таким близьким. Те саме і з Артуром.   Характер Артура розвивається глибоко та переконливо протягом історії, особливо якщо грати  з високою честю .Еволюція його особистості подана дуже життєво. Він був по коліна у гріхах, але так ще легше асоціювати його з самим собою. Та й вплинути на його рішення хоч і нечасто, але можна.  Після того як Артуру ставлять діагноз невиліковного туберкульозу , ми розуміємо , що він помре . Але він не помирає швидкою смертю в якійсь битві , він помирає помалу і дивитись на те , як він кашляє з кожним разом все сильніше дуже важко , ми ніби помираємо разом з ним.   Після виявлення діагнозу , Артур починає замислюватися над тим , що буде після нього? А що він після себе залишив? Чи були виправдані всі його вбивства? Чи за тою людиною(Датчем) він міг піти хоч на край світу? Артур хоче зробити хоч щось хороше , поки він не помер , хоче спокутувати свої гріхи і він стає на шлях хорошої людини та допомагає Місіс Даунс і її сину та рятує Джона з його сім'єю. Світ буде далі рухатися після його смерті .    Після смерті Артура нам одразу показують сцену , як Джон зі своєю дружиною рухаються в нове місце - світ рухається."

4919,keaton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kleaxe/,2,,1,56.0,January,27,101,0,1,"Those are my opinions on Red Dead Redemption 2 and while I loved the first game, I found the sequel to be a mixed bag. The main campaign is slow-paced and restrictive, and the hunger and stamina depletion system gets tedious. I also had issues with the weapon wheel and found the story to be uninteresting. However, the game is visually stunning and has entertaining side missions and characters. It didn't blow me away, but I'm glad I played it. Overall, I would pay its price rating, not including the online aspect.The game world is vast and detailed, with a variety of landscapes and wildlife. The game also features a realistic hunting and fishing system, and players can interact with other characters in a variety of ways, such as through dialogue or combat. The game's attention to detail is impressive, and the game's physics and animations are realistic. The game's soundtrack is also noteworthy, with an original score that adds to the game's atmosphere.One of the main criticisms of the game is that it can be slow-paced and sometimes feels like a chore to play. The restrictive movement and interactive points can be frustrating, especially when you just want to move on to the next mission. The hunger and stamina depletion system can also become tedious, as you constantly need to buy replenishment items to keep your character from slowing down.The game's story, while well-written, is not as memorable as the first Red Dead Redemption. The cutscenes can be long and uninteresting, and the story's pacing can be slow. The game's missions are also generally uninspired, with many of them being just ""shoot-out"" objectives. There are a few missions that stand out, but they are few and far between.In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a visually stunning game with a vast and detailed world, but it can be slow-paced and restrictive. The game's story is not as memorable as the first Red Dead Redemption and the missions are uninspired. The game's attention to detail is impressive, but the game's restrictive gameplay and gradually draining story really hurt my experience. Overall, I would recommend the game with reservation and only if you are willing to invest time and patience."

4929,Not Toxic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/not-toxic/,2,,1,190.8,January,2,84,1,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is truly a feat of modern video game development that provides breathtaking graphics and careful attention to detail to create a vast and immersive world complete with gorgeously produced environments and fascinating characters. The world features a diverse range of settings including forests, mountains, and wetlands, each depicted with great detail. The characters are also well designed, each having their own unique appearance and personality. Every location feels alive and authentic, with its own unique culture, and architecture.Another thing that makes Red Dead Redemption 2 stand out is its strong narrative. The game follows the story of Arthur Morgan, a Van der Linde gang member, as he navigates the changing landscape of the Old West. The story is rich and complex, with a cast of well-developed characters who feel like real people, except for Micah, ♥♥♥♥ Micah. He kicks dogs n ♥♥♥♥. Who the ♥♥♥♥ kicks dogs? The player is free to make choices that affect the course of the story, and the writing is excellent, with great dialogue and character interactions. The game also tackles themes of loyalty, morality, and the consequences of one's actions in a thoughtful and nuanced way.In terms of gameplay, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a feast for the senses. The game offers a wide range of activities for the player to engage in, including hunting, fishing, poker, or killing/torturing NPCs in the most gruesome, concerning ways possible. The combat in the game is seamless and fulfilling, offering a diverse selection of weapons and a cover system that is intuitive (Also first-person killing is incredibly satisfying). The horse riding is (mostly) well done and the game does an excellent job of immersing the player in the world of the Old West.Overall, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterfully crafted game that offers an immersive and unforgettable experience for players. Its compelling gameplay, excellent storytelling, and technical prowess make it the best video game in recent memory and a must-play for fans of the open-world genre.Also cowboy shenanigans are fun :)"

I've been having a grand time hunting, catching horses, and slowly completing the story.Highly recommend even if this isn't your usual style of game.

4949,Elias,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EliasTheOrange/,2,,1,107.3,November,"24,",140,0,1,"I would recommend this game to other players because it has the best narrative I've ever encountered in a video game. The story is so well thought-out and written so intelligently that you feel exactly what you need to feel toward every character: deep, warranted hatred for your enemies; undying loyalty and love for the members of your gang. The atmosphere —although tense — is inviting, with soundtracks that amp you up for a big battle, bring you complete serenity when you're enjoying a relaxing horseback ride across the country, or just deliver unbridled joy when you're relishing in one of the few, but well spaced-out, moments of comic relief in the saga. The environment is visually stunning at every point of the game, with dazzling fauna and flora throughout and a true attention to detail brought to both. RDR2 proves the degree to which games can outdo other forms of media in creating a deep bond between a protagonist and the viewer. It's a masterpiece, and everyone must play this game in their lifetime."

I have never fell in love with a world such as this one, The world is just so dense and so MANY activities to do, Whether that is Fishing, Hunting, Meeting strangers, Doing side missions and just exploring the amazing world Rockstar Games have created, there is just so much to do. The characters in this game are phenomenal, each character is so unique with the actions they do and the dialogue that they speak. The story is Amazing from beggining to end, its such a complex and emotional ride with the Dutch van der Linde Gang. Riding from town to town with the westernized music in the background with the drums pacing with your gallops is just an amazing feeling. Sound design is great for everything (Weapons, Explosions, Galloping, etc...). Overall the game is truly a classic and one of the GREATEST games of all time"

I almost gave up but after several hours of this, I finally got into the core of the game and I have enjoyed it.

Born in 1842, I was abandoned very early on - raised by a small orphanage in Annesburg I was soon adopted into the Dalton Gang where I was raised to be a killer. I lived a very dangerous life, holding up trains, outright robbing every man I see and shooting stray dogs multiple times for a chuckle. Then on one fated night in 1874, during a shootout in Rhodes - I was heavily wounded after taking out several of the rival gang members. I thought that was it for me - it was me versus them, but I had already used the last of my strength. then suddenly a hand reaches towards me, with no power to resist I let it come closer. He jacked me up on ketamine and said to me; ""Butch? I finally found you brother.."" In disbelief and being completely zooted I opened my eyes and shifted my gaze towards this man. ""Who..? I ain't got no brothers"" He sighed, stood up and tilted his hat. ""The name's Baxter, Baxter Beergut - I finally found you after all this time."" We share a warm embrace. (still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up btw) And this is just the beginning of our story as semi-professional bounty hunters."
