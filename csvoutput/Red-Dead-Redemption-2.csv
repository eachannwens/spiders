And being a 57 year old man that grew up in the days of Cowboys and Indian Movies & Shows I tell you if we had this to play as well those times would never had died and be just as popular today. I thought I knew a lot about our great country and the animal and bird life as well as plant life here but this game has taught me even more as well as even more apreciation for what we have and the beauty that needs to be explored. This is the first Red Dead game I have played and I just started playing it a few days ago and can hardly stop each day and can't wait to get back to it is the best compliment I can offer above and beyond what I have already mentioned! You don't know what your missing until you try it! Everything is truly alive from the people in the towns to the animals and wild life and the horses you learn to take care of and bond with and all go on with their lives with or without you. The stories you hear and become a part of or just soak up and listen to are well written and entertaining as well as the music in the background or being played by people around you! So much to experience and explore it's unbelieveable!Take the time to watch the world around you see the Eagles and Hawks swoop down and grab a rabbit running or a fish out of the water or see the vultures and crows and ravens come and feed off a kill. See the fish jump for bugs or the Cyotties or a fox chase down and kill an animal. And see the human ugliness as well of the times the start of the KKK after the Civil War the burning of cross's and slave quarters and poor areas outside of towns for Blacks of the times outside of the plantations of the South. The attention to detail is off the scale the sounds and the visual beauty as well as the ugliness too! Choose the Man you want to be even as an Outlaw a heart of gold or a man of Evil. Either way take it all in or you have missed what has been created here a master piece.EDIT: They say you can finish this game in 80 hours of play I have over 300 hours now and say I am not done yet too much you can easily miss if you rush through it from NPC random conversations and hidden things to find and do. Just remember one thing these times were brutal and hard! This is an  honest depiction story of the times so expect your heart strings to be pulled this is not a story book ending from Disney. Cowboy's rode hard, died young and fast and rarely does greed, revenge and murder go unpunished or is easily forgotten! With the invention of the telegraph and now the phone and news travel by train our great country seemed so much smaller and a lot harder to hide from the law."

5,christr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TaBaScO77/,685,7,1,127.7,November,"14,",180,17,1,"I bought this game during a Steam Sale back in December 2020 for $40.   The best $40 I ever spent.  I took my time with the game, and didn't finish it until November 2021.  I did every side mission and explored nearly every inch of the game.  I'm 44, and usually only have the time or energy to play on weekends.  I played for about 4 hours or so most Saturday mornings.  As a casual gamer I can definitely say the game is open to all playing styles and skill levels.  The story line was as good as a really good book.  The ending did a great job closing out all the story lines too.  The attention to detail by the developers was incredible.  You never know what you're going to deal with as you turn each corner, and every time what comes up is interesting and fun.  Often times I would just go off and explore the game's open world outside of any story lines.  I have an EVGA GeForce RTX 2070 XC ULTRA video card.  The ray tracing they added in mid 2021 was a marked improvement in the graphics, and the graphics were already awesome before the upgrade.  I couldn't recommend this game enough.** Side note -- I tried Red Dead Online a little, but didn't care for it.  I didn't try it till after I had finished the main game.  I found it was full of trolls.  Don't waste your time with Red Dead Online."

I walked over and greeted him and he said ""Who the hell you talking to?"" then stood up and punched my hat right off of my head.We punched the hell out of each other and were both covered in blood. My health was nearly gone but then he ragdolled and faceplanted the table and a message popped up on screen saying something like ""You can no longer use the barber"".Turns out i just beat the crap out of the local barber.The sheriff came, i surrendered and spent the night in a cell. I had to pay $4.I went back to the saloon for another beer and a random guy walks up and talks about the fight i had the night before and how crazy it was.This is just one of many small immersive things which have happened so far outside of the main story.What a crazy game."

Replayablity is there with being able to explore the open world, random encounters, hunting and side missions etcRecommend.EDIT: I'm about to complete my 2nd playthrough, I've done all side missions and optionals, this game is a masterpiece, 10/10 once you become accustomed to the general slowness of the game compared to fast paced games.EDIT 2: Finished 2nd playthrough, done most side content - summary - BEST GAME EVEREDIT 3: I have borrowed my managers xbox 360 at work and red dead 1 disc so I can play rdr1.. will update again with my review.EDIT 4: Finished RDR1, great game, playing RDR2 before RDR1 has made me appreciate both games more than I would have playing RDR1 10 years ago...

You really care for the characters, the gang ""family"" becomes like your family, and when things go bad.. you really want to help. Of course in the meantime you can hunt, rob, kill and do whatever nasty or good thing you prefer, but you know someone is waiting for you. And the ending will bring tears to your eyes for different things in multiple occasions. Add to this an incredible, very realistic environment, a perfect western setting that would make Sergio Leone proud and you have an absolute masterpiece.

20,KING-X®,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kingx69/,780,56,1,154.5,January,"20,","9,270",27,1,"This review is for the single player, spent 150 hours to reach 91% completion and would need maybe 50 or 100 more hours to 100% it. I didn't try the online yet, i'll add the review for that after i try it.I wont review the story to avoid spoilers, but it's a long game with some excellent missions, as usual when it come to Rockstar games and the humor is spot on, characters are great and the story as a whole is a great prequel to the excellent Red Dead Redemption.The game is not easy if you want to master everything, nothing hard if you want to jump from one mission to another, but it'll take you a bit of time to get familiar with all the activities that you can do, especially the hunting which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.For the visuals, even while not at the ultra settings, this game is insanely beautiful, i never felt a world full with life as much as in RDR2, Rockstar went into each detail to create the last days of the Wild West and it's a huge payoff for the players, you really feel like you riding with a gang in the early 1900s. And with photo mode, whatever you are doing and wherever you are on the map, be sure that you'll end up with a nice photo. I'll add to that the dynamic weather and different environment that wont change just the looks but also the fauna and flora of the region.Shooting is pretty satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and the slow motion Even the crafting is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics, also loved the weapon modifications, to make each weapon customized to a different look.Map is pretty big for a game that uses a horse as the primary travelling method, you can fast travel easily using camp, train or stagecoach, but i dont advise that, you'll miss a lot of nice things like that, a lot of random events. Plus there is way too many things to collect that will take hours and hours to find them all, add to that around 100 challenges and you have over 200 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game and even with all that time i'm sure that you'll miss a few of easter eggs or interesting places in this game.It's an amazing game and to me one of the best games ever made, so it's highly recommended for anyone who have the patience to learn what this game have to offer. Thank you Rockstar for all the amazing moments i had playing this game!Edit: I couldn't play online, each 5 or 10 minutes i receive this error: ""You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar game services.

28,Araripe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/araripebr/,561,7,1,177.7,November,"28,","1,729",22,1,"Rockstar Games is known for setting benchmarks when it comes to their open world titles. Red Dead Redemption 2 is their best work to date, without a doubt. Unquestionably beautiful, vast and detailed. It breathes life. From the tiniest toad to the scary Grizzly bear, everything feels alive and convincing. It's an environment so well crafted that it makes you wonder whether it isn't a real world within your own computer. Non-playable characters have their own lives, with a routine that they follow religiously just like we do. Some do hard work, some drink all day, some mourn their loss(es). It's hard to believe it's just a video game. I remember when Skyrim had something similar and people couldn't believe how insanely realistic it was. Imagine that, but twice as convincing. That's RDR 2 for you. They feel so alive that you feel bad for killing them with your plethora of period-accurate weaponry. Evidently, a game is not solely made of environment and their inherent goodies. That's where the story mode comes in. And, as many of you may know by now, either from YouTube or any of the media portals you routinely visit for the daily dose of gaming news, it's a masterpiece. Storytelling is not an easy craft, but they have visibly dominated it after decades and decades of duly delivered benchmarks of how an open world game should be. They make it seem easy, almost as if anyone could do it. Memorable characters, insane character development just like we like it and then fantastic endings based on your own decisions. As linear as it may be, forcing you to do things their way rather than setting your imagination free and letting you decide how to approach a mission, it still allows you to take certain decisions that will shape the moral values of your character, therefore leading it to a specific outcome. Games don't often get the whole moral debate right, understandably so, because they are empty characters with a pre-recorded set of phrases and reactions that can't resonate with you. But Arthur Morgan is different. It's a rather captivating individual, that feels real. Real enough that you will often find yourself questioning whether to kill or spare someone, or if you should or not help that person in need. And inevitably feel the pain of uncertainty of the future - or the lack thereof - that lies ahead. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a western beyond all westerns. An adventure you can dive in yourself, and watch your character grow through all the hardships of the outlaw life. A novel-like main character that is a criminal, killer, cruel and savage but also a human being like all of us. And humanity wins, in the end. Arthur learns what it is to be human, and there is no better teacher than life itself. Would I recommend Red Dead Redemption 2? It would be a crime not to. As flawed as it may be in certain aspects like the slightly truncated gameplay, the typical Rockstar linearity and the underwhelming online mode, the story is something out of this world. It truly outstands. Goes above and beyond the average video game storytelling. It's something you've got to experience to understand. A must-play for every gamer out there."

This title will remain in my heart forever. the world is the most alive and coherent in ALL of open world games. This is open world mastered and perfected by the best. The very best on doing so. You can spend an infinite amount of time in the world.The animals who live in this giant, MASSIVE open world map, are the stars of making it alive. Accordingly with Red Dead 2 wiki, there is 80 animal species with lots of subspecies to spice it up. You will find 170+ different animals in this game.Currently hovering over 147 hours of having the game open on steam, I have not seen everything this world has to offer yet. It is a GIANT behemoth of a game. It is to die for. My god, it is a roller coaster and so well written in the human sense. I have never connected to a protagonist as I have in this. No game has ever made me tear up. The soundtrack, the voice acting, the setting... everything. It is so well done.The most detailed world you can have in games. Compare this to their own GTA, Cyberpunk 2077, any other open world. The amount of realism put into this is not of this world. So many organic interactions with npcs, the physics and with the nature makes this an intoxicating journey with great immersion.As usual, it is not perfect. The game suffers GREATLY from Ludonarrative dissonance. Meanwhile in the story human life has a great weight, you'll find yourself killing hundreds throughout the game and story when outside a cut scene. It is very common in games and it is a shame, because Arthur story is monumental: it is very human.One other thing this game does amazingly and it is a shame that the current culture in gaming does not appreciate is the taste for a journey and not a pure min-max that you focus solely on numbers and efficiency on whatever you are doing.Have a moment and  This is what the game structure tries to teach but not in a obvious way. When I purchased RED DEAD 2 early last year, I gravitated to a min-max state of mind later on the story (around hour 40) and it made me annoyed for the animations, length of travel, punishing physics. Sadly so, because I was losing the point of it all.This month in 2021 I reinstalled it and jumped on the story and it clicked me. When you're skinning a hunt, when you're taking care of your horse, when you are in a shop or interacting in a saloon. Everything is made methodically to be the most realistic possible and to tell a story.You'll find yourself out in the wilderness alone, maybe passing 5 whole minutes crafting split point bullets that are free (you make an X with your knife on a bullet's tip) but it takes an animation. All of this tells a story. Time passes. Sun rises, sun sets.From the state of mind of enjoying the journey, even more precious in these times we are living in, I found myself enjoying 1000% more the game. I stopped making my horse run for minutes straight from point A to point B and began enjoying the view while trotting, and stopped riding when the view was just right to appreciate how gorgeous this game is.The views, the animals, the story, the characters, the world...Even with so many flaws, this goes straight up to my favorites quite possibly number 1.This changed the way I think about life and the world, even though it was in my heart before. It refined further what I believed in. No game has EVER done that to me.I recommend watching the many essays on youtube about red dead 2, including one from Real Pixels.It is a masterpiece."

After a failed robbery, you and your companions are trying to find a new place where all of you will be safe. You will travel across a beautiful country, doing robberies, helping people or not - it depends on you. I don't want to spoil anything so I will not talk about details. The beginning of the game can be boring for some players but later it will change. Some parts contain really emotionally-strong moments. There are only a few games that can compete with RDR 2's story. I can imagine some players will dislike long travels between missions, but it was fine for me. I enjoyed the nice-looking country.In every open-world game, it's important for the world to feel alive. You can have a big map, but if it's empty and dead then it's pointless. It's not case of Red Dead Redemption 2. The map is massive, and everything lives here. Every NPC has its own purpose. They don't just stand somewhere, but they are there for a reason. Some work on a ranch, some do daily chores, others relax after a job, repair something and so forth. You can try to follow NPCs and you will see they have their own life. This applies to animals as well. When you are hunting, you feel like you are playing some kind of a hunting simulator, not an open-world story game. There is a huge amount of side activities. Everything is well made, tasks are nicely hand-crafted, random events are superb. There exist in GTA V but hey, Red Dead Redemption 2 is different and events are much more fun. For example, I saved the life of one guy and later he let me buy anything on his account in a gunshop. You can spend many hours in free roam doing all this stuff. The game offers a superb photo mode where you pick a shot of a rock, and I can guarantee it will look nice. The game has so many details. For example, when you take a piece of paper from the table, it will look and feel like real paper, not just a rectangle with texture. Animations like placing a cable for dynamite, skinning animals, taking things and so on, are a masterpiece and everything looks realistic. Only clothes could have better physics. I can clearly say this is the most detailed game I ever played. Long story short, the visuals are outstanding.Shooting guns is a story in itself. Guns feel realistic, you must maintain them / don't shoot like in Call of Duty. Weapons in the wild west had long reload times. In RDR 2, reloading is not as fast as in PvP games but not too slow to be frustrating either. The devs perfectly hit a balance between fun and realism. The game offers a big selection of guns. You can personalize them to your preferences. You can enjoy shootouts in 3rd person or 1st person view and use the dead-eye ability like a true gunslinger. There is a cover system, but it could be better. Many times my character didn't take cover or left cover after a short time and stayed in a crouch behind an obstacle. Your character has some needs that you need to maintain. He needs to eat, heal, sleep, and keep his energy full if you want success in fights. There are plenty of food types, herbs and drinks that will help with it. Also, you can craft many items that will give bonuses to the protagonist. Don't forget to take warm clothing when you go visit the snowy mountains. You need to watch honour as well. You can raise it by helping random people - encounters and making the right decisions during the story. Honour has an impact on cutscenes and the ending.Your protagonist's best friend will be a horse. You must take care of it if you want it in good condition. You don't want to be kicked down during an escape from robbery. So don't forget to feed and brush the horse from time to time. Upgrades and customization are available too. You can buy a new horse or try to tame any wild ones that you will find.The game offers multiplayer as well. To be honest, I didn't try it. I'm primarily a solo player and I don't have the energy for long grinding to buy something. With friends, I can imagine it can be fun. Maybe I will try it someday just for fun."

Gameplay, shooting, graphics, emotions, diversity of animals, characters impressed me deeply. This is the first game in which I saw how the character takes things with his hands, not just raises his hand and things end up in his pocket. Nails really get hammered into the boards. The more often you hit with a hammer, the deeper it gets hammered. Even such trifles are thought out here, it's unbelievable.The plot is built in such a way that we can see how slowly the relationship between people changes throughout the game, like in real life. We don't understand that we were betrayed at once, do we? We need time to realize it. So we have a lot of time to understand who is who in RDR2. Admiration, misunderstanding, doubt, disappointment, loathing— we can feel such emotions with Arthur Morgan. I have experienced such warm feelings as for Arthur in no game. The ending encouraged me to mull my life over. It's really made me think how I want to live my life. It's so emotional, strong and powerful. I would never regret playing this game, though I used to think that Wild West is not my cup of tea.I guess, I won't run into better game than RDR2. Only if Rockstar releases a sequel, but I'm afraid that will never happen. I can do nothing but admire."
60,quasimodo1957,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014000003/,303,8,1,221.6,December,"6,",112,4,1,"Probably the best Rockstar game by far. GTA V was eye candy but this leaves it in the dust. The scenery and vistas are beautiful. From prairies of weeds and plateaus to mountains with forests and knee deep snow. Lovely waterfalls and lakes. Rivers teeming with fish and a world full of various breeds of reptiles, rabbits, squirrels, deer, elk, wild horses, birds and water fowl and the highly dangerous grizzly and brown bears and cougars and mountain lions. All can be hunted or like me you find your puny firearms early in the game are no match for an angry grizzly or cougar.The story is scripted but only to a small degree. During or in between quests you can wander, hunt, fish rob, murder or just interact with the people in your surroundings. Visit the good sized city of Saint Denis, the smaller towns or wander the bayous (watch out for alligators). Speaking with people can get you a friendly 'hello friend' or 'you better keep moving if you know what's good for you' response. Bumping into people (especially if you're on your faithful steed) will get you yanked from the saddle and beaten to death so keep that in mind. I found stabling your horse and walking saves you this from happening in most cases.There is so much to do and see in this game that to cheat or rush it is a crime. Enjoy the game for what the devs made it for. A fun and exciting adventure. Finally there are well over 100 Easter Eggs in the game. Just check it out on Youtube and watch a couple of videos to get an idea of what you'll see and find. Towns continue to grow, houses you observe being constructed are complete 6 or 7 years later and railroad track crews building a line complete it to add another line to the already long established lines.Right now at $19 is a deal. If you ever wanted to be a character in the West during the turn of the century this game is for you. Frankly this game is terrifically addictive and immersive."

First of all the game is a masterpiece and is easily the best story rockstar have produced yet.Story: the story seems simple enough from the outside but when you play the game you will find yourself immersed in the games amazing storyline and character, as the main protagonist Arthur starts as a brash, arrogant outlaw to an honourable character, and the side story of other missions are phenomenal.Graphics: This game has easily the best graphics of any game rockstar has produced and arguably some of the best graphics in history.Combat: the combat is amazingly balanced, as you can take the stealthier approach with knives and tomahawks and a range of melee and throwable weapons, or you can blow up everything in sight, the gun mechanics are amazing, the shooting feels very comfortable and has been polished brilliantly.NPCs: this is one of the best parts of the game. The npcs generally act in a normal fashion and live out the days of those who lived in that time, it creates an amazing environment that fits the given time period it was set in, you can interact with anyone on the street and create conversations and build a reputation with individuals in the town.Honour system: This system ranks how honourable you are among citizens and different levels unlock new equipment and perks. My favourite part about this is how cutscenes and the actual finale will change in regard to how honourable you are and even in game characters talk differently about you if you’re more honourable or a lot less honourable.Conclusion: this game is a must have, it is the perfect game for anyone who loves any type of game because it is so diverse, it doesn’t matter if you like learning about your character or just shooting people, I guarantee you will enjoy this game!"

Ok the first hour or so I spent tuning the settings and controls to make everything run optimally but once I got through all that, I got lost in the world of Red Dead all over again. Firstly, the graphics are absolutely stunning. I find myself having to stop my adventuring constantly to take photos of the landscape or an animal caught doing something cool. Whether you're up in the snowy mountains or riding through the desert or dense lush forests, everything feels incredibly genuine, with the upheaval of snow or mud as you wade through and realistic water physics and immersive ecosystems. Luckily I manage high-ultra settings and maintain a solid 80-100 FPS (except in busy towns, where it can drop to 60ish), a very rare treat for modern graphically demanding games.Gameplay-wise Rockstar also knocked it out of the park. Sure, the gun fights could be a little easier for QoL, but that's my one and only 'gripe' with the mechanics and it's a minor irritation at its worst. Some say that the survival and maintenance mechanics are tedious but I think it adds to that 'lone wanderer' feel this game gives. You're on your own most of the time with just your horse and I find myself taking pride in taking care of myself and my animal. Aside from being alone, you can stumble across a ton of random encounters all with a choice you can make and it just makes the world feel alive. The towns and NPCs all feel alive and real, offering jobs, vending, haircuts (for that awesome 'real time' hair and beard growth) and much more. And omg was it a breath of fresh air after Cyberpunk to see how intelligent the AI and crime systems are.Finally, story-wise, I cannot fault it. It's a masterpiece of writing and character development. Arthur Morgan has become one of my favourite characters of all time, not just in video games. The rest of the gang all have their own personalities which adapt as the story progresses and you really come to fall in love with (some of) them. Once I finished the epilogues I just wanted to erase my memory, go back, and do it all again.Overall RDR2 has become one of, if not, my favourite game of all time and now it's on PC I fully believe it to be the best video game ever made, with Witcher 3 being a close second (even though I prefer fantasy and RPG, RDR2 just constantly has me in awe). If you have a decent enough rig to run it well, I highly recommend picking it up. It's worth full price and more, but if you're lucky you can get it for a steal in a sale.Forgot to mention - the music, score and all audio in general are also absolutely incredible."

86,† Dead Like Me †,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DantesBabyGirl/,477,18,1,609.1,April,"18,","3,241",0,1,"The game was an extraordinary experience for me. Particularly the Story Mode. From the very beginning, I was drawn right into the game. It was like being in an interactive cinematic film. You felt so involved, it was one of the best fun I have had in quite a long time as far as how a game can leave a lasting impact. The graphics are beautiful, and very picturesque. The voice acting was brilliant and the cast was very believable. While playing it, I didn't want to leave and wanted to keep on playing, because for me, it was THAT good.Luckily, I didn't have too many issues with crashes. I got them a handful of times while playing through the Story Mode. The game comes with STEAM achievements too which gives you even more focus of activities to do in-game as a challenge.The game also has an online side of it. But the online, as much as it was fun playing it with a good friend, lacked content. Understandably, its still in early stages. The Online, has many many issues. Lots of ""disconnections from session"" and I have run into some modders. The infinite loading screens are a real nuisance, that for months, I have much difficulty joining into some games, like Racing for example. Some trade missions and Moonshiner missions will fail for no reason, and you lose your stock. The infinite loading screen will not load the mission, resulting in many 'RE-LAUNCHING THE GAME.' The camp setup is so glitchy that most of the time you cannot get the camp to spawn. * Overall, for the story mode, I will give this game a 9.5/10.* The Graphics I will give it a 9/10.* Music I will rate it as an 8/10* Cast/Characters in the game a 8.5/10* Realism like Hunting, skinning animals etc I will give that a 7/10 for the animation cutscene.* Online Mode is a bit more tricky to give a rating, though its packed with lots of fun aspects, it is very broken with so many issues for example -  the many disconnections, glitches, infinite loading screens, modders in some sessions forcing you to relaunch to change your session due to infinite loading screen preventing you to switch while already in-game. However, the Online aspect for me personally, is simply a BONUS to an awesome single-player game. This rating can change if and when Rockstar Games fixes the problems the game is currently experiencing in Online Mode.Note: Story Missions in Online Mode were fun to do as well as the Bounty Hunter jobs, Hunting animals for Trader Business, crafting, cooking, treasure hunting (Collector Business), mini activities (when working) were stacks of fun, and the fishing was realistic and enjoyable also. So in saying that, I will give these a 6.0/10."

88,Karen's Baked Ziti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adre4u/,266,6,1,120.9,April,"10,","1,004",11,1,"In the 120 hours it took me to finish the game, I didn't use the fast travel even once. The world is beautifully crafted, there's so much attention to detail and its so full of life, that I feared I'll miss something if I'd use it.Riding, fishing, hunting, just exploring this world can take so many hours of fun. I never enjoyed riding and exploring so much like in this game. Witcher 3 comes close in that regard, but the world in RDR2 feels way more alive. There's always something going on and you're not solely a spectator, you're part of it. People travelling and camping, bandits robbing a wagon or kidnapping someone, hunters mauled by predators, fishermans, animals lurking in the woods, wild horses running in open praires. Whole ecosystems with a fidelity in their representation that is really impressive, from the damp swamps of Lemoyne to the cold mountains of the Grizzlies, breathtaking sights in each and every one of these lands.The towns and cities follow the same design quality as the rest of the game, extremely detailed, with their own routines, people coming and going, living their life. Saint Denis might be one of the most beautiful and detailed cities I ever saw in a game, the moment you step on it you'll understand what I mean.The physics engine that made IV the ultimate GTA experience (for me at least) has come back to bring this game to life. Simply shooting at someone can have so many different outcomes it never feels like you're watching the same animation over and over. Enemies will fall off the horse to get trampled to death, they will get tangled in the stirrups, their corpses getting dragged until the horse calms down eventually falling dead on the ground. They'll get shot down like a sack of potatoes from the impact of a shotgun, face blown out in half. And more.The way animals move, interact with each other, get wounded and slowly die when you hunt them, how it feels to fall from your horse or crash into a wagon, every single one of these things has a weight of its own, is not just a couple of ragdolls colliding with each other without a sense of impact, it feels genuine.The chase sequences, shootouts, robbing trains and stores, shooting up a gang hideout, bounty hunting, I really enjoyed all of the different activities, there's not a lack of things to do and action is a plenty. Every one of these is fun to play and feel different each time thanks to the physics engine and its unique interactions.Although I would've loved to see some more guns, there's quite a good amount, but they all seem pretty similar to one another in how they feel. Once you've used a repeater rifle, you used them all. Same with shotguns, and revolvers. The only guns that really differentiate from other categories where the semi auto pistols, which were also way too powerful when used in dead-eye mode.I did not experience a single frame rate drop or a crash to desktop in the entirety of my 120 hours playthrough. Not. Even. Once.Bear in mind I'm playing on a fairly decent setup so your results may vary, but the consistency of the frame rate was really impressive considering the scope of the game and how good it looks.I only experienced a half a second freeze/stutter sometimes when entering Saint Denis, as if the game was loading the city, but it happened only when entering for the first time of each game session, and no more after that.And something that I hate about open world games, which is texture, grass, or NPC pop-in, is not present in this game, at all. That was another technical aspect that really impressed me.Other Rockstar games, Kingdom Come, Skyrim, you name it, almost every open world game has some degree of pop-in issues, sometimes is subtle, other times is unbereable (KCD, I'm looking at you), well Red Dead Redemption 2 got rid of that, completely.That's commendable, it looks wonderful, runs smooth, and doesn't suffer from common technical issues other games do, even games with much more smaller and less detailed worlds than this one.Some stuff that could've been better, Rockstar needs to address their mission design which feels a bit outdated, linear, it doesn't cut it anymore. Sometimes it holds on your hand too much to the point of feeling that it treats you as an idiot who would get lost if a big prompt isn't telling you what to do next every 5 minutes. The honour system doesn't make much sense. You get penalized for petty stuff like looting a corpse on the side of the road, starting a fight with a person who threatens you (and even if they start shooting at you) or accepting a reward after saving someone from a wild animal or a robbery.Some side missions often show another side of Arthur, who's a good hearted fellow, someone who, despite being a bandit, still retains some humanity. He's clearly not a murdering sociopath like some of the fellers he hangs around with. But then you go into another mission, that have you go beat the sh1t out of a working man just because he cannot repay a debt, or steal money from innocent people, then kill half a town to escape. Doesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't matter how you play outside of missions, it won't change anything, if you want to be good, you'll still be dragged to do stupid stuff and kill people for no reason other than ""we're outlaws"" and ""I have a plan, just blindly follow and trust me, dont ask any questions..."".The pacing of the story feels weird, it tries to give a sense of urgency but then it drags you doing errands and stuff that takes time and isn't really important nor urgent. Also, I would've loved to see what happened in Blackwater, since its the main reason the band is on the run, but you never really know what happened, you only get told that ""something went really bad and we had to leave"". A first mission similar to the GTA V bank robbery where you could play what happened in Blackwater to experience first hand the event that actually kickstarted the whole story, would've been a much better introduction to the game than the rather confusing one we got.But despite all that, the overall quality of the game was enough to outshine any negative aspects of it in my experience. This is truly a gem of a gem, worth a try even of you don't like open world games much, or just don't like games from Rockstar in general.Give this one a chance, you won't regret it. 10/10."

Of course, in the meantime, you can hunt, rob, kill and do whatever bad or dec you want, but you know that someone is waiting for you. And the finish will bring tears to your eyes for different things in many cases. It's an amazing, very realistic environment, My only regret was that I bought Red Dead Redemption 2 from the Rockstar Launcher the week it came out on the computer, I wish I had waited another 1 month and bought it on Steam, I've already bought the game now, it was a great feeling to finish this game again, it's really the best of all time."

For example, your characters pupils will dilate in darker environment. Horses balls shrinks in cold weather. Walking in snow or mud make footprints. If you hit someone, you may see them with a bandage around their head the day after. That kind of attention to details shines through the whole game.• The environment is living and breathing of life. This is not only the NPC's. You can even see birds picking up fish, dogs playing in the mud, and even eagles hunting rabbits. The environment and the people are different depending on which state you're in.• The story is extremely well-written. There is indeed a few underdeveloped characters. But overall it's just amazing: it's long, it's complex, and there are many ways to interact with the people in the story outside of the story itself. You really get to KNOW all the characters. The game's ending was very emotional and made me shred a tear.• There is lot's to do outside of the storyline.• I was afraid that this game would become another ''responsive, accessible, fast-paced dumbed-down action game. Well it was not. The shooting mechanics and the animations are great. Not everyone's cup of tea though: this game is not the typical AA-title with fast-paced action and accessible gameplay. Shooting and movement is slower and more deliberate. You have to shave, and clean yourself if you want to look respectable. You have to clean your guns from time to time to keep them in shape. There is a lot of animations. If you have short attention span this game might not be for you.• The soundtracks are amazing.Summary: If this game does not deserve 10/10 I don't know which game that would. No game is perfect. 10/10 cannot therefore refer to perfection. There is simply NO OTHER GAME like Red Dead Redemption 2. It is innovative. It cannot be replaced.

103,Reanimate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/reanimateee/,376,26,1,71.0,February,"24,","1,268",18,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2) is one of Rockstar’s best games ever. It vastly improves upon the first game, and has the quality you expect from a Rockstar game, and AAA games in general.Red Dead 2’s greatest strengths is its story and voice acting, along with the very strong world that always feels alive, bustling, and immersive. This is complemented by its deep and solid gameplay, along with a vast amount of customization in the game that you can use to make the playthrough unique to you.The gameplay in RDR2 is fantastic. While some argue that it’s too realistic and tedious, it didn’t bother me at all. In fact, I like the gameplay’s realism a lot. I liked pulling guns off your horse, looting dead bodies by digging their pockets individually, having to feed yourself and your horse to keep your cores filled up, and more. It’s a nice change of pace that fits the gloomy western atmosphere really well. Controls can be a bit overwhelming at first, but you can get a grasp of them fairly quickly. Sometimes you do stuff you don’t want to do by accident if you are not careful. I played through the game with controller just because I always find open world Rockstar games to be easier with controller, but the game is definitely playable on keyboard and mouse. Besides the horse riding requiring too much button tapping, I didn’t have many complaints with the controls. All keyboard controls are re-bindable which is a great touch.There is a lot of ways to get money, from honorable ways like bounty hunting, to dishonorable ways like train robberies. Once you get all this cash, there is a lot of stuff to spend it on! There is a lot of clothing items, guns, horses, accessories for those horses, food and drinks at the general store, and more! One big complaint I have to mention is that some guns are locked off until you unlock them in the story, which is annoying. You can be flush with cash but cannot spend it on new guns simply because you have not gotten to that part of the story, which is a goofy game design choice.You can also make Arthur yours by how you play the game. Included in the game is an honor system that will rise or fall depending on your choices in the game. Depending on your honor, you will talk to people differently, and people will react to your presence positively or negatively. I always played Arthur with high honor, but he can definitely work as a low honor character too, and I am considering a low honor playthrough soon!The story of Red Dead 2 is based around the Van der Linde gang running across the American frontier from government agents and lawman, after a failed heist in Blackwater. The gang’s relationship gets more strained as the law gets closer and closer to wiping the gang out, and this all happens in a world where the wild west era is getting swept by the oil refineries and cities. I personally loved the story from start to finish, and the setting it is based in complements the story. The story is written very well and always has you on the edge of your seat. It’s worth noting that RDR 2 is actually a prequel to the first game. The idea of making this game a prequel to RDR was pretty smart, as it sets up for the events of the first game, and makes the story of the first game that much more high stakes.Arthur Morgan, the game’s protagonist, is a joy to play as for the lengthy story. The other significant characters, such as Dutch, John, and Sadie are all well written. Dutch, in particular, has probably the best character development out of everyone in the game, as he leads the gang on the run from the law, and starts to go more insane as the game progresses. It’s also great to go out and do missions with various members of your gang, as you can bond with them and see how they work and react with Arthur. I didn’t have anyone in the game that I did not like when I saw them (besides the antagonists, of course).This game is absolutely beautiful, with some of the best graphics I’ve seen yet in any video game. The tradeoff is that RDR2 can be pretty taxing on your system. On my system, I ran the game at 1440p with a mix of Medium-High settings, and only managed to pull about 40-50 FPS. Seeing as I played through the game on Xbox One at 30 FPS, I wasn’t too annoyed about this. I preferred to see the game at its beauty in 1440p, and with it being so demanding, I just embraced the low FPS to experience the game at such a high graphical fidelity.The game is not bug/glitch free, as is typical from open-world games of this caliber. I ran into a few odd quirks and bugs, including a few softlocks and one game crash. One softlock included Arthur getting locked in place after getting out of bed. The other softlock was due to the crash mentioned earlier, which actually corrupted about 30 GBs of game files. I’m assuming the game didn’t know what to do when trying to access corrupted game files so it would lock up every time I would start a story mission. It was very annoying using up internet on my data cap redownloading game files to get my game working again. People have also reported issues with the Rockstar Launcher, but I never ran into any problems with it personally, although it is an inconvenience to have two layers of DRM keeping me from playing my $60 game.As of this review, the standard edition of RDR2 is priced at $59.99, with subsequent editions of this game being $79.99 and $99.99, with each edition adding small cosmetic DLC and Red Dead Online bonuses. In my opinion, the game is worth it even at $99. The amount of content on offer is mindblowing, complemented by very good writing and a lengthy story. Red Dead Online (RDO) is an extra to me compared to the singleplayer content.Speaking of Red Dead Online, it is included with the game for free, but there are some sections of it locked off behind a paywall. You can easily get past these paywalls if you shell out some money on the premium currency of RDO, Gold. Although you can earn gold in-game via stranger missions, it’s extremely slow, so I went ahead and shelled out money to buy access to all the Specialist roles, which was about $20. While it does add a lot of extra content, it was extra money I had to spend on top of the initial $52 I paid on the game. Keep that in mind if you want to get into RDO.Despite any setbacks of this game, it is worth every penny. Rockstar created such a vast, deep, and beautiful game that is dripping with love and passion. It has been worth the 50+ hours I spent in the world so far. I don’t know where Rockstar is going to take Red Dead now, but I’m excited to see!"

Such detail, gameplay, and feeling, is that great that I could play easily 4h without even noticing.The music is not a strong point but it sure makes everything more serious, and it puts more deep into the story.This game runs fine even on lower PC's, I had the privilege to play it on ultra settings & I was just happy. You can do a lot of things, poker, domino...If you have not try this game yet, then I suggest you to do it, my second favorite game of all time."

The game has it all: It's gorgeous, well-written, well-animated, the quests and side quests are all polished and interesing. The attention to detail is astonishing and the lasting appeal is phenomenal. This is not only one of these games that establish a bridge between the video game media and the cinematic world (think of it like a 80-hour long interactive tarantino movie), but it is also the best of them in my humble opinion.I bought the game around the time Cyberpunk 2077 was released (I really wanted this game to be my favourite game...the setting, the developper, the possibilities....exactly what I wanted.)Result: Played RDR2 around 20 hours then came Cyberpunk. Played Cyberpunk for about 15/20 hours across 4 or 5 play sessions.....I was forcing myself to go back to it.After a while I gave up entirely and went back to RD2. No regret. Best AAA game I've seen in years.BTW I work as a professional pilot and I don't have much time to play nowadays. What I really want from a game is to escape and relax for a couple hours here and there.With RDR2, I feel like i'm teleported to early 20th century south-western USA in a blink. My name is Arthur for a couple hours, I ride my horse, contemplate the beauty of the appalaches, hunt the bounty I picked at the local sheriff office, blow his hand in a gun duel, hogtie him to the back of my horse, stop by the river on the way back to do a little sunset fishing while my prisoner insults me in the background. Drop him in jail, collect the bounty, go back to Valentine to rest at the hotel, take a bath in good company, play a couple rounds of poker, punch a drunk on the thoroughfare on the way back to the hotel. And go back to sleep. End of play session. 2 hours well spent...."
114,Mischief,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Travesura/,205,4,1,278.6,August,"24,",486,0,1,"First of all, English is not my native language but for practice I'm going to write this review in this lovely language, sorry if you see any mistakes.I'll try to don't ramble too much even if it's going to be difficult but this game has a lot to talk. Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best game I've played in a long time, even one of the best I've ever played in my short life. It's not perfect, it has faults but it's a really good experience. I think Rockstar is the best making open worlds or at least making worlds that feel alive, not just look nice. The world is full of details, you are able to do a lot of things like hunting and fishing and those tasks feel really well made, even if I personally think fishing is boring like look a brick, this accompanied by a technique section really impressive, the textures, animations, lights, smoke, sand, and fog among others just look gorgeous and help the world looks much better. There are landscapes really beautiful out there, getting lost in the forest/dessert/mountains contemplating the nature is a delightful, even the city of Saint Denis in its industrial ""apogee"" it's beautiful, the light effects and fog at night ... are simply speechless. The animation of animals, people, everything help to feel that world alive. Unfortunately, I can pin one of the problems of the game here, the game is poorly optimized. Even if I have the recommended requirements and more, I can't make the game works at a stable 60 fps ( I don't feel many fps drops and it's totally playable ), some graphics option simply doesn't work or work badly. If you have a system that has problems with the minimum requirements I'm not sure if you are going to be able to enjoy properly the game. The Story, I think this is the best writing game of Rockstar so far, it's not excellent but really good, maybe a bit rushed in the development of the game, I say that because there are many part of the world that you don't see or experiment with Arthur. It shows a cruel and beautiful world of the pre 19th century. Arthur is such a good protagonist, his develop of character is ... personally one of the best things of the game, He changes like the world around him but, he is not alone, the other characters in the gang are so good writing, other better than other, but you can make a good feeling with those people. Even the secondary characters are good wrote, those you find in secondaries quest or strangers out there. There are decisions in the game but don't change so much at the end, even if there are 4 different finals available.The gameplay is good, it feels good, the game is full of options, weapons, and stuff, the missions are the big point but, like a good video that I saw on youtube, it seems like Rockstars always wants to take you by the hand, nothing of improvising, we don't do that thing here, don't misinterpret me, the missions are super fun but maybe a bit of player control can help to be more fun.  I feel curious about some control riding the horse, I'm not sure if it is a bug or just a realistic mechanic, it's annoying though, when suddenly the horse run in circles.  Now I'll talk a bit about the online, if you are going to buy this game thinking this is a Western GTA online, yeah it's something like that but nope. I played some hours it's fun with friends, I personally don't like the pvp component, I think the pve is more fun but that's my opinion. The online feels a bit empty, there are things to do but, not much, also there are many cheaters/modders than it seems Rockstar don't care a bit. The Strongpoint in this game is the campaign, that's all. In synthesis or something like that RDR2 is, in my opinion, the best Western open world over there, it's has a delightful world, an adult, cruel and sad  well made story, and an online not so good but fun with a lack of content. I hope Rockstar bet more games like this one. Thank you!"

It actually HAS that confidence. And it delivers. This is the greatest video game narrative ever written. The choice to make it a prequel and tie it back to John Marston’s old days in the Dutch Van Der Linde Gang is hands down the BEST aspect of this game. It harkens back to characters you love, so you instantly have that connection and uses that context to establish new characters you’ll know and love as well. Arthur Morgan’s struggle with morality and the inevitable outcome of his actions is one of the most engaging gaming stories ever told and is a great successor to John Marston’s story which was also brilliant."

Going through the game and seeing the misadventures the gang gets up to and how Arthur's perception of the world around him changes made me fall in love with this game. It's the most I have been emotionally invested in a game in a long time. The gun mechanics of the game are also top notch. Every shot feels like it has an impact and all the guns feel like actual weapons. Rockstar truly made a world that truly feels alive. It feels like I'm riding through late 19th century America. I can't really talk about the online experience because I haven't played enough of it to give a fair review.If you're considering buying this game I HIGHLY recommend it and hope that you can enjoy the story as much as I did. Even if the online is mediocre, the story makes this game worth every penny."

Is Red Dead Redemption 2 Worth It?In terms of bang for your buck, it's well worth the money, even at $60. In fact, games like Red Dead Redemption 2 make the argument that games could be a lot more expensive and justify the price simply due to the sheer amount of content it has.2. Can you play Red Dead Redemption offline?That's right: you can't play even the story mode of Red Dead Redemption 2 if you're not online. The game uses the Rockstar Game Launcher no matter where you've purchase the game from. And if you launch the game without being connected to the internet, you'll be told you don't have the rights to play it. For now can't be fixed, maybe it will be like that forever.3. How Long Does Red Dead Redemption 2 take to beat?Most estimates put the game's length at about 40 to 60 hours, with HowLongtoBeat reporting an aggregated length of 47.5 hours in simply completing the main campaign. If you decide to complete the game's side quests, that will add about 30 hours to the game.4. Is RDR2 a hard game?It won't be very hard as far as game play goes. Play on easy. You don't really even need to aim, if that's what you're worried about.5. How old is Arthur Morgan?"

Perhaps the greatest video game I have played...a game everyone should play. This game has one of the best stories ever made, Oscar-worthy voice acting, a soundtrack you could listen to over and over, an open world that feels alive but wants you dead, characters you wish you could confide in and cuddle, graphics that have truly set the bar for open-world games(only if you have some GAMING MONSTER) and an experience you will never forget like never. And those tiny mind blowing details in these game is beyond expectation. Once again Rockstar games manage to outdo themselves. You can easily sink 100's of hours in this huge experience exploring the vast beautiful world of the west in the early 1900s.

The sheer amount of dialogue and character building in this game is just incredible. Everything from the graphics, combat, soundtrack, mission design and writing are top-notch and that's what makes Rockstar so special. I've never gotten so attached to a character as much as I did with Arthur Morgan, he's one of the best video game protagonists ever. There's just so much to see and do in this wonderful open world and it never gets old. Also, it is very well optimised and I never really had any issues with bugs or crashes. The only con for me was that the pacing got a bit slow and off direction about midway through the game, but  it does pick up soon after. Also, I felt that the game restricts player freedom and movement in some missions and camps which is a bit annoying. Other than these, the game is just near perfect. If the huge campaign wasn't enough, there's Red Dead Online too which has a lot of fun content to be had and is frequently updated. Red Dead Redemption 2 is worth every single penny, definitely recommended."

The map isn't that big and while it is full of content, you won't feel overwhelmed by it. Going for a 100% was a difficult task but with a PLAN, you can get it done quite fast and without getting bored, though there are some birds that won’t appear when you want them to and will become a headache for a couple of days, but you'll get it done. RDO is full of mod menu users and gets annoying at times, (there are a few guides on how to avoid this), there are bugs here and there, and personally I didn't enjoy it quite much, so I did not spend much time playing online like I did on single player.In conclusion, the single player experience is one, if not the best out there, great mechanics and excellent story.

Being able to grow out Arthur's Beard and hair, and even styling it at given length is incredible!The story telling is also a big part of it. It is truly a sad story with excellent writing, though I understand the story being strictly scripted and there is always one outcome. There are also tons of content like side missions which I equally enjoyed. My most memorable immersive experience was to sit by the campfire with the gang and a bottle of Whiskey in my hand. Everyone was jolly singing together for a hot minute. And then there was Javier who played with his amazing guitar. It was quiet, peaceful, I took my time and appreciate the moment. This is a slow-paced game that not a minute I ever regret spending.No such game has made me so attached to a fictional character like RDR2.

It tells the story about the struggles of people whose old way of living is confronted with a new and rapidly ever changing society of the US during the end of the 19th Century. A Story about thieves in a world that does not want them anymore. The World is absolutely gorgeous and lively and there is always something to do may it be hunting, fishing, committing crimes, strangers you encounter or just relaxing during a ride with your horse companion. Everyone in this game has a personality. I would not be able to kill or rob NPCs just for fun as i did in many other games. I would greet every single one of them and talk to them. Engage in games with people at the local saloon and just hang out there. Your gang members feel alive and have a deep character to them. They react to changes you make and feel like a family you care about (except Micah). The level of detail in this game is absolutely insane. Arthur Morgan is an amazing Protagonist and my favourite by far. I absolutely love him and formed a strong bond to him throughout the story. His journey to redemption is what this game is truly about and makes the Story beautiful. It can be slow at times but it will come back with a bang and gets more exciting. Every major loss is a loss you experience on an emotional level even for random strangers you made friends with. This game made me cry. Thank you Rockstar and everyone who worked on it. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who wants to immerse himself/herself and experience an astonishing story. It changed how i view certain things in life. 10/10"

148,BlacKy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blacky-inc/,160,10,1,168.2,August,"31,",181,1,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is not a game, but an experience.You are experiencing the story of Arthur Morgan, a member of a group that wants to live by their own rules and try to make their own future in 1899's USA. Their story serves as a prequel to the first RDR game.Story wise, the game progresses similar to any typical GTA game, slowly climbing the ranks of crime and doing jobs with increasingly dangerous gang members, but the difference between RDR2 and most of the GTA games is that here, the story is the focus of the game, instead of the action.Gameplay wise, the game progresses very slowly and you will need to make sure you have a lot of free time per sitting to play this game, as one hour a day wont be enough to fully experience the game as intended. Every animation takes its time, at some points, you would feel like its somewhat of an RPG grind, but thats the charm of RDR2, as it forces you to embrace the nature of the game and take it all in, instead of rushing between different jobs. Personally it took me 100 hours to finish the story mode and i've barely scratched the surface when it comes to completing all the side stuff, and boy oh boy, there are plenty of those.UPDATED PART - RDR ONLINE:RDRO wants to give a very similar experience to GTA V Online but it fails to do so in a few ways.First of all, expect to have no real help with getting around the game mode as you'll have little sense of whats going on and where to go. Its going to be really helpful to play at least 10-20 hours in single player mode before jumping into online, so you can understand how RDR mechanics even work.2nd, expect the game world to be empty of actual players, because the game mode is dying and also because Rockstar is hiding most players from the map due to past griefing problems (can google about this).And lastly, the last nail in the coffin is how they push pay-2-win mechanics and grinding into the game. Basically, instead of just doing jobs for money so you can upgrade your gear and buy new outfits, the game tells you to first grind gold bars by a broken awards system so you can assign yourself to a 'role', by which you will do normal jobs to earn more money and gold. Online mode tries to be as unwelcoming as possible to new players who just want to play some jobs with friends, as in most cases you will find a lacking online experience that puts you on an 'empty' server as a new character. If you search 'fastest ways to earn gold' on youtube, you will see what i mean about how the grind works. Personally i gave up with Online at level ~20 when i realised its going to be a really unwelcoming experience to just get started with the game.As for loading times, they seem much shorter than in GTA V Online, so thats one positive i can say here, tho expect similar Rockstar server hiccups.Performance and optimization is where the game lacks a bit (used to be much worse when it launched tho). Rockstar didnt do a fine job porting this game into the PC platform and it can be sensed mostly when riding horses, navigating on foot, and doing certain actions with certain key buttons. Nothing out of the ordinary, but know these things exist.When it comes to performace, the game is really demanding. Personally i own an AMD RX 5700xt GPU with a Ryzen 5 2600x CPU and i get solid 75FPS on mid settings at 1440p (cranking the settings to ultra brings down the fps to around 30, again, at 1440p). Gameplay can stutter when entering towns and cities. There are 2 ways to solve this stuttering issue:1) Lower the overall settings of the game2) Change the API from Vulkan to Directx12 (this may cause other problems of its own tho).Make sure you have a beastly PC as this game is not a game that you'd want to play on low detail. Also check optimization videos on youtube and guides on steam community about which setting to set to which value for optimized FPS and detail.Both the special edition and the ultimate edition add some xp bonuses, cosmetics, practical gear and fast horses, and some money in online mode. You can google the full list.So, which game version should you buy?In most cases i would advise to go for the cheapest version as everything else feels like useless cosmetics and pay-to-win mechanics with no real added DLC content, however, when this game goes on sale, Rockstar deliberatedly gives higher sale value on the higher tier versions (20% for base game, 33% on special, and 40% on ultimate), thus leaving the actual price margins to be only a few dollars, so with that in mind, it will make little sense to buy the base game, so wait for a sale and then get the ultimate edition, unless you have no interest what so ever about the things that are added."
149,🍁キ⃣ツ⃣ネ⃣🍁,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AshFox/,193,1,1,316.6,September,"20,",398,4,1,"Storyline: The story mode is a very slow burning candle, it's really slow paced and people are either gonna love it or hate it. I personally like to take my time while playing games so that was a plus for me. The main plot takes its time introducing characters, building up tension and stirring drama, so that the player would actually feel a connection to each character, that connection can be either be negative or positive. : While on the subject of being slow paced, it doesn't  end with the storyline, most elements of this game are made in such a way to be realistic, for better or worse, for example, everything that the main character does is fully animated, skinning an animal, picking up hats from the ground, looting dead corpses, opening individual drawers, picking up items from said drawers etc, now that makes for some good immersion and RP experience, but some people might hate it as it might lose its charm quite early on. : The world in RDR2 might not be the biggest or the most populated out there, but it looks absolutely amazing, especially on higher settings. You're gonna notice the wildlife is quite sophisticated in this game, you're gonna witness crows picking dead bits off dead people, eagles picking rabbits off the ground or seagulls diving for fish. There's always something to do in the game, either it being hunting animals, chasing bounties, robbing trains, starting a bar fight, playing poker or some relaxing fishing, there's almost not a single moment where you're all out of things to do. This brings me to my next subject, Encounters.: There's a lotta side missions in this game, but other than that, there's the smaller, less significant random encounters. Almost everytime you're travelling from point A to point B, you're gonna encounter one. Either it being saving a random girl from a kidnapper, saving some random guy from wolves, getting ambushed by rival gangs, coming across people robbing others, the world always feels alive which is amazing.: The game features a whole lot of talented voice actors for this game, the one you're gonna hear the most would be Roger Clark, the voice actor for the main character Arthur Morgan, he's always gonna have something to say about the situations you find yourself in the game, whether it being in a mission or just randomly roaming about. You'd see the main character singing to himself, or blaming his temper after killing someone innocent, or talking to his horse while cleaning it.  The soundtrack is amazing as well, you'd hear some great calm ,serene tracks during scenes like riding out a snowy mountains or some epic western music when in a huge gun fight. The music doesn't overstay its welcome and it leaves you to your normal gameplay when there's no need for it to be there.: The game looks absolutely amazing, you'd ride around breathtaking vistas, gorgeous snowy mountains, smoke surrounded cities, foggy swamplands or barren deserts, and the game manages to look amazing throughout every landscape you come across.TLTR, the game is quite slowpaced but it can be a great experience for those who appreciate such game designs:It can be fun when played with real friends, but that's personally as far as I'm personally going to go with praising the online part. It may be just my opinion, but the online part absolutely throws everything good about the singleplayer campaign out the window and indroduces some lackluster and barebone system to either get players grinding, or get them to buy gold bars to avoid the grind.Most of the things you do in online aren't that fun, I often found myself TRYING to enjoy it. It greatly suffers from lack of content as everything it currently has is quite barebone and often buggy.It can clearly use some love from R* team for it to be more enjoyable. But right now, it's a meh experience.All in all, the single player campaign is absolutely worth every penny for those who like the points I've mentioned. But I'd do a bit of research before buying the game just for the ONLINE aspect of it."

The Rockstar launcher simply prevented me from launching the game or it crashed. I updated everything and tried many of the fixes suggested by the community but no luck.

For 80$ and a 110GB download I should be able to press play and not worry about it launching or crashing.

I don't like giving them my email, creating an account so they can sell me stuff or the extra layer of DRM on top of Steam which treats paying customers like potential criminals.I hate the always online BS (on an offline, single player game) that requires validation every time I launch it, insinuating that their $20 is somehow more important than my time. I hate the fact that I can't play the game right now because their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little servers are down. It basically means I don't own the game because I can only play it when they so graciously allow a mere peasant like myself to play it.It also pisses me off that while their crappy launcher is jerking off in the background, it may be harming performance and I could potentially increase some settings and get the experience I paid for.Putting a small warning about 3rd party DRM on the store front isn't enough. It should be outright banned from Steam and it's a practice which shouldn't be tolerated."

HOWEVER, I've seen lots of people complaining about performance, so be warned, you may have to do some tweaking in the settings before you get performance you're happy with, but I think it is well worth the 10 minutes tops of effort.     This game is a pretty standard R* Affair. Overly linear mission structure, simplistic combat, excessive aim assist (when using a controller), if you've played GTA V, you know what to expect. However, the writing, full of likeable (and unlikable) and interesting characters, with understandable motivations and actions. Story is a major plus for the game, so far. The online experience of Red Dead Redemption 2 has many of the same qualities that GTA Online had, which comes with some pros and cons. The grind is real, it takes a while to level up, and things can feel a bit limited at first, but joining posses with randoms is a great way to try out some of the later content before you've unlocked it, (as well as earning yourself some cash and gold) I was pleasantly surprised with how quickly I gained gold, which is the premium currency of the the Online mode. Playing with friends will be a guaranteed good time, just like with GTA Online.All in all, this game runs pretty damn well on my outdated system, while still looking far better than I expected. The gameplay is less-than superb, but the immersion and story is enough for me to foresee myself dumping hundreds of hours into the game. The story has already sunk its claws of intrigue into me, and I doubt it will be long before I've completed it."

159,Saint Aaron,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011965365/,211,4,1,39.8,July,"12,","2,352",7,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 achieves its aim to create a immersive and realistic world in which to play out its Western drama. The game is intentionally slow paced, which some may find off-putting, but this pacing is designed to make you explore, take in the natural world, and discover the various secrets and encounters that are out in that wilderness.This is not a game full of high-energy action every few minutes, but a slow, and often lonely, experience which captures the pathos of the decline of the frontier and the old west. Personally I have spent hours simply cantering around the world, greeting strangers, interacting with random events, and observing the wildlife, nothing more than me, my horse (named roach in reference to the Witcher 3) and the wild. It is visually stunning and weather effects and lighting can give even familiar areas a different atmosphere.In the critical reviews there’s a lot of negative remarks about “spending most of the time riding” or “no fast travel”; I just don’t understand this criticism – Why would you not want to ride through remarkable scenery, encountering random things on the way, while heading to your mission? The hours spent riding through the world were probably the most immersive, most enjoyable experiences I’ve had in an open world game for many years. Without that riding, I would never have been ambushed by the O’Driscolls on my way back to valentine, never met a crazy old man who tried to steal my horse, never camped in the wilderness and been threatened by a couple of crazy rednecks, never found out about the secret history of a certain abandoned saloon.If games are only about action for you, then avoid this; If they are about the experience then this game will provide you hundreds of hours of entertainment."

But the funny thing is that this ‘’previous gen game’’ is the best example of what a next gen game is supposed to be. The world, the graphics, the NPC interactions, the soundtrack, the gameplay, the characters, the amount of content, the story (and the list goes on) are insanely good, I have never experienced something like this. The game is years ahead of its time and to be honest, I am scared and also excited to see what the next game of Rockstar will be like."
167,lexilogo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lexilogo/,"1,494",72,0,311.6,May,"9,",442,86,1,"Okay, so to get the elephant in the room out of the way, the singleplayer campaign is REALLY, REALLY good. It absolutely deserved its status as a popular Game of the Year contender/choice. A few highlights I want to make are:Re. Performance errors, I did encounter the dreaded NVIDIA stutter, but after tweaking with options and trying the Rockstar-approved fix, I was able to solve it and everything else was smooth for me. The game's never crashed on me in my time playing it, but my PC is on the higher end of the spectrum and I don't speak for everyone.So, why the negative review?  (either for moral reasons or because you're actually interested)I honestly think Red Dead Online is a better experience than GTA Online, as you can walk for more than a minute without getting killed by the dozens upon dozens of ludicrously overpowered vehicles that roam that abomination- This is partially due to RDO's more grounded setting/feel, and because the open-world is better designed and doesn't cluster damn near everyone in one tiny tenth of the map. (though Saint Denis is usually pretty populated if that's what you're looking for) Plus, the playerbase is generally less interested in senseless murder and 9/10 people you meet won't kill you on sight.And, quite critically, instead of most people spending their time in scripted missions, RDO does a better job juggling between missions and openworld gameplay for moneymaking. It ACTUALLY feels like an open-world game gone online. Admittedly, these missions are largely ruined by forced public matchmaking with no option to solo, so the ""mission"" is more you running around killing things being constantly pressured by the level 200 hardcore grinders to move faster, skip every cutscene, ecetera, but hey, the open-world gameplay is okay enough.And, here's the BUT... Take Two are a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who are certainly not even remotely happy with making some of the best-selling games of all time with ludicrously profitable microtransactions. Nope, the in-game economy needs to either get people dedicated and invested in the game (and therefore willing to spend money on it), OR for whales who want to actually have fun without hours upon hours of grinding for basic necessities, the spending of as much $ as possible.Many items cost several times more than they do in the base campaign (especially cosmetics, 100 RD$ is relatively cheap for a single hat, and hanging up a small picture in your moonshine shack can cost quadruple that), money is much harder to make, and most insidiously, the secondary Gold Bar currency that's extremely tough to earn outside of doing Daily Challenges every single day to keep up a Streak is used not only for things like exclusive cosmetic items, but to bypass level gate requirements and the Roles, which are the primary moneymaking methods and to be frank CONTENT the mode has to offer, are gated behind extorbitant amounts of Gold.Each of the four Roles costs 15 Gold Bars (except for Moonshiner, which costs 25 AND requires the Trader Role to be unlocked and levelled, so you need a total of  Gold Bars to unlock every Role and actually experience what the full game has to offer), and to put that into perspective, completing a Daily Challenge earns you  Gold Bars. You do get multiple Daily Challenges a day, the aforementioned Streaks can help, and you can get around 0.08 Gold Bars per open-world Stranger Mission you do, but it's REALLY horrible, blatant content-gating behind huge paywalls designed to psychologically manipulate people, and there's also the ""Outlaw Pass"" (guess what that is) if all that wasn't enough money lining Take Two's pockets.I'm not sure which system between GTAO or RDO is worse, GTAO's inflated currency resulting in unbelievably excessive money burning pits like the Yachts, or RDO's incredibly stingy economy that has created a system where its players are deathly terrified of investing money in anything they won't make regular use out of, but I seriously dislike both and Look, I'm not against grindy games, I'm not even wholly against microtransactions, and I actually would LIKE the appeal of a world in which every dollar felt precious and like an achievement and where I have to work my way up from a broke cowpoke to an untouchable gunslinger badass- But the presence of a BUY GOLD BARS button immediately obliterates that and is a complete breakdown of player trust. I can no longer assume stupidity when such a massive motivation for malice is present, and I can't go ten minutes in Red Dead Online without being reminded once again that I'm playing a psychologically manipulative scam. to buy this game for its single-player mode, but I  recommend it when it's attached by the hip to Red Dead Online."
168,Geekydeval,https://steamcommunity.com/id/morwull/,250,9,1,50.1,June,"26,","1,260",0,1,"1890, it’s the end of the millennia and with it, the end of an era, the era of outlaws as industrialization reaches all the corners of the United States, it’s the arrival of modern civilization.Let’s get the cat out of the bag as soon as possible, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of my favorite games of all time but no game is exempt of things that could be changed so let’s see what’s going on with this game, shall we? Main story is made up of three acts that I will call “from blindly following to breaking free” in which all our characters will evolve in a very surprisingly deep way that we don’t usually see in other Rockstar games. The structure of the story is actually simple: the gang arrives at a new place running away from an old trouble -> gang gets in trouble and needs to move to a new location while the gang has internal frictions that slowly breaks the group. Make no mistake, this is not an endless cycle of running away, it is clearly visible how the group is slowly getting worse both internally and externally, not only their camps get worse overtime with declining living conditions and a very thin brotherhood that it’s getting thinner day after day but also problems get bigger and bigger until everything collapses. The story is superb and completely destroys it’s characters by exposing the true nature of an outlaw life, a decadent and obscure life of escapism, violence and death. This story wouldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for the so well constructed characters such as Arthur Morgan, the main character. Arthur is a Dutch’s blind follower but at the same time is a co-leader for the band as he’s one of the most trustful members of the group. His personal background is what makes him the ideal main character for this game, since young he has known poverty, violence, pain and crime, another lost boy that gets into Dutch hands, this is why his lifestyle is surrounded by the same violence he experienced and makes impossible for Arthur to establish a relationship or keep a family, the gang is his family now and that’s the dynamic of the game, how his family and his vision of everything that surrounds him will change.The Evolution of Arthur is really well done, all his perception changes are made by subtle situations that will escalate over time from day-to-day situations to really challenging ones, Arthur has a heart inside him, a sad story behind and a not so bright future in front of him but it’s remarkable how we can empathize with him at certain points to the point when we might even care about him.  Not only the story is really well done, the representation of the South-East of the United States of late 1800’s, a nation of contrast, still healing from a not so far war and a country that it’s experiencing numerous changes not only in technological terms but also when it comes to bureaucracy and law, the old world is dying as the new millennia approaches and you can clearly see that in the different regions of the map, from the little rural communities, the untouched natural landscapes overflowing with wildlife to the complete industrialization of the big cities. The differences between the old and the new ways are also visible through the citizens, how they interact with each other, their talking, everything is so amazingly well crafted to give differential elementos to each region and NPCs. This couldn’t be possible if it wasn’t for the enormous amount of technology and fidelity inside this game, it’s possibly one of the most impressive games out there and I’m not only referring to visual elements which are stunning but also depth in terms of interaction, animation and reactive moments. Let’s talk about this, visually this game is a juggernaut, the beauty of a more natural US, the fidelity of the buildings, the different regions, it’s absolutely incredible. In terms of animations and reactivity of the characters with the elements of their surroundings is top notch, I know this element might be divisive due to the slow pace of each interaction however it feels really natural and for me while not necessary it really helps to build this feeling of immersion on this digital world, in general every element of this game is built to make you feel immersed and create the illusion of realism, it does an stunning job, seriously.This game is very demanding so please keep in mind that, I would say my experience in terms of performance was really great with a very consistent performance of 60fps aside of certain extra demanding areas such as Saint Denis but in general, consistent performance and a great quality, a mix of mid and ultra with tons of trial and error until getting the desired performance, I seriously recommend to toy a bit with the options until you get the experience you want. Visually impressive, animations are top notch, what about the music and sound design? Of course it keeps a very high level, sound is in general really good, nature feels natural and industry feels industrial (redundant, I know hehe) but it fits really well on their respective zones, but the important part here is the soundtrack, is it any good? Yes, the soundtrack is good, very noticeable tracks here and there, scripted moments with an specific mood that really changes the feeling of the scene completely and a good variety of styles, the most noticeable, the Spaghetti western music style with those distinct tones, for example, it’s indeed a good soundtrack. So, if everything is good why did I say at the very beginning of this review that there were some things that could be changed in order to make a better product? Well, this is a very personal opinion but, game focuses too much on John Marston and I feel like at times this game is more about John than about Arthur at times, plus, the epilogue feels unnecessary after Chapter five, I feel like they could have done it differently to make it feel important however, for me, it feels like something that shouldn’t be there or should be a completely separated thing from the main campaign but even then it was good and the content was well written with very special moments.Also, please, take in mind that the pace of this game goes from slower to quicker the further you go in the story, brace yourselves and be patient, while the first two chapters are really slow from chapter three up to the end of the game is a roller-coaster of key moments. Is this a bad thing? Absolutely no but I think it’s important as a lot of people will feel like this game is really slow and will probably drop it before it gets really interesting. In conclusion, after all I have said here it is clear that I will recommend you to play this game, however, I must ask you to please let you go and dive into this deep and marvelous world that is the US of late 1800’s, explore the map, meet the numerous people that live in there and enjoy the life of the outlaws and the story of Arthur Morgan, this experience might be one of the best I had playing and I sure hope that yours is as amazing as mine. Absolutely recommended."
169,thkara,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thkara/,92,,1,225.8,January,"30,",902,5,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an extraordinary game in every way. There is immense detail in everything. From start to finish you are immersed in the 19th century of the US following an outlaw gang. You will end up caring for almost each one of the gang members. The story keeps a high standard throughout the game without losing focus or becoming tedious. The epilogue is a love letter to the previous game and ties up the storyline nicely. The protagonist is very relatable. He tried his best. The World is astonishing. NPCs, wildlife, Cities, biomes are all exceptionally crafted. Sent Denis at night is easily one of the most beautiful period cities ever created. The music reinforces the narrative delivering some of the best pieces in video games. Everything in the game is meticulously well placed. The bar is too high for every other open-world game out there.One of the best games I have ever played."

Slowly you begin to form your own biases and conclusions for each character as Arthur interacts with them.You make decisions that will impact how everyone sees you and how everyone will treat you. Though I would have wanted to explore that a bit more, your decisions are gonna be influenced by the karma meter. I would have liked to be able to stay right in the middle,like a grey moral area between good cowboy and bad cowboy but oh well.The graphics are amazing, let's just get that out of the way. It looks great, the weather system is a little fast sometimes but not too jarring. The biomes that simulate the arid areas, the cold areas and the more temperate areas are superbly done. I especially hate the swamp lands cause it gives me that gross humid feeling and it is frankly pretty great since its able to make me feel that way.Clothing options aplenty but with some limitations. Truly the endgame is to be able to dress up in many different outfits and be able to put on different looks whenever the mood strikes you. There's a decent amount of clothes you can layer but sometimes the physics kind of bug out. This part specifically for the online version cause the tail coats have a bug that give your character some ""extra cake"". There is a good selection of playable guns and I love the fact that you can customize them as well. Who wouldn't wanna ride off in the sunset with a pair of golden revolvers? Pearl handles too. If the first few hours of the game don't hook you in, you might not enjoy the rest of the actual game. If you're struggling to make it past the first bit, I urge you to trudge along and at least give it a fair chance. It gets a lot more fun, trust me. Oh the free roaming is great. You can ignore the storyline completely so that you can just ride around RP-ing as a cowboy or whatever you wanna do. Standard rockstar open world but no cars, only horses.The best part that I like about RDR2 is the hunting.You can just chill out and instead of doing the usual thing where you shoot people,you can just go hunting instead, stalk your prey, strike and skin 'em. Make 'em into clothes 'n stuff.Go fishing, catch some good eats. Avoid getting bodied by a crocodile.Just remember.Be rootin'be tootin'and above allAlso RDO is kinda So many cheaters.RDR2 = 9/10"

177,✦$@MPH0€N!X✦™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Samphoenix79/,108,8,1,248.3,February,"25,",260,0,1,"I'd like to preface this review by saying few things. This is gonna be a SPOILER FREE review and it will be based entirely on the story mode of the game. The review is my personal take on the game as a whole. So it is quite natural that some of the multitude of other players who have played/been playing this game may differ with what I am gonna write. Opinions are subjective and I am sure everyone understands that. Last but not the least I am writing a review after a long time. So bear with me. Having said all that, let's dive right into it. OPEN WORLDRed Dead Redemption 2's open world is arguably the best open world I have ever been a part of. It is a dynamic world teeming with life in every nook and cranny. From livestock towns to marshy swamps to hustling and bustling metropolis to snowclad mountains to barren desolate deserts the game presents you with amazing and varied environments and vistas to explore. The seamless blending of all these diverse locations as you traverse through the sprawling open world is truly impressive. There are no annoying loading screens which makes it all the more immersive.GRAPHICSThe visual fidelity of the game is absolutely gorgeous. Not only the game presents you with breathtaking vistas but also the subtle effects as in the ears glowing red when sunlight falls on it is something I have never seen in a video game before. It is mind boggling how Rockstar have meticulously put such details into the game. The PC version truly shines in this regard.Here are some screenshots:-STORYI'd just like to give a general overview here. The story spans across a prologue, six chapters and a two part epilogue. It is well and truly one of the most memorable stories I have seen in a video game making the players go through a rollercoaster ride and experience a wide range of emotions. The characters are all fleshed out, the voice acting is impeccable and you really feel the bond growing with almost all of the gang members as you progress through the game. Overall it feels like a really well directed movie with an engrossing plot complimented by excellent writing. You just have to experience it for yourself.GAMEPLAY The gameplay is fairly simple but has some certain nuances about it. It is essentially a shooter as you gun down a large number of enemies in majority of the missions. There's the dead eye system which basically slows down time to take out multiple enemies in one go. Initially you start off with a very basic form of it but as you keep progressing you'll eventually unlock more advanced forms of it. There is also a cover system which is appreciated but imo it felt kind of clunky albeit it works fairly well. Stealth at times is a viable option with bows, arrows and throwing knives. However the inventory management is atrocious. It feels clumsy and dated. The horse AI is awful in this game as well. It is very poorly implemented. Talking about nuances since you'll be exploring the aforementioned diverse locations throughout your playthrough you'll have to dress up accordingly. For instance if you're high up in the mountains you'll have to wear warm clothing in order to prevent your health core from draining out and vice versa. Again the fact that you have to periodically clean the weapons in order to keep them functional is very cool as well. The game also offers extensive gun customization too. Having said all that, the most important part of your entire playthrough will be the gang's camp. As much as one would love to go out exploring and do missions, I was so hooked to just stay in the camp talking to all the gang members, listening to the conversations, their thoughts and the stories they had to share. There'll be times when the gang will be celebrating on some occasions and boy were those times so gratifying. It all felt so organic, spontaneous and natural. Last but not the least there's an honour system in game which basically is a scale to measure the good deeds (like helping people, offering alms etc) and bad deeds (stealing, killing innocents etc) and depending on your honour in game you'll be able to unlock various outfits, interesting encounters and even missions. SIDE MISSIONS, ACTIVITIES AND EXPLORATIONThere are a plethora of things to engage yourself with in this world. The best part about Red Dead Redemption 2 is the unforced exploration. The map is full of unmarked locations and Easter eggs that the players are free to explore at their own pace and it is rewarding especially the treasure hunts. Secondly, the side missions in game are so good. They are funny, well written and feature a wide range of diverse and memorable characters. However some side missions revolve around collectables and I am pretty sure those wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea. Apart from those few tedious collectables all the side missions are genuinely good and all worth doing and there are quite a few of them. Lastly the random encounters in the game are equally brilliant and they are so varied and satisfying. For instance I helped a guy by giving him medicine who was dying in the forest after being bitten by a snake and later I met the same guy calling me out in a town and talking to his friend about how I helped him. As for reward, I got to buy a gun from the gunsmith for free. Very rewarding indeed! There are so many different types of these encounters scattered throughout the world and each and every one of them is rewarding in its own way. There are also theatre shows that you can watch and I was literally spellbound by the sheer quality of what I got to see. It is mind boggling to see the amount of effort that has gone into making this game. There are also mini games like Blackjack, Poker, Dominoes etc to partake in.HUNTINGNow Hunting in this game is entirely optional but it is actually a full fledged side activity in itself that requires patience but it is extremely rewarding and satisfying. There are 178 different species of animals and birds in this game and a large number of them resides in their own natural habitat. Not only is hunting required to amass food for yourself but also providing the same to the gang. It is also required to craft satchels, outfits and even some of the aesthetic camp upgrades. The subtlety of hunting different species of animals with different weapons and ammo gives it a somewhat realistic touch. There are a large number of legendary animals to hunt too and each provides a unique perk after successfully hunting one. Same goes for fishing too.CONCLUSIONI'd like to point out some things that has actually hindered my overall experience. The performance and optimization of the game is not good. Although there are many options to tinker with in the graphics settings, overall it just is a sub-par port in my opinion. Secondly the Rockstar launcher is a bad piece of software. Now I personally crashed only once to desktop while playing in my 200 plus hours of gameplay but the most annoying thing I have encountered is the bug where the game would crash right between the transition from loading screen to loading into the open world. Rockstar's official solution to that problem didn't work for me. However fortunately I did manage to work my way around it. Moreover connection issue kept bugging me too. It all stems from that travesty of a launcher. This is completely unacceptable for a AAA game. All the criticism and flak that the PC port has received are completely valid. Despite all that this is a game that I thoroughly enjoyed every minute that I was able to play and it was a journey that will forever be etched in my memory. I recommend it to everyone to try it out and see if it works for them."

The hero of the story, Arthur, meets his mate John in the midst of a crashing world rife with decadence. The two friends get along with each other like two brothers. With the rest of the gang, they must escape from pursuit. Here the story begins and events accelerate rapidly.Can Arthur keep pace with the pace of events amid storms of adversity? This is what you see in the story.The story begins in 1889 and ends in 1908, and during these years you see many changes in the world around you.Fate decided to make the gang members meet with individuals who join them while they are being chased by the authorities. Each member of the gang has a special skill and each individual has a story that has both positive and negative sides. The story gives you a lesson on how to deal with those around you and not to be naive by being a fast judging on people around you. Appearances can be deceptiveArthur is an example of a hero who is loyal to his friends with all what he has.  John is an example of a loyal person who keeps his promises. The world of red dead redemption is a diverse world based on a fictional simulation of the United States during the decline of the Wild West era. You have 5 fictional states based on real life states of the Midwest   southern and west coast parts of the United States. In harmony with this diversity of landscapes, the fauna and the ecological life of the world around you varies from one state to another. As well as the customs and habits of people vary in each state. Simply the game gives you the impression that you are living in that period. When you travel north, you need heavy clothes while in the south you need light clothes and so on. In summary It's a game that leaves its mark on your life.

186,🥀cyb̾eяgơȶhiкa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cybergothika/,227,2,1,90.8,May,"24,",204,30,1,"I think this game deserves a rightful deep insight because after being overloaded by it. The importance of it nowadays, the example it sets for gaming and why I believe you should reserve this game a special place.I can see how one influences another, but the story mode isn't harmed so Online can exist, you’re not going to be harassed by any micro transactions while on singleplayer. The Online is just a choice by definition, you even have the option to turn off friend’s invites. There will be no propaganda of other games in the menu either, like Ubisoft and Capcom usually do. There is no immersion breaking items demanding you to pretend they aren't there.I was afraid of buying this because I was skeptical that a game could be better than RDR1 with John Marston. I also avoided it due the highly inflated price in my country (bolsonaro vai tomar no cú). I had a sellout discount then it was my best chance. This game is a perfected RDR1 if such witchery is even possible.If you’re not an immersive gamer, you’ll learn to be. There are a lot of gameplay mechanics to suit every gamer but they’re so intuitive and sophisticated, it tends to incentivize you to adjust to it, this is a survival hybrid game. You can be the good-bad guy (the canon R* expects from you), be a chill Boomhauer or just be the bad-bad guy. Sneak, bomb, kill, hunt, whatever you wish or if chaos suits you, even the smallest of things got a lot to show as you have probably heard already. When it comes to feelings however, assuming you were convinced to accept the story's pace, you'll have time to feel incredible moments and to see beautiful places, especially with decent graphics. Not everything will depend on it though, only a few games can break the boundary between here and “there” merely by some flow. Many tribes consider wolves to be related to humans, because of the wolf’s dedication to its pack. Loneliness can trigger immersion, sometimes it is the world or the time period, sometimes it's everything combined. RDR2 story mode has all that, but it also adds bounding. A gang can trigger unique immersion, until the point of feeling at home, then you know the writer was inspired, voice and body actors were on fire and the development team resonated. As important as “your people” are, so must be “your foe”, giving reasons and further tightening that bounding. Comradery is also in many other games like Mass Effect, Republic Commando, FC Primal, even Lost and Damned and Cyberpunk nomads living in my soul. But it is definitely the first time I feel it in my blood.If you wish to get high with such sweet endorphins, you can start by dealing with what you don't believe. Like killing, brawling or robbing imprudently (you will do that a lot) or fall to redemption. Of course I despise gangsters but I can see why they can't fit in. So, it is easy to find spatial immersion, but easy to get it busted too. Someone may storm your room, maybe your neighbor is a noisy ass messing with your focus or perhaps your cat is very sick today. Until they’re gone or if you go fix them, and of course, you must pay attention to the story 😂 If you think immersion is for crazies, here’s what  once said about the importance of suspension of disbelief;If you think Tolkien was crazy at least you’d respect him more than you respect me.Now while that mode preserves some of it, surely isn't the same direction. It jeopardizes most of the immersion, starting by the ""Online"" title. You can fully customize a character but he/she lacks voice, like GTAO because of cutscenes with other players, thus it has no substance (still got some story progression) but things are less dense. In order to maintain the sync, some open-world details and features were removed. It lacks new content, it has microtransaction for gold ingots, unpredictable players are annoying and messes with hunting, because chaos rules. Overral; It is a different driving force that requires a mood I don't always have.I like to criticize and I finally managed to nitpick irrelevant things no one gives a xith about, but may be visible to vagabonds, so here I come;Please, If you like my content, would you Devs of the world; shouldn’t you start doing it like R* does? Quit with all the singleplayer manipulation for the love of god. It is your job to avoid breaking it, not mine to accept or pretend. This game just proves it right."
187,Mr.Ora[N]ge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mr_orange13/,277,8,1,138.2,December,"28,","1,241",20,1,"is by far the best game of all time. It's one of the biggest, most elaborate, most impressive games ever made. It's hard not to agree that this is a masterpiece in the gaming industry (but not for everyone, obviously).The story of the protagonist at the beginning seems simple enough. A bad man, in a gang that is engaged in robberies, sometimes murders. The player can line up Arthur in a slightly different way. You can become a better person, do good deeds and get on the right path. In the middle of the game, Arthur learns about the disease, which will make him repent of what he is doing and why he is doing it. The plot is told slowly, but it is exciting, interesting, thoughtful. I want to go through each mission, watch cutscenes and see what will happen next with the main character and his gang. After all, the gang is also changing and not for the best (but see for yourself).Additional tasks are inferior to the plot in interestingness, some tasks act as teaching something. For example, how to rob a cart, to whom to drive it to get a reward. There are many short tasks, funny and even scary. Some of the quests are connected with the heroes from Dutch's gang.You can once again take a break from the storyline or learn something new and interesting. Almost all tasks are quite simple, so why not go through them.Next, we will talk about gaming activities and the liveliness of the world.There are a lot of them in the game, you will hardly find a more filled world than in Red Dead Redemption 2.Random encounters happen everywhere, whether to help people depends only on you.Unexpected attacks of hostile gangs on you, of which there are only 6 in the game, and all over the world you can meet people from different gangs or their camps.Many small tasks, random encounters, as well as the opportunity to explore the world- Cigarette cards of which there are more than a hundred in the game and each card belongs to a separate collection, they can be collected and sold to a collector.- Dinosaur bones, there are 30 bones in the game, after you collect all, an additional quest will open.- Hunting and fishing, a total of 14 legendary fish and 16 legendary animals that require bait to catch- Dreamcatchers, 20 locations in total. They are one of the types of collectibles that hang from trees.- Treasure maps, caches, cave paintings, board games and much more you can find just by exploring the world.Whether you do this or not is up to you.The gameplay is very meditative, slow, but at the same time exciting and quite interesting. The game has excellent movement on a horse around the big world, excellent battles with enemy gangs, there is a hunting and fishing system, a resource management system.The game has a gorgeous picture, there is no doubt about it.I really liked the play of the rays of the sun. Well done change of weather, time of day.Rain / thunderstorm is generally a separate topic for admiration.In a word, not a game, but a real paradise for those who like to take beautiful screenshots.The music score also fits in very well with the game.One can feel the attention to every little thing, in the same collection of herbs, bottles, cans, opening cabinets, doors, and so on. Even the process of collecting trophies from opponents.Of course, the speed of collecting items suffered from this, and for many, I think, for the entire time of the game, all this will have time to get bored with order. Moreover, the animations of all this are the sameThe horse riding is also excellent (as is the care of the filly). It's so good that I've never used fast travel during my entire playthrough.What for? - if there is so much to see around. And in general, it allowed me to fully feel the atmosphere of the game :)This is one of the best story games. If you want to get a great story for 80+ hours and delve into the world of the Wild West, you should definitely try this game if you haven't already. The game has a lot of cool activities, various secrets, very serious detailing and elaboration of small details that no one ever thinks about, but they are in the game. I want to erase my memory in order to go through this game again and get a lot of fun and enjoyment. I definitely recommend at least trying this game, even if it's not your genre."

I'm sure those people are legitimately having issues, but those issues do not affect everyone.Red Dead Redemption 2 was already practically my favorite game after playing it on PS4 and being blown away by the story, gameplay, and amazing environment in which it takes place. Leading up to the release on Steam I was little worried after hearing about some of the issues with the PC launch, but I'm very happy that I have had zero issues with the game now that my wife bought it for me as an early Christmas gift. No launcher issues, no crashing, and it runs beautifully.FRAME RATE TIP: Turning down graphics settings related to water makes a huge difference. I was only getting about 35 FPS near the river in the first area of the game. I turned water physics down to the second highest notch and gained 20+ frames per second. Now about 5 hours in and the frame rate has remained at a smooth 55-60 FPS at minimum (quite a bit more in some scenes), with everything set to ultra aside from turning water physics down one notch.As long as you're not one of the unfortunate souls with launcher issues and crashing, you're in for one of the most amazing video game experiences of this generation."

The open world is stunning and inviting, the story is captivating and addictive, the characters are lovable and interesting, and the combat is satisfying and entrancing. Sure, the controls and some of the missions aren’t perfect, but the game’s positives far outweigh the negatives. This is one of those games that are genuinely worth their high Triple A price tag, so if you’re in the market for a long game that you can sink hours and hours into with an amazing story, then look no further than Red Dead Redemption 2."

It's criminal that this game is overshadowed by God of War in 2018 for the GOTY award, but that doesn't matter. Red Dead Redemption 2 is unbeatable in every aspect, so much so, it feels like they developed the game in 2030 and sent it back to 2018 to please us.Its technicality, the graphics, the main story, the side missions, the random events, the characters, the voice acting, the world, the animals, the guns, the sound design and nearly the whole game are so so so top notch, only another Rockstar game can surpass this level of quality. I always thought The Witcher 3 is the best game in terms of storytelling and side missions, but I think I will have a very very hard time to like any other open world game after Red Dead Redemption 2.This game is so amazingly good that it will make most of the other games as it's been developed by kindergarten students for a very long time.

The single player story is well developed, with excellent character development and an interesting storyline. The world is beautiful and the gameplay is immersive. There is much to do and you infrequently become bored while playing the story mode.Red Dead Redemption online (a RDR version of GTA Online) lacks substance and is a clear cash-grab by Rockstar. The developers make money when players purchase ""Gold Bars""- purchasing in game currency with real money (AKA Microtransactions or ""Pay-to-win""). With this is mind, the developers have modified the game to make it difficult to earn money, while raising the prices of items and upgrades available to the player.  Many of the ""money-making"" activities that make single player so exciting (robbing trains, banks, stagecoaches, etc) have been removed from the online version. The value of items gained through hunting/fishing have been /repeatedly/ reduced, making these activities less profitable.  NPCs drop very small amounts of cash, and rarely drop sell-able loot. The prices of weapons and horses have increased significantly from the levels in the Story mode. If you would like to hunt bounties to earn money (like in singleplayer), you need to buy ""Gold Bars"" and purchase a ""Bounty Hunting License"". Much of the content is locked behind DLC and in-game currency purchases. These modifications are a thinly-veiled attempt to increase the earnings of the developers, at the expense of a game with great potential. RECOMMENDATION: Buy RDR2 on sale and enjoy the excellent singleplayer side, avoid it if you are primarily looking for an online experience."

215,Solaire Bro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/constantdiversion/,117,5,1,68.7,November,"21,",349,5,1,"The video games I’ve always been the most interested in are the ones that cared the most about their narrative. From classic SNES RPGs to Red Dead Redemption II, it’s always been the most reliable separator from the pack, despite perceived mechanical shortcomings. Ignoring recent trends across the industry most-assuredly disagreeing with my supposition, RDR II is a bolded example of a game making the story the priority.    This is, of course, not to say that there haven’t been examples of recent games caring about their narrative (Metro: Exodus, Cyberpunk 2077), it’s just to say that an additional emphasis this generation has been more about creating imaginative ways of squeezing as much money out of the game and player as to make the company's time and financial investment worthwhile. And I’m not suggesting that RDR II’s creators weren’t concerned about their bottom line, but considering the financial success of another Rockstar IP you might have heard about; I think it’s fair to say they were allowed to create the game they wanted to make.  And what they made was Read Dead Redemption II.   RDR II is an odd Rockstar game in many ways. Even when comparing it to its predecessor. It’s less juvenile in its presentation, much more serious in its manner, mature in its execution, and frankly much more melodramatic. The results of which end up manifesting themselves in the oddest ways. You end up with the best Rockstar game – but perhaps, not the most fun one.  And I don’t mean that negatively. Melodrama in RDRII, or otherwise, can be extraordinarily affective in storytelling. As a rule, if you care about the characters then the melodrama is working. The key is that the story itself remains consistent in its approach. There can’t be any camera winking, or horseplay, once the drama kicks in because it must stylistically hold you in place until it makes its point. It’s not what it’s about, it’s how it’s about it. But we’re jumping ahead a little bit here. RDR II is the sequel/prequel to Red Dead Redemption that genuinely serves as both. The chronology places it before the events of RDR, but the game’s tradition of “redemption” center around a new protagonist named Arthur Morgan. In the absence of retracing story beats from a game over a decade old, this story is about the gang we heard so much about in the progenitor. Meaning that plenty of familiar faces return, and the game’s creators do an excellent job of manipulating the player’s own sense of nostalgia against themselves.  This does make playing the original more necessary, because the story makes the chronologies’ roots grow in importance. Provided the player is willing to lower their guard and allow for the immersion to suck them in. And they will be sucked in. RDR II’s narrative doubles down on the series’ thesis about the death and rebirth of America the was previously made in the original. The only difference is that RDR was about lingering after the rebirth. RDR II is about standing face-to-face with its death.   Like most of Rockstar’s IPs, RDR II is a third-person open world shooter complete with all the trimmings we’ve come to expect from their titles. There is a mini-map embedded in the UI which sends the player to alternating quest hubs in order to receive story candy. This is classically delivered via violent shootouts or emotional character quiet time. But unlike most of Rockstar’s works, RDR II layers more customized nuance based upon player choice (albeit limited).    To increase immersion, Rockstar actually changed their formula. Very quickly the action genre begins to fade away, and you would be forgiven for mistaking RDR II for something more akin to a western-themed RPG. Player choice, while limited in its options that don't involve outfit and equipment shopping (because there’s like a million options there), is paramount here.  Do the new options of progression offer more variety? Mechanically, not a ton. Story-wise, perhaps more. The choices the player selects decide the accounting for how much more, or less, “redemption” Arthur requires.  Because RDR II allows the player to interact with everyone they meet, there will always be a positive or negative interaction left in Arthur’s wake. Additionally, there also exist binary choices manifested within the story that hold an even greater effect in its overall outcome. And this is extremely powerful in the game’s many sad moments. Arthur’s fear of perdition is what makes him vulnerable, and the story threads provided by an excellent mid-game twist can have a major impact on how the player plays the game.  That is how you make player choice meaningful. It’s no longer enough to simply have it exist.   Rockstar understands its genre wholly. Westerns are very rarely ever about the setting.  Instead, they almost universally break down into two main categories: 1) The celebration of the American cowboy archetype mythos. 2) The complete deconstruction of that same archetype.  RDR II manages both.  The first half of the game has you playing poker hands, robbing trains, and having gun fights. The second half is about giving up control, making amends, and the expectation of damnation. This isn’t to say the second half ceases being a game, there’s still plenty of bombast and third-person action. But once the bullets stop flying the game is always there to subtly remind you, the player, that hell awaits our protagonist. This moves center stage around the midway point because the game productively begins leveraging Arthur's life choices against his life’s regrets, invoking an earnest sense of empathy from the player because they’re essentially being indicted too. Because the person holding the controller is the one making his choices.    Every choice the player makes paints the world in effective shades of gray because there’s no black and white way of looking at the situations the game displays. There are just too many characters, too many different play styles (via weapons or internal mission choices) the player might utilize for a one-size-fits-all representation of RDR II. Mileage varies. It feels good to shoot people that deserve it, sure, but the body count begins to feel like a liability when events in the narrative cause our protagonist's life to fall apart. This is an excellent western. And an excellent video game.  In RDR II, Arthur’s “redemption” is evasive. Too high a mountain to climb. For the player, it’s whatever they want it to be - hell or heaven, wickedness or kindness, redemption or perdition.  The game suggests that it’s never too late to change. But, indeed, Rockstar did change. Because what you’re left with at the end of Arthur’s journey is one of the finer video game story arcs in recent years.  At one point during a mission Arthur says, “We’re thieves in a world that don’t want us no more.”  How wrong you were Arthur Morgan. How wrong you were."

You know, I'm not surprised to hear that Dan Houser (a major contributor) quit the company after making this game, it is such a ‘drop the mic’ moment as far as I'm concerned. As RDR 2 represents the pinnacle of open world game design up to this point. I love this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game!, RDR 2 is gorgeous, intricate, well designed and just plain ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome in so many ways. It’s pretty cool when mainstream resources come together with talented game designers (who actually give a ♥♥♥♥ about quality). Rockstar games have been the coolest game making company for a long time now, like since the 1990’s even.

But the story just might be the greatest thing Rockstar has put on the table. The fact that this game didn't win GOTY in 2018 shows how overlooked this game is.

The realization that something this good will probably never come your way for a long time, is both beautiful and terrifying at the same time. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent example in the medium of video games. It's basically a 40-hour long western cinematic experience that puts almost every other AAA title to shame because of how unbelievably brilliant it is. That being said, this game isn't really meant for players who just want to have fun and don't care about how the story goes. If you're one of those players, then I'd advise against buying this game, because in my opinion, although the side activities and various other missions are extremely well done, you're eventually going to get bored. However, if you're like me and you love excellent stories that take their time to develop, building up to a satisfying payoff, then Red Dead Redemption 2, is beyond a doubt, one of, if not the greatest video games to ever exist.For a game released in 2018, RDR2 raises the bar quite high in terms of graphical excellence and fidelity. Everything (literally) in the game is hyper-detailed and realistic to such an extent that many other games seem unpolished after playing this one. Even some AAA games three years after RDR2 seem lacking in detail some way or the other. The weather patterns, environments, animals, people, buildings and objects are incredibly detailed and when combined together, create a world that's just stunning. Coupled with the (once again) highly detailed and impressive animations for each and everything, starting from the way trees move all the way to the muscles around a horse's nose and ears, it all seems so immersive it makes you forget you're playing a video game on your computer. Additionally, the lighting engine is just magnificent. The full resolution ambient occlusion around people's faces and the way light sources react around the world is frighteningly realistic. There's no texture popping or weird glitches whatsoever in the graphics department, and it raises your immersion levels by several notches. This game is truly the definition of “next-gen” for its time of release.However, it's worth knowing that RDR2 is a demanding game and the graphics optimization may or may not please you, depending on the hardware you have and the settings you play in. I played it on high settings (PC specs at the end of this review) and averaged around 30 frames per second, which is good enough for a breathtaking cinematic experience like this.RDR2's gameplay is vast and diverse, the majority of which involves you riding horses and shooting people. There’s an almost overwhelming amount of stuff that you can do in this game apart from the above. For instance, you can hunt animals, play poker, get drunk, buy new clothes, get a haircut, buy food and drink, make potions and tonics, craft arrows and bullets of various types, rob coaches and trains, help strangers, and so much more. The huge open world is something that explorers are going to enjoy quite a lot, with no pointless or nonsensical side missions. It’s just at the verge of being “too much”; however, grinding for money and exploring much isn’t necessary, as the story missions provide you with just enough materials to progress. In short, you can choose whether to enjoy only the story or go full-on role-playing whenever you want, and the game doesn’t restrict you in any way. The controls and animations feel weighty and realistic. This game is obviously better suited for a gamepad, but the PC controls are just about right, and I have nothing to complain about. Although there’s no permanent fast-travel system, which can be tedious at times, while riding your horse from one end of the map to another, it’s no big deal, because the atmosphere and amazing graphics make up for it. The variety and immersion in RDR2's gameplay is straight-up superb.RDR2's story can be summed up as one of those awesome one-time experiences that you have in life. One that becomes a fond memory, with the disappointing assumption that you'll never get to experience something like this for the first time ever again. It's a long story consisting of six chapters and two epilogues but doesn't get boring (it never did for me). It takes its time to let you slowly know your people and get attached to them, and it does that through the use of dialogue, writing and cinematography so astronomically excellent for a video game that it hardly gets your eyes off-screen. Many people regard RDR2's story as a ""slow burn"", but in my opinion, it's that particular demographic which expects some sort of dramatic excellence in a story, and it isn't their fault. This game won't necessarily blow your mind with twists and turns, nor will it necessarily leave you emotionally traumatized (like the intro to The Last of Us); but rather, it will tell a tale about the outlaws who come to terms with their lives and deeds, as modern civilization begins to flourish. It's a story about redemption (duh), and by the end of it, you'll feel like you've completed a journey like never before. RDR2 is one of the best examples in a video game where the emotions you feel in game are strangely similar to how you'd actually feel in real life. It's not too dramatic or overwhelming, it's just perfect. It glues you to your screen, not because of a gripping, edge-of-your-seat story, but with  Yes, you read that right. Hats off to the writers for crafting so many brilliant characters. Arthur Morgan is, without a doubt, one of the greatest video game protagonists ever. The way he's voice-acted, presented and developed throughout the story is nothing short of sheer excellence. And this goes to literally every other character in the game as well (I'm not kidding. Every character is pure excellence.), but for the sake of this review, I'm going to keep it short. RDR2's story might just the best video game story to have ever been crafted and executed this well in the medium. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and although it's not meant to be enjoyed by everyone, it does what it has to do, and easily destroys every competition there is.Overall, RDR2 is definitely, without hesitation, the greatest game of 2018, and maybe even the last generation. It has one the best executed stories in gaming history, brilliant characters, rich and diverse open-world gameplay, unbelievably good dialogue, and insane, realistic graphics. I mean, what more could a game need? Go play it. It’s a masterpiece.Processor: Intel Core i7-9750HRAM: 16 GB dual channel DDR4Graphics: Nvidia RTX 2060 Mobile (90W)"

While the plot does drag a bit around chapter 5, and some of the late-game sideplots could be cut in my opinion, I was still moved and in love with Arthur Morgan's story, as well as how his story meshed well into that of John Marston. The acting and the writing were all exemplary, the kind of quality I would expect out of a big-budget production like a movie.The gameplay can be hit or miss, as the missions all have a very uniform structure and are the exact opposite of guided by player choice, but that doesn't mean that there weren't plenty of fast-paced, exciting ones to he experienced.

Another known issue I encounter is a weird smudging effect with objects in the distance, and with hair/beards.

It's not as noticable on higher resolutions, but it's still something that should be addressed.While the game is now ""serviceable"", it still runs like ♥♥♥♥ for a lot of others, even after several patches with R* insisting the game is fixed.Is this really the acceptable standard for AAA titles on PC? Surely not.To add insult to injury, a week after it released on Steam, the game is now on sale @ -20% for the standard edition & -25% for the Special and Ultimate editions.Apparently this is how R* treats the Steam user base. If it wasn't for the fact I'm over the 2hr mark, I'd consider getting a refund, and waiting for some optimisation and a more appropriate price tag.Like I said, it's a great game, but I would hold off until they resolve the current issues, and perhaps wait for a big sale."

So here it goes...Red Dead Redemption 2 is personally for me one of the greatest games I have ever played. The level of graphics, attention to detail, richness of the vast open world makes it a truly unique playing experience.On highest details the game looks a lot like the real world. With your headphones on you can hear the nature around you, when you hunt or when you just pass by on your mission.You can profile yourself as the good gangster with heart or the bad gangster without mercy. Or also something inbetween, depending on the choices you make.Prepare to travel the world of wild wild west and participate in a wide variety of rich quests that fit in really well. From robbing and killing to helping and hunting, the choice is yours.More detailed review laters :)"

Rockstar told me to rename my settings folder to whatever I wanted under documents files and reverify the integrity of the files through the Steam launcher. It did not work, they told me to reinstall the game and not change the graphics settings, even though they were lower graphical settings and it would not start to begin with.

Pun intended!Rarely do I buy games  but this was the case, and the name of the accident was Summer Sale. I’m scared of long games. All three  bought but still untouched, shame on me as a Pole I know. Somehow I decided to give this one a go, and I was hooked immediately.What I love about RDR2, and why for me it’s been a gaming experience like no other?First, the vastness of the world. When you gallop on your horse hearing all the ambient sounds and watching various animals running around, you really feel like you are actually there. The care for detail is almost unnatural, and all is designed in a way that lets you experience that world without loading screens. You’re just there. Someone wrote that it’s , and I think they were on point.All missions, from main ones to random encounters with strangers mix together perfectly and play well into the overall story arc. You can always  just to go hunting or fishing. Everything’s there, from bears to the smallest fish in the pond. Same variety can be observed in main missions – from stealth action to robbing a bank or a train on the move.Gang’s camp is very lively thanks to your everyday chores and duties there, the characters (including yours), their stories, voice acting (those accents!). Also because of what goes around every time you come back after one or more days on the road when you were spending nights in the wilderness. Several hours in and you start to feel like the camp is your home and your family.The dynamic weather and day/night cycle work great no matter where you decide to spend the night. The  is yet another nice touch. It’s based on your character’s behaviour which influences the overall gameplay – dialogues, product prices, number of available outfits or even the amount of loot you find on corpses. The story is in sync with what kind of Arthur  decide to become. I’ve read that the ending you’ll deserve will be just as synced, although I don’t know yet if that’s true. Redemption, anyone?This game is also a great compendium of animals and plants. For me, a non-native English speaker, also a fantastic way to learn cowboy English – , , , , , ,  – these are just a few examples of the many new words I learnt.There are several flaws but they can be lived with. Clunky controls. My horse switching from female to male and losing its name on a regular basis. The abundance of what can be done in this game sometimes plays to its disadvantage – in-game tutorials presented briefly simply won’t do. You’re better off watching some clips and reading tips and tricks on the web just to be sure you’re getting as much from this product as you’d really want.And, of course, this is a long game. For some this can be a negative as well. I strongly recommend not to  to the finale as you’ll be missing a lot, but it’s your choice here, and the availability of such choice to make is yet another good thing.It’s a masterpiece. Go buy right now. I ain’t working for Rockstar but surely love me some RDR2. 10/10"

Now, you might ask, ""Well why didn't you tell Rockstar?"" Well apparently you can't submit tickets for suspension or banning, their staff saying the decisions are final. The modder who did it also happened to blow me up, interrupt missions I was in and kill all the NPC's around me, and a plethora of other issues.Ever been surrounded by like six people and then get teleported while they all watch you? Well it's all the more infuriating when the person who teleports you starts yelling in Korean, and then laughs. It's even more irritating when Rockstar still hasn't patched the nonsense where people can make themselves look like other people, and change their display name in a server where you can't report them.I get caught in the crossfire, and some idiocy happens. Rockstar doesn't care. I got blammed for getting cougars spawned at me, and then I'm the bad guy cause I managed to kill them despite the hacker constantly hitting me. Hell, at one point I just ran to Blackwater, started blasting the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and then selling the pelts. Before anyone decides to tell me, ""Well you were cheating then!"" have you ever had dozens of cougars try and rip you apart, and then have to kill your way through them all?

FOR BEGINNERS: Long press start will bring up the map skipping the menu. Also first person mode is very immerse please try! Take care of your horse, make sure to have horse revival or two!Story: (9.5/10) The story telling in this game is near perfect. World: (9/10) The open world in this game was again one of the best I’ve had the pleasure of exploring. So much detail on such a big map. Flowing rivers with dynamic weather. It’s hard not to feel like you’re actually there. The big disappointment here is that the enemy/animal spawns are ♥♥♥♥. There are almost no predators and the ones that do exist always spawn in the exact same spot. I have over 20 hours in the game and I’ve only seen 1 brown bear outside of a scripted event. Same can be said about enemy spawns. The camps are always in the same spot, and outside of scripted events you are safe to explore everywhere else.Gameplay/Mechanics: (6/10) You can’t rob banks, and the bounty system is broken. There is no bullet drop, and the shooting feels like a lateral move (maybe even a step down) from the first game. Also there are no underwater or above ground components. Swimming is pretty standard in most other open world games, but I guess they felt that wasn’t necessary either. Most buildings are closed off. Makes sense in Saint-Denis, but even in the rest of the world only like 10% of buildings are accessible. It feels like a big tease. interface is tidies and looting is not pleasant nor feels rewarding.Immediately went on sale a week after launch. Slap in the face to initial adopters like me who got it on day one. Absolutely no respect for PC gamers. Overall I’ll give it a 8.5/10. Great, but left a lot to be desired. But... still the best way to kill time till Biomutant and Cyberpunk 2077 are out!P.S. There is a hidden setting in the system.xml file (my doc\rockstar\...) that everybody should adjust. Find deepsurfacequality and change it to ultra. This gets set to lower with these settings and causes the ground tracks,footprints, mud etc to render at very short draw distance. Changing this has no noticeable impact on fps but fixes the terrible draw distance"

It reaches level of immersion I never felt with any other game.This game made me so sad…  It’s heartbreaking. A tale of survival, family, loyalty and relentless brutality. Never in recent memory has a game impacted me so hard on an emotional level. The only two examples I can think of in which the loss of fictional characters affected me this much was when Dumbledore died in the HP books and when Sora and Kairi separate at the end of the original Kingdom Hearts game. I miss Arthur’s voice, his drawings, his interactions with the people of the camp… I hate and love this game and it’s characters. I don’t know what to make of it. This has genuinely been a beautifully epic and harrowing experience for me. It’s like… watching Breaking Bad or Braveheart for the first time, being filled with so much emotion.

I can't remember the last time i've gotten this much genuine enjoyment from a game before. First of all, i won't be talking about the online mode as i have yet to experience it firsthand but aside from that, the graphics are absolutely phenomenal in this game. The sound design truly makes me feel like i'm IN the game. You can hear birds chirping, flowing water, the creaks in floorboards. It's really something. Don't even get me started on the amazing story. Each character has their own unique personality that makes you grow attached to the character and make you feel like you're talking to an old friend or a relative. i showed genuine emotion throughout my playthrough with the amount of twists and turns that the story has. I won't spoil much of the story but just know that it is one of the best story modes i have played in a game. There is an abundance of content to play around with. Apart from the main story, there are many side activites you can do like fishing and hunting, playing poker in a bar, or doing side missions. I'm not usually fond of huge open world games but with Red Dead Redemption 2, i loved just hopping onto my horse and riding around for hours on end just taking in the beauty of the game. I loved exploring and finding hidden secrets like a chest full of gold hidden by a tree or a unique weapon in a cave.All in all, i absolutely enjoyed my experience with Red Dead Redemption 2.

A game in which the creators paid attention to even the smallest details, and I think you will agree with me that small details are actually the most important segment of any project.To really mention any mistake or bug in this game can be considered as a sin, because no matter what mistake or bug existed, if we put it on the scales with all the positive features, the weight of it will not even be noticed.I’m really thrilled with every segment of the game, and my favorite is hunting. So you can spend hours hunting different animals, learning new things about them and simply enjoying it.The scenery is simply enchanting and indescribable in words. Indeed, so far no game has thrilled me like this one.Although I am only in Chapter 3 I can say that the main story, characters, events and everything else are really really damn fascinating.I would write for hours but I know no one will read that much so I will stop here with the words: if I had to choose just one game to play it for the rest of my life, I would choose Red Dead Redemption 2."

It's one of the absolute best looking games ever to be released; its huge, varied world is rendered in an impressive, almost photo-real way. It's filled to the brim with life, from birds circling in the sky overhead to fish swimming in the river beneath your feet to strangers stuck by the side of the road. The open-world is probably the most detailed and lived-in I've ever experienced. It feels markedly real. That's a good thing, too, considering the amount of time you'll spend traversing it. Riding to and from your main objectives will often take longer than the missions themselves. The lack of comprehensive fast travel means you'll be doing this long after you've seen every beautiful location the map has to offer. Thankfully, then, no two journeys are ever the same. The amount of ways you can interact with the people you meet out in the world is amazing, and the small encounters you directly control are incredibly satisfying to play. They're possibly the best aspects of the game. That's because the main missions, which can often feel restrictive when compared to the free-roaming stuff, are as often utterly thrilling as they are frustratingly slow. The piece has a deliberate pace which unfortunately means that it takes a while to truly get going. However, it very much adds to the overall experience. It's supposed to be long, ebbing and flowing as its seasons and circumstances change. Its extended epilogue does take the wind out of the sails of its ending, but it's arguably vital in achieving the effect the finale is meant to have. Regardless of its issues, the narrative is straight-up phenomenal.It tells an at once personal and sweeping tale, crafting characters that seem so human you could swear they were real. Something that the piece does a phenomenal job with is the development of its side-characters. The people who don't get much play in the cut-scenes can be spoken to around camp, or even taken on small adventures, which is somehow enough for you to form almost as close a connection with them as you do with any other. When one of your companions inevitably dies, it's genuinely heartbreaking. That can be said of the overall thing, too. It's heartbreaking. Yet, it's also exciting, funny, hopeful, tragic, beautiful and, even, poignant. It strikes the perfect balance between sincere and satirical. It's generally more serious than its predecessor and, as such, it's more impactful. Most of the silliness is reserved for its entertaining side-missions, which suits them well. It's often genuinely affecting and it has a strong underlying theme that lives up to its title. The writing is just wonderful. It's consistently good across each and every character you meet. The morality system actually changes some small things about the story, too. For the best result, you should get all of your dastardly doings out of the way to begin with; the most fitting ending, thematically, is the 'high honour' one. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and varied, with satisfying shooting and surprisingly deep mini-games. The animation, which is superb, does sometimes get in the way, causing some slight chunkiness that can be cumbersome to begin with. However, this is easy to adjust to and it simply adds to the overall slower pace of the game. It's a measured affair, never as unrelentingly fast as some of its peers but nearly always more satisfying. In the end, this is an engaging, entertaining and affecting experience. It's a massive, thematically rich ride that stands out as one of the best games of all time.rest in peace Arthur."

If you want to play this game you have to use the social club launcher.  I have 2 different social club accounts. One works just fine, the other one doesn't. I lost the email for that account six years ago. But this is fine, right? You should just log in your social club account that works and start the game, right?WRONGYou don't even get to CHOOSE the account that gets linked to steam. I tried to start the game, and it just randomly chose the old account. The game just tells you it sent a verification email to an e-mail adress that doesn't work without giving you any choice or options at all. Think about that; I have a functioning steam account and a functioning social club account and I still can't start the bloody game. I logged in to the social club account to try and link it to steam. But the option isn't even there. You can link your account to  Xbox live, playstation network, games for windows live, twitter, twitch and even facebook. But steam isn't there? why the ♥♥♥♥ is steam not there?How a triple a developer managed to pull that off is just mind-blowing to me.  Can't recommend until Rockstar gets their ♥♥♥♥ together. Will be getting a refund"

The views are incredible, pretty waterfalls, great landscapes & I enjoy the variety of weathers. Even the ambience is good. My favourite map parts are Ambarino, West Elizabeth & New Hanover. ✅ Quests were fun, easy to follow and I did every single one! I enjoyed both the story and the online tremendously. I did not *connect* with the characters much, but I really liked some of the side quests characters. The story was really fun to play regardless. The online has fun events too, the photography one where you run around & take pictures of animals is my favourite (and I win a lot!) 🐴 The multiple horse breeds in this game is definitely a huge plus from me, horse girls will definitely love this game! You can ride, pet, brush, lead & feed them! Simply riding the horse throughout the map is fun for me, I hardly ever use the fast travel option. A great plus too is you can PET the dogs!😀 The fighting is fun, there are multiple guns & I really enjoyed the Dead Eye which slows down time in the story mode. It highlights herbs, collectables & animals which is really useful too. I like how you can fool around in the map by lassoing your friends in the online or innocent passerby's in the story mode. There's a lot of nice details in this game like picking up herbs & selling them to a doctor, going to a photography booth, play poker, or get drunk in The Saloon etc. The online is a lot of fun to mess around with some friends, 🎣 Hunting & fishing in this game are really fun, and the hunting wagon in the online is super helpful! I loved finding all the legendary fishes & animals, as well as just regular hunting. If you do not like hunting, you can now also sedate them in the online and bring a sample to Harriet. There are also online events where you can either protect legendary animals, kill poachers, or hunt animals.I'm probably forgetting something, but I simply can not recommend this game enough! Absolutely amazing 12/10 💖(The only bad thing about it however is in the online there are some people who will ruin the experience by blowing you up or something similar in the online. I would also like to be able to pick a specific spot to place my camp in the online, instead of it being randomised)"

285,Luriam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Luriam/,860,66,1,705.8,December,"22,",248,72,1,"I wholeheartedly recommend Red Dead Redemption 2, and here's why.It is a mature, story driven, open world game. And it touches on some profound subjects like loyalty, sacrifice, loss and redemption. And as such, you have to respect the pacing and the time necessary for character and story development. Things take time, and good things take even longer. But in the end it will all be worth it.If you expect this game to behave like a battle royale, guns blazing, non-stop action clownfiesta - you'll be sorely disappointed. This game is the complete opposite of that. It's about character growth, meaningful choices and living with the consequences. Not gonna lie, a combination of all the things I'm about to mention, mixed with personal feelings made me tear up at a certain point in the game. And that's the magic that inspired me to write this review. The prologue serves as a short introductory tutorial, which in turn also shows off some of the game's innovative technology. Gorgeous graphics, volumetric lighting, polished animations, incredible weather effects and biomes, all of that wrapped nicely in a very well crafted soundtrack suite.I was lucky enough to be able to run the game on a combination of Ultra and High settings. And it is ridiculously beautiful. And I'm not talking only about the textures and shadows. But also how the world itself looks and works. All the big things like three dimensional looking clouds, vast gaping canyons, perilous mountains and treacherous swamps. And all the small details like different tracks and imprints in the snow, a million different animations for skinning animals, collecting plants or interacting with your horse. Clothes getting dirty, dusty, snowy, muddy or bloody depending on where you are and what you're doing.I've never seen a game have this many animations for literally everything in the game. Every little action has it's own animation, mesh and sound. Even after 150 hours played I am still amazed by how detailed everything is. The game's story immediately gripped me and also gave me a lot to think about. It's not every day that you play as an experienced outlaw cowboy, that's also a part of a very homely gang of criminals. The writing is on point, the characters are all interesting and have a role to play. And you will find yourself inevitably caring for these crooks and felons. All the cutscenes are masterfully executed with a touch of Hollywood type of production. Lots of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. I also found myself comparing Red Dead to The Sopranos a little bit. As in there's some similarities when it comes to personality clashes, dialogues, escalations, conflicts and that shocking realization that no one is safe. And even major characters can be killed off at any moment, especially when you least expect it. I really liked that, and I enjoyed that feeling of unpredictability.My favorite feature by far is the ability to make choices. And choices always have repercussions. Some sooner, and some later, but they always do. And I love that. I love that I can choose what kind of man my protagonist is gonna turn into. Most missions will offer you a choice one way or the other. And these choices will define your character's personality and alignment, mission outcome, and even the game's very ending.I honestly didn't expect the game's music to be this pleasant and memorable. Rockstar games always end up having a good, solid score. But I never actually wanted to listen to it outside of the game. Until Red Dead. Because this game not only has this very charming fusion of western and ambient music. But also a unique soundtrack that has been specifically written and composed for different moments in the game. Very impressive and I admit that I must have listened to  on repeat at least 50 times. The world feels alive and lush with sounds. This game makes watching your character light up and smoke a cigarette look entertaining. And it's in no small part due to the amazing audio design. Animals and forests, cities and towns, high octane firefights and relaxing nights in your camp. They're all so immersive and well put together. The little comfy parties that sometimes occur, have in-game characters actually sing and perform all kinds of folk songs. That's lip sync, face and body motion, as well as actually singing and jesting. That detail alone had me in awe of the game's excellent cast. Some characters sing well, some sing poorly, but when put together it all sounds so real, so lifelike. You could swear that the developers just put all the voice actors in one room and told them to improvise and interact with each other. So many lines of dialogue, so much variation, so much talent. Even the characters that you despise, you kind almost like because of how real they seem.I played a good 40 hours of Red Dead Online and I have to say I love it. You have a decent character creator, tons of customization options later on and a morality system. The interactions you have with the world and other players are extremely fun all around. Hell just beating your friends to a pulp and running away from wild wolves together is an experience I recommend to everyone. Oh and the Online's even got it's own brand new story mode. A bunch of really fun and varied missions, which can be all be fully played in co-op! But that's not even close to all there is to do. As you progress through Online, you'll gain the ability to unlock new roles. Such as Trader, Bounty Hunter, Collector or (new) Moonshiner. These roles not only grant access to new missions and ways of making money. But also unlock exclusive rewards, perks and items that can only be gained from advancing these roles.There are also many different NPCs scattered around the game world. You can talk to them and accept all manner of missions. Some of them are good, law abiding people. And some are outcasts and outlaws looking for accomplices. In addition to all of that, there are also different PvP game modes such as: racing, team battles, deathmatches and many others. You can also hunt and fish together, or murder and rob everyone. There's really no boring activity in this game. And unlike GTA5O it has no stupid flying rocket bikes who spawn camp you the moment you leave a shop.My favorite thing about RDO is how there's so much new content that's not available in single-player. New animations, models, activities and items. All the cool cutscenes where you can see yourself and your friends. There's even choices to be made at the end of some story quests. I was very pleasantly surprised by just how fun it is to play it."
286,CARTMAN_021p,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CARTMAN_021p/,59,2,1,209.4,August,"8,",679,0,1,"R* has made another masterpiece in this game. A true cult-classic piece and pure work of art by passionated & talented developers. Such a fantastic western adventure to be apart of, with a very big & detailed gameworld with many missions to complete with a well written story to remember, with characters to love and hate. There is a extreme amount of thoughtful & well design content to explore and stumble upon out there in the dangerous wild. The big map & world is a very enjoyable place to be in. Breath, live and work as you explore more and more of the gigantic world you find treassures hidden around the world. So much magic is there for you to see & carefully watch with your eyes making ever-lasting memories. With several different counties & areas connecting the world you find smaller dirty western towns, a big fancy & technological city, deep swamps crawling with aligators, big hot dry deserts, big beautiful green fields, deep forests & high steep mountins with snow & cold hard weather to endure. Many more things hidden makes this an extraordinary experience out of the normal and delivers a perfect playground for you to be apart of. Fantastic to ride around with your horse just watching people living & working and see how they behave in their own special way where sometime special things happen to the inhibitants which affects them differently. About the control of the protagonist (Arthur Morgan) i think it is very well implemented and riding horses feels nice and responsive. Weapon handling feels good but could be better i believe. I finished it @ PlayStation 4 in 2018 and this time i'm on my 1st (2nd total) playthrough @ Steam. There is so much content & stuff to do in this work. I only play single player mode so i have not tested the online component. The port feels ok. It demands a pretty good gaming rig to max out the graphics which is stunning. So much details in the visuals. It's hard to maintain 60 fps but it doesn't bother me much. This is a MUST own in every library on Steam. One of the best games ever made. No question..!/// Score: 10 of 10                    ----(MASTERPiECE)----"

Literally, all your actions have a consequence and you'll see it sooner or later! when you help someone and they find you in another city and buy you sth, when you see the execution of an outlaw  you captured before, the amount of dialogues between NPCs, the realistic reactions of people due to the weather, time of day and such things just makes you feel like living in that world.This review wasn't about the RDR online tho, I just don't wanna talk about it!"

Whether it's the music, characters, story, game play or graphics, it is hard to find any flaws which is why it's arguably called a ""masterpiece"". Single-player story is approximately 60-hours if you skip most of the side missions. I rushed my play-through as I wanted to see how it all ended and was left depressed for a week (worth it though).Most of the negative reviews are regarding technical issues - the Rockstar social club, the game not launching or graphic stutters - or about online multiplayer which is not Rockstar's forte or the reason to buy this game. Albeit ported from a console for PC, I encountered no crashes. A little tweaking will be needed based on the specs you are running - I ran it on GTX 1060 - and encountered only a bit of performance issues which were fixed after tweaking the settings.Online multiplayer is pretty much like GTA V, the players are there but most are either toxic, inactive or non-existent. It wouldn't be advised to purchase this hoping for a worthwhile multiplayer experience.Salient features Until Rockstar comes up with another GTA or a sequel RDR2, this one will be my favorite.

It feels like a cowboy simulator but made by real devs and not in some dudes basement in the middle of Moscow. You have to eat, drink, bath, shave your beard if you like from time to time. you have to build a bond with your horse and also take care of it. But nothing is overdone to the point where it can feel tedious or annoying. The shooting in this game feels so good! You click to shoot and have to click again to pull the hammer back to prep the next shot. Now if I was someone who never played this game and heard that I would think that would suck but you really have to try it to understand what I’m talking about. I don’t know how to explain it other then that it feels so good and satisfying!---{PC Requirements} ---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☐ Fast☑ Rich boiiiiii☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computer- Not going to lie, this is a heavy game to run. I have a gtx 1070ti, intel i7-7700k, 16gb of ram and I can’t run it with everything on high-ultra. When I first got the game, I put everything to ultra-just to see how it would run and got 20 frames ☹. I then found a steam guide, which I believe is the current top-rated guide for the game that I used as a baseline (will link at bottom). With the exact same settings as guide I was able to get 60-70 frames, settings are like medium-high. Games already looked way better than it did from my ps4, plus having 60-70 frames just feels amazing (ps4 locked at 30 and would still dip under sometimes). I was able to change some settings after using guide as base, made some things ultra and raised other things and now get 60-65. Have only played for 3 hours with no drastic dips just yet 😉. ---{Story}---☐ Story?☐ Text or Audio floating around☐ Average☐ Good☐ Lovely☑ It‘ll replace your life-The main story itself is so much fun and interesting. It keeps you at the edge of your seat the whole way through! But you don’t only play this game for the main story (If you do, you’ll still get plenty of hours and it would be worth the $60, but you shouldn’t). The side mission are also so much fun! Each side mission seems to be unique and more fun than the previous! Not like other games where it seems like it’s just copy and paste of the same thing over and over (kill this, protect that, steal blank, follow blah) Each side mission feels like its own mini main story line, extremely well written and fun.  ---{Game Time} ---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyond-The main story itself is incredible with so much to do on the side. The world is full of side missions, encounters, challenges, animals to hunt, treasures to find, people to lasso, etc. etc. like I said earlier, I have over 200 hours on PlayStation, I completed the main story line and did a bunch (not all) side mission, and there is still a lot left to do!---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your moneySide notes- Some users are having problems with the Rockstar launcher. I have not had a single problem. I installed the game opened it, the Rockstar launcher opened up for a second and closed and game launched. I didn’t even have to log in to my Rockstar account.Link to graphic setting guide i used- Make sure you can RUN THE GAME before buying, as I said earlier this game is a heavy one.If you never played this game when it came out, you definitely should buy this and give it a try, I will be worth it! if it’s just not your thing refund before 2 hours XD, but I honestly think that wont happen. Rate~ 10/10 will pay 60 again. EDIT~~ I have not played online on pc or Playstation, So I really don't know what the difference is between single and online.

301,Skipper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceskipper1/,86,1,1,345.4,August,"22,",161,0,1,"Put simply, Red Dead Redemption 2 might well be *the* greatest game I have ever played. For a tl;dr, I recommend skipping to the end of this review.I very rarely purchase full-priced games. I tend to wait until games are on sale, and even then I hesitate if the game is £20 or more. Whilst at home for Christmas, I saw that RDR2 had been released on PC. I hadn't played the console version but had heard that the game was good, so decided to take a risk and purchased the game full priced. I don't regret it.To give some context, I don't usually like buying AAA single-player games with a heavy story-driven narrative. I like to play strategy games, I like to play sandbox or loose multiplayer games (like Mount & Blade) and I like to play open world games without being forced to complete the main quest. I have many hours on Skyrim over the years, for instance, but only very recently completed the main quest for the first time - I spent most of my time on that game just messing around in the open world. I didn't enjoy The Witcher 3 (quite a controversial opinion I know) because even that game failed to make me feel anything other than boredom during the story.And so, with this in mind, you might think that I rate RDR2 highly due to it's accessible open-world... but that's not the case. I rate this game so highly because it actually made me fall in-love with it's story.Now, don't get me wrong, the other aspects of the game are wonderful. The graphics are mind-blowing. The open world has been crafted to a near perfect level - it feels alive and natural, extremely large and yet diverse. Everything from the macro to the micro level has been considered and these facts alone should make the game near perfect. Those who have read my Assassin's Creed Odyssey review will note that I rate that game highly due to simply the quality of the open-world. Furthermore, the gameplay mechanics - the movement, weight, the feeling you get firing weapons or riding a horse - it's all top notch (this being an area where The Witcher failed).But the story, oh my, the story.I don't think I've ever been so captivated.I'll estimate and say it took me about 100 hours to complete the main story, give-or-take, so it's not short. However, this isn't a problem at all. Every single character is given perfect weight, the pacing is superb, the ending is simultaneously heart-breaking and wonderful, the voice acting is excellent. I don't really know how much more I can describe without spoiling anything (and this is NOT a game you want spoiled), but trust me, it is worth the time dedicated.*The simple fact is, Rockstar have raised the standard for video-game story telling.*Every game that comes before RDR2 now feels outdated and hollow. Every game to come after will have to reach the bar. This is a new generation of gaming and RDR2 is the landmark game.- The graphics are excellent.- The open-world is expertly crafted.- The mechanics are great.- The narrative is absolutely unbelievable.But, what are the negatives, if any?Well, I think the biggest negative - and it's a shame because it really does put a stain on an otherwise perfect game - would be the online gameplay.As I'm sure many of you know, one of the biggest appeals (and biggest moneymaking successes) of Grand Theft Auto 5 was GTA Online. Rockstar have attempted to do something similar in RDR2, calling it 'Red Dead Online'. Unfortunately, it is pretty clear that entire function of the game is purely made for microtransactions and to net Rockstar extra profits.The economy in Red Dead Online is (purposely) broken - it takes an unrealistically long amount of time to grind for money (obviously in an attempt to encourage microtransactions). On top of this, it's pretty boring. I could elaborate, but there are many, many videos on YouTube that explain the problems with Red Dead Online in more detail.So, unfortunately, the multiplayer does ruin RDR2 a bit. However, given that Red Dead Online is separated from the single-player aspect of the game, it isn't too damaging.Ultimately, whilst I may spend longer playing Mount & Blade: Warband or other such games (with high replayability), Red Dead Redemption 2 may well be the best made game I've ever played, and the story is a true benchmark for games to come.Final verdict: 9.5/10. I highly recommend. It isn't 10/10 because of the multiplayer 'scam' by Rockstar (don't buy if you want to play online and don't care about singleplayer)."

That does not include Red Dead Online. At all. So from a value perspective, it's a pretty good deal.You've probably heard people gush over this game more often than not — This game commits one of the cardinal sins of game development in my eyes—Placing the beginning of the game in an environment that is abnormally slow paced and not representative of the main game or gameplay loop. I say abnormally slow paced as the game is slow paced to begin with, but traversing the snow is even worse. Almost languid. The first 8-12 hours of the game is essentially a TellTale game that acts as a sort of tutorial that ultimately did not teach me much as to how the game actually operated. The events were far too scripted to have any sense of how they'd behave elsewhere. I almost stopped playing multiple times during this period. This is a large reason why I feel first impressions need to not be counted into the overall score. I don't know how they'd do it, really. Maybe a check box the user can click and just go on the honor system, on top of the systems already in place.The game is extremely character driven. And I feel as though many of the choices you make are superficial and have no real impact.  How you play and the small, minor details are what, I feel, dictate the most change. It's a much more subtle change—in the end. But the minute-to-minute details of Arthur's character are what change. Early on, when money was much harder to come by and I would go out on hunting trips without any mission prompts. Just hunting and taming horses for money. Selling pelts to the butcher and selling horses to the stable. The Butcher in Valentine remembered me 60 hours in when I went back exploring briefly. He even started  me about going to see other butchers. That NPC is my favorite NPC. The main campaign simply goes on for too long. It's not a terribly unique story. And I found it rather difficult to get through at times. The whole premise is that you, Arthur, and the Van der linde gang are on the run from deeds done in Blackwater, something you don't actually participate in, in the game. There's money you had to leave there and now you need to stay low and away from the law — [Insert Title Card] — But here's my problem: This is Arthur's story. And you're just along for the ride, more or less. , I haven't launched a game since Skyrim or Witcher 3 to simply roam around and see what happens. I feel the game really shines when you're just hunting and running into strangers and going down seemingly random quest lines. The main story is good, don't get me wrong.  The way the cities feel clustered, making your horse more of a nuisance to ride due to the amount of people that get in your way as you try to make your way through, juxtaposed to the open air of the wild and how the sound changes of your horse digging into the mud from the pavement. I started to feel similarly to Arthur not caring much for the “new world”. From RPG and survival elements seemingly spilling over into every other genre, it's no real surprise to see them here. Pet/horse bonding, eating and sleeping to recover your “cores” making your meters refill faster.  that would fortify the meters from being depleted for a brief period. Not to mention your horse being needed to carry more inventory.You're able to fast travel in the game. Though, not before significantly upgrading the camp. You're able to fast travel from campsites made out in the wild as well, provided you have a horse. However, the game actively discourages this as riding your horse will increase its bond and therefore its stamina and health. As well as its value on the market. You'd also miss out on stranger missions and “honor opportunities” as I called them. Random events that made the world feel more alive. Though, clearly very scripted for you to see. Often leading to rewards down the line.Red Harlow theory in the comments: Text limit."

Unfortunately Rockstar has pretty much left Red Dead Online for Dead. Although the Online can be fun and enjoyable with friends it has barebones content compared to its counterpart Grand Theft Auto Online. Both games are plagued by cheaters on their online mode due to Rockstar not adding an anti-cheat of any kind though so if you do play online be careful.

Waited a few minutes, no email, hit the send email again button, no email - did this a few times - no email.  Gave up went to bed with the launcher running.Get up 8 hours later - no email and now when I try it says you have tried too many times in 24 hours.I know they haven't even tried to send me the email because the email address they said they sent it to is a private server and I can see all the logs - rock star games doesn't even show up in any log.  How they got this private server email automatically I do not know - but its not my steam account email.So I send the following to Steam SupportMessage from you on Aug 12 @ 6:46am I less than a minute ago*It requires you to sign up for their social club, and wants to verify your email before you can play. It does this automatically when you hit play from steam library and somehow already knows your email address.I waited 8 hours for the verification email and they never even tried to send one -1 know because I can see the logs of the email server were never even touched by rock star games - at least they said they were sending to my private server.So while I would love to play it. I'm not too hot on joining some club I want nothing to do with and still further turned off by having to verify my email - yet they won’t send me the verify email after several attempts and 8 hours of waitingIf it just linked to my steam account like most other games do it, that would be fine - but this extra and broken process they have is unacceptable - especially when it means you can't even play the game in single player mode on my local PC.Steam recorded me as 8 hours playing - no its 8 hours waiting to play.

Now I can't even respond to the ticket to discuss it with them.  So this is how I'll respond - via a review."
315,Preator,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000207900/,80,1,1,139.6,March,"15,","1,973",7,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2. A game Developed and Published by Rockstar Games.From an early age, sitting couch side watching classic westerns with my family i have been fascinated with the wild west. With the outlaw lifestyle and everything entailed. Travelling a vast nation on horseback, with nothing to call your own but a revolver and your determination. There have been few games that capture this...GUN back on Playstation 2 did an amazing job, Red Dead Redemption 1 was a great step forward and now Red Dead Redemption 2, nearly perfectly capturing the feeling. And what a journey it is to experience.Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel to the first game, you play as Arthur Morgan, an outlaw just barely surviving being hunted by the authorities. You make it free of their grasp for the moment and you begin to unravel the person that Arthur is, or more precisely you get to control the type of person Arthur is. The history of the gang is hidden behind secrecy as is the history of Arthur and how he came to be involved in the Van Der Linde gang (Dutch Van Der Linde is the leader of the gang and players of Red Dead Redemption 1 will remember this name). You begin to traipse your way across the country side, living the life of a rugged outlaw and watching as the story unfolds before your eyes. It is a well written tale but falters in the later chapters as the same cliche dialogue is seemingly reused over and over to drag the story forward. The story as a whole though encompassing both main story and the stranger events is extremely captivating and should be experienced as a full entity instead of just as a portion. Red Dead Redemption does a lot of things really well, one of these things is the gun play. There has been considerable dedication and effort afforded to making sure this feels realistic and gritty, which are both important in my opinion in this era of game. The guns weren't sophisticated but were elegant in their own way and thus demanded a level of respect. Which RDR2 captures seemingly perfect. Keyboard and mouse does aiming justice, as Controller makes click targeting seem tacky and ""cheaty"". Dead Eye significantly amplifies the overall gun experience though, Helping you dominate large groups of enemies extremely quickly should the need arise. RDR2 offers a truly unique experience, in not only its large open world but also in how you traverse and interact with it. This is exceptionally true of its equipment, with a large range of weapons and utility items to assist you in nearly any and all situations that might arise. From hand guns and rifles to the lasso and lantern. Probably one of my favourite parts of the game, Horse riding. It felt so originally and real. That it almost alone made me rate this game 10/10. I loved it. It brought so much authenticity to the game and made me really care about the animal i'm riding around, Feeding it and brushing it constantly to make sure it stayed healthy. You become committed to its health because it defined how good you managed to traverse the world. I'm not sure if this is even the right word for it because there aren't really segregated ""biomes"" in the world, its just a naturally transformation of regions, from snow capped mountains and green open pastures, to dank and misty swamps. But the game has a vast quantity of locations to visit, and does an amazing job capturing the essence of each of them so you almost get completely captivated in it. With a huge open world, there is one thing you need almost above anything. A map. And a good map to compliment the whole experience. Red Dead Redemption 2 does just this, it offers a rustic looking map that helps denote almost everything you need, and updating you whenever something new becomes available. Extremely helpful but also completely immersive and assistant in making you feel like Arthur is using the map instead of you. Red Dead Redemption 2 has a huge amount of content to experience, the chances of you experiencing EVERYTHING the game has to offer in 1 play through is almost 0%. One thing you can complete to fruition is the collecting, even though there are still a monstrous amount of collecting to do, From hunting and fishing trophies, to dinosaur bones and stone carvings. This game will have you exploring every nook and cranny of this world to uncover its secrets. A returning gameplay mechanic from the original game, that helps guide your decisions in some small way is the Honour system. Doing good things gives you an honour boost, Doing bad things cuts it down. You gain certain things by being either and miss out on things the same way. I found this mechanic to be extremely crucial to my decision making, as i didn't want Arthur to be a villain, more of a vigilante. The movement...where do i begin. With Keyboard and Mouse the game was unbearable in terms of movement and traversing the world. It was sluggish and slow and felt like Arthur was always confused as to where he was. With a controller, the movement felt more controlled and manageable even though at times still extremely janky.: Although the writing in Red Dead Redemption 2 is exceptional on a larger stage. A lot of its internal dialogue feels confusing and contradictory to immersion. Arthur wouldn't adapt his dialogue to people, he would out of nowhere scream at passersby or vice versa passersby will scream at you seemingly for no reason. Its not a huge loss but still was immersion breaking. I have nothing bad to say here at all. This game is a visual masterpiece. So beautifully designed that i can barely put to words what experiencing it was like. Easily and without a doubt one of the best graphical experiences anyone can have in a game. From watching the rain pour down and experiencing every droplet fall from the brim of your hat, to seeing your footprints persist for kilometres as you ride through the snow or mud is such an exception touch of detail that it becomes almost breathtaking. I couldn't run this game at its max settings without my computer turning into an inferno however (Specs on my profile). But i think this should be considered a compliment as i played it below its maximum and was still dumbfounded at times looking at the wilderness or overlooking the ocean.Another portion of this game experience that completely revolutionised it in totality. The audio. The music and sound effects in the game have been so masterfully crafted that you become completely entranced in it. If you close your eyes in the middle of a scenic wood, the sound of the birds and rustling trees as the wind brushes past them is beyond contemplation. It's almost meditative in its development. The way the world is just alive around you is what makes this game phenomenal.Not many games are given this by me. This game is exceptional, a few short paces from a masterpiece. In fact if i had started and stayed on controller from the very beginning this probably would have rated ""Perfect"". This game is everything a game should be, Beautifully designed world, Exceptional audio and soundtrack that captivates the senses, A story that keeps you on the edge of your seat and game play that astoundingly supports it all to a crescendo that is almost beyond words entirely. You'd be mad to pass on this game as its not just that. Its far more than just a game its a journey and an experience. And one you have to live at least once."

As an open world adventure game, it's good but flawed. The graphics and voice acting are impeccable, but the plot has pacing issues. The open world lets you explore and do whatever you want much of the time, but the choices you can make are severely limited in the moment-to-moment gameplay during missions (a Rockstar staple, sadly). The shooting is simple and not particularly great. There are survival and light RPG mechanics, but they're superficial and not particularly necessary. None of that matters - why not? This is a game about mourning, and a great one precisely as that. Let me repeat that: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a simulation of mourning.You're role-playing as an outlaw cowboy in an America that doesn't tolerate them anymore, and everything from the open world design to the soundtrack and characters will make you confront a sense of grief for those better days now gone (much like all of us now living in a post-pandemic world). The long open stretches of desolation where you'll ride your horse only to see nothing but nature or burned-down abandoned towns make you reflect on what the characters have lost. The minimalist soundtrack too invites reflection and adds a pervasive sense of melancholy. The characters constantly embarking on heists in an attempt to reclaim glory adds a tragic sense of fatalism to the plot, and without any spoilers you already know this is not a game that comes with trite happy endings. It's a slow, somber tale; a long, protracted goodbye; a way of making the player come to terms with what's lost and irrecuperable.As an open-world cowboy adventure game, it's a 7.5/10 for how beautiful but basic it can be. As an existential tale that confronts and makes the player internalize a sense of grief, it's a masterpiece."

Its choice, more art than a game. 10/10.Publisher sucks immeasurably though. -10/10"

You CANNOT play the story mode offline. That's right, a game this amazing that costs upwards of 40$ to 60$ dollars of your hard earned money, CANNOT be played without an internet connection. Rockstar...Why do you do this?! Haven't you learned this lesson already from other franchises. GIVE US THE OPTION TO PLAY THE STORY MODE OFFLINE. That is all  that i am asking of you. Otherwise this game is pretty much perfect. And it will stand the test of time. But ONLY if you give us the ability to play the story mode without an internet connection. Rockstar, get to it!"
327,Gorre,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gorre/,79,2,1,211.8,June,"28,",609,4,1,"One of the most promising wild west open world games heavily promoted as such by Rockstar Games it did indeed deliver as a whole. You'll find yourself in a slant when you first view the looming life through Arthur Morgan - one rough gunslinger patching the outlaw squad you wake up along, as your first player experience. I absolutely loved the slow pace of your outset as the protagonist getting to know each and every lost soul in your gang, possibly even get attached to some through their first lines of dialogue. The characters are likeable and structured in a way for each to have their own charisma, lower or higher, they'll always convey something meaningful in the lessons, stories and actions they're going to be sharing throughout journey. Atmosphere has been nailed with near perfection in my opinion, random activities in your camp from quarrels between egos to melancholic depressing or joyful mexican songs; every town, house and room you will stumble upon will have its own mood inducer. I'm not joking when I say that the wild life is the best I've seen: you can easily get lost within the forests, huge open fields chasing from smallest mice to menacing bears. And by the way, I'm talking enjoyment wise, not realism even though it probably imitates life-like enough. Being able to interact  with every NPC you're coming across is one of the points which makes this title shine like a bright supernova in the dumpster of nowadays' gaming market, you can greet or absolutely antagonize the hell out of them so they'll snap or run away tail tucked between legs. Horse behavior boosts the immersion a lot when traveling the lands, take care of your companion and it will take care of you in need. Be hesitant with your decisions of murdering innocent folk, unruly impulsive deeds as it affects the karma system implemented and clearly shown each time you take a positive or negative action. Without exception every act you conclude will rebound in the most unexpected moments, karma always delivers.Graphics - holy moly you can't avert your gaze from the screen once you're in, there's too much eye candy for one to handle. Heavy cowboy boots leaving prints in the deep snow, horses trotting setting ablaze dirt particles as you rush through the lands. The attention to detail will leave even the most pretentious player completely satisfied, trees dropping the snow off its leaves, mud sticking to your clothes and skin like glue after a drunken brawl and so on. This is one of those games that feel like they're filled with a ton of gfx mods yet it's all vanilla, landscapes are beautifully crafted to make you put down the controls, sit and watch simultaneously with Arthur the astonishing views. Gameplay is well polished to fit any kind of player who wants a challenge or simply plays for the story, there's enough mechanics to have fun and mess around with entire outlaw gangs while you haven't been scratched once if skilled enough. There's plenty of guns to have your desired arsenal ready at will, golden plated shotgun for stylish brain splattering. Customization feels very authentic to fit the wild west theme, there's too many clothes to try at once, it'll draw you back until you fully complete your wardrobe. I personally spent hours shaping my outfits, which I'm very proud how they turned out, I'll post my favorite creation at the end of the review. Prepare yourself for emotional moments during roughest departures that happen within or outside the gang, music quality and diversity is a huge positive as well as nature sounds, you know like real nature would. The story surpasses anything related to wild west I've seen in a movie or played in a game, every character has the same attention given equally developing all of them, nothing will feel second hand material. Don't be in a hurry to rush story missions, there's enough side content to keep you busy for long sessions; hunting for secret treasures with only clues being some poorly drawn maps, helping fellers along the roadside, doing most insane challenges which drain your mental health fortitude and maybe the craziest goal of all tracking every single objective in your compendium. For me it's been an incredible journey clocked 200+ hours of highs and lows, all worthy of the time spent.[]- graphics & artwork keep you staring forever- character design & interactions - attention to detail on extreme levels- OST & voice acting- very rich adventure & open world- varied customization all around[]- online is not worth touching"
328,Jon Umber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jon-umber/,118,13,1,116.3,April,"21,",408,8,1,"I'll start off by saying that, although I do consider this game worth playing, and though it has had clear effort and care put into its development, it is certainly no masterpiece, and I fought regular frustration with it. I was surprised to see so many gaming publications and fans alike score it a perfect 10 because, in my opinion, it is severely flawed. It's a good open world game with stunning detail, it tells one of the best, most emotionally devastating and bittersweet stories in gaming history with great characters, but outside of that, I actually found it frustrating and shallow.The open world is incredible and full of remarkable depth. From random events to NPC encounters, a staggering amount of detail has been injected into this world by the developers who really did a fantastic job. There's a stunning amount of handcrafted detail to stumble over that will more than satisfy most fans of open world games, so if that's your thing, go ahead and buy Red Dead Redemption 2 without regret.I've seen plenty of praise for the graphics, which I think this is mostly due to the fantastic lighting engine. Volumetric lighting and how it reacts with fog and geometry looks incredible, god rays are marvelous, and the glow that permeates the setting from light sources serves to do a lot of heavy graphical lifting here. It's really something to behold, and combined with the fantastic soundtrack it serves to add a lot of atmospheric heft to the experience. This feeds into the high quality and immersive nature of the open world, one of this game's strengths.I enjoyed how the game gave me hidden side quests to find in the form of Stranger encounters littered through the world. Many of these grow to add detail to the setting and its people and have lots of writing depth to them, despite being little more than random encounters triggered by the player entering a certain area. Despite the strong open world, this experience is at its best during its thrilling, affecting main story missions and when you're getting to know the very well-written side characters in the Van Der Linde Gang via taking on camp side quests, usually in the form of coach robbery, hunting, or fishing with them. However many of the main story missions—although they're often very compelling narratively—are so on-rails that deviating from the set mission path will often lead you to a fail state outright and push you back to a checkpoint, and the checkpointing system is often poor. For one stealthy mission in Chapter 4 I was forced repeatedly to view the same full minute-long wagon ride into the camp over and over, as the game failed me for trying to sneak into a roof window. I later realized the game fails you if you go off the 1st floor, and you're expected to sneak through the ground level. This kind of railroading stifles player agency regularly and pulls you right out of the experience.Despite these flaws, single player is a strong narrative with good characters, twists and turns that mostly feel earned and are emotionally impactful, well-written dialogue, and fantastic voice acting and performance capture. Dan Houser and the writing team at Rockstar are at the peak of their abilities. This is a well-told story which makes important points about American exceptionalism, frontier expansion, human civilization, and morality. It's all helped along by the fantastic performance of the cast, particularly the player character's actor, Roger Clark. A fair amount of the side content is also quite compelling, but a lot of it does unfortunately fall into typical open world game territory, which leaves you feeling like you're doing tedious busywork for NPCs whom you just met and don't care about. Although I admittedly loved some side quests, I began skipping side content later in the game after one too many ""collect 5 bounty posters"" type missions, which was very disappointing.The slow, laggy way that both the player character and horses control is awful, unfortunately. There were several extremely frustrating moments during combat in which my character would become stuck either on a piece of in-game geometry, or running in a loop, which led to some frustrating deaths. Additionally, inventory management is an unintuitive chore, and you're never quite sure which weapon Arthur considers his default, as you're constantly drowning in dozens of them since the game doesn't allow to equip a main, nor sell those you aren't using. There's something very wrong about a game in which you're a wild west gunslinger, yet half the time you attempting to draw your pistol quickly (by holding right mouse button, then clicking left mouse button), the game fails to respond at all and you stand there like an idiot as you get shot to death. These clunky bugaboos ensured I never felt fully in control of the player character, and some of the game's fantastic immersive quality was lost as a result. I regularly felt frustrated from moment-to-moment while playing this game.Despite the compelling main quests and companion quests, this game also features some of the typical open world bloat that I've come to despise in games of this sort. I never want to hunt animals for crafting components, for example. Not out of any sort of animal-rights motivation, but because it's never been compelling for me to go out into the woods and spend hours trying to find the right damn animal to obtain materials from. I've also long despised hunting for treasure using only hand-drawn maps—another sin this game commits. I had a particularly poor experience finally finding a treasure location, only to open the hidden compartment and receive another map to decipher: What a kick in the groin it was spending 15 minutes trying to scale Caliban's Seat to complete the first treasure map I purchased, battling bad platform jumping and awkward walk/run controls and falling a couple of times only to finally find it and realize it was ANOTHER TREASURE MAP. This is the kind of boring, time-wasting side content I can't stand, and I was disappointed to see it in yet another open world game which is an otherwise fantastic experience.Additionally, the camp upgrade options are little more than window dressing. Beyond gaining fast travel capabilities and gaining new satchels, there's almost nothing of value to be gained by upgrading your camp, which is a huge missed opportunity. Because the characters are so compelling, the acting is so great, and the dialogue is so carefully crafted, I found myself wishing for an opportunity to impact the lives of the gang around me by putting some of my hard-earned wealth into the camp. It's prohibitively expensive to do so, and you gain little in-game reward for it other than certain cosmetic flourishes. If I could do it again I'd have instead poured that money into my own clothing and horses. It's simply not worth it, and before long I began ignoring the feature entirely.There are also several sorts of minigames available, such as poker or five finger fillet, but most of these—although they received obvious care in development in the form of unique animations and lines for the NPCs against whom you play—ended up feeling obviously rigged to me. The worst of this is during the poker game in Saint Denis, which one player always just stomps and led me to think he was cheating in-game. But no further explanation is available, so it instead feels just like he was programmed to take all of your money by winning lucky hands constantly. I gave up on most of the minigames after experiencing this.This game lives or dies on its being a great story and a deep, atmospheric world. If you love immersive, engulfing video game worlds or want an amazing story, you're going to love it. If you want great shooting or compelling gameplay in general, you're likely to end up frustrated.Feel free to follow  if you like this review."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. the hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, also 4 years old. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you, Red Dead Redemption 2.And thank you, for allowing me to post this cringy ass copypasta."
336,SHEWOLF,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198318084284/,79,6,1,"1,098.1",June,"12,",124,0,1,"Let me see.    I am pretty sure everyone knows Rockstar studio. GTA and all that macho stuff around it. We know what they are capable of when creating a game. So when Red Dead Redemption 2 came out for consoles I was stunned. I honestly never thought I´d want game more than that. I am a PC gamer, (honestly I suck at playing on consoles) but I wanted this game so much I even thought of getting one. So I bet you can say how excited I was when RDR2 was announced for PC. And all the waiting was worthy. I am aware that so much has been said about RDR2 that I can't possibly add anything new, but I just wanted to share my experience with this beautiful game.   The story is a prequel to the 2010 game (Red Dead Redemption). When you start as , outlaw, underdog, you start a story you wish you'd never finish. In front of you, there is capitalism, the end of the wild west as we know, indigenous Americans are pushed away, just so another rich man can have his way. And there´s Arthur and his family. Van der Linde gang. Or just Dutch's Boys going by the mantra:  The very firsts steps in the game make you feel like this (Arthur) is just another lost man. Man who can not be changed. Who is rough, harsh, brute, relentless, yet you can't just give up on him and you see him go through massive change.     I think if you rush really fast through the game, you can finish the story in about 60 hours, but considering how huge and alive this whole world feels, it's a terrible way to play this game. It deserves so much more. Go into that far west corner of the map, and enjoy what's awaiting. It can be an easter egg (there are sooo many of them) abandoned house, or simply nothing but breathtaking nature. Sometimes I found myself in the middle of nowhere on my horse, galloping towards the sunset. And you know what?    The story itself isn't anything ""oscar worthy"". But I dare to say that  For the people who love completing games all the way to 100% - this is the game for you. All those animals you have to ""study"", challenges, plants, medicine based on crafting, collectables. Tracking a scent to find your prey. Cooking your meal and giving it a bit of a touch of herbs and improving its quality.    Many times, you find yourself jumping into unexpected adventures by random strangers. Some have multiple chapters, some ends really quickly. If anything it only breathes more life into the world of Red Dead Redemption 2. As you go by, trying to get enough money for your gang  you really find yourself loving so many characters and you never know who you stumble upon.    On my way to sell my pelts I was almost robbed, while defending myself the train robbery was in progress nearby and when I finally thought I could breath and get drunk ( to finish my compendium of course ehm ... >.> ), the fight over a poker game started. On my way to the east part of the map I was drugged and robbed and bit further people kept warning me about creepy Night Folks killing innocents and begging for help. (and boy did I find them.. RIP my first horse Pototo :< )   Crafting system is super easy and mid game special recipes keep the fighting fun. The tiny details make it more fascinating. After you kill an enemy, or even animal, skin it, you can see their body decomposing over time. The horses will sweat after you gallop for too long. Certain parts of the map are deforested over time and you can see the progress. And once it's done, workers move to different locations. You see houses being built in front of your eyes. ( Now I can't just stop thinking about the unfinished buildings in GTA V lol ). And nothing makes it more real than your horse taking a massive.. and I mean massive dump while you're talking to a stranger and getting new mission.    I am on my third play through. Part on epic, part here on steam. And I keep discovering new things I missed before. I laugh with Arthur and I cry      Now that was the story tho. Same as GTA V we were given an online world full of fun and endless possibilities.  well yes but.. no.  You manage to create such a unique masterpiece like RDR 2 and then you dump Red Dead online to be a side milking cow for your favourite kid GTA V. What a shame. The bugs, the endless loading screens, CHEATERS, lack of content for veteran players. The Outlaw Pass 3 is nowhere to be seen and absolutely no communication with players as well. While GTA V has many new cars, events, here - take a million bucks just for logging in. And the RDRO community? Ah, here's a 20% sale for stuff most of you already own. Peace out.   Horses! I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love horses in this game. The difference in breeds, their stamina, health, coats. Turkoman  - always my favourite one in story and Missouri Fox Trotter in RDRonline for his speed. If they ever plan on adding more horses I'd be so happy, or even possibly own more than 5. To have a ranch maybe - would seem as fine new business since we got a moonshine business as well. The animation of horses and their behaviour is spectacular. Do you fight a lot and prefer horses that won't buck you off when the first bullet flies by? Go for Turkoman or Andalusian. Need a fast friend? Arabian. (not a big fan of those. They´re skittish) Oh man.. I could talk about this game all day. Oh I almost forgot. ♥♥♥♥ YOU MICAH!!! + story+ Arthur Morgan+ soundtrack- cheaters in RDO and incapability of Rockstar to fix bugs (animals not spawning, missions not ending or starting...)- lack of content in RDO in past few months RDR 2 Story 11/10RDR online  5/10"

This takes immersion to next level. The random encounters, mysteries and Easter Eggs are heart and soul of this game. You'd often find yourself exploring the world, chatting with random people, robbing homesteads, interacting with mysterious entities and in the process, forgetting for a short while the amazing Main Story this game offers. Gameplay :Top notch. Plenty of weapons to chose from. Very satisfying combat and realistic sounds adds to the feel of the combat.Graphics : One of the best you'd ever see in a video game. Detailing has been done on every major and minor level.Story :All the aspects above contribute in making the Story of the game an unforgettable one. Arthur Morgan, the protagonist is member of a Gang which is on the run and in search of money, peace.

One thing which always gets me is the attention to detail. The physics of this game are so jaw dropping. Also the story is very emotional. Arthur Morgan is my Favorite protagonist of all time now. The dialogues are also amazing. And oh my God those graphics!! the dynamic weather. The rain, the sunset it all feels like you are interacting with a movie in real time. The music is also great. Wildlife is amazing. You really get emotionally attached with your horse. I recommend finishing the story with max honor for the ultimate one hell of a ending. Will play time to time for nostalgia now. <35000$ ? for me? Can I turn myself in?Edit: Well It felt very sad that Rockstar has now officially abandoned the RDR Online and there won't be any  new content made for it. This game had so much potential but it is what it is."

However, I can not, in good faith recommend a game that is dependent on a 3rd party launcher that has issues maintaining a connection, AND also requires you to be online the entire time you're playing. Even in Single player mode.Rockstar, you can do better than this.That said, what I did play of the game was well done and fun. As I said, barring the issues with the launcher that they REQUIRE you to use, I would recommend it. It is a GRAPHICAL MONSTER to run, though.Sorry, Rockstar, but you've failed the customers hard on this one."

This game is one of the best singleplayer games I've ever played, however I didn't like the multiplayer version that much. Here is my pro-con list about the game:Pros:-Exceptional story-Outstanding visuals-Great soundtrack-The best character development I've ever seen in a game/film/TV show-Riding a horse is satisfying-Great physics-Interactions with the NPCs are highly effective in the game-Towns and cities are greatly decorated-Choices really matter, both affects the game and the player-Board games are fun-Plot twists <3-You can talk with your horse-Atmosphere is perfect-Weapons and customization-Optimization is great-Game is well executed-Play time is long enough-You're alright my boahCons-There is no vocalization in multiplayer-Game is a bit slowly paced at the beginning, so it might lose players who aren't patient enough-You cannot go back to the older save file after you die, it randomizes the place, and you cannot get your old horse if your horse is dead. This can be counted as a good realistic feature, but I lost legendary bear fur, so I didn't like it.Overall: This game is a greatly executed game with a perfect story, physics, sound, visuals, atmosphere, gameplay, and choices. I would give 9.8/10 for single player and 5.4/10 for multiplayer"

353,aviggo77,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aviggo77/,228,23,1,87.0,December,"28,","1,853",0,1,"Firstly, yes, the game requires a demanding PC. But the amount of graphical details justify the requirements. The optimization isn't poor, just that the current generation hardwares can't bring out its full potential.The highlight of RDR2 is its realistic aspect. The immense level of detail, coupled with a near perfect physics system makes this game a truly immersive experience. For added immersion, the entire game can be beaten with HUD disabled. The sun, street signs and land marks can be utilized to reach destinations.Overwhelming use of realistic elements in a game turns it into a tedious experience. In RDR2, there are some mechanics like: gun wear, feeding and cleaning your horse, maintaining your health, stamina and deadeye core with food and drinks etc. Unless sprint and deadeye is overused, or too much damage is taken, these mechanics don't get in the way of the gameplay.Once, after serving time, I was released from jail and the sheriff told me to scram. In other games, it would only be a mere threat. But in RDR2, I received another bounty and was apprehended AGAIN for not listening to him. This much attention to detail is rare in the medium of video games.One of the few annoying aspects of this game is the horse. Many a times early in the game, I strayed too far from the horse just to realize that the horse was no Roach that will magically appear in front of me from the other side of the map. So, making the horse follow you everywhere is a must. And, the horse can actually die if it falls from even a moderate height. Losing your horse in the middle of nowhere leaves you to a painful trek to the nearest town. Still, this is but merely a punishment for making a stupid mistake.However, there is still a limit to how realistic a open world game can be. In RDR2, there are medicines that heal you back to full health in mere seconds and save dying persons or horses; An ability that slows down time, and so on that makes me realize ""Ahh.. this is a game afterall"". But this much is necessary to not make the game too boring.The combat in RDR2 is pretty good, but not fantastic. Headshot is lethal for both enemies and the player (unless the health core is full). Luckily, the enemy AI can't land headshots constantly. The more dangerous wild animals like bears or crocodiles can kill you with a single attack, which has a realistic feel to it. All in all, the combat is on the harder end of the scale, especially on horseback. Moreso, the game doesn't have any difficulty sliders. So, to make the game more accessible and a less daunting experience, there is the iconic deadeye ability. Everything besides you will go into slow motion while you tag and kill enemies like a badass. Though deadeye breaks realism, its a cool core gameplay element. Without it, RDR2 would not have been the same.The vast world of RDR2 is mainly traversed on horseback. The horse movements are quite Witcher 3-like. However, in RDR2, the horse feels more ""alive"". As your bond with the horse increases, you unlock some cool tricks it can perform. If riding the horse becomes too repetitive, traveling to a certain destination can be automated. But the autopilot on twisty roads isn't very reliable. Also, any major location can be fast traveled to.When not riding on the horse, I climbed various mountains in my search for collectibles. It felt as if the mountains could only be climbed in one set way. If you could climb a steeper one, you might not be able to climb a less steep one because it was a ""shortcut"" to the summit. This is when the game punishes you for just trying to save some time. Swimming is not used much, and you cannot dive underwater or swim long distance.The side quests and random encounters were quite varied. However, besides some humor missions, the main missions were all very similar:1. Go to X location2. Kill all enemy in said location in a big shootout and rob them.3. Get back to hideout while having another shootout on horseback.There are some quests that start with stealth but ends up in a shootout anyway. Moreover, the movie-esque main missions have a great contrast to the RPG-like free roam activities and side quests- to the point where they almost feel like two entirely different games.There are also some minor glitches in this game. Objects sometimes clip through each other; objects or characters sometimes fail to spawn, requiring a reload of the save file. Lastly, sometimes, the horse movement becomes clunky. Getting off and back on it fixes this issue. Overall, there is no game-breaking bug in this game- just few minor setbacks which can be resolved.RDR2 on consoles looked great. But on PC with ultra settings, it might just be the best looking video game of all time. Even the smallest of things, unnoticed by many, are created with a high level of detail. The animations of player and NPC movements, explosions, fires and other minor movements in the enviroment are all very smooth. Bonus props for the lighting work.The world of RDR2 is quite vast and filled with many activities. You can watch shows, play games at a saloon, catch fish, track down unique animals and birds in swamps, tundras, deserts, grasslands and many more areas. Saint Denis is gorgeous at night. The game encourages exploration- part of RDR1's map opens up after the campaign solely for exploration. This area feels like the last remnants of the wild west. The setting truly makes you feel like you are in America at the turn of the 19th century.A merry band of misfits are unable to accept the rapid civilization of the country at the end of the wild west era. Their objective is to gather enough money and move to a yet uncivilized area to live in. The gang leader makes many plans to gather said money. His plans end up causing a huge disturbance in that region and they are forced to move on to the next. In reality, the story is about accepting change and Arthur's character development from a puppet to someone who thinks about consequences of actions and tries to not make the wrong move. After a certain point, the focus shifts from ""just making some money"" to opposing America itself. This takes the story to a generic direction, but Arthur's later character developments greatly overshadow this.The characters, named or not, everyone has their own life to live. They have interactions fitting for them. The gang members have random chit-chat amongst each other, they drink and sing all night after overcoming hardships. In most games, the NPCs' actions are centered around the protagonist. But here, not only the protagonist's, but each member's actions have consequences on the gang as a whole. They all are like a big family.The protagonist, Arthur Morgan and the gang leader, Dutch are the main characters of this story. Dutch's character regresses from an idealistic person who makes choices with no better alternatives to an indecisive assh*le who makes the wrong choices INTENTIONALLY. His character just changes somewhere in the middle without really showing reason for the change. Arthur, on the other hand, is the star of the game. He was, by no means, a good guy. But he tries to change- tries to oppose Dutch's dangerous plans. Arthur grows a heart and learns to do the right things.RDR2 is a huge game packed with content that will last one with over a hundred hour of gameplay. The game is not finished after completing the campaign. There are numerous side quests, and a lot of collectibles and challenges that emphasize exploration. The online mode is an added bonus. This is what a AAA game should offer at 60 dollars. With RDR2, Rockstar went out of their comfort zone to create a truly immersive, realistic yet an enjoyable and emotional experience. They have raised the bar for open world games and made something that can represent the progression of video games in this decade."
354,ALL4VALOR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/All4Valor/,663,107,1,18.3,March,"17,",213,0,1,"This game saved my life.I am 29.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am a close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you."

The story is amazing, the gameplay is great and the choices you can make are great too. I'm not a GTA fan because somewhat in video games I tend to like doing the good guy and what turned me off with GTA is that 1. You cannot escape having to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. 2. The world is so immoral and a complete parody that it does not feel realistic for a second. However, none of those things are the case in my own opinion with Red dead redemption. Sure you start up as a villain but you may redeem yourself and change. At some point, there are very sad moments where you will feel like crying and empathizing with the characters. They really stepped up on the realism of how characters behave although some are just crazy, the way that they are introduced makes sense.Rockstar really managed to make this sequel a piece of art. Although this game is very popular for the online side of it, I honestly believe that the popularity overall comes more from the gameplay and storyline of the solo campaign. My hope and I dare say that i'm not alone in this after speaking with many people really is that Rockstar would make more games like these and possibly a third one or DLC's about solo campaign. I really think they would draw a lot of people and make a lot of profit.But heh, buy it, it's worth the full price and definitely should be considered if on sold. I recommend 100%"
358,J6,https://steamcommunity.com/id/6561198054548261/,133,17,1,120.4,December,"21,",216,0,1,"Bought the game on Xbox One day one, and decided to buy it again on Steam recently.Completed the game on PC as I did not complete it on Xbox.This was due to burn out just because of the sheer amount of time you will spend on this game, take that as what you will as some will take that as a good thing, and others a bad thing.So what are the positives and the negatives.The Positives Single Player:1). You will never find an RPG open world game that pulls you in so much that by the end of the game you will feel as if you actually know the characters that you meet within this game. What I mean by this is, if you have friends real life, you will develop the same feelings to the people in this game, and that is because of the amount of time you spend interacting with these characters. That is because of the slow pacing that is this game, you can not just rush through the missions and expect to complete it in a day, you just physically can't. Do not let the 22 hours of my game time fool you, (I still have not completed everything) as I started with a save game that I got online that starts you at Chapter 3, and that was only because that is where I got up to on my Xbox game version.There are 6 Chapters in total in this game, with 2 Epilogue Chapters as well.2). The amount of world building, exploration, interaction that you will be doing in this game, would be described as a second life experience, in the understanding that, you will be taken away by not only the scenery, but by how the NPC's in this game, especially by the NPC's in camp. I know this word has been butchered to death, but that is only because it keeps being erroneously used for games that use gimmicks that give the impression of a real living world *cough* *cough* Skyrim. But this game, by it's very definition is an art form, because when you step away, especially once you have completed the main quest lines, and you take a step back and have a deep think on everything that you have been on and been through, it would have been one hell of a journey and you will be thinking about all that you have seen and done for many days to come.3). This is not a small or quick game to get through. From what I would state, if you was to do nothing but the main story quests, 100+ hours. If you want to try and complete everything in this game, (I do not want to just state a small number), but a mate of mine is still going at 800+ hours so, a £50, or $50 investment is a bargain for what you will be getting out of this game.4). With the coming mod support with this game, just like any game Rockstar put's out, this game will have longevity that will see no end, so take note that if you do buy this game, I can safely say you will not find yourself with becoming bored as you will be able to satiate your weirdest and wildest desires for many months and years to come.5). The game looks amazing, and is the closest you will come to seeing a Bob Ross art piece in game form, visualised in its entirety from your computer screen.6). You can customize almost all aspects of your character, weapons and horses, with some real depth to how your character looks as well. Growing facial and head hair over a period of time will also give you a sense that this game is a living breathing representation that you are quite literally playing real-life people. After a while you will forget that you are playing a game.7). There are many positives to this game, and I could go on for ages but I think these are the main points that should catch your eye. Now on to the Negatives.The Negatives: (From what I would expect people to complain about):(I like the game no matter what, I am just putting down what I think people will moan about).1). Not a negative for me, but some people may or will see it as one, but, if I am going to be honest, this one is on you. If you have a computer that does not have a GTX 1060 or higher, with 16GB of 3600 DDR4 RAM, and a decent CUP, an 8th Gen Intel I7 8600, basically a fairly modern high end PC, do not buy this game and wonder why it won't run well or chugs, then cry and moan about it, it's your fault.I have a GTX 1080TI 11GB Graphics Card, An 8th Gen Intel i7 8600, 36GB DDR4 3600 and everything at Ultra and it can still struggle with FPS when near lost's of Water. You will not be able to play this game like you could with GTA V. If your computer can barely run GTA V, you will not be able to run this game or play it in a decent visual form. Make sure you have the minimum specs as exactly stated, if you do not have them as they are written, do NOT buy this game, period. Most of the people that are moaning and complaining is because they do not read before they buy.2). For people that have a low attention span or do not have or want to put the time and effort into a game that requires you to focus, pay attention and to listen to the characters and to the world around them without you getting distracted by family and friends, this game is not for you.You need to spend a good amount of alone time playing this game. This is not Call of Duty where you can play it, put the controller down to do the dishes, come back, then put it down again 20 minutes later. You need to invest your time into this game to get the most out of it. If you buy this game, and you complete the main story missions and feel nothing, that's your personal problem, and the problem is with you, not the game. It just means that you are incapable of listening and investing a real understanding of what it is that you are doing in this game.TL;DR: If you can't stay quiet and sit still and listen for a good amount of time, do not buy this game, it's not for you.3). Very similar to the top reason but shorter. The game is very slow to start with, and I mean very slow. There will not be fast paced action scenes and combat all of the time, and things will not be interesting Michael Bay style, this is not a game for you.It's not a Farmville simulator kind of investment, as you can do a hell of a lot of things, but you do need to invest yourself to get the most out of this game.4). The game is going through updates and patches on the regular, so if you use mods expect to be waiting on Scripthook updates, so I would suggest you creating a backup copy of your current game version just in case you want to downgrade (Make sure you have 250GB in total of free space for both your normal version and you backup.Now for the Multiplayer side.The Positives:1). Some good Multiplayer exclusive stuff that will be ported to Single Player by the use of mods.The Negatives:1). Don't bother, it's GTA Online in a nutshell with all of the Microtransaction goodness that flows into this game. Certain things are locked behind Gold Bars which, let's face it, you will have to spend real money on because completing online missions gives you so little it's not worth it. The same goes for cash, you will be making a buck at best at the end of Multiplayer missions.Stick with Single player and play with mods."

Those pushed me over the edge and I now have RDR2 in my Library.Let me start by saying the game still costs a premium price for as long as it has been out. That might scare some off who have tight budgets. However, for me, it is one of those games that is still worth the cost.You are not going to finish this game quickly and feel like it cost #20.oo a day to finish a game in 3 days, something I have experienced too often.  This thing takes some time, and it is time well spent. The story is rich and engaging. I find the main character, Arthur Morgan, to be fascinating and entertaining as I play along. He draws you in to the game, a game rich in story.Now the graphics, well, they are beautiful. With my RTX 3080 from Asus, I am running this game fulling Optimized through G-force Experience and still get over 100 fps at 1440p. Replay value on this game will be great too. I can see me playing it several times over, changing outcomes along the way by my actions just to see what happens.

Rockstar Games have managed to create the perfect open world experience from almost every aspect. From gameplay to storytelling, it delivers the best experience I have personally witnessed in a triple-A title. Before starting my review properly, I'd like to warn everyone that this review is going to be for those who have played the first Red Dead Redemption; thus, it will contain lots of spoilers including a major twist that could be considered as a huge spoiler for those who never played the first game!  I'd like to start my review by praising the perfect writing of Dan Houser and other writers involved in crafting this wonderful story. Arthur Morgan could easily be the best video game protagonist out there due to his character development. He is the right hand of Dutch van der Linde, a name that you're familiar with from the first title. It's been made clear by John Marston and Strange Man that Dutch was not always the way he was, not until the Blackwater Massacre anyway and the game starts off with Van der Linde gang making their escape from Blackwater to cold mountains of Colter due to a ferry heist gone wrong. If you'd paid attention to newspapers in the first game, they clearly state that Blackwater ferry job was pretty much a massacre but further details were not known except for lots of dead bodies, a girl Dutch killed in cold blood, and Landon Ricketts' involvement in it. While these details are not mentioned a lot, whole story is based on this event and how Van der Linde gang has been affected by it, especially Dutch since it marks the turning point for his character development that will evolve him to man you're familiar with from the first game: an opportunistic narcissist who uses anarchist and partially socialist principals to cultivate a loyal base. And yes, despite having ""2"" in its title, it's actually a prequel, not a sequel. Throughout the duration of the game you will witness John Marston's doubts about Dutch while no one even dares to say a word against him, Arthur Morgan's evolution from a dishonorable and an extremely loyal outlaw to a man with moral principles, and Dutch van der Linde's evolution into a delusional madman. The whole story is beautifully crafted by meaningful metaphors of Arthur's character, shocking turning points, and a perfect storytelling. When it comes to gameplay, it delves deep into realism with RPG elements and stat cores that you need to keep up by eating and sleeping otherwise your health, stamina, and dead eye meters replenish slowly. Previous statement is also valid when it comes to your horse's stats so, you need to keep it fed and clean otherwise you won't get the most out of it. While I understand that these aspects of the game can be considered as a chore and unenjoyable by many players, I personally didn't have any problems with them since they work as intended and I'm someone who prefers arcade over realism. On the other hand, shooting mechanics are quite good and they feel good. Despite having wide-open areas as you would expect from a Frontier Western game, there is no shortage of covers and should you need to get yourself out of a tough situation, chug a bottle of snake oil and use dead eye to your advantage. Believe me, you'll be using dead eye a lot for various reasons, one of them being the AI is quite advanced and they're sometimes very hard to deal with with their unbelievably good accuracy. Leaving combat behind, the map of Red Dead Redemption 2 is nearly four times bigger than the first game's map and the amount of detail in every corner of it is insane! When I said that it delves deep into realism, it wasn't a strict statement that only covers game mechanics, it was meant for the whole game. I won't go into detail, though. Instead I'll give you two examples and you figure out the rest: You'll often hear horses and people fart and you'll witness that the horses' balls shrink when they're in a cold area. It's finally time for my personal complaints about the game. There isn't much but I'll write them down regardless. I've realized my first issue when I decided to go for 100% in-game completion rate and I felt exhausted while going after the every single collectible because there was literally no end to them! Just when I thought I've been through the worst of it, I've faced the very thing that made me almost pull my hair out: Gambler Challenges. Why couldn't they come up with actual challenges rather than RNG based ones? Why did they have to add so many collectibles? I'm fine with bounty hunting, stranger missions and other stuff but collectibles and gambler challenges made the game feel like a chore for a few weeks for me. I don't even want to start with Red Dead Online. My sole purpose of playing it was for the achievements. It's bad. Very bad. Like GTA Online bad. Even worse. Speaking of stranger missions, I feel like I should point out that some of them are missable and they tie into the main plot quite well. So I'd suggest doing all of them without exceptions.Red Dead Redemption 2 is probably the best game I've ever played in my life. It's nearly perfect in every aspect. However, its strongest point would be its carefully crafted plot that consists full of complex characters placed upon the foundations of the famous Blackwater Massacre. If you're expecting a Spaghetti Western, I hate to break it to you but you'll be severely disappointed. Unlike the first title, it's a Frontier Western that delves deep into realism in both gameplay and story. It's basically a triple-A game that should be experienced by every human being who's into video games."
369,Omnipotent-Q,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marktlawson/,29,1,0,26.2,August,"6,",234,7,1,"I was enjoying this game a lot. When it was working, it was excellent. Then version 1.20 was just released. It’s bugged to the point it crashes on starting story mode or going to settings, because of what looks like some coding stupidity with null pointers looking at the crash dumps and diagnostics. I’ve tried every single fix on the Rockstar support site, which in itself is buggy and seldom loads on a lot of browsers, on multiple devices on completely different networks.I’ve tried re-installing the game, re-installing drivers, beta graphics drivers, blanket OS resets and re-builds, updating to Windows 2004 from 1909, re-creating settings files, removing profiles, verifying game caches, registry bodging, making use of the onboard graphics instead of the graphics card. Disabling and uninstalling anti virus software. Running it directly from Rockstars awful social app bypassing Steam. A whole host of other things and none of it works because the game is inherently bugged, there is no fix. Curiously I’ve been unable to identify any differences there is with people where it’s working for them, and the many, many people who can’t play the game whatsoever right now. My rig goes well beyond the recommended specs and was handling ultra settings perfectly before this patch. (I have of course tried to amend and regenerate settings files to basic levels, flipping to Vulkan, back to DX etc)I’ve never had such a poor experience with a game in 16 years of having a Steam account, or on any console. Or with any Rockstar game and I think I’ve played most or all of them over the years, going back to the original GTA and the mythical GTA London. Nowhere near this much trouble with a game before. To the point this is the first review I’ve ever left. Don’t waste your time right now, don’t waste your money. Until they fix their ridiculous QA processes and their own sloppy coding this isn’t worth it. You’re rouletting on whether it works from first install, or works for a time until they release another horrendously tested forced patch. Ridiculous."

Then entire Rockstar launcher debacle has been a headache.  They wanted to mine our data, I get it, but I just wish I had the option to pay more and not have to be online to play the game for the first time.  I would happily pay $120 to get a DVD or USB and load the game on a computer which is not connected to the internet, and just play.  Despite all of the ridiculous, invasive, bureaucratic, spyware that we are required to install on our personal computers, just to play the game, it is incredible.The game is beautiful, and a joy to behold.  The developers really put in a ton of work and it shows.  But alas, I cannot recommend this game as the Rockstar launcher is so buggy that it gets in the way of playing.  Please, fix the launcher.  The game is a work of art, and it is such a shame that greed has gotten in the way of our opportunity to enjoy it."

I've bought it on a discount, but tbh now, after playing this game i would have bought it even without an discount. Its totally worth the money, the story, the guns and other stuff, especially the views (landscapes). You are called Arthur Morgan, and you can create your own story, are you going to be a good guy? or a bad guy? its totally up to you. Choose carefully tho, it is gonna matter believe me. If you are ever going to buy it, be sure to make your character they way you like it, make peace with your own mind and his mind aswell, dont hastitate, just be yourself, take your time exploring and ""horsing around"". Because all of that is gonna end eventually, like our lives man. 9.5/10- there should be a bit more music during riding a horse imo, other than that, its just fu*king awesomeI deeply love Arthur."

This game is highly eventful and high quality and has multi-layered dimensions of art, music, design. , Lighting, high quality animations and many other things. One of the story stages of the game and the sub-stages and various activities in this game is made with arithmetic and accuracy and thinking. The wildlife of this game is as much as 10 story games. It has a wide range and can be one of the important factors in the quality of this game. The story of the game in the stages along with the epic and listening music will delight you. The game world is very carefully and realistically designed and for each behavior. You will answer. For example, if you hold a gun and look around the city, people will tell you that you don't need to use a gun, or if you harass a town butcher or a gun dealer or discover their secret, the next time. See them, they'll tell you you came back? And I have nothing to hide, or they say you bothered me a lot last time and things like that. There is a lot in the game from finding hidden gold bars or treasure trove of criminal gangs and stealing horses and carriages and selling them and hunting legendary animals and turning them into special clothes. Your popularity line in the game It plays an important role and makes people treat you well or get into fights with you. Your weapons get dirty over time and you need to clean them to get them back to their original strength. Taming horses in the game is one of the most enjoyable activities of the game. Arthur has the ability to personalize everything from clothes to weapons. The artistic design and graphics of the game are excellently designed and make you wait from time to time and take photos. Take it and the photo mode of the game is also great. The release of this game for personal computers initially had problems, but after various updates published by Rockstar, it was completely solved, but the system is still there. It requires a strong compiler to play. Anyone who wants to understand the grandeur and breadth and depth of the game must experience it, and the origins of the game in the story section. That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.سلام به شما دوستان عزیز:بعد از بازی کردن آخرین محصول راکستار به مدت ۵۳ ساعت باید بگم با یکی از بهترین بازی های این نسل در صنعت بازی های رایانه ای طرف هستیم.این بازی به شدت واقعه گرا و با کیفیت و دارای ابعاد چند لایه از هنر،موسیقی،طراحی،نورپردازی،انیمیشن های به شدت باکیفیت و خیلی چیز های دیگر داره.تک تک مراحل داستانی بازی و مراحل فرعی و انواع فعالیت های مختلف در این گیم با حساب و دقت و تفکر ساخته شده است.حیات وحش این بازی به اندازه ۱۰ بازی داستانی وسعت دارد و می تواند یکی از فاکتور های مهم کیفیت این بازی باشد.روایت داستان بازی در مراحل به همراه موسیقی های حماسی و گوش نواز شما رو به وجد می آورد.جهان بازی بسیار بادقت و واقعی طراحی شده است و به تک تک رفتار های شما پاسخ می دهند.مثلا اگر سلاح رو در دست بگیرید و در شهر بگردید مردم به شما خواهند گفت که نیازی به استفاده از سلاح نیست،یا اگر قصاب شهر یا فروشنده اسلحه رو اذیت کنید یا راز آن ها رو کشف کنید،دفعه بعدی که آن هارو ببینید،به شما خواهند گفت تو باز پیدات شد؟و چیزی برای مخفی کردن ندارم،یا می گویند دفعه پیش خیلی برام مزاحمت پیش آوردی و از این قبیل کارها.فعالیت فرعی زیادی در بازی وجود دارد از پیدا کردن شمش های طلای مخفی گرفته یا گنج گروه های خلافکار بازی و دزدیدن اسب و کالسکه و فروختن آن ها و شکار های حیوان های افسانه ای و تبدیل آن ها به لباس های خاص.خط محبوبیت شما در بازی نقش مهمی را ایفا می کند و باعث می شود که افراد با شما خوب برخورد کنند یا با شما وارد اختلاف و درگیری بشوند.سلاح های شما به مرور زمان کثیف می شوند و باید آن ها را تمیز کنید تا به حالت قدرمند اولیه خویش برگردنند.رام کردن اسب ها در بازی یکی از فعالیت های  بسیار لذت بخش بازی است.آرتور قابلیت شخصی سازی دارد از لباس ها بگیرید تا سلاح هاش.طراحی هنری و گرافیک بازی بسیار عالی طراحی شده و باعث می شود شما هر از گاهی صبر کنید و عکس بگیرید و حالت عکاسی(photo mod ) بازی نیز بسیار عالی عمل کرده.انتشار این بازی برای کامپیوتر های شخصی در ابتدا مشکلاتی رو به همراه داشت،ولی بعد از به روز رسان های مختلفی که کمپانی راکستار منتشر کرد،کاملا حل شده ولی هنوز سیستم کامپویتر قوی برای بازی کردن می طلبد.هر کسی که بخواهد عظمت و وسعت و عمق بازی رو درک کند باید آن را تجربه کند،و ریشه و اصل بازی در بخش داستانی آن نهفته است.موفق و پیروز باشید."

389,Zylo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199031804934/,29,,1,300.9,March,14,102,1,1,"This review is based on my experience playing the single-player campaign of Red Dead Redemption 2. I dedicated a total of 300 hours to reach 91% completion, and I estimate that I would need an additional 50 to 100 hours to achieve 100%. I have yet to try the online mode, so I will not include a review of that in this post.I won't go into detail about the story, so as not to spoil it for anyone, but I will say that the game features excellent missions, typical of a Rockstar game. The humor is spot-on, the characters are great, and the overall story is a fantastic prequel to the first Red Dead Redemption.While the game isn't too difficult if you want to jump from one mission to another, mastering everything will take some time. You need to get familiar with all the activities available, especially hunting, which is essential if you want to craft the best items in the game.The visuals are stunning, even on lower settings. I have never played a game with a world so full of life as Red Dead Redemption 2. Rockstar went to great lengths to create an immersive world of the last days of the Wild West, and it's a huge payoff for players. You really feel like you're riding with a gang in the early 1900s. With the photo mode, no matter where you are on the map, you can take a beautiful photo. The dynamic weather and different environments not only change the look but also the fauna and flora of the region.Shooting is satisfying with the dead eye mechanic and slow motion, and the crafting system is diverse, from food to ammo to tonics. I also appreciated the weapon modifications, which allow you to customize each weapon with a different look.The map is vast, and you primarily travel using a horse. While you can fast travel easily using camp, train, or stagecoach, I do not advise doing so. You'll miss out on random events, and there are way too many things to collect that will take hours to find. Additionally, there are around 100 challenges, so there's over 300 hours of gameplay without even touching the online part of the game. Even after dedicating all that time, I'm sure I still missed a few easter eggs or interesting places in the game.In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is an amazing game and one of the best games ever made. It's highly recommended for anyone who has the patience to learn everything the game has to offer. Thank you, Rockstar, for all the amazing moments I had playing this game!"

One of if not the most immersive game worlds ever created, though it is a very slow game because its almost like being there in the old west for real. Some may like that, others may love the immersion.It has some of the most realistic NPCs with actual AI that works, which seems rare for games of today. You can even talk to every NPC and there is a lot of interaction.It also has, while small considering its the old west, the most immersive towns and ""cities"" (for the time period) ever created in a game. The towns are amazing, and never have I seen such amazing detail with so much interaction, realism and actual npcs that look like they belong there in towns/cities that know how to move out of your way than I have this game.Definitely highly recommended if you are looking for a highly immersive, slow paced game, where you can actually feel like you are really living in the old west."

This games takes a games graphics to a new level. In terms of graphics i gotta say that Red Dead Redemption is one among of the best games in the graphics category.☐ Bad☐ Alright☐ Good☐ Beautiful☑ FantasticThe audio is really well made. I love the sounds that are in the game, there is not much to say since the sounds are prefect.☐ Easy☐ Average☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☑ Hard☐ UnfairNow the difficulty is another thing. The game overall was pretty difficult, the most difficult part was the missions but I'm pretty sure every rockstar game is difficult when playing for the first time. When replaying the mission it isn't as difficult then. It's mostly hard to learn at first but then after a few times of replaying the mission it's pretty easy to master.☐ Bugs destroy the game☐ Lots of bugs☑ Few Bugs☐ You can use them for speedrun☐ Nothing encounteredThere are quite a few bugs that i have experienced like the character dissapearing meaning i would have to restart the game and the preformance being really bad at times. But i think they have fixed those bugs already. Otherwise the bugs aren't really so game breaking.☐ There is none☐ Bad☐ Alright☐ Good☑ FantasticThe story was probably one of the best stories i have experienced in any game. The story is just so overwhelmingly good that i think it would still be fun to play the story over again a hundred times. The story has so many unexpected events which makes the player go really amazed and so many fun and intressting missions. Although the epilouge was a bit boring the story was fully okay.☐ Frustrating☐ Sleepy☐ Boring☑ Fun☑ ChallengingThe gameplay section has kinda the same points i made in the Story section and the Difficulty section, but one thing i didn't mention is that there are still a lot of things to do even after fully completing the story like completing the game to 100%, there is also the Red Dead Online which is the multiplayer version of Red Dead Redemption 2. There is also a story in multiplayer like the singleplayer one, there are a lot of things to do in multiplayer like the stranger mission or fully completing the roles etc.☐ Really short (0 - 3 hours)☐ Short (4 - 8 hours)☐  Few hours (10 - 20 hours)☐  Long (40-60 hours)☑ Very Long (61-100 hours)☐ Extremely Long (101+ hours)The game lenght is really long, you could also just say that it never ends since you can still play after the story mission but it isn't as fun as doing the story mission though. There is also Red Dead Online but i think only the story counts as the game lenght. If Red Dead Online counts then it would easily be put in the Extremely Long thing.☑ Full price☐ Wait for Sale☐ Don't buy☐ Refund it if you canNow taking everything i said right now about the game i think it's worth the whole 59.99 euros that it's priced on. Although you can get the game for a bit cheaper during sales if you think the price is too high."
393,thöni,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036788427/,62,3,1,105.1,January,"14,",627,7,1,"There is a reason why Rockstar Games is the only videogame company that can consistently make competent great open world games and Red Dead Redemption 2 is their Magnum Opus. While others ruined their franchises with quick uninspired cash grabs or buggy messes they created the highest grossing game of all time (GTA V) with GTA Online, and even when Red Dead Online didn’t really work that didn’t diminish the insane quality put behind RDR2.Rockstar mastered the open world game formula and instead of finding the classic boring problems of your yearly open world games (useless filler missions, retarded npcs, low level acting and forced microtransactions that sh1t on the game’s lore), red dead is a believable historically accurate, fun and emotional moving world.Arthur’s gang and him are probably one of the best singleplayer video game stories ever, a long catching journey (50+ hours) where you will not feel like you are forced to do optional quests but you will want to do them, every mission (main or not) flows without you even having the feel like you are filling a checklist, missions are chained one with another with such fluidity that you won’t even notice.Everything is so perfect in this game it is hard to find something negative, the soundtrack is phenomenal, perfectly timed with the vibe of each scene, beautifully crafted world, tens of memorable characters and an iconic main character.If you like the Wild West and feel like being a cool cowboy in the start of the 20th century don’t doubt it, buy it.You might get tired of hearing about “The Plan” (xD) but don’t worry"

395,PhishNyx,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013482899/,594,72,0,797.2,April,"23,",115,20,1,"I held off on writing this review until I had an absolute reason to put it up. That being said, I've nearly logged 800 hours and have played since early December 2019. So in turn this is not a short experience review... this is what I feel other's should know before buying this sub-par Build of a game.Again, 797.2 hours as of writing this. The devs and Rockstar only consider this as a means of revenue. If you have issues with disconnects whether it be on occasion or regular basis... it's your fault. Not because they use p2p servers. Any hackers or griefers? There is an in-game report system they claim catches hackers on the spot (though hackers have died down some). Camp won't spawn, neither will moonshine shack? Well it's likely your fault too.I have dozens of e-mails back and forth regarding in-game issues or mechanics not working and Rockstars' Support team is only good at telling you ""Try verifying your game"" or ""Try restarting your router"" or some other BS despite there being thousands of players that experience the same issues, videos on youtube describing said issues, subreddits, etc...I literally was the last one in my group of friends to stick by this game as long as I have hoping for improvements. Much like a fool, I see now this is a repeat of Fallout 76, only it's a different franchise and publisher. Once you complete or get tired of single player, the online nightmare begins. Now I have 100% completion on the online story. And the game is great... WHEN and IF it works as intended. This to me feels like another early access mess. Many people say they should have waited a year to release the online mode, and I have to agree. Issues that were in beta are still present. And in a western game, there is NO WAY to rob NPC's, No passenger or cargo trains to rob and perhaps the worst part... No Bank Robberies either. Except out of your wallet (if you're foolish enough to buy GOLD BARS).The support isn't sub-par, it's next-level amateur hour. This game in my opinion deserves a seat next to FO76 for multiplayer experience. As I said before, Single player is fantastic. But it only lasts so long. Everything else about this ""game"" becomes a second job. So if you have tons of spare time, and the patience akin to a rock or moss... sure, give it a go. Otherwise, Do not go in expecting anything. If they fix the issues all players across all platforms face then maybe I would consider giving it a go. But I am waiting on a ""reply"" from support now. Depending how they handle my situation, I may just uninstall. As of now this ""game"" is only a source of more stress for me, and I don't need or want that in a game.Buyer Beware. Game is not finished. Has several issues. Needs fixing.However; Rockstar is only concerned with profits.And before you say ""Well they are limited by the quarantine,"" These issues and others have been around since BETA.Again, if it is your cup of tea, go for it. If you were waiting to see if it improved... it hasn't.Great concept, Excellent Franchise... POOR, Mismanaged execution."
396,Kosmozuikis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/,118,3,1,92.2,July,"6,","2,657",16,1,"Oh where to even start with this one? Is this a masterpiece? No, but very close to it. TL;DR it's one of the best open world games ever made.I didn't like it at first. Actually I hated it in the first 5-10h but since I paid a lot of money for it, i wanted to finish it. It felt too slow, too boring but when I started to look at this game in the same way I looked at Death Stranding it became almost as good as the latter. You need to accept the fact that you live in RDR2, not play it. When you realize that it becomes so fun that it's hard to stop playing.First the story. It's good, really good. Although there's one downside and it's the main character Arthur. Game tries to make you like him, but he's a disgusting character. Although towards the end of the game you might start having a bit warmer feelings towards him, he's still just a disgusting criminal. The story in general is very good and extremely long. Unlike for example AC odyssey where you need over 100h to finish the game but only 20h is actual gameplay (everything else is clearing camps and other pointless, mindless filler content), RDR2 is around 100h long without doing any colectathlon, only the story. And it never gets boring, the story is engaging, the missions constantly change, the game constantly surprises you with something new. And even after all those hours you want more. The pacing, the variety, the depth, the cut-scenes, it's just amazing.Gameplay is simple yet extremely fun. You are a gang member who tortures and murders innocent people. You rob people, trains, banks, slaughter everyone on your way (this is why the main character is disgusting). But the way you do it never gets old because it's always something different, something new.You'll be riding your horse a lot. It's like GTA in wild west only RDR2 is good and fun. Besides perfectly paced and fleshed out main and side story missions you can hunt, fish, help strangers, craft stuff, cook food, take care of your horse and so much more. You just live in this game, you live your life. To rest you set up a camp where you can sleep, fast travel, cook food and make potions. You can brush your horse, feed it to restore its health. Your can even take care of your beard which is growing, you can use beard oils or you can shave it. Hunting is also fun. You track animals with your Witcher sense and kill them. You get a lovely skinning animation and then you can sell it or craft some stuff for you.You can buy clothes, your character could get cold and clothes matter. There's even your weight which could increase or decrease. The depth is insane and even though the game is published by a terrible company, you can see that developers put a lot of work into this game and they made it with love and passion. Often on the way somewhere you will meet some strangers or witness some weird events. The game is filled with those, it's also filled with hilarious side stories which will make you laugh. I haven't used fast travel just for this reason – there's something happens on your way somewhere.On top of that you have plenty of side activities like hunting, fishing, shooting competitions, mini-games, collectibles which probably will add another 100h to your time if you don't want to put the game aside.Or maybe you're into multiplayer? Oh well, then I guess you're never uninstalling this.One annoying thing is the controls. Like in other Rockstar games the controls are weird. You can't run and rotate the camera which is very annoying. Sometimes you unintentionally bump into people and they get mad which leads into them attacking you and the whole town trying to kill you. But this small issue is one of the biggest flaws of the game which doesn't happen that often after you adapt to the controls.This game is probably the best looking game on the market today (besides MSFS). And it's been released a while ago. Compare it to Cyberpunk for example which looks like a game from 10 years ago. RDR2 looks stunning, no matter in what conditions, no matter if it's a cut-scene or gameplay, outside or inside a building. Every corner of the map looks stunning. The detail is insane. The animations, both facial and general are insane. Graphically the game is a masterpiece.But here's the downside – it's a technical mess. The game tends to crash and it runs extremely poorly.Crashes happen when you try to load into the game. In that case you need to go into you documents folder and delete some files which fixes it. Changing graphics settings in-game could crash the game. Having certain graphics option turned on leads to artifacts on the screen. And performance is absolutely terrible. I'm playing on high/ultra mix, dlls set to balanced and getting 60-80fps. Without dlss it's unplayable and runs at around 40fps or lower.Played on 5800x, rtx3080, 32GB at 3440x1440.No native ultrawide support but works perfectly with a fix. As always check PCgamingwiki for that.Sound, music, voice acting is of highest quality. The music is perfectly incorporated into the game. It fits every action, every moment of the story very well and enhances the overall immersion. You won't hear a lot of music in this game, it's very subtle but when you hear it you feel right at home. Voice acting is done very well starting with main characters and ending with some random character voices.Overall an amazing game worth buying despite if it's on sale or not. It has technical issues and requires a beast of a PC to run properly but it's one of the best open world experiences ever. Don't miss on this one."

Stupid marketing moves like that do nothing but pissoff loyal customers and will no doubt gonna back fire on Valve in the long run.  At the least, will  certainly delay revenue for Steam as we learn to wait and not jump right at release. Lesson learned Valve. Gosh I feel much better now getting that off my chest.  lol. Anyway, back to the game.First off the game is fun.  Good story, action, and characters. It's pretty easy to fall in love with this game. The scenery is very detailed and the voice actors are awesome. You can almost feel the cold and freeze attacking you when in snow and  mountains areas. The certain gritty aspect of the old west and voice accents just add to the experience. The story is solid although it is quite easy to  get off track with side quests which is pretty cool too. And the story keeps you interested and immersed. Besides, who doesn't like to brandish a nice six-shooter anyway.That said, I think it is crazy that as a 'fix' to starting the game for so many (me included) is to unplug your controller before launching it.  I mean ok that works. But why should we have to do that for a game that costs almost 60$ USD, whoops, I mean 47$ for all the wise and smart people that waited a bit to buy it. I would think devs would have that worked out but hey, at least it will launch (most times) doing it that way. The only other negative I can think of is that occasionally the game will crash on me. This does not happen very often and there seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why. However, No problem, just unplug your controller and fire that baby up again and turn on the controller and you're good to go for another run.Would I buy this game again?  Absolutely!   However I did learn a lesson for me to slow down and 'set  a spell' - like a couple of weeks to get in on a deal. Why pay more than ya have to?  That said, I think the game it worth the money (even at full price), in spite of the loading issue and occasional crashing.  And you will probably experience may hours of awesome fun playing this game. And now for me, it's back to running from the law and chasing outlaws. Enjoy."
400,haha,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eferis/,18,,1,87.4,December,"13,",996,0,1,"A narrative tour de force. Nothing less can be said to describe this almost 100-hour long journey that will take you through the towns and lands of a shifting America at the turn of the XX century, following the story of Arthur Morgan and a whole bunch of misfits and weird characters in a world that's getting less and less hospitable for their kind. The twists and turns of the plot, the extremely variegate and believable cast whose stories you'll get to know, care for and be a part of, the top notch writing and a soundtrack that is nothing short of amazing, starring some of the finest artists in American alt-country and soul music, make this one of the highest point in video games storytelling and probably one of the greatest Western stories ever told.The gameplay side of the production is an acquired taste, it's pretty well-known that the game is very slow and moving around feels kinda heavy but it's also very functional to the game world and, once you gets used to it, you will not want it any other way (and if you do, well, maybe this game is not the one for you, and there's nothing wrong with that). The amount of activities to do and stuff to see is pretty amazing and, if you enjoy them all, they will make the game even longer.On the technical side the game will probably require a bit of tinkering on your part in order to make it run properly on your system. I had to spend almost two hours adjusting visual settings so it could finally reach relatively solid 60 fps in every situation on my system (currently mounting a GTX 1070 and a i5-6600k CPU), achieving that with a combination of mostly Ultra and High settings, with a few Medium ones. The mandatory Rockstar Launcher is definitely an unnecessary hassle we really could have done without, let's just hope it won't break the game in the future like GFWL did with GTA IV.I haven't tried the Online mode (yet) so I cannot comment on that.In the end, Red Dead Redemption II is likely a game that won't please everyone but, those who'll dive deep into its rich world, won't find anything like it."

But I was compelled enough to come and share my experience. This is my rig:ASUS ROG OC 2080 Superi9820x @3.5 GhzASUS Strix II (quad channel)64GB Corsair RGB Ram (16x4) SSD m.2 x 2 and SSD Samsung 1TB (OS)Windows 10 HomeYou would think with a rig like that, the game would run as smooth as pancakes. Nope. This game will crash every 1-3 hours of playtime. The VRAM usage continues to rise as you play the game.  Because I have an 8GB graphics card, I have ample space for the VRAM.. except, I don't. My VRAM starts at 51% usage (baseline 8% for background). As I continue to play the game, the usage increases to 56%. 61%. 70%. 75%. And usually around this time (if it made it this far) is where it would crash, as it will continue to go up with no limit. Sometimes it crashes 45m into the game.The game itself is absolutely stunning and the physics are next level. However, due to the constant crashes (especially during critical times!!!), it ruins a really great experience.  I would rate this a positive review, but the lack of optimization for PC is deplorable.Edit: I am 100% willing to update this review if or when the developers decide to do something about it.Edit 2: Still crashing. However, not as often. And to respond to the comments about the issue being on my end:I built this rig about 3 days before playing RDR2. So it is only about 1-2 weeks old by now. Everything is brand spanking new (my old rig fried). Understanding it may not happen to everyone since every pc is different, it is happening to me, and to a lot of others.  So given that fact, the issue isn't with our pc's, it is with their settings and optimization.With that being said...I shouldn't have to juggle the settings around just to get it not to crash. Why should I have to do that after paying $60 for the game? If I have the option to play everything on ultra, then I'm going to play everything on ultra and expect the ♥♥♥♥ to work flawlessly. Not ""well some options have to be medium, others high and ultra...."" ♥♥♥♥ that. Optimize the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game so I DON'T have to do that ♥♥♥♥.Edit 3: Lots of these comments are about my rig being too OP.  No one is flexing, but if I can afford a steak, why the ♥♥♥♥ would I go to McDonalds.Anyways, I don't have these optimization problems with ANY other game.  Even ♥♥♥♥♥♥ EA's Jedi: Fallen Order (EA is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one here, the game itself is gorgeous) runs perfectly fine on all ultra. Far Cry 5 runs fine on all ultra. Everything runs fine on all ultra EXCEPT this game.  I understand they are ""not gods"", but knowing there was this problem and releasing it anyways, is the problem. At least have the game work first, and if it breaks down later, I get it. But from the outset the port to PC was just bad, which is inexcusable for a company that makes millions of dollars."

This is the first game i have taken 100 screenshots in the first 10 hours of the game. Playing as Arthur was the best thing in a game because he is one of the best protagonist i have played as.The animations and the voice actors just fit so good one with each other. This is the first game in a long time that made me do every possible mission. The side quests are so well done. Some of them change some things in the story mode. Red Dead Redemption 2 is the prequel of the first Red Dead Redemption and it's a good this cause we finally saw what happened to the gang that John was in. And now a lot of things make more sense in the first one.Red Dead Online it's a prequel of a prequel, it's really weird. Online is not bad, but is hard for new players to make the gold and money. And it needs some heists/robberies but other then that is good.The graphics and visuals of the game are astonishing and really well made.The gameplay it's just so good like no other game.The soundtrack just amazing and really well fitted. A really great choice with the western like vibe of the music and game. Oh and i like it when the horse testicles shrink when it's cold.I fell in love with the game in the first 2 hours of it because it's just so good. I played like 10-12 hours per day cause it's great. No game really made me do that.  That's how much i love it. I don't regret buying this game. I bought it on sale for 40 euros. The best decision. The game is worth every penny you have. I hope they will port Red Dead Redemption to pc so i can play it or maybe a remake or remastered version of it and maybe Undead Nightmare 1&2.So if you have the money buy the game it's worth it.If you want to look at the screenshots that i have, some are spoilers so be carefull.    Red Dead OnlineOk after playing online for some time i can say i like some elements from it. Love the grind like in GTA Online. Love the trader role because of the animal hunting.I can say that RDO is not that bad but it does need content.The game kinda has a somewhat a lot of content online. You will need to grind a lot as well.After a lot of hours that went into online i can say that Red Dead Online is not that bad, is really great actually. You can really make money easy if you know how. To get gold is kinda a pain in the ass but is worth getting it for the roles and other items that have nothing to do with getting money or such, just for the cosmetic purpose. Online does have a story driven kinda gameplay that happens before the single player campaign. The game is really great if you have friends to grind with. More people the easy it is to get money and gold but mostly money. So after all that online is quite fun but it does need more content."

The characters, including Arthur Morgan and Dutch Van Der Linde, have some of the most complicated moral dilemmas and plot lines in all of media history, and it’s more than interesting to watch unfold in the game as you play.Red Dead Redemption 2 also currently possess the most intricate and detailed open world to ever be created. With a technical marvel of an AI system, an artificially intelligent animal ecosystem, and incredibly dynamic and interactive NPCs, the technical aspects of what make the open world fantastic as truly some of the best to ever hit the market. All this, combined with the beautiful and detailed map are what really bring the world into fruition.I could look on and on about the writing and how fantastically executed it is but despite all this, this isn’t a very “gamer” game. There’s no “double jump”, or points system, or fancy fantasy game mechanics, It’s very detached from gaming as a whole and a lot more focused on telling a story. This type of style appeals to me, but I can see why it isn’t as treasured in some gaming circles either. This is a game made to be brutally realistic, and that to me feels more relatable and embraceable than any other game will ever."

HOWEVER- I could not recommend buying for PC through Steam or any other PC game platform because, like some others have said, the Rockstar social club app is a forced install and is complete garbage. So this would effect other Rockstar games as well. When I installed this game it made me create a Social Club account and must launch when you try to run the game. I get an error when I launch the game that says ""Code 17 Social Club failed to initialize"". It then will force you to try to look at a solution and a browser will pop up in RDR2 for Rockstar. The solution will say something about GTA5 and the solution didn't work for me. I've read other possible solutions from other sources and nothing worked. I know my way around a computer and have figure out how to fix just about any issue I've ever had with games and could not figure this one out. But I shouldn't have to and I'm not going to waste my time. RDR2 is excellent but don't buy this because of Social Club and maybe buy for console insteadUPDATE: Against my better judgement, because I'm not a quitter and I must be a masochist and after getting a refund I REPURCHASED this game and tried again to get this game to work. Not sure which of that many new things I tried did the trick. Moving a file here or there and deleting this other file. I was happily playing for about four days and suddenly Social Club stopped working randomly saying it couldn't connect even though the Rockstar servers are not down. And now down I go into another rabbit hole of fixes to get this garbage app working with this new issue. It sucks because I only have so much time each day to play a game and I'm sitting here for hours troubleshooting Social Club on my own instead of actually playing. Who knows if I will ever get it working again but still can't recommend this game after all Social Club has put me through- it can't be worth it."

Now, years later, I purchased Red Dead and tried to run it and apparently this also requires Social Club.  However, the last time I used Social Club was with an email address I don’t have access to anymore (like I said it was years ago) and it won’t let me log in now.  As such, it won’t let me launch red dead (or presumably GTAV if I ever wanted to play that again).  I tried making a new Social Club account and Rockstar won’t let me associate it with my Steam account until I verify my old email address that I don’t have access to anymore.  I contacted tech support and provided them with screenshots of my receipt, Steam ID, CD keys for GTAV, and some other stuff they asked for and they actually wrote me back saying that the problem is unfixable!  Like no next steps, no we need to do something else – NOTHING – just a big screw you.  I was really looking forward to playing this game – I guess I won’t be able to play this or any other future Rockstar releases that use Social Club???  Stupid.

Once I downloaded the game and the rockstar launcher, when running the game I started to get the problem that the game did not run directly getting the message to run the game safely but still did not run.I am a software engineer so I set out to find the causes of the errors and try to solve them, analyzing the launcher's log, where the game's events and errors are recorded, this file can usually be found in the following path 'C: \ Users \ USER-NAME \ Documents \ Rockstar Games \ Launcher \ launcher.txt ' I found some problems:.First error 0xc0000005, this error is associated with a blockage by another external program, normally the antivirus, so by deactivating the antivirus I was able to overcome this problem, I tried to run the game and received another error.Second error 0xc0000374, in programming this problem is associated with something called Heap Corruption, something that should not happen unless the game is badly programmed or there is a problem with the compilers or the hardware, in a few cases the hardware is responsible so I discarded this option, a bad programming also discarded because the game worked on other machines so I set out to see if it was compiler problems, in this case I noticed that the launcher uses Visual C ++ Redistributable 2015 and in its installation add this to the system, so I went to control panel> programs and uninstalled the versions of visual c ++ Redistributable 2015 and the rockstar launcher.Then download and install the c ++ version from the microsoft page,  and reinstall the rockstart launcher, with this I could access the game .Once there the game worked in multiplayer mode but not in campaign mode, when I tried to run the single player mode the game was loading indefinitely, seeing this I decided to use steam to analyze the integrity of the game, finding that I needed Downloading a corrupt 7.9 Gb file again, additionally proceeded to perform a clean installation of the video driver with the DDU program because the game performance was not as expected on multiplayer mode, once I finished these processes I could fully access the game.The game is great, but all these problems make my rating negative, it is not possible for the launcher to have such bad error management, they should minimally guide the user depending on the error he throws and not only leave it registered in a log file that most users will not know how to read and interpret.A lot of work ahead is left to rockstar with this game, hopefully improve in the future------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Compre el juego hace dos días, me gustaría comentarles el complicado proceso para hacer funcionar el juego, primero mis especificaciones básicas- Procesador core i7 7700 3.6 Ghz- Nvidia RTX 2060 6Gb- RAM 20 GB 2400 MhzTengo los requisitos para correr bien el juego. Una vez descargue el juego y el lanzador de rockstar al correr el juego empece a obtener el problema de que el juego no corría directamente obteniendo el mensaje de ejecutar el juego de forma segura pero aun así no ejecutaba.Soy un ingeniero de software asi que me propuse encontrar las causas de los errores y tratar de resolverlos, analizando el registro del lanzador, donde se registran los eventos y errores del juego, este archivo se puede encontar normalmente en la siguienete ruta 'C:\Users\USER-NAME\Documents\Rockstar Games\Launcher\launcher.txt'. Encontre varios problemas: Primer error 0xc0000005, este error es asociado a un bloqueo por otro programa externo, normalmente el antivirus, asi que desactivando el antivirus pude superar este problema, intente ejecutar el juego y recibi otro error.Segundo error 0xc0000374, en programacion este problema se asocia a algo llamado Heap Corruption, algo que no deberia ocurrir a menos que este el juego mal programado o que exista un problema con los compiladores o el hardware, en pocos casos el hardware es el responsable asi que descarte esta opcion, una mala programacion tambien la descarte debido a que el juego funcionaba en otras maquinas asi que me dispuse a ver si era problemas del compilador, en este caso note que el launcher utiliza Visual C++ Redistributable 2015  y en su instalacion agrega este al sistema, asi fui a panel de control > programas y desinstale las versiones de visual c++ Redistributable  2015 y el launcher de rockstar.Luego descargue e instale  la version de c++ desde la pagina de microsoft,  y reinstale el launcher de rockstart, con esto pude acceder al juego.Una vez alli el juego funcionaba en el modo multijugador pero no en el modo campaña, cuando intentaba ejecutar el modo de un solo jugador el juego se quedaba ejecutando de manera indefinida, viendo esto decidi utilizar steam para analizar la integridad del juego, encontrando que necesitaba descargar de nuevo un archivo corrupto de 7.9 Gb, adicionalmente procedi a realizar una instalacion limpia del driver de video con el programa DDU debido a que el rendimiento del juego no era el esperado, una vez termine estos procesos pude acceder completamente al juego.El juego esta genial, pero todos estos problemas hacen que mi calificacion sea negativa, no es posible que el launcher tenga tan mala gestion de los errores, minimamente deberian guiar al usuario dependiendo del error que este arroje y no solo dejarlo registrado en un archivo log que la mayoria de usuarios no sabra leer e interpretar.Mucho trabajo por delante le queda a rockstar con este juego, esperemos mejore a futuro"

433,Phoenix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixKovacs/,27,1,1,108.3,January,"6,",236,0,1,"This game is an accomplishment of visuals and narrative, but the game design is more complicated. The story missions and open world content feel so vastly different its almost jarring. Exploration is absolutely wonderful and incredibly immersive, and I even got way more invested in hunting then I ever expected. Discovering new locations and stranger missions is always enjoyable, and the first time I stumbled upon  was genuinely jaw dropping. The attention to every minute detail, and the admittedly tedious at times animations, create a truly unmatched sense of realism. It may not be for everyone but the slow pace of everything is definitely for me. On the other hand the story missions are so on rails that after a while I just treated it more like TV show more than a game. I don't actually have a problem with this, sometimes its nice to just soak in the world and story without much effort. But the mission design is at best good and at worst boring and tedious. The ride - talk - shoot - ride loop becomes incredibly rote by the end that I was so tired of it, especially the amount of shooting gallery's. None of that really matters because god darn this game has one of the greatest narratives I have ever experienced. Arthur Morgan might just be my favorite character in all of fiction. When all of the open world systems are working together, it creates an opportunity for role-play more than any RPG I have ever played, I felt like I WAS Arthur. If the mission design matched the quality of the writing this would have the potential to be the greatest game ever created. My only real issue with the game, what I believe to be objectively bad, is the epilogue. Right after the grand crescendo of the story I spent over 90 hours with at that point comes to a dramatic end, the pacing takes a massive nose dive and never recovers. It isn't all bad, and still retains its quality in writing with genuinely great moments here and there. There was just so much bloat and pointless missions that didn't add anything to the story. So many drawn out shooting galleries, I was so bored most of the time. I would almost recommend you skip it but its worth playing for that one song. Lastly I'll touch briefly on the graphics. I don't think I have ever taken more screenshots while playing a game before. There are some aw-inspiring vistas, but the graphics can get extremely muddy at a distance. That may have just been my graphics settings so if you're like me and still making the best out of your 10 series card just keep that in mind. I cant believe this came out in 2018, and is easily the best looking open world game I have ever played, and it could have easily released this year. Overall I would give Red Dead 2 a 9/10."

Avoid the steam version and go get it for console to work around the launcher. Let me begin by saying RDR2 is one of the best games I've ever played, and i'd rate it 10/10. It will go down as one of the best games ever made, but I cannot recommend the steam version because of two words: ROCKSTAR LAUNCHER. It's atrocious. I recieved an error message today saying I could not open the launcher because my social club installation was incorrect, which was odd considering I never mess with game files, so I go to try to redownload the social club and every link on Rockstar's support page leads me to the Launcher download link........something I don't need. Also, the only way to validate your social club information is by OPENING THE LAUNCHER and verifying there. See my issue? Looks like my experience of rdr2 concludes at 33 percent game completion, because the game will refuse to play if your launcher and social club crap isnt perfect, and if you're unlucky like me and get stuck in a catch 22, then you might as well get your money back and uninstall, because after 5 hours of trying to get it to work, i finally give up. I'd ask for a refund through steam but I know I wont be getting that 60 dollars back. I'd stay away from the steam version until the launcher is either completely removed or improved on. Absolutely rediculous.EDIT: I only managed to get the launcher working again after deleting the 120GB rdr2 and reinstalling it onto my computer. HOWEVER, now the launcher is saying it cannot create a sign in token, and it's been saying this for the past hour, so STILL waiting to play the game I PAYED FOR.EDIT 2: I managed to log in after enabling my vpn. Apparently, being region locked prevents the launcher and social club from updating properly. I an now able to play my games again. I will not be changing my recommendation, because it SHOULD NOT BE THIS MUCH OF A HASSLE TO PLAY A GAME I PAID FOR.EDIT 3: The launcher refuses to work without a vpn. It complains that I have no network connection when I obviously do. This single program is the only one on my computer that doesnt sense the internet connection, but for some ungodly reason, when I enable my vpn, it works like a charm. The launcher, in it's current state, WILL NOT WORK WITHOUT A VPN, SO IF YOU CAN'T FORK OVER MONEY TO GET ONE, DON'T BOTHER BUYING RDR2.EDIT 4: And now for the cherry on top of this dung cake: The launcher is working without a vpn now. So it had nothing to do with any of the internet crap apparently, and just decided to spontaneously grace me with it's single braincell functionality after I tore my hair out for hours trying yo get it to work. I'm not holding my breath, because if it F***s up this badly once, it will most likely do it again at some point. What a gigantic waste of my time for absolutely no reason.EDIT 5: And like Nostradamus himself, I predicted exactly what would happen. Not only is the launcher not working AGAIN, but now it won't work with ANYTHING. Vpn? Restart computer? Mess with DNS settings? Mess with the router? Mess with wifi settings? Delete and redownload? Nothing. It doesn't work with anything now. Keeps saying there isnt any internet connection WHEN THERE IS. I'm actually at a loss for words. I cannot describe how incompetent Rockstar is for releasing a launcher that doesn't even ♥♥♥ work half of the time. I will never buy another Rockstar product if this piece of malware launcher is connected with it, and I suggest that everyone here does the same. Dont bother going to the rockstar support. A piece of molding bread that's nailed to the wall will be of more help then they would be, and it'll have more brain power to boot. Save yourself the headache and play on console. If you dont have a console, then watch a lets play or something, because the pc version of any Rockstar title will be ruined by this idiotic launcher."

Crashes consistently in the early missions preventing any story progress. But because I was silly enough to try for longer than 2 hours to get it to work, I can no longer return it. I can understand not wanting to refund games after people have already played it too much. But when you're selling a clearly defective product on your platform, you have to take some responsibility for that. This release reflects just as badly on Steam as it does on Rockstar.I feel like somebody owes me $60.EDIT:Just felt like I should update this. After much back and forth with Steam customer support, we've worked out an agreement that I'm happy with. 'Sall good. And it's just in time, too.

437,Old Man Gamer (OMG),https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManGamerOMG/,31,3,1,420.2,August,"14,",277,2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the product of a well made interactive open world game. The main story is compelling in itself, but there are also a slew of well written and enjoyable side stories. The game can easily become the only game you play for months, without any regrets.For me, the first and foremost is the game play. The game plays well, has an open world feel that few games fully achieve, a weapon system that functions very well, and horse mechanics that will both frustrate and add enjoyable dynamics. Even when there are issues with graphics or physic simulated behaviors, the game delivers far more positively than those can retract. Typically my first and foremost is story. The story in this game is absolutely brilliant, along with the writing and voice acting. This is one of the few story style games that I could find myself enjoying, even with a bad story, however. Fortunately, the story is sacrificed, and worth the experience as well. There are liberties taken with the approach to what historically occurred, but overall, the researchers did their homework. There are a great many small details that would be easily overlooked, but are actually true. The developers also did not get so bogged down on the story, to forget to make the game for entertainment. From the writing to the voice acting to the animations, the personalities are well established with great characterization. There are also a great many life lessons within the game, such as the two competing brothers, which add to the realism and give insight to wisdom for those paying attention. The writing of the two convicts shows how far hatred typically went in the real world. There are a great many side stories that show many truths and offer pearls of wisdom, without making the game politicized or preachy. There is a great balance that gives realism and believe-ability to the impossible Author Morgan and his environment. The music is relaxing and fits the game well. There is not anything that stands out with the score, but their are quite a few songs within the game that are comical and enjoyable. The sound effects seem very meticulously and deliberately placed. This adds a great dimension to the game while fishing, hunting, robbing a home and so forth. This is something that I rarely see this well done in a video game. Ambient sounds are more present than just background noises. For example, if you hear a frog, there is quite possibly a frog right next to you, or a chatter of a raccoon, or growl of a cougar. In summation, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a must play for open world and story driven gamers, in my opinion. There are more positive aspects to share of this game. From the attention to detail of the audio, maintaining historical accuracies without turning it into a daunting social political agenda, to the realistic human interaction that has been lost in so many modern games (that makes you question if the developers ever had a healthy interaction with another human). The game is not without its flaws, but they are often more comical than frustrating. At the time of this review, I have only played the single player portion of this game."

I finished my game on 93% +/- which took me more than 200-250 hrs. (played on Rockstart launcher)I think that RDR2 story is the most epic story I ever played. I really enjoyed most of the missions. I didn't even feel like there were some kind of filler missions which didn't have any impact on the main story or character development.I really like how they were able to create such unique gang characters. I played a lot of games in my life but I never cared that much about other ""main"" characters in the game until I played RDR2. This game really made me care for other characters. Every single character felt unique and through the story you learned even more about these characters.Amazing combat. Shooting is really feels real. Reloading etc. is realistically correct which is amazing. Dead Eye ability is really neat and with options to upgrade it with talismans etc. Melee combat is also good.Wow. I must say that RDR2 is my the most favorite open world game I played in A REALLY LONG TIME. I don't even remember the last time I just went to the woods and enjoy the world by hunting or just chilling. RDR2 really nailed the world.Horse physic is really great and on spot. I like that there are different types of horses and bond system is really cool as well.Map is HUGE and BEAUTIFUL! I never used fast travel in my whole  play through. Every time my ride felt unique with so many random events. Even in the very end of the game I still experienced NEW random events. Did I mention that you can hunt in the game? And that animals are very real? I spent a lot of hrs. by just hunting. Yes, it's true that RDR2 has a really bad performance but sadly it's mainly because of Rockstar Launcher and too strong protection but otherwise game is really beautiful. You have a tons of settings you can change. Overall quality of textures looks really good. RDR2 is one of my most favorite games I ever played. Story was amazing. Arthur Morgan is the most realistic in-game character I ever played as. Thanks a lot Rockstar for creating this masterpiece. Even if you heard that Multiplayer is bad, you should really try it at least for Single Player because it's really worthy.- Arthur Morgan(Product is not refunded, I own it on Steam as well, it's just a bug)"

This game is art. This game is a masterpiece. In every single conceivable way. I'm currently on my second playthrough - first I played on the XBOX - and enjoying it just as much. My favourite thing about RDD2 is that you can shape your own path and how you want to play... First time around I decided to play honourably, I helped out strangers, I spared those whom I could spare, etc. This time around however I play dishonourably, I'm a menace, I kill whoever I can, I rob, I loot,  I exploit, basically everything bad, I do; and I'm having one hell of a time doing it.

The update happened right when the community was reaching a point of mass protest, and it turns out that Rockstar has plans for at least one more update around Halloween.The game is worth its price tag for the single player alone, and I've personally clocked much more time online than I have in the Story mode.

Imagine having bought the Ultimate Edition like a gullible idiot (hi that's me) because you're excited to support a port of a really good game, and by extension other projects an otherwise great developer is working on.Absolutely not. Not right now.It's clearly poorly optimized, it's clearly very buggy, it's clearly just not ready for Steam.Which brings me to my next part. What the hell is the point of making us wait for a Steam release if we still have to use the Godawful, troublesome, completely unnecessary Rockstar Games Launcher to begin with exactly? What's the point of it? Completely back asswards, if you ask me. Superfluous as ♥♥♥♥. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher doesn't even recognize that yes, I've already bought the game and yes, it is clearly installed on my system. And the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ launcher in question is telling me I still need to buy the game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's just totally pointless.I've done everything from running Steam as an administrator when before I never had to, to upgrading my BIOS, to upgrading my OS even, to upgrading a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ l i t a n y of drivers, to unplugging my controller when I first boot up the game, to sitting through a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ clickable chorus of ""Red Dead Redemption 2 has exited unexpectedly,"" to furrowing my brow at ""The Rockstar Games Launcher is already running,"" gritting my teeth at Steam still thinking RDR2 is running after it has clearly long since crashed out thus pushing my playtime further closer to the two hour mark of no return when it comes to Steam's refund process, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around with the .xml file for the settings to even make it run smooth when I finally do get the game running only to be met with getting kicked in the face with ERR_GFX_STATE.So after every fix imaginable, every tweak, every last thing I can think of, I turn to Rockstar Support.Also a pretty horrible experience. Expect the recipient of your support ticket to rummage through the entire Amateur IT and Comp Sci Starter Pack with such classic hits as ""have you tried restarting your computer?"" and ""obvious things you've already tried by Googling them five hours ago."" Fat lot of help that was.So by now you're probably wondering hey where's the review of the actual game.You see, I'd be able to tell you if I were actually able to play it beyond a few minutes at a time.It has taken me up to my current playtime (that's 5.1 f u c k i n g hours of crashing, restarting, and all other manner of crazy things) to get . By the time another element of gameplay meets me, I'm crashing out again and either am having to reload a save that's far away from that particular point or auto-save has bailed my ass out.So it's hard to actually talk about the gameplay and story and all that.But I'll leave you with this. What I've actually been able to experience has been .The gun play is satisfying, the music score is fantastic (even heard a rendition of Leo Delibes at the first camp, that's just tasteful), the characters all seem very interesting and the environments are gorgeous and .So when the game runs, you're treated to a great experience. When it runs, it runs .But when it SUCKS, it .Don't buy this title until Rockstar bothers to iron out the kinks, and there are a metric ton of them so a lot of work still needs to be done. There's a lot of crashing, there are a lot of errors and pop-ups and launcher problems that still persist, and this launch (while financially successful) seems to echo a lot of the sentiment here in this review.That actually getting it to run is a total slog fest. It's just miserable.But when this all blows over and they DO get this thing off the ground in a smoother way, absolutely."

This game takes over 3 minutes just to load into the singleplayer even though it's installed on my SSD because it has to authenticate with Rockstar Online Services and do some cloud sync stuff that's really buggy and takes forever. I miss when games were just games. It's a shame such a beautiful game made by a team of passionate and talented devs can't just live out its existence unblemished by greedy fingerprints. I will continue to play the game with massive respect for the developers and the gorgeous world they've created, but every time I open this game, I wish I was playing a pirated version instead, and it has nothing to with the cost of the game.

A slightly dodgy port is eclipsed by the masterful story telling and cinematic missions that far outshines GTA V, another Rockstar game in recent memory.

487,DisableBore,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DisableBore/,16,,1,107.3,January,"24,",804,0,1,"Two years late to the party but still glad I got around this one.While Manhunt will still be my guilty pleasure, RDR2 is probably a top favorite from Rockstar Games.RDR2 tells the downfall the infamous Van der Linde gang before the first game, from the perspective of Arthur Morgan, the top gunman. His entire arc is the things of beauty, and to say doubting I’d like him as much as John was foolish of me. He is a character full of likable traits who can stand proudly among my favorites. Robert Clarke deserved every single praise he received alongside the rest of the cast, with especially Benjamin Davis stealing every single scene he shows up.Now, RDR was almost entirely a love letter to the Italian Western, with mostly deserted and dry locations-and people. However 2 goes beyond to cover more classic takes too. If you have enjoyed any of the tales of the western genre, you will absolutely be satisfied in some way. From small to large heists, insane shoot outs in towns and bar fights, mountains to deserts, forests to dirty swamps, every single activity in the savage times you could like from the West is here. The soft harmonic guitars, gospel chanting, gorgeous visuals and beautiful vistas just deserve that you to take your time and enjoy a slow horseback ride.Everything you do in the world comes to bite your bottom eventually. Being a carcass to people will not result in kindness, the lawmen are ruthless to hunt you down, meanwhile bounty hunters and rival gangs seek to ambush you at any turn. Exploring the environment, paying attention to the surroundings, and finding side missions and quests always benefits you, from some good looting, rare materials to sell or craft, maybe simply amusing characters that go about their antics. The hours I spent just taking a break to go about my leisure is probably half my playtime. Hunting alone is a good example of how much you can go by, hunt to eat in a makeshift camp, donate to the gang, sell for profit, use to craft. There is almost nothing you do that can be considered a waste, and letting loose to invest yourself in the people (and especially your trusted horse) will always be worth it.I'll be straightforward, however: This is a slow game. So slow, that I wouldn't blame you for getting tired of it by the first hours. In game play terms, we have a similar mannerism to Max Payne 3, the shooting mechanics being deliciously brutal, and combat as a whole feels impactful, as it should. You must keep your body well with some light rpg style mechanics and the game will not be afraid to pull a rabbit with a gun if you do not watch your back. Being able to gunfight in first person is a neat addition, not too good for the rest.As a whole, I cant deny I am biased for adoring the genre this game pays so much homage and respect to- but in it's own it's a fantastic story of it's own that does everything to immerse you in.If you liked Clint Eastwood or John Wayne's movies (if you don't please get out of my sight and leave your testicles by the door), you enjoy a slower approach to open world, and can put up mildly annoying design choices for sake of a plot, I can absolutely recommend RDR2 even at full price, and on sale it's damn worth the price."

494,A Harmless Cat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HarmlessCat/,15,,1,297.7,March,"17,","1,106",5,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure game following the end of the 19th century, the end of the Wild West. The prequel follows the story of Dutch van der Linde's gang of outlaws, fiercely fighting to escape the inevitable faith in store for them, the new ""modern"" world. The second game presents us with a brand new protagonist, Arthur Morgan. Just like the original's protagonist John Marston, he is also an outlaw - Dutch van der Linde's most trusted associate. Honorable at heart, but at the same time stuck on a crossroad between what's right and what he believes is right. Taken on a massive rollercoaster ride through the ~50h campaign, our main protagonist evolves so much when his world views get taken apart.+ A massive open-world that feels like a living and breathing creature, filled with breathtaking views. From the gorgeous snowy mountains to the giant muddy streets of Saint Denis, all the way back west to the deserted town of Armadillo. The world ""talks"" and responds to you and your actions.+ The most detailed animal wildlife featured in any video game so far. Incredibly extensive list of different animal species that act just like they would in real life.+ Technologically astounding weather system, most probably the best weather system of any video game so far as well. You will ""feel"" when it's hot outside or when a massive storm approaches.+ Rich AI behaviour for all NPCs, they remember the player's actions! Whether he robs a store or helps someone in need, everything reflects on those around him. They also have daily routines - eating, sleeping, doing some work, etc. Rockstar nailed this part here compared to GTA V.+ Incredible story, full of twists and turns, pinnacle of what video games have to offer. Rockstar made us care so much for some characters on our screens. Thanks to incredibly mature writing and the phenomenal delivery of the actors who portrayed them, those characters feel so alive and real. As if they are right in front of us. The protagonist is the main focus, but the side cast in this game is also staggering and adds so much to the whole experience.+ Huge emphasis on realism in this game, even more than GTA IV or even the original RDR. The stamina, health, and deadeye cores drain over time, there is a need to eat and sleep in the game to replenish them. They drain quicker if the player is poisoned or has a sickness. Weapons also have to be picked up from the horse, we can't carry all of them on our back like in GTA. This is not to everyone's liking, but it's important to note that this game is artistic, and art is often not appreciated by all.+ Incredible cast of actors that poured their heart and soul into these characters, possibly the best ensemble in any video game.+ Great and extensive customization options - Arthur's hair and beard grow over time. There are loads of different clothing, beard and hairstyle options. Same applies to weapon and horse customization.+ Astonishing soundtrack that deserves to be heard at least once, by everyone. Absolutely vital part of the whole experience this game presents.I am almost at loss, but there are minor things that could have been better in this overall masterpiece.- A lot of emphasis on animal hunting and plant collecting. This applies to people who want to 100% the game, of course. If you plan to start this journey be warned, you are bound to get fed up by the amount of hunting and picking you have to do.- Gambler Challenge 8 (Soul Draining!!)- The missions are a lot slower and ""calm"" compared to GTA V, for example. This is necessary, as it goes hand in hand with the heavy narrative-driven experience. I am absolutely fine with this and can appreciate the decision. You need to be aware, however, if you are primarily a GTA fan or don't have patience to take this game slow, like it should be taken.- Not exactly a negative, but I will put it here anyway. The game requires QUITE a powerful computer in order to run smoothly on high settings.Red Dead Redemption 2 is true art. If the original was a masterpiece among video games, this one is a masterpiece in all of entertainment. Elegantly and masterfully crafted, even after 4 years, this is the best example of games being on par with movies and books. Featuring one of the vastest and most detailed open-worlds, arguably the best story in video game history and the most detailed wildlife in gaming. All this brought to life by an astonishing cast of talented actors makes RDR 2 a concrete !  Game of the decade and one of the best pieces of entertainment of all time. Thank you for reading this lengthy review. A small point to mention is that the score and everything mentioned concerns only RDR 2 and not its Online mode. I know how poorly Rockstar treated the online for this game, but I've never really cared for it so it does not bother me personally.For anyone interested in doing 100%, I have a great guide you can follow, which features optimal strategies and routes!"
495,isapicobella,https://steamcommunity.com/id/isapicobella/,21,,1,"1,223.7",August,"19,",73,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is my favorite game of all time and an absolute MUST play if you're into immersive and realistic gameplay mechanics, like to sit back and unwind, and are looking for something to invest hundreds of hours in while never truly running out of things to do and ways to entertain yourself. The world of RDR2 is enormous, and as someone who is very picky and values rewarding and intriguing exploration that does not hold your hand I can wholeheartedly confirm this game  it. All of this is accompanied by a fantastic protagonist and moving story which continues to blow me away with every playthrough. The acting, storytelling and character development is top-notch.While no game is perfect, and Red Dead Redemption 2 being no exception, I still have very little to complain about. However, the in-game bounty system would be my biggest issue. It's often illogical, unpredictable and annoyingly punishing. You'll have to keep up with it and adjust yourself, as the system itself makes little sense. My second complaint would be the tracking down and hunting of Legendary Animals. There is zero challenge involved, unlike the tracking down and hunting of regular animals in the game, and will get stale quickly. Lastly, with a game this big, you are bound to run into bugs and glitches sooner or later. I have dealt with my fair share of annoyances over the course of 3 playthroughs and while I've been lucky to not run into anything game breaking there have definitely been plenty of frustrating moments that required me to reload an earlier savegame more than once. I recommend saving regularly, preferably after every mission­—just in case.Moving on to the PC port of this game, the 3 playthroughs I mentioned were completed on console. I am currently in the middle of my 4th playthrough, but first PC playthrough. I was skeptical about how the game would perform with the numerous complaints going around but the game, to my surprise, has been running well so far and performance seems to be exactly as it should be with my hardware. I have experienced a couple of crashes only when booting up the game after having changed settings or when changing settings on the in-game title screen. The game, at least on my end, seems to be sensitive to that. Once it loads into Story Mode, however, all is well and I haven't run into any issues thus far.There has only been one limiting factor regarding my setup which I'd like to mention briefly for anyone in the same situation and that is my GPU's small amount of VRAM. As the owner of a GTX 1060 3GB, Ultra texture quality in this game is out of the question during regular gameplay as that can take up 4 to 6 GBs of VRAM. I use Vulkan, which is more VRAM hungry than DX12 but also performs twice as well as DX12 so I stick with it. As a result, however, I'm experiencing frequent and at times severe pop-in of textures in big cities, small towns and even out in the wilderness with Texture quality set to High. I'm talking about entire buildings, mountains and roads popping in. Switching to DX12 eliminates the issue, but the drop in performance is even worse. I have experimented with dropping down textures further to Medium quality on Vulkan and while doing so significantly lessens the pop-in, it's  not fully eliminated.Unfortunately, the downgrade from Ultra textures to anything below that has a  impact on the overall look of the game. High texture quality is jarring, and Medium simply looks awful. It  makes me favor the console version of the game in terms of graphics despite having the majority of my other settings set to High, which far exceeds what you'll see on any current gen console. It's still not enough to make up for it, in my opinion.In conclusion? I do not recommend the PC version of the game if you've got less than 4GB of VRAM, at the very ,  especially if you've already played through the game once. Anything below Ultra texture quality will not look good, regardless of the rest of your settings."

(around 3 months before this review)Keep in mind before you read that this is a 80 ish hour singleplayer experience.The bug I am referencing is one that will crash the game in a seemingly random amount of time, could be 5 minutes or maybe an hour and a half  when you are lucky. I have experienced the issue on 2 different PC's. One bone stock laptop and 2 fresh installs on a high end custom build. Pretty soon I'm sure it will happen on a new build and will update when I put it together. I am running top percentile hardware specs on my main and maintain my systems meticulously. If you check the steam forums or reddit and sort by recent with a search for crash you will see that the exact same issue is affecting a large amount of people. I am very experienced with troubleshooting anything PC related, I have not been able to fix it even after spending a ridiculous amount of time trying literally 2 dozen or so fixes in multiple combinations. I would say that about 90% of the time I am able to fix a bugged game or put a bandaid on it with a significantly lower amount of time spent troubleshooting.Hours instead of days. Rockstar knows about this issue and fixed it before. They even have a special launch parameter that helped mitigate the issue back when it first popped up. I really hope they will fix it again but its been almost 3 months and I'm sure they are getting a large amount of support tickets regarding this error. Rockstar, you have done such an amazing job on this game and I would like to be able to reccommend it to my friends switching to PC from consoles this year. For those of us that already own it, please don't become  developer. Your number one priority is profit right which is fine, I can tell you that if you become  developer you will lose good will along with some of that profit you love next time you release a game on PC. I would say you made me waste more of my time writing this negative review, but if I help even one person then im fine with it.I will also update the review if and when its fixed and show people instead why its in my top 5."

If you can't grind the 40 gold to unlock it (which from stranger missions you can at best farm a little over 1 gold per hour doing) within the first week, then you will only get 30 gold back instead of the full 40.If you can't buy the pass at all within the time the pass is up, then you lose the ability to cook multiple food at once, fast travelling from your wilderness camp, and increased ammo storage capacity. Just a little extra here is my calculations for how much gold I could make from stranger missions (since I was greedy for the exclusive halloween event I spent my 15 gold I earned from the start on that and don't have any of the roles that cost 15 gold unlocked)-To maximize gold gains, every 3 minutes in the mission the gold you earn goes up by .08, optimally stopping at 12 minutes for .32 (after 12 minutes it goes up by .04)-suppose you can complete a mission for the .32 gold every 15 minutes (3 minutes of downtime for easier numbers, 4 minutes is more realistic)-then you can get .32 gold 4 times an hour, for 1.28 gold/h-to get 40 gold for the pass is 31 hours and 15 minutes of nonstop grind(I believe bounty hunting is the same numbers for gold, except maybe the downtime will be lower between missions)Each roll costs 15 gold (bounty hunter now technically 25 since they lowered base price to 10 and the extended license is 15) The pass costs 40Bounty hunter, Naturalist, Trader Collector, and the Outlaw Pass is 100 goldSo if you go 31.25 hours/40 gold = 78%, then 78% * 100 gold = 78 hours of grind to unlock it all.Or you can spend $40 on 2 of the $20 gold packs for 55 gold bars each to unlock all the current online$9.99   25   gold$19.99 55   gold$49.99 150 gold"

The best and greatest game of all time ...after GTA: San Andres in my opinion!In my opinion Rockstar games made gaming industry so important and a serious besinus! I remember when everybody ( not only gamers ) were talking about GTA3 and I remember every second of when GTA VC came out and I was playing it in my friend's house and when GTA SA came out and I was playing on my own PC! About haters:I don't understand why only R* gets hate while other developers what ever they do people only worship them ...that's why I hate internet it's about only hype and fooling people! Some people didn't notice RDR2 is prequel so they hate! (so no need to cry about RDR1) n00bs that say game is not optimized and they want to play on ultra with their potato PCs! ( yes game has a few bugs and crashes but not like haters say! and graphics is way better than console version !) (( it's funny when same people were so happy about the witcher 3 and none of them talked about downgrades ... they had only 1 major success for The witcher 3 I don't expect Cyberpunk 2077 to be so good like TW3! ..and fallout using same crap engine and....kojima makes a crap walking simulator .... EA/ubisoft make same crap games every year and only thing they get is love lol ...fake hype good luck to their fans ...i'm not a hater for those games I like them! I just said some facts...))About luncher every online game these days has a it's own luncher why biggest developer can't have one? I noticed some of my friends have problem with it while i don't have any problems! I guess i'm lucky or they don't know how to work with it :/ what ever it is I promise it's better than EA's origin (real cancer)About Gameplay :RDR2 uses all mechanics from GTA and Bully and Max Payne and other Rockstar games so it feels so good for R* fans! in another word It's more realistic than GTA without getting boring! ( but if you don't try to learn it you will be tired even with your horse LOL ) My story: Played RDR1 on my friend's PS3 while I was waiting for GTAV PC version and when RDR2 announced I bought a PS4 PRO only for this game ...and when game announced on PC i sold that crap console and bought a RTX 2080 for RDR2 only!I enjoyed every minute of my time play so yeah i'm gonna recommended this game to every wise person on steam! about online: R* focus never was on Online a small part of one of their studios is working on online so be patient with online bugs! it's completely playable and enjoyable and more free DLCs on the way so I recommended online too!Unlike GTA Online RDO is fun even when you play solo! with friends you can make money faster and pass missions easier! It has no cheating problem ... I guess people that say it has cheating problem they never played CS:GO LEL! I saw only a few cheaters and it was easy to get rid of them I just joined another season!About Red Dead Online golds! evey game these days that has a online should have a way to make money and it's Golds for RDR2! if you want everything in game you should buy golds and buy in game... or you should have brain and know what to do in game to earn golds and money! ( so ez while you enjoy the game you earn golds and money! )At the moment I have 420hrs time play in online and I own everything in online with 160 golds and 10k money that didn't decided what to do with them yet xD! ( why same people are excited about new half life VR ..are not talking about Valve that sells expensive skins and they talk about RDO golds!... think again you can buy skins and roles with golds only by playing game and time play and not too much like Rainbowsix crap to earn a operator! I bought RDO season pass called outlaw pass 2 in game when i had less than 100hrs! without spending 1 cent! ) all you have to do is play the game! you spend time you do something and then go reset awards it gives you golds! don't forget daily challenges! do  only one of them at least! don't kill your streak! it's best way to get golds! for money collector is the best if you like to travel whole the map solo... if you like hunting solo or with friends go for Trader! bounty hunter is real challenge and it gives good golds too and moonshiner has good and cool missions!Graphics ...it's more like a unreal engine DEMO ... best textures in open world games...  animations physics tessellation global illumination and .... are the best in 2020!Story is a long and amazing journey characters are the best unlike some movies and games like last of us it doesn't need black or g@y/les$bian characters to get any attention! 11/10 waiting for GTA VI - MP4 - Bully 2- LA Norie 2- .....

508,iRhuel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iRhuel/,255,26,0,294.1,March,"19,",565,34,1,"This review is specifically for the online component, there are plenty of reviews for the SP portion of the game.TL;DR - Red Dead Online is a tragic tale of a game that COULD have been great, but has been incrementally ruined on almost every level by a development strategy that prioritizes one and only one thing: getting players to spend more real world money. It's seen in every aspect of the game, and means it's generally not worth investing the time in to get to the worthwhile parts.---The game has several core problems, outlined below, but know that the game has 2 currencies - $RDO (ingame currency) and Gold (RMT currency, earnable ingame as well). Almost everything can be purchased with Gold, and some things can ONLY be purchased with Gold.Especially for new players. The only money making tool available to new players are daily challenges (which force you to do things you may or may not actually enjoy, like fishing, pvp, racing, photography, hunting, or visiting a random location with no other value), and stranger missions which generally involve going from A to B while fending off NPCs.All other moneymaking methods worth considering (bounty hunting, trading, moonshining, and rare item collecting) are locked behind Gold purchases.Almost all of the major moneymaking methods are time gatedAlmost every type of mission has some arbitrary time limit placed on it, which in the case of Strangers and BH, is completely independent of and always shorter than the hidden reward timer, requiring players to ""game the system"" in order to achieve the best reward.All of this points to a design philosophy of artificially extending playtime, seemingly without regard to players' time or enjoyment. It's as if Rockstar only measures engagement by time played, and the more they have of that, the more likely players will buy more Gold.The game has a plethora of bugs ranging from relatively minor to literally gamebreaking. Most of these have been in the game for quite a while (evidenced by the yr+ old reddit threads of people having the exact same issues), so it is clear that fixing them is not a priority for Rockstar. Here's a list of some off the top of my head:There are currently several hacks available for the game, ranging from teleportation of yourself and others, to autoaim, to invulnerability, to spawning invulnerable hostile NPCs, to instantly killing other PCs, to following other PCs between lobbies, to preventing other hackers from joining your lobby. I cannot tell you how many missions have been ruined because some hacker teleported me to a roof with everyone else in the lobby, across the map from where I'm supposed to turn in, making it impossible and causing the mission to fail.Some of these hackers are fairly benign, while others will target you to ruin your day for no reason at all. It's gotten to the point where some people in the discord communities have purchased hacks JUST to defend from these other hackers.At time of writing, Rockstar seemingly refuses to do anything about this other than a onetime ban wave some time ago. I assume this is because dealing with hacking doesn't directly make them any money.As mentioned earlier, Rockstar's development strategy is one focused on maximizing the time required to actually play the game, as evidence by a few features:The game is chock full of small taxes on your time. Every single action has an associated animation. This is initially immersive, but quickly becomes annoying when, for instance, it takes ~10 seconds to craft a single item and you're trying to craft dozens of items. The UI has more layers than a katyusha doll, and there's a transition animation between every single one of them. Most actually useful information is buried several layers deep.The Naturalist role has players sedating and collecting samples from animals in the RDO world and turning them over for a (pathetic) xp and $RDO reward. Unfortunately, this directly conflicts with the trader role which requires you to kill animals to fill your goods. The Naturalist NPC will refuse to interact with you for a set time after killing animals, making it impossible to sell your samples. What. Even.Despite being a multiplayer game, there are several impediments to playing together; most of them have to do with limiting moneymaking while in a party.There are currently NO train robberies, bank heists, or stage coach robberies. The game is generally missing banditry of any kind, in a game about cowboys and bandits.At this stage, it is fairly clear that RDO is in maintenance/money-wringing mode. The last two content updates (Naturalist at 25 Gold and Prestigious Bounty Hunter upgrade at another 15 Gold) were generally poorly received by the community for being either sparse or poorly thought out additions to the game. The majority of other updates have not been bug fixes or content refinements, but Gold-only cosmetics that are becoming increasingly cartoonish and immersion breaking, from straw beards to voodoo outfits to emotes and furry belt buckles. I'm honestly not sure who this was targeted at, but I have met no one yet who actually likes them.I would be (pleasantly) surprised if there was a major update with more and better content than the last drop... but it's looking unlikely.---The prevailing strategy seems to be to annoy players into buying Gold, but it ends up just annoying them into quitting the game. All in all, while there ARE enjoyable aspects to the game, they're buried under so much annoyance and bulls**t that I can't in good conscience recommend it to anyone."

Everything seems so incredibly tedious to do. I've tried a few Rockstar games in the past, and they've never latched on either though, so.Final Verdict: It doesn't have enough of today's Quality of Life mechanics to keep me interested.

The blatant anti consumer and predatory practices, content drought, neglect, refusal to fix issues in the game since launch, but extreme willingness to remove any sense of fun, progression, or achievement has ruined the game.Cutting daily rewards in half, forcing daily challenge streak resets, removing the ability to get all of your currency back with the pass, adding in a ""new"" Bounty Hunter extension, which is 15 gold for the literal exact same bounties, but with slightly more money (which is still the least profitable role out of all 5 professions.

This was the first RDR game I’ve played (and I’ve never played GTA so I think this is also my first Rockstar game).•	You can switch between first person and third person perspective whenever you want. First person helps with aiming guns and is very immersive while wandering around towns and talking to NPCs, whereas third person provides a better view of the environment while horse riding.•	The open world features a stunning environment to explore, with small towns and a big city full of people, surrounded by fields, trees, rivers and snowy mountains populated by lots of varied wildlife including deer, birds, rabbits, horses, bears, wolves, alligators and more.•	Side quests have their own mini-stories. There’s not many examples of the repetitive copy/pasted mission types that you usually find in open world games. Even bounty hunting missions where you can capture or kill outlaws and bring them back to a town sheriff for a reward, have some unique dialogue.•	As you’re riding around the map you’ll encounter other people who might ask for your help. Maybe their horse died and they need a ride back to town, or they’ve suffered a serious injury and need to be taken to a doctor, while other people are being attacked by dangerous animals. However, sometimes a cry for help will be luring you into an ambush.•	Story has great writing, high quality cinematic cutscenes, and excellent voice acting.•	Sometimes stories about criminals can make us root for them on some level, depending on the nature of their crimes. I didn’t feel that way about Arthur Morgan and his gang. I didn’t agree with most of their actions and I didn’t like most of the important characters. However, the second half of the story clearly showed the negative side of that lifestyle, which at least made the story interesting.•	The lengthy epilogue, which is focused on a couple of characters that I actually did like, has a much more positive tone, and was by far my favourite part of the story.•	Graphics still look fantastic compared to newer games. I had no problems with framerate, bugs or crashes.•	There’s lots of content. It took me 62 hours to complete the main story and most side quests.•	The weapon loadout system drives me crazy, and often made the combat less enjoyable than it could have been. You have 2 slots for pistols and 2 slots for rifles, shotguns, or a bow, however the game constantly unequips weapons from those last 2 slots, forcing you to re-equip them from your horse. I’m not sure exactly how it works, it seems to happen after cutscenes or when you return to camp, but I lost count of the number of times I was in the middle of a story mission and I suddenly realised all I’ve got is my pistols. And of course by that point I couldn’t return to my horse without restarting the mission.•	Sometimes even when I’d remembered to check my loadout, the game decided to change it anyway because I guess you’re supposed to use specific weapons for some missions. On more than one occasion I had to fight several enemies at long range, but the game took away my sniper rifle that I’d bought for exactly this purpose, forcing me to use a crappy lever action rifle with no zoom scope instead.Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t quite the masterpiece that its hyped up to be, but its still very good and I recommend playing it for the fantastic open world and cinematic story."

Missing out on this game for all of the other games on Steam is like visiting the Louvre, but not seeing the Mona Lisa. It's like going to Rome and never setting eyes on the Colosseum. Don't do that to yourself. Don't miss out on this absolute masterpiece of a game. Even if you didn't play the original Red Dead Redemption (or Red Dead Revolver), this game is worth your time and money. Since it's a prequel, there are no obvious spoilers for the earlier games, as everything that occurs in this installment sets up the original Red Dead's storyline. And if you *have* played the original Red Dead but not this installment, you really should! The best aspect of Red Dead Redemption 2, aside from the *phenomenal* storytelling, is the pace of gameplay. As the player, you can choose to speed through each story mission and still get a satisfactory ending. Or, you can spend hundreds of hours in the earliest chapters, hunting and fishing your way around the Old West frontier, growing a Grizzly Adams beard and collecting cigarette cards with pretty pictures on them. Want to drop a few hundred dollars in blackjack or poker, then get up and shoot your opponents in the head if you lose? This is the game for you.Red Dead Online has its fun moments as well, though if I'm being 100 percent honest, after a few hundred hours it can get a little repetitive and Rockstar hasn't added much to the online portion of the game in quite some time. However, the story mode alone is worth far more than the box price, so if you're looking for a great game, get this one."

525,Feuersturm,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048823683/,12,,1,57.7,September,"26,",70,0,1,"Steam wants to know if I would recommend this game to other players. Yes or no. I'll tell you what. I would recommend this interactive movie to others.RDR2 is on the surface so triple A, it's practically quadruple A. The first clue of this is when you look at the keyboard control layout and go ""AAAA!"". There's literally 50 binds you are supposed to assign, that will serve absolutely no purpose at any point. The game will keep you pressing different keys to do the same actions from start to finish, seemingly for no reason. In the very beginning you pick up items with one key, but pick up a hat with another. There is no rhyme or reason to it. Sometimes to simply perform an action you're supposed to press Enter, when a moment before it was another key or a mouse button. Is this a cunning plot to nudge players into using a gamepad instead, I don't know, but I wanted to use the trusty mouse+keyboard combo even if it meant having to deal with a convoluted to hell control scheme. Of course no one will ever need all the assigned keys and just having those fundamental things at hand works fine, and the mouse can be used to bypass things like having separate keys for turning pages left and right when browsing some weapon catalog... sheesh.But I have to admit - RDR2 is the most beautiful open world I've seen on the PC, possibly in any game for that matter. Even totally vanilla with no mods, the scenery is sometimes so gorgeous you will just have to admire the impeccable eye Rockstar has for crafting visuals. Once you reach Saint Denis for instance, the attention to detail, be it how every passerby is an individual or how the lighting and shadows are so true to reality, really captures your attention over and over again. The snowy visages are the best looking renditions of wintry landscapes I've ever seen as well and the way the snow glistens or how a lantern's glow bleeds over it is a sight to behold. Reminded me of Finland's winter nights for certain.Having this living, breathing wilderness around you is a thing of beauty, but Rockstar has chosen a very narrow path with their mission design. It works not unlike an interactive movie, where you play the action scenes. This was probably the biggest fault of the game. As soon as that marker is reached, the massive open world narrows to a footpath and the player is lead through the quest in a tight leash. The developers want you to experience the story the way they intended and the missions will allow practically no innovation or personal freedoms. Attempt to flank the enemy from the right? Mission failed, you abandoned the gang. Shoot a bad guy in the leg to stop him? Mission failed, target was killed. Grab a horse other than your own? Mission failed, you became wanted. Odd, considering you're a wanted man anyway. The scripted chase sequences have not changed. Often times Rockstar will even limit movement by disabling running and climbing during certain parts. Weapons will be disabled as well so that you don't dare do something stupid. It's an epic western on the outside, but you will find yourself reduced to a passive bystander all the time, holding down one key or tapping another to make the interactive cutscene keep playing forward. AAA title mission design, everybody. Most things that would work better under player control have been turned into essentially quicktime events, meaning you will play their fiddle and watch the events unfold. Having the option to switch weapons during firefights is the most of your own material you get to write in the story. Stray 50 feet from the designated path and Rockstar says no, screw you, you didn't play by our rules, back to previous checkpoint. Difficulty is no issue because the actual parts you need to play are beginner level shooting ranges and knowing how to move from point A to point B. Do I further need to explain why this game feels like a movie? I quit playing for 2-3 months because I didn't feel like it was worth watching, but came back with lesser expectations, knowing it was going to be a linear run with heavy emphasis on telling a story. And you know, as such, it works better.I think Rockstar has sacrificed a lot on the gameplay side to favor the hottest trend - a ""cinematic experience"". Some of the mechanics have suffered in the process. For example, why not allow the player to climb freely? Because it might look inappropriate? Why can't you run in the camp? That's not justified hero behavior? Why is the melee system an insensible few animation minigame when it could have been a fun way to showcase the abilities of the physics engine? Remember fights in GTA IV? That stuff was fun. In RDR2 you don't really want to beat anyone up because you end up watching the same motion captured stuntwork and then a falling ragdoll in the end. Why can't I lasso the bad guy during a chase when I'm right behind him? Why do bullets leave trails of smoke??It took some introspection but the game won me over ultimately. I think what matters most here is the visual presentation and insane amount of production value. The rest, well, maybe it's just meant to be experienced."
526,θανεσεστερεοφων,https://steamcommunity.com/id/deaathbysterreo/,16,,1,865.8,June,"29,",692,0,1,"Like any good prequel, there's an incredible amount of tension in knowing what happens without knowing exactly how. If you played Red Dead Redemption, you know who survives and as a result who probably won't make it to the end of the game. Even during the slower parts, you're waiting for betrayals and injuries and other events you've only vaguely heard mention of before. You're waiting for characters to reveal their true selves, and watching as everything unravels is riveting and heartbreaking if you know what's to come.You can still enjoy the story in its own right without that background knowledge, though. Some of Red Dead Redemption 2's best moments have almost no relation to its predecessor. One mission takes you to a women's suffrage rally, and a painful side mission has you facing a woman whose husband you killed and life you ruined. The new characters are among the best, too; Sadie Adler is a personal favorite for reasons I won't spoil.Generally, Red Dead 2 tackles pertinent issues of the era with care. Rather than defining any of its characters by the bigotry they may experience, it allows them the room to be well-rounded individuals while still not ignoring that things like racism and sexism exist. One arc focuses squarely on a very serious issue, and here, the lack of real choice in the story's direction--and your resulting involvement in what transpires--will likely make you uncomfortable in a powerful way.While Red Dead Redemption was mostly focused on John Marston's story, Red Dead 2 is about the entire Van der Linde gang--as a community, as an idea, and as the death rattle of the Wild West. It is about Arthur, too, but as the lens through which you view the gang, his very personal, very messy story supports a larger tale. Some frustrating systems and a predictable mission structure end up serving that story well, though it does take patience to get through them and understand why. Red Dead Redemption 2 is an excellent prequel, but it's also an emotional, thought-provoking story in its own right, AND IT'S A WORLD THATIS HARD TO LEAVE WHEN IT'S DONE."

Buy it for console if you are playing RDO. If you are only going to play single player and never touch Multiplayer then it's a fantastic game. The graphics are amazing and the game runs great and Ididn't run into any problems as far as glitches or bugs in Singleplayer and I had some of the most fun playing a game I've had in a long time while following the story of Arthur Morgan and the gang. Multiplayer on the other hand is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ show and a complete waste of money, time and hardrive space, not because Multiplayer has bad content or nothing to do but because you will not even be able to play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Apparently modders and script kiddies have free reign over the RDO servers and will continually grief you until you either uninstall the game or throw your monitor out the window. In my first hour of RDO alone I ran into at least 1-3 modders per session that I joined, in the midst of the constant dynamite arrows randomly spawning on you from across the map and continually murdering me I was also teleported across the map to some location in the middle of the snow over and over again with one of these teleports occurring in the middle of a timed starter mission, well I failed the mission and it seemed to break the game because my camp was no longer anywhere to be found and unable to be moved. Once i finally loaded into a session where i could get to my camp I was greeted by another modder who proceeded to somehow lower the safety flag of my camp allowing him to keep griefing me in my own camp. In roughly the hour all of this happened I realized that somehow all of my $1000 in-game starter cash had randomly disappeared and i was left with nothing. Tried playing multiplayer for days after but continually ran into modders in every session with no end. With more research i found out that these ""hackers"" are breaching your game files through RDO to access private & personal info on your PC as well as modders and script kiddies easily deleting any cash you've earned in a game session. Your p2w gold will be safe but cash is free game.  Oh and Steam wont refund you for ""Multiplayer not working"" or any other reason if you have over two hours in the STORY mode regardless of all these known issues making the game completely unplayable as far as online at most times and basically taking half of the game away because its such a mess of problem trying to get anything done in RDO when you're being griefed and harrassed literally every 1-2 minutes.If you want to play multiplayer do yourself a favor and save money and time and just buy it for xbox or playstation because at least Rockstar somewhat gives a ♥♥♥♥ about their servers for those platforms, been playing on XBL and haven't ran into a single previously noted issue in any of my game sessions."

Your horse always spawns behind you and never catches up, so you'll just waste time running or waiting, unless you do the quick U-turn to call em.The roam quick missions are overrun with Chinese hackers. On the bright side, if the mission isn't about killing everyone, they won't understand what to do and you'll be able to win. If it is about killing, you're just going to waste 15 minutes getting snap-on headshotted over and over by the Chinese hackers. (Possibly Korean, i shut off public voice chat after all the Chinese ear raping that i received every time i was near them)All the real fun stuff is stuck behind a soft pay-wall. I.e. you need the premium currency ""gold bars"" to purchase roles for more money and missions. Most missions give somewhere between 0.08 to 0.2, and you'll need 15-25 per role unlock and etc. Or you can drop some real $ to get the gold bars, on a game that already costs 80CAD. Yeah, not happening.Levelling is silly slow, same with earning money to get anything done. Best way is the drop in missions, treasure maps, or stranger missions. Do those in-between your long excursions of searching the swamp for feathers and gator skins. Hopefully you get $50+ for one hunting run, but you'll need several to purchase guns. Ammo is dirt cheap.Lots of bugs and random crashes as well.I'll probably shelf this game in the near future and come back to it later like i did with GTA5.

Can blow you up or teleport to you and shoot you. Literally only place you're safe is in an instanced game OR while talking to a shopkeeper. Spawning animals kills you even if you're in your camp with white flag raised. They are a true plague on what could be a fun game. They need to be region locked out because this is just pathetic. The exact same hacks as in GTA5 are happening here and they all use the local voice chat to spam chinese/korean (so far that's all i've heard clearly) with horribly broken english trying to troll you and provoke you.That all taken with the fact that changing sessions is buggy as hell... You're screwed. 7 Attempts to join my friend's instance recently, all failed. Game crashes maybe 1/2 the time i try to load into a new session from another. Hardware issue, maybe? My friends on better rigs report similar issues and therefore I doubt it is hardware.DO NOT BUY UNTIL HACKER ISSUE RESOLVED (was it ever resolved in GTA5, or did they just get bored?)25 May 2020I have shelfed the game. No point in doing virtually the same missions 50 times just to get up a level and do them again. I'll come back if China gets region locked or anti-cheat software that actually works gets added. I might come back if they add more content, though it's unclear because why bother if you'll just have to deal with the feeble-minded people that hack?"

It's just a shame that a few bugs, flawed honor system, flawed crime reporting, and shorter story than the first game prevent  from being perfect in spite of improvements in other areas.Does a AAA game that's a few years old really need a review? Ol' Il Pallino has his gripes and the founder of  needs more reviews, so may as well! The people who need a description of  are the same people who will never read this review. Set in 1899 (roughly twelve years before the first ) the story of the Van der Linde Gang starts with main character Arthur Morgan as the only lieutenant to Dutch Van der Linde who takes his gang through a misadventure through multiple (and mostly new) states in hopes of being able to pull off that one perfect heist so everyone in the gang can retire from their life of crime. Of course with the contents of the first , it's pretty obvious that the Van der Linde Gang never comes close to this accomplishment. About the only real unexpected surprises are the stranger missions and new features.Normally this category wouldn't apply to a AAA game, but it is unforgivable for a game with such a high budget to have floating rocks encountered (albeit infrequently) along with the occasional floating character.However,  does have a really cool graphical effect that sometimes occurs in shootouts, and usually whenever headshots are scored.The sounds, however, were faultless, and the game's soundtrack was perfect for the late 19'th. century with a score of original music. (One song was even performed by Willie Nelson.)The biggest positive to  is that the game is a dramatic improvement over the first game on account of the improvement to horses. Horses have four levels of bonding (five if level zero is included) and increases in levels unlocks horse skills and increases health (hit points) and stamina. Horses can have their looks customized, and new saddles can not only be purchased, but new saddles can also be crafted by trappers located on various parts of the map. (More on that in a minute.)  On the downside, horses can now be spooked by predators, and there's a chance that a horse (especially at a lower bonding level) will buck the player off and leave them to deal with a predator whom the player will hopefully have enough time to activate deadeye and put a bullet in it's head.Unlike the outfit ensembles in , the player has the ability to truly customize the outfits of the main character in the event they see something they'd like to mix and match with clothes that can be bought from tailors and general stores, along with clothes that can be unlocked at a trapper's shop by selling snakeskins, hides, pelts, and feathers to a trapper. The best saddles in the game can also be purchased at a trapper's shop.Deadeye has also been improved with one new level of deadeye allowing the player to shoot and remain in deadeye without painting any targets, which is particularly useful in the event the player is using a sniper rifle.The concept of animals needing to be taken down with a specific type of weapon makes hunting more interesting than the first game, and makes all the difference between good and perfect condition. (With enough overkill, an animal or snake carcass can drop from perfect to poor condition.) The game also introduces a bow and arrows, and specialty arrows can be crafted and used to kill game in one shot (if aimed perfectly) and keep it's condition perfect.Also on the issue of hunting, players do not have to skin what they killed for the most part. If the player wants to have more food (at the expense of sacrificing it's outer layer or feathers) for either themselves or their camp, an intact animal carcass can be stowed on a horse. (Animal carcasses can also be sold to butchers and trappers.) In fact, several decorations can be crafted at the camp require an entire carcass.Fishing has also been added to the game, and is a nice activity to engage in to help add variety to whenever the player doesn't wanna do story missions, go hunting, complete challenges, or whatever. Apart from being a food source, fish meat that's classified as  can be used with berries to make  that can either be used to attract perfect quality predators or sold for money. While it is advised to catch fish with the fishing rod that unlocks fairly early into the story, ol' Il Pallino caught his first fish by shooting at it. (Fish can also be ""caught"" by throwing dynamite into a body of water.)Weapons can now be customized in a plethora of ways. Some ways are useful in that they make weapons function better and degrade slower, but most are purely aesthetic.The biggest negative is that the honor system is flawed and does not recognize acts of self-defense. While honor can be built easily enough by greeting everyone in the game's biggest city (along with catching and returning fishes) it is annoying to have people shooting at you and lose honor because you killed them in retaliation. Plenty of members of the rival O'Driscoll Gang can be encountered in the town of Valentine, and a few times ol' Il Pallino managed to get a bounty for getting into a non-lethal fight with some of those jackwagons. Unlike other criminal organizations, people strangely care if they see the player looting an O'Driscoll and can expect a bounty just for making an encounter worth their while if said encounter is in the Valentine area.While not affecting honor directly, ol' Il Pallino saw some game to shoot at in the outskirts of Emerald Ranch, and a freakin' dog attacked him. Again, self-defense wasn't recognized when the dog instigated a kill or be killed situation.While complaining about aesthetics, it may be unfair to complain that Arthur Morgan's (plain) default hat always takes up an inventory slot on the horse, and cannot be changed. Hat accessories to Arthur's hat also count as an entirely different hat, but this is problematic since ol' Il Pallino's favorite hat is not Arthur's default hat!Rockstar Games has been making games featuring Blackjack since 2004, and *STILL* do not treat a ten to be any different from a face card in regards to hitting a blackjack. (This works out if it's the player who hit an ace and a ten, but the dealer can also get blackjack with a ten instead of a face card.)There are bugs that are game-breaking. Ol' Il Pallino has a friend who's experience was ruined by bugs, but the only game-breaking bug that was encountered personally was once getting accidentally stuck on a stagecoach and needed to quit just to get unstuck. (An inexcusable bug for so much as a tiny indie game.)Fun fact: If the player steals a wagon transporting oil, they can sell it for $50 instead of the usual $40.This review provided independently by .No compensation was provided.Email contact@dnbmedia.co for requests & promotions."

It should be taught as lesson on how an open world game should be made, from the massive natural landscape to the towns full of life and to the way the random encounters/side activities plays out, which are presented in such an organic way that it creates a strong immersive atmosphere in which you can easily lose yourself. It offers a great freedom of exploration that often makes you take a sudden turn to a distant landmark while riding to your objective, just to see the view from there, and it does not disappoint because needless to say this game is stunning to look at. As for the narrative of the game, there is really little else to say except that it's truly beautiful, exciting and heartbreaking in so many ways.

576,LordGandhii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/,68,5,1,52.0,May,"11,",771,5,1,"While all critically acclaimed games are well-regarded for a reason, I never really understood why  was praised as much as it was. To me, it looked like your run-of-the-mill open world game. Once I realized I was stuck inside, I knew that I had to finally give this a game a shot. And I'm glad I did, because I was really missing out.I don't think it's a stretch to say that  is the best looking game on the market right now. While open world games, especially ones as densely packed as this one, are prone to having messy textures, everything in this game looks insanely crisp. It's a remarkable technical achievement, and I'd say it's one of the few games over the years that has left me genuinely awestruck in how beautiful it is. On top of this, RDR2's other big visual strength lies in its presentation. The story is compelling, but there's definitely some moments where the game doesn't have much going on, and while these parts should be boring, they're saved by the presentation. You really feel like you're in a western film, and the cinematic camera helps add to this feeling. A lot of games that lean on being realistic end up sacrificing style as a result, however Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the very rare examples of a game that still establishes its own style and identity while placing an emphasis on realism, and in that regard, makes the graphics arguably the game's biggest strength. But, thankfully, it isn't the only strength.While this game has a lot of things going for it, unfortunately what holds this game back is definitely the gameplay. The first big criticism, of course, are the controls. They're messy, confusing, and outright unresponsive at certain points. While I did somewhat adjust to the controls as I played more of the game, there were points where the controls were so unbelievably janky that killed my immersion. However, this jank doesn't really affect the gunplay, which is a good thing because there are way too many massive shootouts in this game. I found the game was at its best when you had the smaller, mundane tasks with the occasional combat segment and full-town shootouts on rare occasions. However, as the story progressed, every mission began to follow the same structure of having you mow down hordes on top of hordes of enemies. The epilogue helped dial the game back a little bit, but even then it was still prone to having these massive shootouts a tad bit too frequently for my liking. But worst of all, these issues as well as the game being open-world create the game's biggest flaw in my eyes: the massive dissonance between story and gameplay. Just from exploring the world a little bit, I had around $4000 by the time the story ended, and that was after getting all of the camp upgrades and spending tons of money on new outfits, horse items, and customizing every single one of my weapons. Therefore, the constant stream of ""WE NEED MONEY"" and the desperation the story tries to create gets undermined when the answer to all of the gang's problems lies in my pocket. It got annoying and eventually I lost interest in exploring the open world, which sucks because the world is full of so many cool things to see and do that I'm considering starting a second playthrough just to find more of them. But the game wants to be linear, and so the game's incredible open world and compelling story collide into each other head-on, and both get tarnished as a result. Is the gameplay outright bad? No, because it's still quite fun to play and has plenty going for it. However, it still conflicts with the rest of the game, and ultimately does a lot of harm to the overall package.But that's enough negativity. Like I've already said a few times now, the game's story is amazing. Arthur Morgan is one of gaming's best protagonists of all time, and how they handled him in this game was absolutely perfect. He has an incredible amount of depth and leaves plenty open to interpretation, and he grows right alongside the player. While John is also a great character in his own right, Arthur single-handedly bumps up the game a few notches for me. But he's not the only standout here, as characters like Dutch, Micah, and Charles all excel at their roles in the story as well. I do wish some of the characters like Javier, Mary-Beth, and Karen got more screentime, though, as they were enjoyable characters in their own right. Some people argue the main plot is too predictable, but I think the game actually used this in its favor. Especially when it came to a major reveal close to the game's end, I think the idea was to give you some extra motivation for the final mission, and fleshed out some of the characters in the process. I wasn't fond of one major segment of the game as it exemplified a lot of the game's main issues, but it ended quicker than I thought it would so it didn't bother me too much. Otherwise, it's a slow burn that hooks you more and more as it progresses, and the game's amazing presentation and world help keep you occupied during the moments that aren't as engaging. There's a lot more I could talk about here, but that's a discussion for another day. What's relevant here is that the story is amazing outside of some smaller issues, and is another high point for the game.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the music. Outside of some of the major vocal tracks (which are excellent), I wouldn't say most of them were particularly noteworthy, but they blended in with the game's world and tone perfectly. The sound design is also excellent here, as everything sounds incredibly crisp and satisfying. However, the real star of the show here is the voice acting. Roger Clark absolutely nails Arthur, and helps provide a subtle layer to the character that couldn't be conveyed through text. Another standout is Benjamin Byron Davis as Dutch, whose charisma really helped me understand how Dutch could be as revered of a figure as he was, and he manages to keep you hooked on every word that comes out of his mouth. The voice acting is some of the best in a very long time, if ever, and really helps sell the western feel of the game. And with the music and sound design blending together perfectly, the audio continues to prove the game's remarkably high quality.Gameplay/story disconnect aside, the open world is absolutely phenomenal. There's a ton of different side activities, like fishing, hunting, and playing poker to keep things interesting in ways that aren't just shootouts. There's also lots of cool little interactions in the world, and while you don't get rewarded much in terms of loot, the experience of seeing them is worth it alone. On top of a densely-packed single-player, there's also an online mode. I have no intentions of playing it, but it's like eating a pizza with too many toppings on it. Even if you ignore eating some of the toppings, the pizza's still delicious. You'll get a ton of value just from the game's world alone, and the engaging story and additional online mode merely serve as supplements for the incredible world. To conclude,  is a remarkable achievement in almost every way. The gameplay does hold it back, but it's the only blemish on an otherwise incredible game. If you have the time and money, then I have to insist that you give it a shot. - 10/10 - 5.5/10 - 10/10 - 9.5/10 - 10/10+ Amazing protagonist+ Beautiful graphics+ Engaging story+ Strong presentation+ Outstanding voice acting+ Detailed open world- Gameplay/story dissonance- Messy controls- Repetitive missions"

Breathtaking story, living open world with lots of things to explore, mysteries to unravel, activities to participate. If you're looking for an open-world shooter action with guns and cowboys, this game's singleplayer will leave you more than satisfied.The reason for my disappointment in this game is Rockstar's greedy attitude towards their online projects. I have somewhat about 500 hours in GTA V, most of wich comes from the GTA Online and after many years passed from PC release of the title, Rockstar haven't or didn't want to learn from their mistakes.Red Dead Online faces same issues as GTA Online did. Bugs and glitches aren't getting fixed, if they don't help you to get money. Rockstar selectively fixes bugs that allow for easier in-game income, while ignoring any gamebreaking glithes that may occure during the missions or open-world exploration.All they care about is making players buy in-game currency for real money. This would've been understandable if they tried to make more profit while fixing issues existing in the game, but they're not.Just wait for them to add horses with homing missiles and jet-engines up their arses. GTA Online: Wild West.edit: since they've made RDO stand-alone game, I change my review to positive.

However, for red dead redemption 2, I struggle to find any reason why it's NOT objectively the best single-player game of all time.Its story may not be an intricate plot but it's full of small, nuanced displays of emotions and life-like dialogue that pulls you into the world and sometimes forget that these are virtual characters. It's by far better than most Hollywood films, tv-series and dare I say should be up there with some of the great tv shows if it could be classified as one.The gameplay is equally amazing with npcs feeling life like amazing random events, amazing side quests, and a robust selection of guns, outfits, animals etc.I really struggle to find any negative to this game other than the slow start to the game. To me, it's necessary to have that slow start as good pacing but I can see how the slow start might put off people from the game entirely. Anybody that says red dead 2 is a bad game either never completed it or is just trying to be different and go against the wind.  Red dead 2 is a masterpiece. Even after 2 years since I finished it, I still remember its story vividly and without hesitation say its the best game I've played if someone asks me that question."

It turned out to be one of the worst PC gaming experiences in my life. When I launched the game the first time it installed Rockstar Social Club launcher and I had an accout already so I logged on and then the launcher said I had to switch to a very old account I completely forgot I had. The problem is that the old account is linked to an email I don't have anymore (it's a very old account) so I can't access it and the launcher won't let me start the game with the newer account which is atleast a few years old.Good job Rockstar! How can you mess up a launcher to the extent where it won't let you start the game you want to play and why do I have to use your stupid launcher when I buy it on Steam. I tried searching for a solution to this problem but couldn't find an answer anywhere. Until Rockstar either fix their stupid launcher or even better remove it completely and just let me play using Steam I guess I'll never buy a Rockstar game on PC again.Steam refunded me for the game so I want to give a big thumbs up to Steam. Thank you Steam!(I usually never write reviews but this experience was so bad I want to warn other people.)

This isn't one of those one-sentence reviews.I regret to say that I cannot recommend anyone to buy Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC in it's current state. This comes from a variety of reasons, which have led me to request a refund of the game.To start with, upon installing the game I encountered immediate crashing (before even getting to the main menu) every time I launched the game. After trying many forum fixed to no avail, I decided to contact Rockstar support. I spent a few days trying to get a hold of Rockstar support on their website (a confusing badly-made mess of a system), and eventually managed to get in-contact with someone.I spent around 7 hours talking to Rockstar support in a live chat attempting to fix the crashing, and all they did was (unnecessarily) walking me through steps in an attempt to fix the crashes. They had me update drivers, change launch options, run things as administrator, UNINSTALL MY ANTIVIRUS (I refused to do this), and numerous more pointless tasks.After getting to the point where I was about to give up and simply refund the game, I ended up managing to fix my issue by actually reading the files they were having me change. It took me less than 5 minutes to read, comprehend, and fix my issue. I find it ironic how I fixed the issue so quickly (once knowing what to look at) while the support were seemingly messing around with me. Not only did I spend an extended period of time with support talking to them in the live chat, I also had to actively wait well over a total of 4 hours on my computer to even be assigned to a support agent.The live chat system that Rockstar presents is one that demands the user stay at their computer awaiting assignment to a support member. If you don't reply to the support staffs message soon after they send it, the chat is closed and you are forced to wait another hour or more to open it again. For the first chat I opened, I had to wait a hour and a half before reaching a person.At this point I managed to actually get into the game, which at the time seemed like a blessing. I spent about a hour actively changing the graphics settings in the game to attempt to get a reasonable FPS in the game. No matter how low I set my graphics settings, my FPS struggled to get over 40; I was getting frustrated. Some may automatically assume that my hardware is not good enough for this game, but this is easily dis-proven by taking a quick look at the other games I actively play in my Steam library, most of which I have on near-maximum graphics settings.Overall, it's extremely hard for me to put a negative review on this game, and especially to request a refund for it. The original Red Dead Redemption remains one of my favorite games of all time, and I still go back to play through it once in a while. I really wish I could play this game, but the state that it's in and Rockstar support have made it un-playable for me. If after reading this you do still decide to purchase Red Dead Redemption 2, I sincerely hope you have a better experience with it than me."

Aside the fact it took me a year to get the game working on my PC after a complete rebuild, and Rock Star's crappy REQUIRED third-party system, I did manage to get it to work.But I am continuing to give this a negative review.I pumped about 50 hours into the game.  I log back in one night (tonight) to play some games and about 30+ hours of gaemplay vanished.  Just all of it is gone, and I don't have it in me to continue playing this game or trying anymore.This is just a terrible PC port and I don't recommend it on PC.Old review:Bought this game maybe 6 months ago but had issues with Social Club, so I refunded it.Tried again last night, same thing.I keep having problems with Steam connecting to Rockstar's Social Club. >Buy game>Download game>Launch>Sorry, you need to download Social Club>k, I download it>You need to make an account with Social Club>k, I make an account>Sorry, but that email address is linked to a different Steam account>huh?  k, lemme check brb>nope, it's the same email>Re launch>Sorry, but that email address is linked to a different Steam account>*randomly gets emails from Rockstar in all Russian*I am in the middle of my second refund.  I have never played this game and I really want to, but it literally will not let me.  That said, I have no choice but to down vote this as a Steam game.  You can likely just buy it direvtly through Social Club - that said, just buy it and play directly through Rockstar's system."

However...After an entire week of negotiating the borderline useless Rockstar support, the damn game only launches after making an completely new windows account. Meaning I have to log in to windows as a separate user every time I want to play. Apparently that was a satisfactory outcome for Rockstar. The sheer number of hoops I've had to jump through trying to reset profiles, doing system scans, editing registry permissions and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, coupled with a complete lack of error code details on Rockstar's behalf. It just boggles the mind.I cannot in good conscience recommend this, simply because of the terrible, broken and frankly (for single player) unnecessary launcher and Rockstar's cavalier and negligent attitude towards improving or fixing it."

Rockstar is not showing the required attention to the problem of cheating in both rdr2 and gta5. Both games are time and time again rendered unplayable by its toxic and childish community of wannabe hackers. At this point Rockstar should put a disclaimer at the start of their games stating that ruining the fun for other players wouldn't make a person ""hacker"".

Glad other users on here have seen this, since pro journos can't be trusted.Gameplay:First person really doesn't work well. Difficulty is laughable, even playing in first person with all aim assist turned on. Enemies take multiple hits, and you are a tank. There's lots of standing in the open and shooting at each other from 10 feet away, out of cover, shaving off health with multiple shots. Basically gives everything a very low energy, low pressure feeling even with all assists turned off, so that you feel no excitement. The whole experience just feels like a chore. Free aim is terribly clunky, and hit detection is something they still haven't got the hang of without lock on turned on. I'm a very mediocre gamer, and this was one of the easiest game I've played, and not in a good way. Enemies are identical in behavior and armament, and don't behave organically enough to justify the sameness on the grounds of ""realism"". Last but not least, a lot of boring riding through the same forested landscape. Its wants to be the Witcher but lacks the beauty, variety, and depth of the countryside. It also can't get off its own shaft, and constantly make you ride the same area and pause so the developers can jerk themselves and make you look at their masterpiece. Never though, did I have organic moment like in other games where I stopped to admire.Story:Bad. But I have a much higher bar for stories than most people, while my gameplay bar is about average. Still if you like HBO stuff more than say FOX or NBC, the story will disappoint. It's the same tragic tale as last time, with very inconsistently written characters. The dialogue is great in some cases, but the overall story is very lacking. The biggest issue is the attempt to paint Arthur as the good guy, vs just a likeable bad guy.When you murder 700 law abiding government officials, its hard to portray the guy as a classic hero, but try they do. To make it doable, the employ the laziest method ever, which is to make everyone else racist, and Arthur and his gang of barely literate horse thieves and prostitute feminists and equality centric. Why is it okay that Arthur is killing trains full of 18 year US Army personal just doing a job? Oh, because they are, every one of them racists, so now Arthur the murdering thieve is a nice guy do-gooder. Dumb + lazy writing. Makes me wish for Niko again. Didn't pretend to be a good guy any more than Scarface, so when he thinned out the ranks of the NYPD, it still made sense.Value for money:Low. They claim like 200 hours in bonus activity, but this isn't the case. You end the game with tons of money, with nothing in the game world to spend it on. Even if you did have something worth buying, you wouldn't be able to make it. All side activities pay very poorly. Robbing a store (banks are not robbable???) pays 30$, meanwhile the bounty you'll rack up escaping will be a minimum of 400$ bounty if you want to have any fun, and you can lose thousands if you die. Bounties pay nothing, like 80$ on average, and hunting fishing is boring (somehow the only viable option is with a bow, and you there are so many animals you can just ride up to them and dead eye, making it pointless to go looking) and pays very little. Stick ups pay 50 cents, and always go the same way. Poker games are limited to 5$, also making them pointless. I think the reason the post game feels so dead is to force people into online."

635,B,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bsc01451m5423423brhkcr/,16,,0,823.4,February,"21,",160,0,1,"For starters, if you like open world games, beautiful scenery to take in, character customization (not the best, but it suffices), and have a soft spot for historic games, this might be the game for you. The attention to detail is fairly impressive, to give some examples, you get bloodied and dirtied on specific parts depending on what you did, such as on the hands after skinning an animal, on the shoulders if you carry a skinned beast, mud on the side you fell from your horse and so on, not only that, people on the street comment and have different treatment towards you about it, the singleplayer character's hair and beard grow over time, shop owners' comments change depending how recently you visited them and more, so, among other things, praise on this aspect is well deserved. The combat is ok, featuring decent gunplay, wall/object cover, gruesome melee that makes you feel the impact of hitting your enemies, different animations depending which weapon you have on your hand when grabbing someone, having to click again when using repeating guns, a lasso and other tools that are very fun to use on animals and people, all make it overall enjoyable, the only con, besides the ones in the following section, though i'm probably biased thanks to playing some shooters where every shot is lethal, is that some enemies take too many shots to die if you don't aim for the head/neck, granted it's not as bad as some other stuff out there. The sounds of the game are overall pretty good, it's nice to just stop and hear the scenery around you whether you're in a farm, a city or the wilds, the animals, gun sounds are alright too. The soundtrack puts a nice touch, it heightens every moment well, whether it's a relaxing or intense one, though it's not something i plan on stopping to listen to when not playing. Overall the ambience is nice and the game provides good decent immersion.Now that i'm done talking about the things i think are nice, i'm gonna talk about its shortcomings related mainly to multiplayer, which i play more than singleplayer, and is the main reason i'm on this game for.The bugs/glitches are the ultimate reason that led me to giving this game a negative review, and quite honestly, given the relatively extense list of positives, even if you expect it as a standard of an AAA title, they have to really be bad to outweigh the positives, and it turns out to me that they are. For the price this game has, the ammount of issues on this aspect is subpar to what it should have been, actually, just saying that feels like an understatement, i normally don't write game reviews, but i reached a level of frustration that made me want to use the time i normally would be in-game and write this. Now onto examples:- The absolutely most aggravating issue, is the fact that sometimes you get stuck on infinite loading screens. This can happen on the most unfortunate times - just before i was writing this review i had finished doing a mission that took around 20 minutes, the cutscene ends, and a load starts, i cross my fingers per usual, because every loading screen feels like a russian roulette where  out of 6 rounds are loaded, after it took too long, leading me to wait over 5 minutes, i realized, ""yep it's bugged again"" and had to press Alt + F4, effectivelly nullifying all my effort and time i spent doing that job in the game. Thanks to other bugs i'll mention below, you're forced to go through loading screens more which only adds up to the problem.- Randomly losing connection to the game servers, it doesn't matter how good your internet is, you will still get disconnected at some point from the game, it may be now, it may be in 2 hours or more, it can also happen so much you give up on playing that day, it'll happen, and just like the previously mentioned bug, it may happen on unfortunate times where you're in the middle of something, which can upset you. Now imagine you're in the middle of a mission, the game disconnects you, taking back to the menu. You try to join a new session, then you have to load...and load, and you get the infinite loading glitch, thus making you waste even more time and have to alt f4 again. It happened to me, my friends and a bunch of other people i'm sure.- Sometimes your horse, which you spend more time on than on foot, and is the main transportation method on the game, straight up gets stuck, you hop on it and it doesn't move, sometimes you can try things and it'll work to restore it, specially getting a friend on the horse, sometimes it doesn't and you're left there on foot, sometimes you have to restart the session... and have to  the game again, do you see where i'm going? Maybe have to reboot the game again if you get the infinite load bug.- In the game there is a role called trader, which is a job that utilizes a table on your camp to start its missions and retrieve animals that are used as resources for it, so here i went to hunt good quality animals to bring to my camp, i set my path back to camp after being done, reach its location, and the camp is not there, even if the icon on the map tells me it is. This makes me unable to deliver the resources bogging me down. I open the camp menu and try to relocate the camp, it doesn't work, so this made all the hunting i did be pointless, because the only way to fix it, is swapping session again. Not in the mood to do it, i gave away the animals to another player hunting near me and decided to do missions from another job. I get there, interact with a door to get in (most places don't need loading screens to get in btw, but this one does) and...- Sometimes interacting with things straight up doesn't work, continuing from above i couldn't get in the estabilishment to conduct a completely different activity from what i was doing because it was bugged. Long story short, i had to reset the game post infinite load bug after trying new session because i couldn't do both of the options i felt like at the time.So yeah, those are the main bugs i remember on top of my head because they're the most aggravating ones, the game seems to be worse on peak hours also, which is the only time some people have to play. Some days are better than others. I've experienced other bugs and if this doesn't convince you this will be a frustrating experience, i don't know what will. My other complaint is that the online economy is pretty grindy, so if you don't have a lot of time to play, expect the rewards and wealthy part of the game to come in slow, granted it's worse in the beginning than when you have more hours put in and have more resources.Saw some people complain about poor optimization but it runs mostly smoothly FPS wise for me.Sometimes the game crashes, but it's rare on my end.I still play the game despite everything, call me crazy, but the good part of the game is still there but it's mostly because there's no other game i feel like playing right now. My advice is for you to  don't buy the game just yet, me and i'm sure a lot of the player base are looking forward for this stuff being fixed, in some time it'll be cheaper and hopefully with less bugs. If the bugs never get dealt with i'll probably ditch this game.Hopefully this review helped you, cheers :)"

Absolutely amazing work and effort put in by Rockstar Games.The game's graphics are absolutely spectacular, especially when you finish the first chapter of the game. The lighting and fog effects are unbelievably good. The god ray effects in forests are realistic. Nighttime lighting is realistic as the moonlight spreads over the whole area instead of being a light in the sky. Character clothes have great attention to detail, along with the fur on animals, and mud effects in towns.The gameplay can be a bit of a slow burn at the start, but once the first chapter is done, the gameplay becomes less restricting, and continues to do so as you progress forward. The gameplay is also very realistic as you have to maintain your guns to keep them working effectively (they can jam if you don't) and you also have to bathe regularly to keep yourself clean, eat regularly to keep your weight in check and also yo You also have to feed your horse regularly so they don't starve. All this may be confusing at first, and may be tedious to some, but you'll figure it out once you start playing the game.The story is possibly one of the best ones in videogames. rest assured, if you pay attention to the story, you will enjoy the game to its fullest. Coming to the other thing, side missions are often humorous and enjoyable, and are usually as good as the main story. Make sure to do side quests around the same pace as the main missionsI could go on and on but I'll just let you experience the rest. It is a 10/10 game made by the legendary company Rockstar Games, so rest assured, it's worth every single penny."

I play in bursts and love what the game is.I don't recommend the game however because of what the profoundly incompetent nimrods at Rockstar have done with it. The online content is not only now dead but was always atrocious and plagued by cheaters, not something new to Rockstar online games but really seems to be bad in this one. It also will not be receiving any further content updates so Rockstar can focus on GTA6 (which if we're honest is the only franchise they actually care about anymore). The final nail in the coffin for me was the announcement of no planned DLC. The BEST thing about the original game for me was Undead Nightmare. Period. All hopes for a similar mode for RDR2 are dead and gone. Screw you Rockstar."

The phenomenal story, well written characters, and incredibly talented voice actors makes me wonder if this might be the greatest game ever made. Other fantastic open-world games like AC Origins and TW3 felt incredibly vibrant, and RDR2 easily stands tall amongst those giants with its incredible sights and sounds. But what really sets RDR2 apart from those 2 is the level of effort put into developing the NPCs in this game. You just don't see random NPCs with unique conversations amongst themselves in other games, and with such diverse appearances, emotes, personalities, and mood states at that. Hiring over 1000 voice actors to voice NPCs that aren't even a part of side-missions? Truly incredible.I challenge anyone to ever feel bored playing RDR2. And yes, there're some game breaking bugs every now and then, but everything else is so phenomenal, that you just don't even care.RDR2 is truly a landmark in video games as an art form."
657,Meatbug,https://steamcommunity.com/id/meat_bug/,17,1,1,330.3,November,"26,",944,0,1,"In Red Dead Redemption 2 you're playing Arthur Morgen, a member of a posse of outlaws, lead by Dutch van der Linde, who are on the run from federal agents due to a heist that went awry.While on the run and relocating their camp regularly, you're trying to make money by doing jobs that aren't necessarily legal all the time, everytime with a promise that the next big job will be the last.Over the course of the game, Arthur is also faced with his own mortality, making him question the things he does and their consequences and together with things going wrong and questioning the motives and integrity of Dutch, tensions rise and a conflict seems inevitable.The game is played in third-person, in a huge open world that you can traverse by foot or horseback (there are also carriages you can pay).Visually the game is gorgeous, from the snowy mountains to the prairie lands and dark and swampy regions, it's a feast to look at.But not just the visual presentation is great, there are some tracks from the soundtrack that are absolutely fantastic and their implementation in the scenes of the game sent shivers down my spine.Besides looking and sounding good, the gameplay is fine as well in my opinion. There's nothing groundbreaking new here though. You aim, you shoot, take cover and reload. Sometimes movement might feel a little wonky and sluggish, but there's nothing really standing in the way of enjoying things.The open world offers a lot of quests and activities you can do, animals to hunt, collectibles to find so you shouldn't get bored too easily.Now, while mentioned ""boredom"", the pacing of the game is quite deliberate, if not slow at times. Especially in the beginning. Personally, i think it fits the game and helps getting to know the characters, the situation everyone is in and personally, i love stories in games. So be aware, that you might not be able to explore and roam free as much as you want right away.I did played the multiplayer part a bit, though it feels more limited, empty and more repetitive than the singleplayer.Though if you have friends to play with, i guess it should offer some fun as well.I haven't encountered a lot of toxic players in my playtime, i really just got into a fight 2 or 3 times and that never really lasted too long and was more or less a minor inconvenience, though i'm not sure if this might have changed over time.Overall i think the game is a very good singleplayer, wild west game, with an online part that might hook you as well, depending how much you can bear repetitive tasks and if you have friends to play with as well, which probably increases the experience a lot."

Allow me to elaborate.They pushed the same gameplay model as GTAV (Get money, buy things and get more money). This would be fine except they force you to purchase useless ♥♥♥♥ and lock professions behind a 10-15 gold transaction. This is not to mention everything is insanely overpriced which I assume is an attempt to pad the sparse gameplay. They also made it so the ""survival"" mechanics from singleplayer are present in the multiplayer portion. An asinine decision however it is what it is. All of this would be forgiveable if not for a handful of the combat mechanics. First of all, if you play on controller, even on PC, the aim assist is insane. On mouse and keyboard you are at a massive disadvantage unless it is a free aim lobby. Secondly there is a new pseudo passive mode called ""Defensive mode"". This makes it harder for other players to attack you, however it still allows you to attack people who are not in that mode extremely easily. It also disables any form of aim assist and ability to tackle when fighting someone in defensive mode. All in all the story is great, unforgiving at times, but great. It is worth the buy if that is what you are looking for. The multiplayer is the single worst experience that I have had in a very long time. If i could give it negative stars I would run out of negative numbers.Edit as of 11/29/2020:Second verse same as the first, the story is great and the multiplayer is ass.

665,King Bradley,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/,11,1,1,129.3,November,"30,",418,0,1,"RDR2 was really something new for me. If you have never played RDR1 like I didn't when you first start the game, you will probably wonder why the pace is so slow, and what's the hype all about, but if you are patient, and stick with the journey, you will see that this is truly a wonderful game, well worth your time and my top 2 favorite games of all time.Story is this game starts a bit slow and that was off-putting for quite some time until I understood that this game is like a long book. It takes some time for you to get to know characters, so for a long time nothing actually happens, but when it starts happening, you will actually care way more if something good or bad happens, because you will know characters very well. You play as Arthur Morgan, outlaw who is part of the gang led by Dutch Van Der Linde, charismatic leader, loved by everyone. Arthur is like a son to Dutch, he was adopted by the gang when he was only the kid, and he has been living this gang life since then. There are around 20 people in the gang. So what is story about? Gang has been killing, robbing for ages, and they are wanted men for a long time, however this time, they screwed up some job in Blackwater, and Pinkertons, federal agency almost captured them and they had to escape Blackwater and hide somewhere. Traveling through harsh snowy mountains, hopefully nobody will find them there, gang needs to settle down and start getting money and food so they survive these harsh times. So for quite such time, nothing is really happening, and you are just killing, robbing, hunting, trying to help the gang, trying to survive. It's like real life, well real life of the outlaw. Eventually things start getting intense. Without spoiling much anymore, I will just say that the story is amazing, possibly the best written story out there imo, it's a pretty real and emotional story that features wonderful journey and great characters, that you will really care about, and that's what makes this game so great, this wonderful journey. Gameplay in this game is complex enough. Combat is simple, you just shoot folks, and most of the time it's a pretty easy game. You just hide behind rocks, walls, trees and shoot, if you get shot you can just drink some medicine that you probably have a lot, because money is easily made in this game. First of all you don't even need to rob people outside of main story, because you will earn more than enough money just playing missions. I was being good guy, bad with boys, pure sweetheart on my own, not breaking any laws and I always had a lot of money. I would go to store and buy everything I need, food, drinks, medicine, ammo, and all that is so cheap, that you don't have to worry about side looting. One important technique to mention, and the only combat ability in this game it's Dead Eye, it's basically like something you have seen in Max Payne games, time slows down and and you can shoot people easily, only difference is that Arthur is not as nearly agile as the Max. This Dead Eye has it's own meter, so you gotta fill it up when it depletes, but it also increases on it's own when you kill people. So all in all, combat is really simple and most of the time you won't have any issues beating the tasks. Aside from combat important thing to mention is that Arthur is traveling on his horse, and you can change horse any time, by buying new horse, or taming wild one, however in first missions you get some new horse and I stayed loyal to him, even though they were better horses. Traveling through lands on your horse is extremly relaxing, music is so chill, and the world is beautiful. You can hunt or go fishing if you like these things and there are legendary animals to get caught, but these things didn't really pick my interest. You can rob anyone you want, however there is honor meter and if you do bad things it will go down and this will affect the personallity, he won't be caring person (for an outlaw at least) if you are doing bad things. It's kinda like paragon and renegade meters  in Mass Effect series. It also affects store prices and most importantly, the story. What's unique about Red Dead games is that there are random encounters in the world, you will be going through world, and white dot on the map will start blinking or you will hear voices and bunch of random things will happen. Strangers will ask for your help, for example snake bit them, and you can help them, or someone is taking bounty on their horse, and by bounty  I mean wanted people and you can help them, or not, if you do help some strangers your honor will increase a bit, but however sometimes helping them is not a good thing. I am not really gonna go into details how your honor meter increases, cause everything is explained in details in the game, but pretty much helping random strangers, saying hello to random strangers, helping gang in the camp by doing daily chores are some of the things that will increase that meter. Aside from random encounters, there are also stranger missions, and these are missions that will appear on the map when you are walking close to them. These are basically side quests in this game, and most of the time these side quests are divided into few parts. Once you are done with one part, next part will appear after some time. In that situation if you want to continue quests, just set up camp in the wilds, and sleep till the mission shows up, or you can continue doing something else and mission will pop up eventually. There are also few optional missions from the gang members. Aside from that bounty hunts are worth mentioning, you can go to local sheriff and start your bounty quests, and money will be paid to you once you bring back target dead or alive, based on your request. There are also a bunch of side activites in this game, like poker, robbing stagecoaches, houses, etc. I mentioned before that you can make a camp in the wild, and basically whenever you are not in the city or in the gang camp, you can set up the camp, and you can sleep, cook food there or fast travel (Money Lending mission, after you acquire ledger, you can purchase that ability). Overall pretty good gameplay.Atmosphere is amazing, like I already mentioned. It's so relaxing, so chill, it's one of the most relaxing games I've ever played, if not the most relaxing one. Performance wise this game ran pretty good on my configuration, I was getting 60 fps most of the time on high-ultra settings at 1080p. Fps does goes down in one city, but if you lower lightings it will definitelly help a lot. It's not the best optimized game out there, but it worked pretty well for myself. Game is around 70-80 hours long, if you do most of side quests in the game, minus hunting and fishing, but it's an open world game, so there is no limit, as you know. I didn't try online at all, because I wasn't really interested in that, so I can't say anything on that topic. - Amazing beautiful open world, with so many things happening, like random encounters- Writting and the story are one of the best I've ever seen, if not the best- Journey is wonderful- Beautiful atmosphere, maybe the most relaxing game I've ever played- Gameplay is pretty good- Performance wise it's not the best optimized game out there Wonderful relaxing game with beautiful world, story and the characters. I would recommend this game even at full price, it's my top 2 favorite games of all time along with Dark Souls, and in my opinion the masterpiece, because I don't see any flaws in this game, it's totally complete game and the story is so detailed."

The game itself feels weird. The game feels like it is trying to reimagine GTA IV in the end of the wild west era. But at the same time trying to make the game as cinematic as possible like GTA V. But this creates a slight clash of ideoligies. The missions are now much easier and seem to have no ""direct but suboptimal results vs smart with better results"" options. The game seems to want to feel like its dynamic and reacting to you, but it can only happen in the less scripted open world, and there it feels amazing.Original: Game does not launch.When trying to boot straight from exe tells me that the soucial club does not have rights for this product.When starting from steam, crashes when trying to launch, unexpected error.Worth buying on a maybe when the rockstar launcher has been completly removed from the launch process.Not worth my time and money if it doesnt even tell me whats wrong and it isnt fixed 2 months after launch."

I absolutely loved its campaign it's a prequel to previous game of franchise which is very well executed, the story felt very cinematic and every bit of it was solid, i thoroughly enjoyed it. Open World is very immersive and it feels hand-crafted as you explore and encounter its elements and there are certain activities to do like hunting, fishing etc. i'd also like to acknowledge the great soundtracks this game offers, songs like American Venom, that's the way it is are some of my favourites, overall the music is punched and gutted right through its moments and you'll feel it. Combat is highly enjoyable and it feels great through-ought the game."

I have even done 3 fresh and clean installs of the steam game and the Rockstar launcher and still not working.

I did not play before in the first part, and as I understand it, this is a prequel, so PC players who did not play the original now even won.The game takes place in North America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, where we play as Arthur Morgan, a man of new progressive views, stuck in a gang of thieves, killers and liars. On his apth the protagonist saw a lot of blood, participated in more than a dozen skirmishes. The story of how blindly following friends leave their lives, their future for the short-sighted and selfish plans of the leader of the detachment Van der Linde.The game evokes different feelings, but most of all it makes you empathize with the main character, because he is true to his word, his friends, but at the same time wants a better life for his loved ones. At the same time, he is forced to go to the ""last"" deal in order to raise money and realize the so-called American dream.Graphically, this is a new word in the gaming industry. The game squeezes all the juices from any PC configuration. Here you have support for 4K with HDR, support for ultrawide monitors and an unlimited number of FPS, just requires the hardware, which is still under development.Fascinating landscapes, changing the time of day, weather and seasons, simply fascinate and force you to take screenshots with incredible beauty every now and then.For all this you have to pay a lot, you need to find a balance between a beautiful picture, but at the same time not to lose in the number of frames. This game is very voracious.The music in this game deserves special praise. Dramatic notes during intense scenes are replaced by cheerful and perky melodies in bars and taverns.The voice acting is beyond praise, it seems that the bandits you draw in your head look exactly like that, and the voice actors have done their best.This is not just GTA V in the wild west, there are much more activities, customization and just a huge number of random encounters that will lead to something unexpected.For the first time, fishing in the game looks like I want to do it. Hunting animals is made not just as a source of food, but also as an art in finding legendary animals from which legendary artifacts can be obtained.A huge variety of missions: from robberies to building your house, from fishing with friends to creating the first iron man. Separate praise is the best “drunken” mission in the bar with Leni - tons of ​​humor are guaranteed.I want to say that this is another masterpiece in the Rockstar piggy bank, but this is a masterpiece in the whole gaming industry, even the entire entertainment industry. A deep and sad story with its sparks of hope for a better life ...- A heartbreaking story, lasting more than 150 hours (including the search for all animals)- Fascinating secondary quests with unusual development of further events- A new word in visual and graphic terms (and this is without raytracing)- Memorable music and voices of the main characters- A wide variety of activities (from playing dominoes to hunting animals)- Dull multiplayer with a lot of hackers spoiling the impression of the gameЛегендарная игра от легендарных разработчиков наконец-то заглянула на ПК в ее самом совершенном виде. Не играл я до этого в первую часть и так понимаю, что это приквел, так что ПК игроки, не игравшие в оригинал теперь даже выиграли.Действия игры разворачиваются в Северной Америке конца 19 - начала 20 века, где мы играем за Артура Моргана, человека новых прогрессивных взглядов, застрявшего в банде воров, убийц и лжецов. На своем пути главный герой повидал немало крови, поучаствовал не в одном десятке перепалок. История о том, как слепо следующие друзья оставляют свои жизни, свое будущее за недальновидные и корыстные планы главаря отряда Ван Дер Линда.Игра вызывает разные чувства, но больше всего она заставляет сопереживать главному герою, ведь он верен своему слову, своим друзьям, но в то же время хочет лучшей жизни для своих близких. При этом вынужден отправляться на ""последнее"" дело, дабы собрать денег и осуществить так называемую американскую мечту.Графически - это новое слово в игровой индустрии. Игра выжимает все соки из любой конфигурации ПК. Здесь тебе и поддержка 4к с HDR, поддержка ultrawide мониторов и неограниченное число FPS, только подавай железо, которое находится еще в разработке. Завораживающие пейзажи, смена времени суток, погоды и сезонов, просто завораживают и заставляют то и дело снимать скриншоты с невероятной красотой.За все это приходится платить очень дорого, необходимо найти баланс между красивой картинкой, но при этом не потерять в количестве кадров. Эта игра очень прожорлива.Музыка в этой игре заслуживает отдельной похвалы. Драматические ноты во время напряженных сцен сменяются веселыми и задорными мелодиями в барах и кабаках.Озвучка выше всяких похвал, кажется что именно так и выглядят бандиты, которых ты рисуешь себе в голове, а актеры озвучки постарались на славу.Это не просто GTA V в диком западе, здесь гораздо больше активностей, кастомизации и просто огромное количество случайных встреч, которые приведут к чему-то неожиданному.Впервые рыбалка в игре выглядит так, что хочется этим заниматься. Охота на животных сделана не просто как источник пищи, а так же как искусство в поиске легендарных животных из которых можно получить легендарные артефакты.Громаднейшее разнообразие миссий: от ограблений до постройки своего дома, от ловли рыбы с друзьями до создания первого железного человека. Отдельной похвалы стоит самая лучшая ""пьяная"" миссия в баре с Лени - море юмора обеспечено. Хочется сказать, что это очередной шедевр в копилку Rockstar, но это шедевр всей игровой индустрии, даже всей индустрии развлечений. Глубокая и грустная история с ее искорками надежды о лучшей жизни...- Душераздирающая история, длительностью в более 150 часов (с учетом поиска всех животных)- Увлекательные второстепенные квесты с необычными развитием дальнейших событий- Новое слово в визуальном и графическом плане (и это без лучей)- Запоминающаяся музыка и голоса главных героев- Большое разнообразие активностей (от игры в домино до охоты на животных)- Унылый мультиплеер с большим количеством хакеров, портящих впечатление об игре"

This game is like wild west life simulation with immersive environment, it is very nice to wander around the map, doing activities like hunting, stowing animals you killed on the horse, riding and doing random encounters.   The game is  reminds me of childhood because i grew up watching western movies with my family on every sunday. You know cowboys, outlaws and sheriff stuff. (also fighting with natives). Of course, there are also things i did not like while playing the game; like shooting without using slow motion not so funny, therefore i am always using slow motion to headshot enemies. Also missions with doing daily stuff sometimes could be boring like driving coach to town to buy supplies, but i said the game is like wild west times life simulation.   Do i suggest this game?

This is actually my second time buying it, and I am not having as fun of a time as I was on PS4. Unfortunately, this port is pretty lazy and there are a whole lot of technical problems that have resulted from it. I've only had the game crash twice, but it generally runs like ♥♥♥♥, which is sad considering I am running it on a RTX 2070. Framerate drops, graphical issues, and harsh stutters are very common. From trying online, I can say that the community is by far this game's best feature. Other players, 9 out of 10 times will drop whatever they're doing to help you if you need it. It genuinely blew me away when I first started playing this game, and honestly it still does to this day, considering Rockstar Game's other titles' communities and how godawful they are. There are occasional hackers online, but I can't think of a time where they were genuinely obnoxious. Most of the time they just spawn a bunch of bears or something. The last gripe I have about the online mode is the general lack of love and attention it gets from Rockstar. I would describe the experience as ""barebones"" - while it has a great setting and atmosphere and gameplay, its absolutely lacking in content or just general things to do. The online scene is dying because Rockstar refuses to add anything to it, seeing as it doesn't make nearly as much money as GTAO does for the same amount of work.TLDR: Rockstar has a great game here, but it is plagued by a generally embarrassing amount of technical issues."

The technical aspects of this game are some of the most brilliantly realized I've ever seen in an interactive medium.  The visuals,  animations, and voice acting are all the level of quality you've come to expect from a rockstar release.  With that said, it's without a doubt, the most BORING game I've ever played in my life.  The mission structure is such that it basically plays itself and has you go from point A to point B with the game telling you exactly where to go/what to do and god forbid you go off-script.  The missions make sure to throw in some braindead easy shooting galleries every now and again to ensure you stay engaged but it simply wasn't enough to keep me interested.  I don't really have much to say about the open-world, it's fine I guess.  On the merits of it's technical aspects and story it's a 10/10.  In terms of the gameplay experience, I'd have to give it a 3/10.  I don't think I've ever tried to hard to enjoy something so beloved by many and just been completely unable to.  I realize I'm in the VAST minority here but that was just my experience sadly."

Not the ""aim so well you are suspicious and frustrated"" hackers, but the kind that explode you over and over, catch you on fire, teleport you across the map, teleport you into the sky, spawn dangerous mobs on you, kill your horse, spawn multiple replicas of your character which then attack you type hackers. I have never had anything like this happen in a game before. I ended up stuck in a loop being exploded to death over and over before I could access the menu to quit out of the game or try to load into a different realm. I had to alt f4 to exit the game. We have all asked for our money back, this is the most we have ever spent on a game and the fact that hackers have this level of control unchecked with no way of even seeing their names to report them is insane.

But not only you get to know the west, you also visit American south and even one of the big southern cities with all modern features of that time. The environment and depth of the game is breathtaking and just riding around on your horse can be just as fascinating as shooting gangs, which you will get to do a lot here. The level of detail and scale of random events happening to you or just around you makes it feel like you were really there. This is something I was overwhelmed by. Now about the main story plot. You are typical gunslinger in one of many outlaw gangs roaming the west pursued by the law. All your gang care about is how to get more and more money in every possible way and you can see how gang leader Dutch Van Der Linde is just more and more obsessed with that and even though your character does not like that, he follows, because he is just a gun. Yes, this is some character development, but overall this is something I just didn’t like even though characters develop it does not affect their actions. The story is simple in my opinion, very straightforward, with little to no choice whatsoever and most importantly very predictable. ✪   ✪   ✪   and their enhancement choices✪   ✪   ✪   ✪   – after great beginning it goes downhill✪   –annoying a lot✪   ✪   – always online even in singleplayerOverall rating"

So I tried whatever I could find online to solve my issue. For some reason my IP is considered an abusable ip or something, that hackers can use to exploit the game or something, basically the suggestion people gave with that is to disconnect my router for 5-6 hours and maybe my ip address will change. I cannot do this as other people in my household use the internet for their jobs. I tried a vpn, and I could connect to the servers on my browser, but i needed to use my phone hotspot to even connect to not my internet ip to use the launcher, and when all of that was said and done RdR.exe could not respond, so after all of that work to play a game I was still gatekept by rockstar to play their single player game. I cannot even play it offline. So with that in mind I unfortunately have to refund this game i was otherwise excited to play again after so long but now with this sour taste in my mouth I do not know if i can continue supporting this company if i had to jump through this many hoops just to be denied access to a game a purchased.

I tried to play online again but I just couldn't handle to start from 0 when I have an OP character on the ps4. If they can make the transfer possible (Just like in GTA 5) then I bet a bunch of ps4 users will buy the PC version and gladly spend more money on gold bars.Rockstar do yourself a favor and just make the online character transfer from ps4 to pc possible.

738,Dalton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GriffonKeep/,24,1,0,235.7,May,"9,",222,0,1,"As much as I want to recommend this title I just can't do it. So, let's talk about that.First I would like to go over the pros:1) Graphics are excellent and optimization is good2) Stories are fantastic with very interesting characters3) It will take a LONG LONG time to run out of things to do in this game, whether it's online or offline. After 101 hours I am still nowhere near running out of fun things to do.Now, let's get to the main cons and the reasons I can't recommend the game:1) Controls. They're bad. Real bad. It's exceedingly difficult to do precision movement whether on foot or horse due to the unresponsive and clunky controls. Not to mention a lot of times your mount will just veer off the direction you're heading and run you into a tree, rock, fence, building, etc. even when you're not pushing any directional keys. Trust me, the controls are infuriating.2) Online bugs and glitches. I have had entire shipments that I have spent hours putting together just vanish on turn in with no rewards. The shipments (trader and moonshine roles) do not get reset back to your camp or moonshine shack, they're just gone. This is the most egregious of the glitches so far, but there are also a lot of glitches involving movement that are frustrating.3) Hackers online. Oh so so so many hackers. These people can drain your money, print their own, god mode, aim bots, downpours of dynamite, invisibility, etc. etc. The worst part of this is that even if the hacker does not target you the hacks will break the lobby causing NPCs to be unresponsive along with... well.... everything else.4) Micro-transaction shop. Had I realized there was one in the game I would have never purchased it. These shops, every single one of them in ANY game, are nothing but scams. The developers purposely make things a grind (though in RDR2 it's not as bad as others) so that you will feed them money just out of frustration due to lack of progress even though you just paid for a full price game. Every single game with one of these shops is designed this way, some are just more subtle than others.    So, this review is long enough as it is, but I could keep going. However, I feel I have hit the most important points as to why I can not recommend this game. Maybe if it ever goes on sale for 20$, but I can't state enough that it's just not worth more than that due to the glaring issues, ESPECIALLY if you're looking to play online. As long as people keep feeding devs that practice shady tactics and ignore glaring issues (because, hell, they already have your money so they will just pretend they're working on fixes, but never actually fix the problems).    I will probably continue playing it because I am one of the dimwits that sprang for the ultimate version, so I already have a lot of money in the game, but had I known what I know now before purchase I would have never even paid the basic 60$. The online play especially is too broken with the CONSTANT harassment from hackers.    So, in conclusion, I would recommend you do not dump any more than a 20$ bill for this broken mess. And since that isn't likely to happen any time soon, I highly recommend you just pass this by completely."
739,Skays,https://steamcommunity.com/id/skays_gaming/,7,,1,253.1,November,"28,",280,0,1,"It's definitely Game of the year, but...Maybe I approached it with incorrect attitude but honor machanics are pretty confusing for example until chapter 4/5 game just didn't let me to be good guy. Main character Arthur is messed up guy with a lot of personal issues and this what kept me confusing about these Honor mechanics it was very hard to keep it on high(est) level. Don't get me wrong I loved main character (and his horse), I loved story but I felt that Honor mechanics are not needed and they sometimes pissed me off, for example why looting some guy's body who obviously died ten years earlier in the middle of a desert decreases honor? I still cannot tell especially when there is content in it (letters, valuable items or diary entry). In one sentence? It's hard to be a good guy on wild west even if you try hard.Next thing I have to mention are horses. Oh my... these are made beautifully not even by design but all of these have a soul and are so natural that when you meet some in the wild you know that you want to have him or her. There are a lot of things to do which if I would like to decribe It would take ma a lot of time. But discovery new places, hunting, a lot of sidequests.

In this game there are two components, the first essence is known as story mode, the sequence is referred to online (multiplayer). Although online may seem debatable to some players, it overall gives a more positive output compared to GTA online (Grand Theft Auto). Story mode is considered one of the most heartfelt and captivating narrative components of a video game ever.Story (10/10):  In the Story mode component of this virtual game, the story consists of a low life cowboy named Arthur Morgan. Seen throughout the story as you progress, Mr Morgan is trying to find a way out of this life that he has brought himself into. There are exclusive features and details that vary among the story anticipated on your honor ranking. High honor will receive a contrasting ending that will gratify players' minds and captivate their hearts. But a differing sequence occurs when a player will receive low honor, the ending sequence of this virtual game is rather substandard and undesirable leaving players regretting the negative choices they had established throughout the story component. Overall this virtual game has a formidable story component that is highly ranked by all onlookers.Online (7/10):Online consists of an immensely inexpedient quantity of labor, consisting of a high amount of hours spent on playtime. Although GTA online (Grand Theft Auto) Consists of many players who decrepit and withdraw the satisfaction of playing. Rockstar Games had made sure those issues wouldn't arise again. Instead, leaving us with a correspondence that is genuine and pleasant. But the labor that has to be put into this sequence is over the top and leaves onlookers feeling purposeless. Therefore reducing a prohibitive amount of attention drawn towards the online sequence. Overall online is good but will take an excessive amount of time that is unwanted to most onlookers."
746,NotASpy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/definitelynotaspy/,6,,1,71.8,May,"30,",871,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is such an extraordinary game that it deserves more than just walls of text covering random topics like other reviews I made in the past. As quality of a game as Red Dead 2 is, I will try and make an equally informative and quality review of it. I will cover 3 main points that I think are important to what makes a game, this includes its story/characterization, gameplay, and visuals/sound.Many people see a game such as Red Dead Redemption and think about the gunslinging, the robbing, the violence but it is much deeper than what meets the eye. The story revolves around the main protagonist Arthur Morgan, it explains the origins of Dutch’s gang and the steps they need to go through in order to reach their goal of getting out of the U.S. and off to exotic lands to escape their tragic lives. The story is full of exciting missions and events that mostly revolve around the one last big score the gang needs to get the money they need to escape. Many twists and turns happen throughout which cause division amongst the gang and some drastically halt progress to getting the money they need. I am trying to keep it as vague as possible as it’s best to experience the game unspoiled, like I said it’s much bigger than a robbing simulator, it’s a story of redemption. You need to sit back and think of the world that the gang once knew is still a viable way of living. You think about your actions, and think if the harm you cause to others throughout is right. The cast in this game is outstanding, you can go from looking up to, to feeling sorry for, to hating, to feeling sorry for just one character of the many you get close to. This way of life takes a toll on people, and there is no honor in this life and you will find it out first handedly. How the people you grow close to change into people they once despised, how people react to certain events, how their lives can be taken at any instant and you wonder if Arthur Morgan is doing the right things for the people he cares about.While Red Dead Redemption 2 is a near perfect game in all other ways to measure a games worth, here is where you can see some of its faults. The game revolves around such realistic and beautiful animations, that it sometimes bleeds into lowering the quality of controlling Arthur. Not on many occasions but maybe a handful of times, I clicked buttons that didn’t register properly which lead to the game doing something I didn't want. For example, trying to mount your horse in a city and Arthur brutally tackles a random civilian which leads to me having every police officer in the city shooting at me even though it was not sevre and an accident. This made me have to mount up and escape from the law for about 2 minutes before I can return to the story mission I was on my way to. The gunplay leaves dissatisfied and you wanting something that feels a little more impactful. The shooting in this game just feels frustrating and unrewarding, which had me abuse deadeye which was fine but turned later missions in the game to me stuffing tobacco down Arthurs throat and point and clicking until I got to a cutscene. The stiff controls and poor shooting mechanics are really my only two gripes with this game, it may put some people off but I feel pushing through these issues are worth it for getting to play the almost masterpiece that Red Dead Redemption 2 is. The game tries its hardest to be realistic, and with that comes certain sim elements. Which has you naturally get immersed in the game that it is. You need to stop at stores to stock up for long journeys to keep arthurs weight up, you need to sleep to keep deadeye up and stay awake. Which has you every once in a while making trips to shops getting to know the shop owner and stocking supplies for you, crafting, horses, and more. It isn’t too in your face, it almost feels refreshing and natural to keep these things in mind throughout the game. The missions in this game are typically Rock* activities but set in 1899. You can go from robbing a bank, taking out rival gangs, helping out fellow gang members, to riding a hot air balloon. The mission diversity is amazing and has you wanting to pull 5+ hour sessions regularly. Besides the main story, this open world isn’t barren like other games . There are tons of strangers to meet that can have you escorting a cameraman to get the perfect shots, helping a newly widowed women survive on her own, tear bounty posters for escaped inmates, help a stranger on the side of the road who just got bitten by a venomous snake, and so much more. I am not usually a fan of side content, as it usually is subpar compared to main story quests. But the side content here is on par if not better than most main missions. They are full of interesting characters, twists and turns of their own that it feels great to just see a small story on its own. You can hunt various legendary animals or any old deer to get materials to craft new upgrades for your camp or upgrades to Arthurs equipment. This is hands down the single greatest visual and sound in a video game you can experience as of today. There are no other games that compete with the beauty of the world and no one can tell me otherwise. I was playing this game on near ultra @1440p with my Gtx 1080ti at a smooth 60fps . And at no point in this game did I stop getting stunned by the visual quality. The shadows are outstanding and reflect the time of day, on every blade of grass. The textures are top notch, everything is incredibly detailed from the horse’s balls to Arthurs buttons on his coat. But what really takes over here is the lighting quality, from the dust shining from the light coming through the windows, to the reflecting light of the swamps. I feel in this review I was able to thoroughly explain each of my points well, but in the case of Red Dead Redemption's 2 graphics I don’t think I am up to that task. Just take a look at my screenshots to see for yourself. This whole game immerses you with its dialogue, sim elements, but what ties it all together is the better than real life views. The forest can make you feel the dread of what's to come, the foggy and darkness of the swamp has you ride for your life in fear of the monsters lurking, the snowy mountains have you bundle Arthur to keep him from getting frozen solid. If there is one thing to take away from this review is that, this game seriously looks better than real life at times it will have you stop and take a screenshot to remember the time you had. Another key to the visual quality in this game are it’s animations and physics. Arthur moves around the world in beautiful fashion, the people smoking a cigar during a poker game are all realistic. It really has you believe that this is a real living world with how amazingly the people interact with the world itself. The sound design is also key to the delivery of the game, everything from rain hitting trees, to the distant gunshots, are all realistic and have you fully in love with the design of Red Dead Redemption 2. Not only are the sounds amazing, but the music and the timing of it is equally as impressive. The only other game that has comparable music is Nier Automata and we all know how amazingly the game weaves gameplay with its soundtrack. Here the music also perfectly matches with what you are doing, slow paced music while you are setting up a heist, and when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan the music reacts appropriately.The few real life songs that actually play, play at emotionally impactful moments."

And I am sure this one may have been just as great and wonderful.   BUT, there is just one minor annoyance that has prevented me from enjoying this game.  wait did I say one minor annoyance? I meant a CATASTROPHIC FAILING IN BASIC FUNCTIONALITY. Any one who has tried to play this game on pc will know what I'm talking about.  The fact that it requires yet another launcher is not even the worst part, what is is the fact that you cannot play this game while offline.  You have to be connected to the internet for the entire time you are playing this game.  for some this is not a problem.  for me though, I travel a lot for work.  And not everywhere has access to the internet.  and some places that do, it is unreliable at the best of times.  so playing a game that boots you from playing just because of a hiccup in the connection is problematic at the best of times.  I would like to think that this isn't going to be the new normal for games in the future.  However, i have a feeling that this (just like i said about micro-transactions) is going to RUIN several games and franchises for many of their loyal fanbases."

A ton of possible choices that affect our honor plus a heartwarming but extremely satisfying ending.The Wild West atmosphere is further enhanced by countless side activities such as playing cards, hunting, racing with strangers, fishing, etc. After completing the story, you and your friends can enter the online world and keep having fun. After a short introduction we are thrown into the game world and we can turn into: a skin trader, a moonshiner, a bounty hunter, a naturalist or a collector of unique items.

How can I comprehend the masterpiece of this game and the amazing character development and the incredible voice acting and the outstanding soundtrack? And best of all sets up perfectly for the first Red Dead. Arthur Morgan Where do I start with him He is the perfect protagonist, in my opinion, the game sets him up as a simply hardened outlaw who lives to ride and kills to live with him and his gang but as you continue to play the story you get deeper and deeper into who he really is and it's not only him it's also with Dutch, and John, and Micah, and Javier, Bill (all these names are your gang members) we all see their true selves at the end of the game. But Arthur changed the most because back then he was a ruthless man who gave no mercy or pity to others (if you choose to) But as you play as him he suddenly changes and shows that he really is a good man (again if you choose to have high or low honor for Arthur). As you continue to get higher honor you see his character development as he helps his gang and other important characters like Rains fall and Eagle flies they played a huge part in showing his true self. And Tuberculosis also played a major part in changing his life, and not only that but John and his family, Tilly, Ms. Grimshaw, Mr. Pearson, Mary-Beth, Even Uncle. Arthur redeemed himself by trying to save as many as he could and get justice to those who deserved it. His passing was one of the most heartbreaking moments for gamers and It gets even better when you then Play as John Marston Arthurs Good friend and brotherly figure, Together with his former gang members Charles and Sadie who the game will introduce you to as the game progresses through the story. They hunt and avenge for their good friend and get the retribution he deserved and cuts into the sequel to red dead redemption the entire story is amazing from beginning to first."

Few games look this good, play this well, and have this much to offer. It begs you to slow down, turn every page of its dramatic tale, and savor every last breathtaking detail.

A perfect exhibition of the fallacy that was the American Dream. A beautiful tragedy of an idea so many have hopelessly held onto only for the optimist to lose their hope, the idealist to turn cynic, and the dreamer to wake from their dream and into a nightmare. The beauty was in the fight for it. That's what this game is. Dreamers fighting for a world in which they can still dream. Sadly the world in which they truly live doesn't want them anymore, they are 'more ghosts than people'. The dawn of a new century means the death of the last one and thus modernity kills mysticism. The tale of Arthur Morgan and the Dutch Van Der Linde gang in all its richness is the tale of those last few who held onto, fought for, and believed in the myth of the West. A particularly poignant song on the game's soundtrack contains one lyric in particular that translates this sentiment best: 'the building of a shrine only just to burn'. They gave themselves to an idea that could not give back. But who's to say they fought in vain? In the end, if not for an idea, we can fight for each other. That's the only thing worth fighting for. I know it's just a game and everything but I found a lot of truth in my time with it. So yes, I would recommend this game."

788,Theoran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theoran/,7,,1,"1,614.6",November,"13,",66,3,1,"I never played Red Dead Redemption 1 but knew of it, so I was so excited to have a chance to play RDR2 when it came to PC. I jumped into the game not knowing anything and quickly realized this was going to be a slow burn of a game. The opening chapter is pretty slow paced as the game introduces you to the many characters and the mechanics of the game. I cannot stress this enough; the rest of the game is nothing like Chapter 1. So don’t give up on the game early on, there is so much more to come. Chapter 2 opens most of the world and you can finally explore the land at your own pace. This is where the game really shines. Exploring, hunting, and random encounters really make the world feel alive.Take your time and explore the world. Enjoy the scenery, bond with your horse, hunt animals, complete honor quests and side quests, and even do the main quest when you want. It all is so extremely rewarding. Obviously, you could only do the main quest and finish the game over the weekend, but you will miss so much about what makes this game great. The more you put into the game, the more you get out of it.In the early game, I did not know how I felt about Arthur. I just didn’t connect with him, and I certainly did not like him at all during the Leopold Strauss missions. As time passed in game, my feeling for Arthur began to change and you get to start seeing small changes in Arthur as well. You get to see the honorable, caring, and loyal friend he is, and I fell in love with him. By Chapter 6, I wanted nothing more than to protect Sadie Adler, Charles Smith, Abigail Roberts, and my horse, and save the gang and live happily ever after.I got lucky and was able to get Biscuit, my grey dappled Missouri Fox Trotter, seven quests into Chapter 2 and I kept Biscuit to the very end and without even realizing it, I had formed an emotional bond with her. I love this horse. I fed her; brushed her; took her to the stables for treats! It is an odd thing to realize how attached you have become to a video game character and as much as Arthur meant to me, Biscuit meant just as much.As Chapter 6 ends and the music plays, I am an emotional wreck. As the scene faded to black, I just sat there, staring at my screen. I had spent 500 hours in game at this point and I was drained. I had become so emotionally connected to all these characters that I did not want this the be the end, but it was. It was a satisfying, gripping, emotional story that left me filled with feelings of elation, despair, happiness, and sadness.The story of Booker and Elizabeth from Bioshock Infinite is the only other game I have played that had so completely pulled me in to the world and built connections with characters in the game so much so that I teared up at the end. This game delivered and the journey this game took me on trumps any glitches, bugs, or error codes that happened along the way.To say that RDR2 put a spell on me is an understatement. I own the RDR2 Official Guide, the original soundtrack, and the original score. This game consumed me as I worked my way to 100% completing the game.  I love this game, flaws, and all....even the ridiculous gambler challenges.The online game is what it is. I played RDO for 30 straight days and pretty much hated almost everything about it. It felt empty, soulless, and boring. There was no one to play with and for the most part I simply grinded the same area for cougars and plants. Ultimately, I got to a certain point where I asked myself, “Why are you even playing this?” At that point, I stopped playing and have not gone back even after RDO updates."

That being said, seeing that half of the game is still in a bad shape and little is being done about it I see no way but to keep my recommendation negative. ****************2020.01.24 - After playing over 100h, and most of that on-line I can tell that game instead of getting better is rolling downhill, and fast - old bugs that were there in december when game was launching on steam are still there, and new ones are poping-up almost on a daily basis -  shopkeepers and questgivers becoming unresponsive, daily challenges not getting counted properly, world events and animals respawning at terrible rate. On top of that servers are performing like sh*t, and all R* seems to be caring about is new premium currency content, which i wouldnt mind if the game was working fine, but it's not.This game has TONS of potential to be great, and I'd love to recommend it, but in current state RDO is unplayable.******That being said i love single player part of the game, which is awesome so far I recommend it with my whole heart."

The game has more physics details, than other games. About the story. Main character is Arthur Morgan. This man is very very charismatic, memorable and handsome. Always in my heart. About the graphics. Graphics are wonderful and very good, i just each watch on sky and my eyes get awesome beauty. Soundtrack and ambient music is perfect.Red Dead Online is good multuplayer about the Wild West. There are 5 roles (Bounty Hunter, Collector, Moonshiner, Naturalist and Trader). If you play with friends, then the game become more interesting. But, you can play solo, It won't be boring. Multiplayer has clothes, horses and guns, according to your taste.My rating is 10/10 - I recommended to buy!"

Of all those games, this is most assuredly one of my absolute favorites. I went into this game with no expectations, all I had heard was this was supposed to be a very very good game. The first several hours I spent starting and restarting, learning the mechanics and what does what and all of that and eventually it clicked and when it did, an adventure began the likes of which I've never experienced before. I am happy I waited until I had a beefy PC to play this game at max settings in all its glory too. My only real critiques are that I wish the map was just a tad bigger and the physics were a little less buggy. Beyond that, this game and its story are near flawless. A life changing game I would suggest any gamer play at least once. Thank you for the memories Arthur, enjoy Tahiti <3UPDATE: after finally sinking significant time into RDO, I feel like I can give an honest and fair review.It's a money-grubbing grind fest similar to GTA online and if you don't want to grind, you can gladly pay to get ahead. The story missions aren't bad, but most others are just radiant fetch missions or your standard guard this/take that/steal this jobs. What's more, in order to access more missions and features in the game, you actually have to pay a significant amount to buy ""kits"" that'll allow you to partake, and then in some instances (Blood Money) you have to pay just to do missions. If you're OK with grinding mostly for cosmetics, or want to RP, this might be up your alley. Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere. I would gladly pay $200+ for the RDR2 story. And I'd gladly pay $20+ to forget RDO exists."

""Non gamers don't know what they're missing out on, it saddens me to know a lot of people still think video games are still in that pac man or donkey kong phase where it's just a fun time waster for kids; but games have evolved into a broad medium of storytelling and world building in ways movies or books wish they could make their audience connect to."" - Comment from Youtube video.I like to review games based on MANY reasons but I mostly prefer to point to 3 main reasons that have a big impact on my experience:Very realistic. This is by far, the best and mostly will be even on the future the most realistic and graphical game I have played to date, aswell the whole physics which are breath taking and how well done they are, every single small detail is put into the game for one to experience the real west times! It also has it's own weather and it's another surreal part of the game. Snow, rain, sun, thunderstorm, sandstorm.. The map is one giant open-world with a lot of different biomes and also having a change of time for day and night, which already increases drastically the way a player view the game at. Not only that but the combat, the guns and the blood are super good! If you have played the game or at least seen a video or two, you know this game is no joke, but at same time it is very optimized as I played mostly on 90-120 fps on max settings for 1080p, considering the perfect graphics. Wow! Not only has the most thrilling western songs out there, aswell the sounds from ambience and everything are just in shape. Travelling by the forest, earing the owls at night while riding the horse listening to it's walking, and Arthur/John breathing. Or walking into the snowy mountains with your steps in and with eagles above birding loud, probably looking for a prey to catch. The rain or the wind on a top mountain... Simply outstanding!Also walking by the cities, specially the crowded ones and listening to the trains, the people chatting and all... it's a very different feeling than any other game, maybe because it's complemented with the graphics making it feel so real? Yet I think it's amazing what the creators have done with the sound in RDR2, as most of the games aren't this much detailed at all, to the most small point.The story is HUGE and very well writen, one of the best I have played so far. There are a lot of characters and cities, aswell a lot of missions and things to do. Nothing more to say, only playing is the best way to tell.Adding another extra part as the game includes a Online version but I really despise it and my hate goes all here since it needed to play it in order to complete the game's full achievements. Reaching rank 50 required me to buy a 10€ pack to collect easy but grindy XP that took me around 20 hours, not so fun. The PVP was crazy bad and really didn't liked it.Take a look at these two videos, just an amazing experience!  -"

A game with unforgettable characters, amazing gunplay, and the occasional horse glitching through a boulder. A game that, to this day, I've never found someone that thought poorly of it. And now, here we are. Ten years later, with a prequel of even grander ambition than the first.The only true way I can describe this game is that it  the embodiment of everything good about the ""Triple AAA"" games. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game that oozes with care and attention to detail in a way you usually only see in a Metal Gear Solid game. A cast of characters you genuinely come to care for, and an open world that feels truly . As Arthur Morgan, a member of Dutch's gang, most of the game world is open to you from the start, but the way the game is structured, your journey across it tends to unfold organically as you follow the main story. As a member of Dutch's gang, your main goal is to make money, and how you go about this can range from simple robbery to more theatrical methods of plunder.And this is where the core gameplay loop of RDR2 comes in: go out and explore the world, and experience its splendor. I haven't felt a sense of a game world being this huge since Skyrim, and in the same way, you tend to stumble upon quests as you reach around every rock and stick to see what the game world has in store. It's an immensely satisfying way to have quests structured, and that's not even getting into the gameplay.In my entire life of playing video games, I don't think  has even come close to how fun the gunplay is in RDR2. Nearly every single firearm is just plain  to shoot, and there's a lot of times I'd just ride through the game world shooting my gun into the air because it just felt right. And then, when you get into combat, you have a pretty bog-standard cover shooter, but with the element of the satisfying guns put into the mix, pretty much every gunfight is a blast to go through. It's almost decadent how full this game feels, and how much is packed in. This game could be double the price it is, and still be worth every penny. And I've only talked about the singleplayer experience; there's an entire and well-made online portion than can keep you entertained well after you've beaten the singleplayer portion. This is a game I hold on nearly the same level of Undertale or Chrono Trigger; you owe it to yourself to play it at least once. Cannot recommend enough."

805,NB,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198221239660/,6,,1,336.4,December,"19,",133,6,1,"This is an in depth review of Red Dead Redemption 2.I have over 300 hrs ( on pc ) in the game so i basically know the game inside out and also have all the achievements for the campaign mode.Now a lot of people are reluctant to buy rdr2 because of the launch issues it faced in its pc port and i totally agree it was buggy at launch but things have changed now , rockstar has fixed almost all the issues that the game had so there's no point in holding back your purchase for this reason.Now the game isn't for everyone its a very slow paced game,the game takes its time to show u the magnificent world that rockstar have created and its an experience that u need to take in slowly. MUSICNow music is on the top of list because this game has one of the best soundtracks out there. OPEN WORLDThe world of rdr2 is something that every gamer must experience.Its a beautiful world but don't be fooled danger lurks in every corner of this game from random gang encounters to you being hunted down by predators like a panther or a pack of wolves, you cant trust anyone in the wild .I had an encounter with a man who called out for help and said he lost his way, so naturally i went to give him a ride back to his town but he pulled me down and stole my horse, this is one of the many encounters that i had in the open and each one plays out differently. Its filled with a level of detail that is unmatched. There are treasure maps to be found ,dinosaur bones to be discovered, animals to be hunted and skinned etc ,i can go on and on about this but i will stop and give you a few numbers.The game has 178 animals all of them with distinct movements just like their real life counter parts ,around 30 types of fishes ,19 horse type each with their own unique skill set.There are around 60 weapons ,43 types of plants,60 types of items.GAMEPLAYIts a typical rockstar game so it uses a physics based engine which still creates hilarious moments ,Arthur (the main protagonist) moves like a real person and does actions at his own pace, for stats he has a stamina bar, health bar and a dead eye meter .All the mechanics from the first game have been implemented and improved in rdr2 with additional new ones. Hogtieing a npc and placing them on the train tracks just to see them run over is still fun to do.There are occasional glitches but not a deal breaker.The weather system is top notch with sand and rain storms being highlights.Gun gameplay is still clunky like all other rockstar games ,cover system is okish, first person mode of the game is the best way to make the gunplay interesting if u are having difficulties in the shooting areas of the game.For me the campaign was not at all challenging but it had some amazing moment which i am not gonna spoil for you. Even though the game has many weapons you can pretty much use a carbine repeater through the whole game with no issues ,which is one of the problems i had with the game.Looting an enemy or an area takes a lot of time because Arthur manually has to do loot each single area and can be frustrating some times.Horse gamplay is fantastic, the movements are just like real life and for the most part they can be controlled easily with a few cases where i had my horse going on its own, now i don't know if rockstar did this to make it more realistic or its just a bug.Horses have stamina and health bar.Bonding is a new mechanic in which it increases depending on how you treat your horse for instance cleaning them, feeding etc.As the bonding level increase the stamina and health of the horse is also increased in addition it can perform skids and side movements.Another new introduction is the camp area where all the gang members hangout and go about their lives.Arthur can talk to each member and can do small fetch quests for them.The gang reacts to how you behave to them.The camp has an upgradation mechanic where you can use in game money to upgrade the camp abilities like unlocking fast travel, better food for the members etc.There are mini games like poker,dominos, five finger fillet and black jack 21 all of which are fun to play.*Dead eye is still in the game and is still lovely and honor system also returns*STORYStory wise rdr2 takes place before the first once where you play as Arthur Morgan a member of the Dutch van der lined gang and shows how the age of civilization afted their lives. The game has hands down the best writing in the video game industry, Arthur is such a well written character that you actually start t care about him as the game progresses.Every piece of dialogue is masterfully written and executed ,each charecter feels unique and have different back stories. Side missions are also of excellent quality. The missions are fun to play there is humor and charm to the character which all in all adds to the experience.The only down side is the story starts to drag towards the end creating some missions which were not necessary.ONLINERdro is still new and is improving as of now i havent played much but its still a good aditional package that you are getting.It is not as good as gtao considering is fairly new whereas gtao has been around since 2013.From what i have played its very good ,the missions are fun do with friends and has a lot of side activities to keep you invested.There is room for improvement.Yes server issues still exists.VERDICTThe game is an absolute must play and i  highly recommend it.I have a lot of screenshots uploaded on my profile for rdr2 so if u want to see how the game looks you can check them out.Thank you."
806,Soloccidens,https://steamcommunity.com/id/soloccidens/,10,,1,124.5,December,"12,",100,0,1,"I decided to give RDR2 a try because of the protagonist's ability to pet horses and, honestly, to pass my time before the release of Cyberpunk 2077. Now that I played it upon release, I felt like I should come back and say something about RDR2.Boy was I never this wrong in my expectations. Maybe this is due to the fact that I never played a Rockstar game before, but I really didn't have many ideas on how this will unfold besides shooting bandits and stealing their horses. But the game was a hell of a ride.The story is extremely well-written and beautiful, the main character is probably my favourite protagonist so far: his actions are all making sense, there is little to no dissonance between his established personality and the world it lives in, and his development doesn't feel unjustified, rushed or faked, which is something I quite often experience in video game media. His voice acting is top quality and in general, I found Arthur a charming main hero, flawed and imperfect, but totally alive. In the beginning, I was worried about quite a big amount of supporting characters in Arthur's journey. I kept mixing Bill and John, Charles and Lenny, Hosea and reverend Swanson (!) and pretty much all female characters in their posse thinking they will be a minor decorum in our journey. And they ended up none of this, every minor character is great and their interactions are a treasure, and the amount of work put into their camp banter, responses, mimics and writing much be insane to feel this satisfying, From horses (I love my good girls!) to hunting, playing poker, chasing serial killers, antagonizing Micah in the camp or fishing in the frozen lakes of Grizzlies — this game does its job brilliantly and delivers an incredibly immersive and believable picture of living in America on the turn of the XIX century.I know this game is not a hidden gem in need of more recommendations, but if you are doubting and somehow reading this — make sure to give it a try. It is not cheap, but definitely worth the price. Albeit slow-passed and sometimes sluggish, it is a great story of Arthur Morgan, Dutch van der Linde (I would give this guy an Academy Award if this was a film!) and his gang which for me pushed the boundaries of open-world gaming and made it into a Coen brother meeting Faulker tale of a people trying to find their place in the world passing by.10/10 if only for the mission ""Blood Feuds, Ancient and Modern"", this is the best crafted scene in the video games I have ever seen."

How he realizes the truth behind things he otherwise followed blindly as the game progresses is done with no rush. Playing with High honor is the best way to play this game., although I wasn't a fan of this honor system at the beginning, it just adds that little touch of 'Realization' that Arthur goes through in the game.

815,oarsoid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Oarsoe/,6,1,0,55.1,December,"24,",80,1,1,"I have to start with words of praise for the game. I first bought the game half a year ago for PS4 launch and it was incredible. I finished the game, spent a good 100 hours in it and what a game that was! Truly a masterpiece. Logging into social club was awkward, but it never bothered me once after, so it was a smooth sailing.A couple of weeks back my friends convinced me that I need to join their posse in RD Online and get it on my PC. So I did, I bought the $80 edition, went through the 100GB download and wanted to start playing. I was expecting something on par with my PS4 experience. Boy was I wrong.Game requires not one, not two, but THREE launchers to be operational - Steam, Rockstar launcher and the despicable Social Club.So far I've spent 30 minutes to 1.5 hours trying to start the game DAILY. Today was it - I sat there trying and trying and trying again and spent my last hour with red dead 2. I cannot start the game whatever I do.The vicious circle starts with ACTIVATION ERROR greeting me upon loading. Looks like thisThen it basically two things - either you are not logged on into social club, or the rockstar launcher. I tried both, with multiple captchas and every time it lags for MINUTES. Why? How much time does it require to verify the login, jesus!Second thing I see then is the cloud sync conflict. Naturally RETRY doesn't do anything! You start anew waiting each time for these stupid launchers to crawl for 5-10 minutes before even attempting to launch the applicationThen I'm being reminded that after paying $80 I still don't own the game: I try relogging into launch - and it doesn't let me complaining about authentication tickets I had to reset the password to break through this one. And boy was that fun - launcher was stuck with 'expired auth token' - and outright refused to log me in with a new password. Mind you, each attempt costs you a few minutes of LAG.Then I get another one after playing good 20 hours And another one And another one this one was so horrible, I'm still shaking - basically after the password change in the rockstar launcher, the social club just refused to let me into the game. It gives no options naturally, only Quit. What they don't show you is that you can press HOME twice then sign out there, then sign in, then quit the game (because at this stage it is no longer operational regardless of that you actually DID login into the social club), and then it MAYBE works. It gave me the menu, but after trying to get Online, I got disconnected with 0x10022190 - What is the reason for it? Only god knows. Some people on reddit say it's when you have bad internet connection. My 1Gigabyte network says otherwise.But when I do login, I have roughly 2-40 minutes to play before I hit another bomb with sudden disconnection and lost progress, naturally. It's HORRIBLE. It's mind-numbingly stupid, slow and borderline painful.That being said, I know I have quite a few hours played, but I just can't anymore. It's a great game that I can't play. A few days in a row I spend more time trying to login than actually playing. It's ridiculous experiense that leaves me filled up with anger and disappointment."
816,Ossi ㋛,https://steamcommunity.com/id/armanossiloko/,6,,1,56.6,April,"23,","1,058",0,1,"The popularity of Red Dead Redemption, being a console exclusive, was incredible. At the time, the Internet was full of fan made art and posters of the game and even some fan fiction continuations of the story. But, beside a really great DLC - named Undead Nightmare, the franchise went silent for years, though, it was never forgotten. Everything went viral in Fall 2016 when Rockstar teased the return with a new company logo, themed similarly to the colors which the franchise is known for. It turned out that a new Red Dead game was in development, which is set years prior to the popular ""sequel"". Knowing 2010's Red Dead Redemption, RDR2 had a lot to live up to with a limitation to the story, having in mind that many players already know the outcome. It's oddly satisfying to say that it manages to deliver a beautiful, carefully written story with a big number of memorable characters you interact with. It's set in 1899, an era where the society began to modernize and little to no space was left for the dying breed that the cowboys were. Dutch van der Linde and his gang refuse to accept the new ways of living and are in constant clash with the law. You, Arthur Morgan, are part of that gang, one of Dutch's closest people and are set on a quest to earn enough money so that the gang can leave the area and disappear once and for all.Dutch's ideals are phylosophical and often not the most unrealistic ones, but the way of going through that path has to result in constant robberies and a huge number of dead people, both innocent and guilty ones. After a disastrous robbery attempt in Blackwater, the gang has lost a lot of its members. The law is constantly chasing them and there are bounty hunters waiting around corners, ready to kill. On the run, the gang is slowly being torn apart. Arthur is a man of a slow realization of his gang's terrible deeds who, while remaining loyal, is starting to question Dutch's transformation and his way of handling situations.The camp is crucial to the game and story... Or so they want us to think. Dutch will complain about being broke no matter how much money you donate. Essentially, all the camp activities can be totally ignored, and nothing will change, really. Beside Dutch, there are some, expectedly, familiar faces in the game such as John Marston, his wife and son and a few other characters known from the original Red Dead Redemption. Essentially, it is very hard to provide any details without spoiling the end of the story, but RDR2's story is beautiful. Arthur's character transformation throughout the story is haunting and in reality, I started playing the game wanting to play as John Marston, but ended up wishing to remain as Arthur. His character arc is really amazing and he certainly is one of the best protagonists I've ever seen.One of the crucial elements of any game is its gameplay. From the wide variety of animal life to the random encounters with strange NPCs and the weird and mysterious places you may come across, RDR2 has a lot of stuff to offer. Alongside the main story, you'll occasionally meet strangers - paleontologists, beggars, other outlaws on the run as well as an occasional NPC in need of help, their variety tends to be interesting and creative from time to time - there was an instance where I was able to watch a doctor amputate an NPCs left arm. Unfortunately, these seem to be too scripted and I found myself in a few occasions where I helped a prisoner on the run and left the area before he was able to speak to me, only to cross the path with the exact same NPC and the exact same problem a few hours later, just in a different place. Eventually, I helped him again and waited for him to finish his line in order to avoid the same meetup again.People can be weird at times and riding a horse often caused encounters with strangers who greet me. The game provides a fun option to talk to any NPC, but I found myself avoiding this since you can never really know what Arthur is going to say next, no matter whether it's positive or not. Random NPCs sometimes greet you in the wild, and while I'd gladly send some greetings back, it feels a bit too much work to stop the horse from riding, focus on the NPC who may already left and then talk to them. At the end of the day, it's the littlest interactions that truly magnify the experience. There was an instance in the camp where two characters had a discussion whether the gang is losing their way and after few arguments, Hosea turned to me and ask me of ""my"" opinion.The controls are binded the way they are natural, but there are often really unresponsive, especially while riding a horse. The horse sometimes may or may not slip over anything. The bond with your horse is important, since a it will result in both better and easier controls as well as the distance within you can call it. If it's far away, you'll have to wait for the horse to physically return to you. Stealing a horse will mark it as a temporary one, and a nice touch was seeing how the game will remember its existence and the last place you left it the next time you play. Combat, on the other hand, feels really good and it has the positive elements of GTA5's with some improvements. Guns will have lower stats if they are not cleaned, but they won't be low enough for most players to care.The weather can change randomly within a few seconds and when it does, colder weather will impact your health, so you allegedly need to wear clothes intended for the current temperature. Arthur's actions won't have an impact on the story, but depending on the honor level, the same cutscene will play out differently. One of the things that impact the honor level is the so-called ""witness system"" - unfortunately, RDR2 suffers from the GTA police effect. The law will magically know you for killing a person in the middle of nowhere which usually results in a randomly spawned traveler running away to tell the sheriff. Every step of the horse, every animation, every plant and rock you come across are meant to immerse you into its beautiful open world, and it's incredible to see that the game succeeds in doing that more than often. The lighting is just phenomenal and it works really well. The game features a wide range of terrains - from the foggy and snowy mountains all the way to the swamps filled with alligators, it never ever felt repetitive. Even visiting the exact same spot feels like a totally new place. Rockstar has really inducted the power of QUIXEL's Megascans in a proper way and the result is just wonderful.The details of each gun and character is astonishing. The characters will be covered in mud if not cleaned, their health will worsen and Arthur's face and animation will changed based on his health or if he got attacked by someone. The skin may be brighter and reddish on sunlight and both mud and snow will have footprints if walked on.There's an outstanding cast of talented voice actors featured in RDR2; Rob Wiethoff and Benjamin Byron Davis reprise their roles as John Marston and Dutch van der Linde, respectively. The main character is portrayed by Roger Clark and he delivers the line wonderfully most of the time - it's a performance of a lifetime. The sound of the guns is great as well and has a nice few touches depending on the origin and area of the gunshot, so it will sound different indoors and outdoors.2010's Red Dead Redemption had entering Mexico playing ""Far Away"" by Jose Gonzalez, and that is one of the most wonderful moments in all of gaming. While ""Far Away"" doesn't return here, there is a similar equivalent - D'Angelo's ""Unshaken"", and it works well for RDR2's setting. Generally, Rockstar's music choice is top notch and I loved every bit of it.If anyone cares, here's some numbers:"

After nearly 10 years of waiting for the sucessor, it definitively paid off, the  game is  astonishing. The story and dialogues of individual characters are amazingly written. You can take your time with the story, explore many locations, or side missions which tell other interesting stories. As far as you can go, you can also do a lot of nonsense, caution here, because due to the high level of realism of NPCs’, they remember nearly every little detail of you (clothing, horse etc.) Nevertheless, which was also known, the game also has its issues. The game is very large and extensive that the developers have actually forgotten, to explain things a lot more precisely, which were relevant for gameplay. Of course there were also many PC bugs, but this shouldn't matter in terms of the game itself, but was a mistake by the developers. Since the game has definitely laid a new foundation for realism in games, I think that there are lovers or dislikes depending on the player. For me, it was great. In my opinion, one of the best games over the past 10 years."

I wont be the first person to say this but the game literally felt *alive*. Each npc moving around has its own personal life which it carries out over and over again, the animals react to you and the surrounding almost as if it is actually happening in real life. The attention to detail Rockstar put into this game is just marvelous. The story, the scenery, the gameplay is all just perfect and fits in extremely well. I've heard people say that the game is *slow* or just calling it a *Cowboy GTA*. I believe that the game actually tries to convey its story like a movie, In the first chapter, it sets up characters and lays down there traits and how they react to certain situations. Watching Dutch Van Der Linde, John Marston, Javier Escuella and Bill Williamson is certainly nostalgic and reminds how RDR1 was a Masterpiece too. The slow gameplay is needed to sets up the amount of chaos that's gonna happen towards the end. The major difference between RDR and GTA is that the latter is a blockbuster action movie with an okay enough story while the former is a slow paced Scorcese movie with cinematic moments and an amazing story and setting. Overall Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece 10/10 Edit: People complaining about fast travel is a valid point as game doesnt exactly explain how to use it properly. Basically you just need to set up your campfire outside any city and you can fast travel back to any loaction that you've been too. Hope it helps"
825,DRACER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IDRACERI/,20,5,1,498.5,May,"18,",622,2,1,"Absolutely amazing work and effort put in by Rockstar Games. This review is spoiler free so you can read this without worry.Graphics: The game's graphics are absolutely spectacular, especially when you finish the first chapter of the game. The lighting and fog effects are unbelievably good. The god ray effects in forests are realistic. Nighttime lighting is realistic as the moonlight spreads over the whole area instead of being a light in the sky. Character clothes have great attention to detail, along with the fur on animals, and mud effects in towns.Gameplay: The gameplay can be a bit of a slow burn at the start, but once the first chapter is done, the gameplay becomes less restricting, and continues to do so as you progress forward. The Dead-Eye system, which is a character ability to slow down time when shooting, isn't like regular slow-mo shooting, but you can tag targets to automatically shoot them when you press the shoot button. The gameplay is also very realistic as you have to maintain your guns to keep them working effectively (they can jam if you don't) and you also have to bathe regularly to keep yourself clean, eat regularly (but not too much at a time) to keep your weight in check and also you have to sleep and eat regularly to maintain your cores. The 3 cores (Health, Stamina and Dead-Eye) decide how fast their respective attribute regenerates. If you have full cores, the attributes will regenerate at the fastest possible rate. Another mechanic is horse bonding and to do this you have to groom, feed and be kind to your horse to bond to the maximum level i.e level 4. You also have to feed your horse regularly so they don't starve. All this may be confusing at first, and may be tedious to some, but you'll figure it out once you start playing the gameDetails: I could go on and on about this. Horse balls expand/contract based on the weather, wolves mourn other wolves' death, constellations in the sky are 100% accurate. You drown if you swim too long, boats sink if a hole is shot in them, you pass out if you drink too much alcohol, you can vomit if you eat too much. Snow, mud and blood can get stuck on your character's clothes, and clothes only get wet up to the part they have been inside the water. Also, let's not forget the great random encounters in this game.Story and side missions: The story is possibly one of the best ones in videogames. I won't write much about this as it's filled with spoilers, but rest assured, if you pay attention to the story, you will enjoy the game to its fullest. Coming to the other thing, side missions are often humorous and enjoyable, and are usually as good as the main story. Make sure to do side quests around the same pace as the main story.Characters: The characters are quite amazing. People who only played the first game may not like Arthur at first, but trust me, he is amazing. Then there's the iconic John Marston who isn't as great as he was as he is still young and foolish. We also have the charismatic Dutch Van Der Linde as the leader of the gang, and Bill and Javier as guns on heists. Other returning characters include Abigail Roberts/Marston and a 4 year old Jack Marston. There are also a lot of new characters like Hosea Matthews, Micah Bell, Lenny Summers, Charles Smith etc, who you all don't know at the start, but eventually come to form an opinion and virtual bond with them.I could go on and on but I'll just let you experience the rest. It is a 10/10 game made by the legendary company Rockstar Games, so rest assured, it's worth every single penny.Happy trails My Rating for this game - 9.5/10"

831,Ke1N,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ke1n4o/,7,,1,19.9,December,"25,","1,250",0,1,"Red Dead Redemption II was definitely one of the best experiences that I ever had in a video game.I bought the title day one on the PS4 and enjoyed almost every part of Arthur and the gang’s adventures. The story was enthralling and I remained interested in understanding what exactly went so wrong, that we got the “hell bent on revenge” John Marston in the first game (the second game is actually acting as a prequel).The attention the detail was amazing. Rockstar completely nailed every little thing and managed to make it feel not so tedious, I hugely enjoyed every realistic aspect of the game. The ability to have a “short conversation” with strangers, the fact that you and your clothes get dirty so you need to take a bath and clean them.  People will also react differently to you if you are wearing dirty clothes.Also, the fact that when your horse is dirty it impacts its stamina and you need to take care of him as well. These little things are doing a really good job of making the world feel alive.As with every other Rockstar game you have complete control (out of missions) in the world. You can explore as much, as you like. You can do various side missions and participate in a lot of the classic mini games that were present in the original. The amount of shows and attractions that you can visit is also really impressive, especially when you get to St. Denis, the performances there are amazing.The setting is amazingly done, I still remember the chills that I had when I played Red Dead Redemption 1 and went to Mexico, they are several plot points here that left the same or maybe even bigger impression on me. I just love the Wild West era.Graphically the game looks stunning, it looks even better on PC, of course from what I’ve seen so far. I understand that there were some issues with the port, welp I guess that’s what the 1 month of Epic exclusivity is for, to test and tweak the bugs, so that we can get a good release on the real platforms. The optimization sure seems strange at best, but unfortunately this has become a tradition with Rockstar ports… (it speaks a lot that the top reviews are all users posting fixes for crashing or other technical problems)They continue to treat the PC market as “second hand customers”, and sadly this is not changing soon.My only real gripe with this game is how “limited” the world feels when you are doing a “scripted” story mission. The game holds your hand too much on the story points, the freedom that you were having in the open world disappears and you need to follow the path that was set by the developers. You can’t do most of the things your way, which is kind of strange because it feels really limiting. I understand that they probably do that as part of the “cinematic” experience, but a big part of Rockstar games in the past was the complete freedom that you were having to fully create your own experience.I’m looking forward to playing the game - 1 year later with keyboard and mouse and with better graphics. I don’t know if it’s worth 60 bucks right now, based on the fact that it’s more than a year since the official console release, but if you are looking for a great story with an amazing open world, look no more.(I didn’t write anything about the online part, because I’m not familiar with it, I treated this game purely as a single player experience. Maybe I will check the online someday.)"

With a world so large I wonder just how much is ahead. I'm not prepared. I haven't had many graphic issues. Just FPS loss at odd moments otherwise it runs great.I can't wait for RedM to come out (FiveM for RDR2) to RP as a kickass cowgirl. Red Dead Online is also interesting, rather bare at the moment.

838,Sonic Punk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sonic_punk/,7,,1,230.2,December,"8,",971,0,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is the game that sets a new bar for all open world games. It took me around 190 hours to complete this amazing journey with 87% completion and I still have some side missions and unexplored lands left. The game is a prequel to Red Dead Redemption, so even if you didn't play the first one you can perfectly enjoy the ride and start hoping for a remake. If you played the first RDR though, you will definitely get the best experience, as some characters return and the ending part of the story is so connected to RDR that you will get emotional. There are two game modes available: story and online (which I barely touched). I would say that, even without the online part, the game is worth every single cent. Since it's a massive game, it's hard to write a proper review without taking every single aspect in consideration.Once again Rockstar elaborates its amazing version of the frontier depicting a world at the edge of civilization where there's no longer place for outlaws and gunslingers. Everything is narrated through the eyes of Arthur Morgan, a member of the Van Der Linde gang. It takes quite some time to introduce story, characters and world events, but it always feels natural. You will enjoy the story better if you treat the gang as your family, talking to them, fullfilling their requests, doing activities together. There are also some choices you can make that will indeed change dialogue lines, cutscenes and even unlock more story missions, so choose wisely when someone asks you to help. You will also be able to increase or lower your level of honor, depending on your actions, and that will affect how the other gang members react and talk about you.Speaking about longevity and replay value, every story mission has some challenges that will reward you with a bronze, silver or gold medal. Sadly most of these challenges require you to complete missions in the shortest time possible, which I think it's a wrong game design choice, 'cause the game is slow paced and you will get so absorbed by the dialogues that you won't rush just to get some medals. It adds some replayability but personally I don't feel like getting all the gold medals.The gameplay is as realistic and immersive as it could be: opening drawers, skinning an animal, tying your horse, picking weapons, looting corpses and much more. Everything has its own command, takes its own time and it's fully animated, with a level of detail that I never saw in any other open world game. You can even interact with all NPCs, though you will often have only three options: talk, provoke and rob. While most of NPCs will eventually start to repeat the same dialogues, this interaction is really useful with particular strangers, random encounters, gang members, animals and more. It's a kind of interaction that is based on context, so it's really important to keep an eye on the things you can say or do depending on the situation.Like the previous game, there's a level of honor connected to your actions. It helps define what kind of person you want Arthur Morgan to be, although his story is already written, so it's more about how he behaves and what others think of him.Horse riding is the best one I've seen in a videogame: realistic, social and not buggy. You can capture horses, buy and sell them. You need to take good care of your horse if you want to increase his stats and your bonding level which will unlock new riding abilities. Be careful though, your horse can be stolen or killed (you can revive him using a special medicine if it's not too late). Small tip: you can talk while riding, no need to get off your horse. You can also drive boats and trains.Gunplay is good. It's simple, but with all the available weapons you can get really creative. Not just guns but also arrows, throwing knives, explosives etc. You can also customize weapons and outfits of course. There's an Aim Assist feature that you can reduce or disable if you don't like. Red Dead also uses the Dead Eye system, which allows to slow down time and manually target your enemies before auto-shooting them all.AI is very good. During combat I've seen not only enemies taking cover and trying to flank you, but also trying to stab or disarm you. Enemies also react realistically when shot, they can lose their hats and get injured. Outside from combat, AI does a great job too. NPCs start looking at you if you follow them, asking what you want. People looking at you the first time you enter a saloon. Small things like this really help increasing the immersion.The world of RDR 2 is one of the biggest and most detailed I have ever seen. Every single region has its own unique beauty and wildlife: different forests, towns, mountains, deserts. The weather system is also incredible. You can tell when it's about to rain, you can hear thunders at distance, you can see your horse getting scared, the wind moving grass and leaves around you. RDR 2 open world is truly an amazing experience. As always, exploration is a key element. It rewards you in different ways:That's just a short recap, there's so much to do that you will never get bored.Generally speaking, soundtrack and sound design are great. The game has this random soundtrack system that selects the music depending on the place and the mood, which I think is amazing.Despite what others might say, the game is really well optimized. Even medium settings look amazing, but being able to play the game at higher settings is breathtaking. In any case there are so many options to tweak that you can find the perfect balance between graphic quality and performance, it just needs some testing.One thing though. In the prologue area you might get a better performance due to the fact that you can't roam in the open world for story reasons, so you will only have a real idea of your performance after the prologue (which could take more than 2 hours).The only cons I could think of is the Rockstar Launcher. It's awful and it can give you problems if you want to start the game offline.RDO is a real Westworld experience. It shares the same huge map, so if you don't want to get spoilers about locations, I would suggest to play it only after finishing the main story, or at least exploring most of the map. There's a storyline that introduces you the online mechanics. There are co-op missions, side activities, co-op and pvp events, but hopefully Rockstar will keep adding more. Like GTA Online, the game includes microtransactions. It can be really grindy if you want to buy expensive horses and outfits and they probably hope you will buy some gold bars using real money.If you want to buy the game just for Red Dead Online, don't.With its living open world and its amazing story Red Dead Redemption 2 offers a true western experience you won't find in any other game."

848,Machiavelli,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DieNackteKanone/,7,1,1,354.3,December,"21,",53,0,1,"So I spend 90 hours in one week on this game... Am I mad?Background:Red Dead Redemption 2 is an action-adventure, open world game set in a wild west scenario. As its name suggests, the game is part of the Red Dead series and a prequel to Red Dead Redemption. You play as Arthur Morgan, an enforcer of the Dutch van der Linde gang. After a job went horribly wrong, the gang has to run and pick up the pieces to be able to leave the country for good.Opinion on the game:Lets get to it. This game is one of the greatest open world games ever. And I mean that literally. The world you play in is huge, the regions vary from a cold Rocky Mountain environment over the humid swamps of Florida to the arid and hot dessert wasteland of Texas. The world is so vast but yet full of life. Even in the remotest dessert areas or on the coldest mountain tops, you never get the impression that you would be alone in an empty world. Rockstar managed to put life into this game with the incredible diversity in the animal and plant fauna, the interaction with others and the map design in general. Especially the great contrast between the deadly wilderness and the life in all the small villages and towns really adds to the game's capability of immersing the player into a world as it could have been in the late 19th century in the wild west. A big contributing factor is that with exception of one character (to whom I come to later), all pro- and antagonists are credible, which is partly due the fact that they were played by real life actors.So the game is huge, not only in terms of space (on your drive) but also in terms of how mauch playtime you can get out of it. The single player camapign alone without doing any sidequests will take you at least 15 hours.The graphic and sound design are also incredible. There was one instance where I was in the desert during a severe storm. (You have a dynamic weather btw) The lighting and sound effects were so impressive that I was just standing in the midst of the storm for 3 minutes straight watching how the rain affected the wild life and environment around me. One of my all time favourite moments in playing video games was riding through Saint Denis at night. A post-Victorian era industralized city resembling the likes of what is now New Orleans. On the one hand, you see the ones profiting from the industrialization and just a few streets further you experience the lifes of the people that did not manage to cope with these changes. You see the snobbery and corruption, you see the poverty and you get a perfect understanding of why certain elements in the population reject the society this era produced.The interaction with NPCs is nothing but outstanding. You can talk to practically anyone and the responses will be always somewhat different. Some will even tell you their life stories if you dont leave in time. And others may try to rob and kill you...The protagonist(s) you play have the most important trait that I value the most in a video game character. And that is credibility. Just by playing the game, you understand why they make the decisions they make. And why they change the way they change. Rockstar has done a great job with that and this also includes the antagonists.So in summary, the gameplay experience this game provides is amazing. I can only think of two to maybe three other games that managed to immerse me into their world in a way that RDR 2 accomplished. It really ticks all the boxes so far but is it a perfect game?Even though I would really like to give this game a 10/10, I cant. There are two major things holding it back. One is the character I previously mentioned. Unfortunately, this character (Sadie Adler) feels so forced into the game since she is written way too over the top and exaggerated. This is why whenever you interact with her, she manages to destory single-handedly all the immersion created by the entirety of all the other game elements. Thats a real shame, especially since she is way more present in the last chapters of the game and really soured my gaming experience towards the end. Plus, her voice is so annyoing that at some point, I just skipped all the dialoge with her.The second aspect (and arguably or objectivley the more important one) is the fact that this game (on PC) is just a console port. Which Rockstar is not really famous for, and this is for good reason. This game is liable to crashing and freezing. Once you have to replay 30 minute story missions that basically only consist of walking and talking, you get somewhat frustrated. For a AAA title, the amount of crashing is just not acceptable. Furthermore, the menus, UI and also the interactions with objects can be clunky. This game was designed for consoles and you feel it every minute you play. Another issue is that this game is really hardware hungry/badly optimized, especially so if you want to crank up your graphics settings. Eg, I got an RTX 3070 and a Ryzen 5 5600X and I struggle to achieve 40 fps on ultra settings in full HD. Apart from that, there are also notable bugs and glitches in the game but I wont consider them in the final rating. This is because it is just ridiuclous to assume that anyone could create a world as huge and impressive as this game without having a small amount of bugs in it as well.Summary:In conclusion, this game is astonishing. If you have any interest in western themed scenaria, like open world games or prefer story driven games in general, get this game! You will not regret it. (Or maybe dont if you have a potato PC, otherwise the game might not even launch in the first place) Despite its shortcomings, it is easily in the top 3 games Ive ever played. There are only a few games out there, that achieve a comparable level of immersion and authenticity. Considering everything I stated above, I give RDR 2 9.8/10. This is a Game of the Generation contender, nothing short of that. Period. So maybe I might not be mad after all. Well, at least not completely...."

Sometimes I'm wanted for a crime when there was no-one for miles around to witness it - there's just no way to avoid being wanted, and it's no fun.The first Red Dead Redemption was a joy to play. This one is a chore. I keep playing as it constantly feels like the fun is just around the corner, but it never is."
850,Vlad 254,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VLAD4591322/,7,,1,113.6,January,"27,",154,5,1,"The prequel to Red Dead RedemptionMaybe you want action, maybe you need a chill game for a break in the action (this game has both). This game has it all and regardless if you played the first RDR or not you'll find this game is absolutely amazing, I'd go so far as to say a masterpiece. Sometimes there is more story than action but that's not to say it's a boring game at all and the story is simply superb. That said you do have control of how much action you want vs story. The game has stunning graphics, great gameplay, it's immersive and you truly get attached to the characters in the Van der Linde gang. I'd say Rockstar has mastered open world gaming with RDR2 which is a true western right down to the gun and saloon fights as well as the train and stage coach robberies. Call it an RPG where there are no skill or perk trees to put points in to at each level up as there is no character level system. You earn XP in 3 attributes, Health, Stamina, and an excellent aiming system called Dead Eye which are all leveled separately. You level up your stats in a learning-by-doing type system. You must do certain physical actions, such as sprinting to increase stamina, rowing a boat to increase health and shooting to increase dead eye. The map is massive. There is also a Honor rank which you control with good or bad deeds or even things like doing chores if you so choose. There are potions and food to control your health and weight and of course camping, cooking, even skining animals. In short this game is incredible. The game does a good job with both funny and touching moments I'm already looking forward to another playthrough where I make different choices. Iv'e played about 100 hours so far on my RTX 2070 with an i7-8700 CPU and have encountered zero bugs. I give this game a 10/10!"

This game really puts you in the world of the old west and allows you to relive your greatest old west and makes you feel like part of that world. Have played the 1st part on console and have been waiting for it to release on PC since it was announce and boy it was worth the wait.Writing 10/10Sound 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Acting 10/10The story was so breath taking and progressed beautifully showing the current adventures of an outlaw who has lived a life violence and sorrow. As the story progresses you learn even more about the character which may or may not make you feel for him. The story present many chances for big choices to be made which impact whether the character is good or bad. The soundtrack is impressive and really brings the story to life and greatly aided in bringing me to tears several times.  Game play was great and really inventive but at times it felt like a lot. In the end the acting greatly benefited the overall story and really added to the motion i think all the actors deserve a pat on the back. The Graphics of course was stunning the detail was almost felt impossible it really makes the game stand out."

864,Gunter Severloh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GunterSeverloh/,10,2,1,885.0,February,"2,",76,0,1,"Love this game!   Going to list some good and bad points:Good Points:==========- Graphically game is stunning, that is if you have the hardware to boot, I'm running the game on an- i7 -700k 4.20 cpu- EVGA Geforce RTX 2060 12gb- 32gb ram 3600mhz- 1 TB SSD- 4 500gb SSD's- PSU 1000wGame is smooth for me no hiccups, or stutters.   If you have low specs, low ram, no SSD, low end system then i suggest not buying the game, you not only may not be able to play it, but then the quality, and performance would be crap, and you would be frustrated because its not going to run like it should, so either upgrade ... seriously or dont by it, trust me, i've seen reviews where people complain the game runs like crap, yet they have crap hardware and they blame the game for their own lack, dont do it!- Graphics again -==============I use a Reshade ---> It seriously changed how my game looks without any performance impact.  Most of my settings are in ultra except for a few.- Gameplay -===========You can play in 1st & 3rd person! i love open world, there is alot of freedom, and then there is not depending, some things i wish it was just like skyrim, open, unrestricted, drop, pickup what you like, even instead of a story, i would have preferred to have a character creation like it is online.       Besides the hunting, fishing, looting, camping, and exploring, the world has amazing detail, it seems fairly authentic to how it looked back in the day, like i would know but from documentaries, pics, ect. i'd say it seems legit.          The weapons are pretty cool overall, sound, look, and function, i dislike the automatic reload, the automatic fill my gun up with bullets when i shot 4 and have 2 remaining and i holster the gun and then pull it out and find a little gremlin has filled the gun for me, wtf    You can change that with a mod ;)     Deadeye, i dont use it, i play hudless, since im an Arma fan and used to simulations, thats how i prefer it, i dont care for the deadeye, i think its just cheating, and its a fools tool, for me it breaks the immersion so im happy that you can have the option to not use it, i prefer looking at the map and using my brain. I prefer the challenge and the threat it makes you think about your tactics, and how to overcome or go about doing something.- NPC's / AI  -===========    The fact that NPC's respond to you based on what you do, what you say ect,. is to me the 1st i have experienced in any game, i find it incredibly immersive, i do wish there was a bit more to it, like go into further dialogue with them, but if you keep hitting greet, or even antagonize it will go a bit further.    NPC's remember you, even after you haven't been around for a while, thats all of them, if they've seen you before, if you have good honor they respond accordingly, this to me is very refreshing in a game, it makes it more as i said alive, immersive, but more interactive, also effects you emotionally to a degree.- Animals, Hunting,Fishing, other things related -=====================================  I mostly do hunting, and fishing, skinning animals is pretty realistic, when i skinned my first animal it was a bit gruesome to see but i got used to it, i actually felt sorry, empathetic, sad for the animals when i shot them as they do respond, i mean they cry out in pain if they are wounded, its scary real where you feel guilty, like you feel bad to have done that.    Of course you know its a game too, so still for a game to stimulate those feelings really adds to the immersion.  The predators .... Scary!  Wolves, bears, watch out for them, be ready!!!   i dont want to say they are rare but when you do come apon them your horse will get antsy and start going crazy, best get off him and find high ground with a view and some distance.   Been killed a number of times by wolves, cougars, and bears, but most encounters were warded off or i ran.    Animals are ""alive"" they respond like they would in real life (to a point, im no expert but its believable), predators are scary, either run like the wind or kill them!  Other animals, may either ram you, bite you, or run from you, so watch your step!- Horses -========    Horses are awesome, customize them, gear/equipment like saddle ect,. even their tail, ect,. treat your horse with respect, feed them, pat them, wash/brush them, and you will bond with them, ya its that real, theres 4 levels of bonding, after level 2 they respond to commands, you can tell them to stay, and whistle for them provided their within hearing range of you.   I have 3 horses, i use all 3 at the same time, you can name them too, and tell them to follow me, and stay when i need them too.        You can individually call them, tell them to stay, ect,. but i use all 3 for hunting, for carrying pelts, and hides which will gain you more money when you sell them.   Just remember your horse is everything in this game, ya you can run everywhere on foot but then why would you, the horse is pretty realistic and feels very immersive, its like riding a real horse, and yes i did when i was a kid.- Story / Game -=============Story is pretty interesting, the game is fairly linear up til you get to chapter 2, as its made to be an immersive story tutorial you just dont know it, its pretty cool how they do it.   There are missions, the main quest missions with the gang your with are what progresses chapters, the story is immersive and really brings you into the game and characters emotionally, theres alot there!- Bad Points -===========- Game can be linear with some missions, overall its free roam.- I wish the game had more customization for your character instead of a set character, otherwise you can change the look of your character (Arthur Morgan)I would rather have to create a character and spend 1-2hrs on features, looks, ect,. then just go with it, however your character's hair, beard does grow, and can be long, and you can get haircuts and shave to how you want to look, change your clothes, and there are many other customization's for weapons, gear and for the horse so thats good at least.- Not everything is interactive.- I hate in some instances when you setup camp in a certain spot (unlike skyrim camp mod) where you camp, you dont end up there, its close though.There is a mod where you can camp anywhere so if you dont plan to play online and like camping get that mod!- Honor system needs some tweaking  - dont loot knocked out people = bad honor, anddont kill horses are the two most things imo that lowers honor quickly, unless your a straight up outlaw then thats up to you.- Time can be a bit ""fast"" and the weather goes with it, i mean its not super fast, but the day change still takes quite a bit, You can change it with a trainer, a good one is one that comes with scripthook rdr2 weather its pretty cool too.- Deadeye as said before to me is stupid, it breaks the immersion, i wish it weren't in the game but i dont use it so thats good enough.=========Idk what else to say here, its a good game if you have the hardware and if your into westerns, if you like western movies, or even old history then this game will be for you.=========LastlyWatch this video, its 37min long, but it goes into detail, its funny as hell, but its the truth, if you have any experience with Rockstar's game this guy tells the truth on how RDR2 plays he nails it:Here are some resources for the game:Mod Websites===========Nexus - RDR2Game GuideMapsFull mapInteractive RDR2 Map"

Sorry friends but I did not get that feeling. After beating the story and plenty of side quests (not all) that took me over 55-60 hours, only thing in my head is WHY the hell are 99% characters so stupid.People were intelligent back then same as today, but the amount of stupidity and retarded actions in this game is unreal. I didn't feel well playing the game where main character and his friends had IQ lower than outside temperature, and yes it's winter.... In any case amount of playtime and replayability  justify the price of the game, that is for singleplayer/story mode.Now the major thing, WHY negative review?!I do not understand how is it possible for a Rockstar, AAA dev/publisher multimilionarebiollionaretrillionare company  to allow themselves to release the game that is NOT working properly.First there are random crashes in singleplayer, some players experience it more some the less, I was lucky that I had maybe 5 crashes in interval of 50-60 hours, that was tolerable.However, ONLINE, that's the trick, it keep crashing,crashing and crashing due Rockstar end, it crash you in middle of mission, it crash you with inventory and horse full of goods that ofc disappear... you get the picture.WORST part on this subject is that I saw people complaining about this 0x20010006 error BS for over 7 months.... 7 FU MONTHS.... that brings be to conclusion that it may never be fixed.P.S. Almost forgot, loads of cheaters, in almost every event, you get at least one or two... god mode on, aim on... If I didn't see it with my own eyes I'd say yeah Im bad, they were better, but after shooting at man over and over again and his hp is stucked at full not to mention legit scores such as level 20 with 50kills 0 deaths.... convinced me again that Rockstar anti-cheat is a joke same as in gta5.And worst thing about this is that you cant report players after event is over, only in middle of it. Thats it from me :D But yeah it's great game, hopefully they will fix it in future.UPDATE 10/1/2022Just installed the game again to see if I can enjoy it some more... aaaand I'm happy to see that connection has been fixed and It's playable. HOWEVER still sea of lowlife cheaters, it's impossible to play anything online  involving shooting, unless you have a cheater in your squad too. Still remains negative review."

So I adjusted my Graphics Card a tad, and there have been no issues to report. You don't really need Ultra Settings on everything. So I knocked a couple down a notch. I'm not going to bother listing my FPS, because I totally hate the  that lurk around out there, but the game runs nice, and smooth for me, and my benchmark test ran just fine. In-fact, better than I expected.I also got the  to work properly without any lag, or stuttering. No need to fiddle around with files placing this here, and that there, as noted on the forum. Now I can go into the games  and take some nice pics.I like the grit of Westerns (movies or games), and this game is a real treat for me to play. The story thus far is engaging, and the graphics are superb once you get the right mix. I only play  so you'll have to go elsewhere for a review on Coop/MP.So, if you've got the money, give it a try. This was an early Christmas Gift for myself, and I'm not regretting the purchase price for the Special Edition."

You decide. The characters are all amazing in my opinion, of course the most loved one is Arthur because you form a bond with him the more you play the game. So after all, it's a very good game to play, if you'd like to feel like you're in the Wild West, than this game is for you.I know some people have technical issues with the game, but personally, the only issue I had so far was an infinite loading screen that occurred in RDO.

Even though I know that the problem is often sitting behind the screen, in this particular case I can say with a great certainty that I have done everything in my power to get the game running stably.(...Searching for corrupt files; switching between Vulcan and Dx12; testing the graphic settings; using health care and 'SFC /scannow' in cmd etc.; using DDU to freshly reinstall my drivers; using steam commands as '-ignorepipelinecache'; etc etc etc...)I really want to like this game and have spent much more time then I would like to admit trying to fix this mess Rockstar Games has released but after 15 hours even I surrender.I hope to get this game working one day, but my patience is not endless and it has now reached its limit."

The soundtrack chosen for the main menu, gameplay, cutscenes, and many different missions are amazing and are perfectly timed it gives you chills. The gameplay is detailed where you would do many things realistically and it's extremely fun. The graphics and details are just unbelievable it will really amaze you so much that it makes you stop and look at your surroundings just like in Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt.

Be ready for an unoptomized game; You've been warned.Grind: Compared to every MMO I've played and the grind hell that is GTA Online, this is a breath of fresh air. There are two currencies = Cash and Gold. Both can be obtained in fairly healthy amounts in-game. You CAN buy gold with IRL money though, but you don't have to at all. Gold is easily obtainable in-game and when bought with IRL money only speeds up progression instead of being a blocker from even being able to compete with others. A LOT of content automatically either makes you unkillable or instanced so harassment and endless murder during a mission is almost unheard of.Hackers: Unlike GTA Online, they are rare or at the very least, not as public about what they do. Because of the way the game plays, it's not exactly very fun for them to harass people. Not much of a reaction and that results in a ton of them either not being around or just not harassing people. I've run into a single hacker over the last 2 weeks i've been playing nonestop + multiple different timezones.Balance: So far so good, nearly every weapon is great; with a few rifles being borderline overpowered. It's still pretty fair and you don't feel like someone has bought a win against you. You can min-max some stuff so there are still the crazy guys that are harder to take down so try to be ready for them during a match.Focus: Instead of the power fantasy obsession of GTA Online, you get an incredibly solid western fantasy with all the horse riding and cowboy-Outlaw badassery included. If you don't enjoy long horse rides you won't enjoy this game. Tons of outfits, tons of PvE content to do, a large amount of it instanced as to not get harassed.Community: Miles better than the other platforms ESPECIALLY when compared to GTA Online. Folks naturally get into their roles and characters, due to the game's focus out of being a murder obsessed psychopath (GTAO) and into being your own character with a grey morality. There are still people that will kill you in the open world but they are a minority instead of the majority. You'll still get the odd ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the PvP modes but they're uncommon and easy to ignore.Most people you run into just say howdy or try to group up. Had a guy the other day tell me merry christmas, that's the kinda thing I love about this community.Be a little more trusting and you'll see that most folk are quite fun to interact with and a bit of a tussle didn't hurt no one. Don't take it personallyKids are rare (Due to the horse riding being boring for most of them) So that's great for us fellow adultsOverall a fantastic experience, I pissed off my significant other with how i've been obsessively playing this!9/10 needs more horse armor (I'm joking Rockstar please don't actually do this)"

I felt happy and sad, but I'm glad i put in the time to play this awesome story.The world is beautiful, it amazes me what some developers can do with the current tools at their disposal and other prefer to take the quick route and do a poor job.

Between GTA IV and V and the previous Red Dead, we’ve beheld iconic performances and tremendous leaps in animation, physics, and immersion. While you can sense the DNA of the acclaimed studio’s previous work in the follow-up to their Wild West hit, it’s nearly evolved past a point of recognition. I’ll come right out and say it: Red Dead Redemption 2 is a masterpiece that transcends the current generation and elevates gameplay and storytelling to a level of which is unprecedented. It exceeds far beyond my own expectations, and following more than seven years of passionate development, Rockstar has prevailed in crafting the finest game in their history and unequivocally the most immersive open world ever created.The story occurs in 1899, more than a decade before the events of John Marston’s tale in the first game. As the 19th century draws to a conclusion, so too does the era of outlaws in the American West. You fill the boots of Arthur Morgan, a senior member and lead enforcer in the infamous Van der Linde gang. Following a job gone haywire in the town of Blackwater, the gang heads north to escape the federal agents and bounty hunters who are hot on their heels.You quickly grasp a sense of the inevitable doom that awaits the gang’s lifestyle. The civilized world is rapidly evolving, and their ways of living within it are shifting to survival tactics as they rob and fight across the American frontier. Throughout the story, the gang relocates to diverse areas as they flee law and order. While they intend to steal enough cash to escape the clutches of justice once and for all, they struggle to make ends meet as divisions rise.Expertly paced and masterfully written, the tale of the Van der Linde gang is one that will forever remain with me. The game takes you on an emotional roller coaster as you get to know Arthur and his fellow gang members throughout sixty plus hours of the main story. Themes of loyalty, betrayal, revolution, and the American Dream are woven deep into a truly captivating, funny, and at times heartbreaking narrative. I loved every moment I spent with the engaging and diverse cast as the story unfolded, and I desperately wish I could experience it all over again for the first time. What’s more is the prevalence of player choice, and the world reacts to your day to day decisions as Arthur Morgan."

Far, far too many hackers. They are unbridled currently. They will spawn you into locked rooms, kill you repeatedly with a kill command, drain your bank accounts, teleport, run around in god mode, aim bot, pick you up and drop you from high altitude and just generally ruin the entire experience. Pretty much guarantee your game will be ruined by a hacker at least once every 2 hours. Maybe more. This will require you to quit the game and start another...which you will find is a common theme.Then there are the bugs / glitches. The VERY first thing you do in the game is glitched. It asks you to name your horse, and freezes there. A restart is required. Pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the experience though. Long load screens that load into black screens or never load at all. Poor animal spawn rates..where most everything in the game revolves around animal spawns. Not getting credit for daily challenges you clearly completed, while everyone else in your party gets credit. Your horse will sometimes just stand still, cant be moved. Many things require you quit the game and restart completely to resolve. This is just scratching the surface...but the running theme seems to be restart the game every few hours or less and watch long loading screens. Cross your fingers it actually loads.On the positive side, when everything works as intended the game is beautiful and fun. But the hackers and glitches REALLY hobble the experience.*update* LOGGED IN 2 YEARS LATER AFTER UNINSTALLING, VERY FIRST GAME WITHIN 5 MINS encountered 2 hackers using god mode, spawning in tornadoes, etc. Relogged to a different lobby, connection kept dropping every 5 mins.

920,NickyJ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NickyJ3/,5,,1,648.5,January,"16,",216,0,1,"Several hundred hours later into the game, I have two different ratings for the game:Singleplayer: 10/10. The story is superb. It's linear enough to truly be a story, but with an open world that lets you choose when you want to move on with the story. The moral system gives you a fair amount of influence over how you look at the story and the main character. The open world ranges from beautiful snowy mountain peaks to swamps and deserts. Many interesting jobs and people are found in those lands, all of them unique but not so outlandish to be annoying (looking at you, GTA).Multiplayer: 5/10. The open world has lots to do, but 80% of it is locked behind a pay-or-grind wall covered with suggestions to pay. Each set of skills you can use (bounty hunting, trading, moon shining, etc.) is unlocked through gold bars that you can spend a week or two grinding for, or you can TOTALLY JU$T $HELL OUT $OME MONEY, JU$T CLICK HERE FOR YOUR PA$$. They're cool once you get them, but it gets boring fast if you don't have a solid group of friends to form a posse and play with. Server stability is also lacking. Not as horrid as it once was, but the game has inconvenient moments of crashing after taking your ingame money but before giving you possession of what you bought. Too bad lol, guess you'll have to buy that train ticket again.Oh yeah, the singleplayer story is about working for a gang of thieves who rob banks and trains, right? Well you can't do that online. But you can buy the content where some nature hippie gets mad at you for killing animals when you hunt for your traders business. Priorities."

I'm a huge fan of immersion in games and this game has really set new standards for me. The story itself is fantastic but it was the rich open world as well that tied me up in front of my PC. You play as Arthur Morgan in the year 1899 who is a gangmember of John Marston's old gang and get to see what happened before the events of Red Dead Redemption 1. Every gangmember has his or her own unique background story making them distinctive. Ruthless gunslingers or sweet and innocent looking young women who take advantage of their skills as thieves. You really get to either love or hate them. The story missions offer much variety. Next to the obvious robberies and heists there are also few fun missions that made me smirk but i don't want to spoiler here. Just a small hint  The open-world felt vivid. NPCs weren't simply just chunks of meat standing around but felt like real people. Every simple action has consequences, from simply robbing a shop owner to robbing a whole bank.Red Dead Redemption 2 has its own crime & bounty system. You get to choose as what type of person you're playing as. Be a ruthless outlaw or a kind and merciful feller. Be a good guy and gain advantages like reduced prices at shops. Be an outlaw and have bountyhunters hunting you. As a gangmember you constantly have to keep your other gangmembers in mind. You're basically responsible for everything. You have to hunt for food or pay the ammo for example.In addition to that RDR2 even offers an immersive hair-system as well a weight-gain system. While the hair-system does not actively change your experience, the weight-gain system does. Eat too much and lose stamina, don't eat at all and lose health.There are a lots of activities and minigames that keep you occupied like poker, tabletop games, fishing etc. Furthermore, there exist numerous random events just like in the previous RDR. However, they're optional but they will increase your good honor stats once you help (The crime and bounty system i mentioned earlier). The event vary from helping a captured citizen who is held at gunpoint by outlaws to rather hilarious saloon brawls. Did i mention you even have friendship system with your horse?Graphicwise it really does manage to keep up with current standards. From forests to swamps to snowy mountains, villages, huge cities, canyons; This game just looks pretty yet it is demanding and i strongly recommend watching an optimization guide to get the most enjoyable experience possible.  It does not feel dull and every region has its own charm. There's a fast-traveling system in RDR2 but i rather rode to my destination!The gun system is pretty decent. There's a fair amount of guns you can choose from. Revolvers, pistols, shotguns, repeaters, rifles and more. Every single one feels like they should. The hit-feedback is amazing. I quite enjoyed the fact that bullets actually caused bulletholes in bodies depending on where you hit them and not just plain blood effects.What about the soundtrack? Breathtaking. While being scripted most of the times (there are no radios on horses duh) it gave the gunfights that certain ""something"".  The soundtrack made me wanna be a gunslinger wandering around on a horse. Not even exaggerating at this point. My personal favourite is ""American Venom"". Soundtracks that are not performed during combat are mostly harmonica ones.. since RDR2 takes place in the late 19th century. Okay, after praising the game i want to tell you something i did not like. The controls felt rather clunky in certain situations. I know Arthur is not a trained elite fighter. Instead of doing a roll he just throws himself into the ground when jumping to the side while aiming a weapon. Also, looking for cover can be fiddly since Arthur just goes to the nearest cover possible. By the way i played with a controller so i don't know what it's like with mouse and keyboard. Probably worse.Sometimes the horse does what it  wants and struggles to jump over the simplest obstacles or even worse; tripping over small rocks. While first being rather funny it got annoying.While reading other reviews you might have noticed how bad the online mode is. Does it really deserve the hate? I think it does partially.  While the PvE modes offer a wide variety of missions like heists, bounty hunting or robberies, the PvP experience is where it starts to stink. There is no shortage of coward cheaters in this game who will kill you for no reason. Does not matter if it's in free roam, during a mission or the shootout modes. They'll use godmodes, aimbots or invisibility cheats  to ruin your day. I encounter a cheater every fifth or sixth match. Apart from that the online mode is pure grinding. As a newbie you don't stand the slightest chance against other players in PvP. They have more HP, more stamina, better equipment and the worst of all far better dead eye abilities that are just unfair. Even if you want to change your clothing you must grind for several hours. A cool looking coat  or a somewhat decent gun cost around 250$ ingame dollars. A mission (approx. 15 minutes) usually rewards you with around 10-30$. You do the math. I'm not saying the online mode is not fun at all. I enjoy hanging out with fellow gunslingers and doing shenanigans but speaking of PvP... i recommend sticking to PvE (especially as a new player). I wish Rockstar Games would make more effort banning the cheaters.The single player is one of the best experiences i have had in video games. The story,  visuals,  cinematics, soundtrack,  gameplay has set up new standards for every upcoming triple A title.This Rockstar Game's open world   is a game you'll lose yourself in for 50-100 hours if not longer. You don't even have to like the western setting to appreciate the love and effort they put in this marvelous game. Regarding Red Dead Online; if you stick to PvE and have no problems with grinding it is fine. You will encounter good & bad people just like in any other game.9,5/10"

928,jnbek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jnbek/,6,,1,250.8,January,"23,",399,0,1,"Disclaimer: I have not played the Online Mode, the 229 hours you see logged are for the Story Mode only. I am one of those pedantic players who prefers to open the map, play all the side missions as they come available and wander around checking out everything in my path, I also have not played this before on any other platform, so I can not offer any comparisons with the original platform release. I will start with the Story itself, the writing is top notch, there are very few holes in the story, each event has a purpose and serves to move the whole thing along. You're given the opportunity to shape your character's personality and will find yourself getting really attached to your characters and a number or the NPCs. I really like how well thought out the story lines were put together. I want to avoid spoiling anything but I really appreciate the zero tolerance for certain ways of thinking and how the consequences vary depending on the ideology of the NPC involved. Certain actions will be ignored if the NPCs ideology is repulsive, but if the NPC is forward thinking or well liked, the exact same actions will place you in a pretty difficult situation that will prove hard to escape from. I became very attached to my character and was very invested in how things turned out. Next is overall gameplay. I found the controls very intuitive and responsive using the keyboard and mouse. The older technology in the weaponry did pose some challenges initially, these are not GTA weapons with high fire rates, they reflect the technology of the day and you're required to work with these limitations accordingly. I was impressed with the attention to detail with the weaponry, how the horses and wagons handled, and the need to properly care for your horse as well as yourself. I did get somewhat annoyed with the idea that the temperature was 42F and I go and got my ass bitten by a snake, beings as a snake is mostly unable to move at those temperatures, but this was a minor annoyance. Some of the AI for the other wildlife was also a bit weird, but made for some rather humorous interactions. Overall the controls and the feel is very comfortable and easy to work with.The graphics are beautiful, again the attention to detail is remarkable. I ended up playing at a lower setting, for those with powerhouse graphics cards, the possibilities are endless. But even on the lower settings, every blade of grass has it's own unique movement depending on weather conditions, movement of animals, NPCs, etc... you can actually see the grass react when a snake is 20-30 feet off moving away from you. The clouds were natural, the rain was great, I got caught in a thunderstorm and I was legitimately blown away by the level of detail, the heavy rain affected long distance views even more so than a normal shower and the lightning effect blew my mind. Overall performance, 95% of the time, I had no problems with performance, there were occasional times when jumping on a horse and attempting to leave town in any kind of hurry, there were occasional 'blips'. I did have issues with crashes that a number of other reviewers have mentioned. I made no effort to try to fix anything, but almost on queue, after about 3.5 hours of playing, the game would crash. I did notice that it tended to be more common when using the Steam Overlay, or if a Steam Notification popped up particularly when attempting the above getting on a horse to leave town behavior. Once I stopped using the Steam Overlay, the occurrences of crashes were reduced significantly, there were a few days where I played 8-10 hours and did not have any crashes at all, only for the next day to have it crash an hour in. I was pretty annoyed by these crashes, but it is worth noting that never did I have the game crash when on a mission and I'm a pedantic saver, so I had no issues of losing any progress. I never went as far as disabling the Steam Overlay to see if that corrected the crashes, but I'm convinced that this is where the core problem lies.IMO this is the best game story wise that Rockstar has ever made to date. Rockstar never disappoints when it comes to graphics and detail in their games either, they push whatever hardware they develop to the max and make a beautiful presentation with a story you can get invested in. You will find plenty of easter eggs, mysteries and some things that will make you kinda sad and other things that will make you go ""Oh wow!!"" scattered all over the map, if you just go looking for them. Overall this is a 10/10 game, but the crashing force me to give it an 8.5/10."

The environments are lush and the long draw distances make the game look gorgeous. I have fooled people before that screenshots from this game are real photos, that's how real it looks in some instances. While the shadows and reflections aren't quite as good as some of the new RTX titles, they still look amazing. The only place where the graphics fall short is the textures. They often looked blurry and I installed a mod that allowed me to apply a sharpness filter to fix this. ---{Gameplay}---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It‘s just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don'tDespite some wacky controls and mildly irritating small glitches, I really enjoyed the gameplay aspects of this game. Gunplay was fun and the missions had a lot of variety. The variety of the missions was great as you didn't expect the same exact thing with each missions. This was an especially good thing after recently playing a Ubisoft game. Some of the controls, specifically the horse controls, were mildly annoying. Sometimes my horse would just go in random directions and I failed missions as as result. I guess this is realistic, but not something I want when playing a video game. And because of the similarity of some controls, I sometimes found myself accidentally shooting or strangling someone instead of getting on my horse or initiating dialogue. The cover system was also bad, but not quite GTA V levels of bad. Another thing that may not be for everyone is the extreme level of realism in the game. There are several mechanics such as you character's and horse's weight, whether your character was hot or cold, and your horse's mood that could be mildly tedious at times to manage. While this may be a good thing for some as it can help with immersion, when I am playing a game I just don't want to worry about these things. In addition, Rockstar is kind of encouraging eating disorders with the ability for your character to lose weight by simply not eating or gain weight by spamming down an ungodly amount of snacks. Again. this mechanic isn't entirely bad, it just wasn't for me.  ---{Audio}---☑ Eargasm☐ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deafI was very pleasantly surprised by the music in this game. I have never played a western before this, and I was expecting more twangy country style music (narrow minded, I know). Instead, I got some of the best music I have ever heard in any digital work. There was unique music for each of the major missions that was uniquely fitting for that mission and the tone of the game. I found myself humming the songs even after I stopped playing the game. My favorite song in the game was ""Unshaken,"" which Rockstar got D'Angelo to perform specifically for this game. The scenes with this song were some of the most beautiful scenes I have ever seen in gaming. In addition to the music, the ambient sounds, sound effects, and voice acting were all convincing and added to the game. ---{Audience}---☐ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ AllM rating is accurate. Plenty of violence, foul language, and heavy content to ensure that the game is not suitable for children. ---{PC Requirements}---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☐ Fast☑ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computerWhile much better than what I read it was like at launch, this game still has some optimization issues and doesn't perform as I would like on my PC hardware. Combine this with the game being overall very demanding and you get mediocre framerates on all except the best hardware. I was playing at 4K on a combination of ultra, high, and medium settings and got anywhere from 55-80 FPS depending on the situation. I have an RTX 3090 and 3900XT, so my PC is a beast. Not bad performance and totally playable, but I would've liked a consistent 70+. Also got some random stutters, which was odd and mildly annoying. ---{Difficulity}---☐ Just press 'W'☑ Easy☐ Significant brain usage☐ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Difficult☐ Dark SoulsI didn't have trouble with this game at all. The abilities such as deadeye and dual wielding made it much easier and more fun. ---{Grind}---☐ Nothing to grind☐ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☑ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You‘ll need a second life for grindingFor the main story, there is no need to grind, as you get plenty of money from just the main story missions. In fact, I consistently found myself with too much money with nothing to spend it on. The only scenario I could see the need for grinding is if one was trying to collect every single item in the game, or just kept spamming down so many snacks that you'd buy out every single general store on the map. ---{Story}---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It‘ll replace your lifeThe story is by far the best part of this game. While a little slow at the beginning, it is absolutely worth getting through it as the middle and end of the story is phenomenal. The story is very emotional and can make you laugh and cry all withing the same mission. The characters are amazing, and I can easily see why some say that Arthur Morgan is the best video game protagonist ever made. His story arc along with the other characters' is beautifully written. It is extremely difficult to put into words just how beautiful the story of this game is. The main story consists of 6 chapters and 2 epilogue chapters. The epilogue, while good, felt like it was drawn out and was a bit of a letdown after the phenomenal main story. It was filled with somewhat mundane missions that involved scooping horse sh*t to constructing a house that could have easily been made into cut-scenes. However, from what I've read, the epilogue does an excellent job of setting up RDR1 if you plan on playing that (Sadly I won't play it unless Rockstar makes a PC port remaster as it is a last gen console exclusive, and I only have a PC). Mostly I feel that the epilogue could have been condenced into something around half to two thirds of the length that it was. All this said, I would consider this game a masterpiece, and the story is why. ---{Game Time}---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☐ Average☑ Long☐ To infinity and beyondTook me 55 hours to beat the main story and epilogue with very few side missions (I honestly wish I had played a few more). ---{Price}---☐ It’s free!☑ Worth the price☐ If u have some spare money left☐ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your moneyEasily worth the price for this masterpiece. Despite the fact that I got this game as a gift, I would easily pay full price for it knowing how amazing it is. ---{Bugs}---☐ Never heard of☑ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☐ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsOnly a few mildly annoying bugs such as my horse always being irritated and the audio being extraordinarily quiet (easily remedied by simply turning up the volume), but nothing game breaking. ---{Verdict}---I am a die-hard science fiction fan. When I got this game as a gift from my friend I was genuinely not expecting to enjoy it as much as I did. Despite this being the polar opposite of the games I usually play, I enjoyed it equally as much if not more than any science fiction game. If I can get as much enjoyment from this game as I did, I genuinely believe that anyone can. There are very few games that I would be comfortable calling masterpieces, and this is one of them."

PS4 (muddy as all hell - don't buy), Xbox One X (okay, but has HDR issues), Rockstar Store (unwanted launcher), Steam (unwanted launcher, but with easier to see achievements).Game prefers CPUs with more cores due to file I/O thread design; lower core CPUs (especially CPUs without HyperThreading) will hitch during asset streaming. Ryzen CPUs are especially good at avoiding sharp 1% low events, but not so good at achieving maximum framerate. Given the game's absurd GPU taxing quality presets, the distinction between Intel and AMD's strengths largely don't matter. Just get a CPU with SMT (HyperThreading) and you'll avoid wild framerate fluctuations.The rest falls entirely on your GPU. My RTX 2080 Ti does 4K HDR @50 FPS with negligible variation at mostly high settings (2.2 GHz GPU, 7.4 GHz Memory). Expect to spend some quality time fiddling with settings until you get volumetric effects (you want these!) looking good and performance stable.Special K has limited support for this game. Threading, and SteamAPI features work, but the overlay (and framerate limiter) only works on NVIDIA hardware and only with the game running in HDR mode. No ETA on when Vulkan support will be complete for non-HDR / AMD configurations. If you do have an NVIDIA HDR setup, SK will take care of tonemapping screenshots for import into Steam."

Seriously, it will leave you emotionally wrecked (in a fantastic way).  +Best open world so far with a ton of stuff to do (Cyberpunk may overtake it but who knows).+Beautiful soundtrack (Especially House building theme, Unshaken and That's the way it is).+Tense missions such as the train robbery missions.+Gorgeous visuals.+Incredible performances from all the cast.+Tahiti.+Great sound effects.+Incredible animations.+Extremely detailed and lifelike (Arthur’s pupils dilate, horses have shrinking balls, your gun performance changes on whether it is clean or dirty).CONS-Can feel clunky and over slow (I understand the game is MEANT to be slow but sometimes it can be a little too time consuming, especially for those of us who have jobs/school).-Guarma was cool but felt a little out of place (On a side-note Rockstar NEEDS to make a pirate game).-Bad optimization and performance-Game design is outdated and most missions end the same way.-Intro feels like one large tutorial but at least it serves as a good introduction to the characters and story. Don't skip it.-Despite the animations being the best we have seen in a video game, they can be a little too long and slow (Modders will probably resolve this).-No single-player DLC so far nor is any being planned (I am still hoping Rockstar surprises us).-Online is getting better but still lacks variety and can get stale after a while.Overall score:10/10- It may have flaws but it is still a true masterpiece.BUY FULL PRICE!"

Now it crashes roughly every half hour. I'd be somewhat forgiving of it if it weren't for the game NOT auto saving at some points during a mission... I'm writing this after having had to restart the same long mission 7 times because the game always crashed during it. Last attempt it crashed literally seconds before finishing the mission, yet on relaunching the game it still makes me start the mission from scratch... Unacceptable."

946,Yogo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogo19/,10,,0,101.6,January,"24,","1,075",0,1,"Once again a huge AAA title with good graphics and attention to detail, but disappointing in every other aspect.I will try to keep it the review as slim as possible, so let's dig into the pros of the game first. Don't worry, they aren't many.+ Great attention to detail (as I said in the beginning). The world is full of wildlife, the vegetation is diverse. The cities are bustling with life,the people are always doing something - they broom their property, talk to each other, smoke, drink, play cards; there are small animals like cats and dogs,it's just so nice and comfy.+ The scenery is very beautiful. What I really appreciate is that each area you go through feels completely different and has a unique atmosphere,attached to it. Jungles, forests, snowy mountains, beaches, you have it all.+ Amazing voice-acting on Arthur Morgan. The main character is pretty decent, to be honest.+ You can grow a huge beard and have a cool hat.Well... To be honest I was expecting the pros to be a little more than that, but truly I don't see anything else that would classify as a 'pro'.Let's see what's up with the cons.- Incredibly slow and mundane gameplay. I understand that the game is meant to be enjoyed slowly, but it's too much. I thought Red Dead was a game, where you are supposed to robtrains and banks and cause chaos. However, most of the missions are just a long-ass stroll with a bit of gunnin' here and there. The looting animations are soooooooooooooslow, too - it takes ages looting a pile of bodies or skinning an animal.- Pretty much a non-existent story. Basically, you're a part of a gang and do errand-boy stuff, so you can get your boss a nice new home on an exotic island.- Way too many characters. I don't know the names of 75% of Red Dead's characters, because they appear like 2 times in the whole game. Not only that,but they are so badly made - they are either very bland and completely lacking any kind of personality or they are so stupidly stereotypical, thattheir way of acting feels forced as hell. I didn't get emotionally attached to any of them- Every single gun feels absolutely the same. There is literally no reason for you to own more than 1 repeater, they all shoot at the same speed and have similar damage. Even if they didn't, you're always aiming for the head, right? Why would you even care what damage they have if you always 1-tap your enemy. The revolvers are cool, but they are useless. The customization options are terrible as well.- Nobody, except for blacks, say 'niġger'. When it comes to that word, it's always substituted with 'blackie' or 'darkie'. Now I understand that the slavery is over, butdo you REALLY think that after it was abolished and everyone magically started acting like they've always known it was wrong and are totally against it? I don't think so.- Karma system... Are you for real? ... This is a game, where you are the BAD guy, a villain, a robber and a murderer and you put a KARMA system??? I remember RDR1 also having such system,which pissed me off back then as well. So basically - I go to a town, rob a bank, kill 250 police officers and then I go into another town, greet 5 people and my Karma goes up? K.If there was a respect system - that would have been a different story.- Atrocious horse physics. Your horse tips over the tiniest little pebble on the road which can result into it breaking its neck.- Boring missions as a whole.- Dull soundtrack.- The legendary animal clothing is the ugliest abomination in the world.- The inventory management sucks. Too many items doing the exact same thing. Keep these things simple! Why would I need 100 different kinds of food that restore the same stat?- Failed core system.- Glitches, bugs, crashes, launching issues and horrible optimization.- Terrible Ultimate edition items and addons for a stupidly high price.Well, there we go. I'm sorry if you don't agree with me, but that's how I really feel.Everyone has the right to have an opinion and just know that I genuinely feel happy for you, if you are enjoying the game, although I sure as heck didn't!Also.....SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME THE WORLD WAS GONNA HANG MEI AIN'T THE SHARPEST OUTLAW AROUNDTHEY WERE LOOKIN KINDA DUMBWITH THEIR SEMI-AUTO GUNSAND THE PINKERTON BADGE ON THEIR JACKETSWELLWE WON'T STOP RUNNINAND WE CAN'T STOP RUNNINBACK TO THE PLANAND I HIT THE TRAIN GUNNINDIDN'T MAKE SENSE NOT TO LIVE FOR CASHYOUR PLAN GOES WRONGAND YOUR FRIENDS DIE FASTSO MUCH TO STEALA GANG TO FEEDSO WHAT'S WRONG WITH A BANK ROBBERYIF YOU DOUBT ME YOU'RE NEVER SAFEYOU'LL NEVER MAKE IT IF YOU LOSE FAITHHEY NOW, YOU'RE AN OUTLAWPUT YOUR MASK ONGET PAIDHEY NOW, YOU'RE IN MY GANGFOLLOW MY PLANHAVE FAITHBUT ALL THAT WILD WEST IS GONEONLY THE ISLANDS HAVE MY MANGOES"

See my stream on RDR2 Below; Hot air balloons, Horses, Prison Breaks, Bank robberies, tuberculosis, family feuds, snitches, Dutch's orders, ramblings, and keeper of his insanity. Buying this, you are in for an extremely amazing journey, more than 60 hours GUARANTEED STORY MODE, and travelling. Also up to you to prioritize, but travel = fast = your horse, or the horses you find, etc.This is 'My Little Pony' For adults. 99% of your RDR2 life is with your horse. You are nothing without your horse. Life in 1899 revolved around you having horsepower. Ain't no outlaw without horsepower.This game is marketed as 3rd Person Cowboy simulator:: BUT: :You can play first person cowboy!There is fast travel and this is how: It also becomes a very beautiful screensaver. You mark on the map where you want to travel, so you have the red mark, and then you hold V, enter cinematic mode, in the world, so that your horse navigates to the end mark with automation. You can hold shift to sprint, or tap it, etc. but otherwise, you can sip a drink, chill, relax, listen to the ambient sounds of the game. Escapism at its finest.The bugs noticed: 3rd person on   a horse, Arthur keeps putting a gun away that you are not holding, as it's holstered, and he keeps doing the animation as though he's putting it away when holding shift, and turning around corner, to the right, sucks, but doesn't break the game.Game breaking bug: played up until like 38% - Vulkan. I searched for 22 dinosaur bones, then the next day, the game will NOT start. Not safe mode, not altered settings. Only changing vulkan to DX12 fixed it. Now the game has longer loading times, etc. DX12 is a pain. Vulkan had that one bug. Loading into Chapter 3/ near the end, was not possible.You play Arthur Morgan, there will be lassoing of people -taking hostages, hunting animals in the wild, bows and arrows, guns, headshots, missions rankings- upon completions/bronze/silver/gold/R* ranks.You have three stats affecting you and the horse, which is health points and energy points, and you the gunslinger has a dead eye, where you squint for the best shots. The guns are cool, expensive back in the day, and very customizable. The mission types feels almost endless. I played block domino's, went bounty hunting, story witness searching to confirm something really happened and of the first  4, 2 were not crazy enough to mess with Arthur. The time of this era, feels like community building where everyone works together. There's so many letters to find, with small details. Or a location of where something is going wrong, and you are there to help fix it. Things go wrong. It's super fun. And that's just the way life is.  It's incredibly deep <Story Mode> You're on the run - I didnt play RDR 1 - so I dont know if it's connecting to Blackwater that way.. :/0 crashes in vulkan once all the settings are optimized, played for 5 hours straight last night. <28~29 December 2019> and used only like 1kwh. Fans required for gpu 45% as its definitely had the most impact on it. This goes hotter than pubg if I don't put fans on 45 instead of say 35, it can easily stay at 70^cFirstly - the Vulkan. It's smooth sailing. <latest Nvidia Drivers are smoother than 412...or something there> <plays better>It's running like a dreamNext, the Rust programming language- which comprises of vulkan ensures secure coding on the system it runs on. It can't even be malicious for you, unless R* permitted that release, This is one of the most beautiful looking games.  Correction. THIS IS THE DEFINTION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF GAMING> AGAIN!> Always Rockstar doing this amazing kind of work.The way the horses legs move  in and through snow is awe inspiring. Jaw dropping. The snow on the surfaces are also delicious. Character faces, textures of clothing, furs, cottons, so much tree-tessellating, it's just beautiful everywhere you look.The Faces, The expressions, the snow, the terrain, the backdrops, the sky around you, - Although it's quickly changing, it will constantly make familiar places seem foreign as you see it in a different light. It's exquisite, and with High Tessellation <Not Ultra-  but capable> - I still prefer FXAA Off, as the jagged-ness feels cheapened, where as no AA== Western, hardcore, everything. The Textures on High or Ultra -- Or even medium- to low - if your PC_ is capable of Vulkan rendering. You Require AT LEAST 4GB Free Video RAM - to let the game run without crashes. Borderless Windowed <Default::VULKAN> _ Change to FullScreen - For Issues - With Alt-Tabbing. It's not recommended for this game anyway.Even with it installed on a SSD, there's a lot of content. <BUG> Loading- into Menu - Game - Whether you choose Q || E - if you cancel and say you do not wish to quit, after a R* Game, Service - Cannot connect error - you are stuck in an Infinite Loop - of loading- the Gun Barrel -If you say not to quit the game, you need to do it through task manager, or taskbar, right click, or on the cross, of your Alt+Tab Menu's Either way- This is meaning you need to be online to play - even story mode <--- Unfair. I paid the price R* _ i desire to play the game in the 15000Hour comfort of my life Not On The Internet. Connections Aside:REDDEADREDEMPTION_GAME ENGINE:IF This is the engine that will present GTA VI to us, I am dedicated until the end.  For the first time, I supported a developer shortly after release <20% Off>. It's rare that I ever buy a game so early, but I raised the money to go and do it. VISUALS<The way your eyes adjust when you walk into or outside of buildings is already a game-changer. The negatives are a high price, and the minimum GPU's Requirements are going to be a pain. This Game will probably cause you to upgrade your PC< but when you can play it, the success and joy of playing is going to be beyond you.You also cannot alt-tab around- or leave the game idle for like 10 minutes.VULKAN Is the way forward - May Vulkan API outwit and secure everything in the battle Versus DX12 ->  It's way better mechanically speaking :D  <360FPS constant - Vulkan - GTX1070 - Zotac - Amp Extreme - -Best for your power bill too, because vulkan knows everything about overheads management.I7 6700 - DDR3 16GB RAM, and the game runs like a dream. Recommended purely out of the many joy's of being a cowboy. You are going to be riding your horse and coming over hills, and seeing fog in the swamp below, and it will take your breath away.There are soooo many places,. Because the map is GIGANTIC _ and it always looks so beautiful to see the environment.Make sure your R* account is also in good standings, etc. and you should be good to go :)"

It can change you personally if you make the right choices in game. I got it again for PC in late 2020 and it's just great fun to play the story over again. This is easily one of Rockstar's greatest achievements and I'm glad it won two Steam awards for 2020. I will recommend this game to anyone who loves playing story more than online. The music, the gameplay, the characters....there is a lot that can make you really immersed with this game.10/10 You deserve it, Rockstar."
950,'.The Sev.',https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSev/,9,,0,19.4,May,"14,",197,0,1,"Pros: Beautiful, era-accurate, immersiveCons: Game runs like absolute garbage on high-end PCs, I can't even imagine how it runs on lower end ones. Numerous community 'optimization guides' prove just how badly this game runs, as half of the graphics settings have inane and arbitrary performance hits. I can't stress enough how suffocating this game's performance has a tendency to be. Narrative pacing is so slow it is almost unbearable. Numerous major online bugs still haven't been fixed after half a year, and continuous server issues have plagued the game since release, even on consoles. It almost seems like Rockstar put forth an obligatory, cursory effort to port this game to PC and then moved on.I personally feel that Rockstar screwed the pooch on this. Joke's on me though, I didn't ask for a refund within the 2 hours of 'gameplay' it took for me to adjust the graphics settings just to get the game to run at a quasi-stable 60fps."
951,Kraut,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maeglin__/,6,,1,443.7,June,"27,",195,2,1,"Red Dead Redemption 2 is a fun game no matter what mode you play, story or online (or both). I originally bought this game because I love cowboys and westerns and it did not fail me. The story is amazing, many touching moments and the freedom of choice is something I adore about this game. You can either be known as a terrible man or a very honorable one. The characters are acted very well and you can see them as almost real individuals. Arthur Morgan is great, that's all I need to say. There is never a dull moment in the story and you can play it however you like! Online is fun, yet there are many downsides. Hackers, Modders, very grindy, glitches, etc. If you want to play online, do so with a friend or a group. I stayed up countless nights messing around with my friend(s) and having the time of my life. If you have none of those or like to be a lone wolf, online is a great time waster and I have found myself spending hours listening to music and hunting.  The game goes on sale often so I'd say wait for the sale, but if you really want to, it is worth the full price. 10/10 love this game and I bet you will to."
