I have sooo many hours into this game and I love it.  I admit I need my sons help and his friends to get me through things sometimes when it's a monster that's kicking my butt.  I'm now at the stage where I can do it on my own.  I think they did an amazing job with this game.  It doesn't matter how old you are, this is so fun.  I highly recommend this game.  Thanks for doing such a great job with this game."
3,Reivaz,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004248075/,720,18,1,"1,149.6",June,"13,",96,17,1,"I waited until I had at least 1000 hours on PC to write this review. Honestly there's so much to say about this game. Been a fan of the series ever since Tri, and I sank 800 hours into MHGU (which you can now buy on switch, which is dope).Let's start with the cons because I think it's more important to see if the cons are worth looking past if you're on the fence about buying.Cons:- weapon designs are less creative than older titles. Everyone knows that this game is notorious for taking a bland weapon design, slapping on a few monster parts, then calling it a day rather than creating a new design that creatively incorporates the actual design of the monster it's made from. HOWEVER, lots of the newest endgame weapons that were introduced in the Iceborne expansion are more creative and look fantastic. With the addition of layered weapons, this is less of a problem since you can make a bland weapon look like an endgame weapon or at least have it match your outfit- monster list is less diverse than older titles. Let's make a comparison between MHW and MHGU. With the addition of Iceborne, there are 68 large monsters to fight vs 93 large monsters in MHGU. However, in MHW, about 5 of these monsters are either tied to limited events or are not really noteworthy (zorah is pretty boring imo). So that leaves around 63 monsters. 5 more monsters are tied to the late game where you have to rank up enough to grind and unlock them. So that leaves you with around 58 monsters for at least the first 300 hours of the game. MHGU gives you 93 monsters that unlock as you naturally progress through the game, with 18 of those monsters being deviant versions that can progress alongside your hunter rank so that they scale into late game with proper rewards once you get there. Additionally, the monster diversity in MHGU is a lot higher. There's giant frogs, big mammoths, more monkeys, giant crabs, giant snakes, giant spiders, etc. Keep in mind, a lot of the monsters in MHW are ALSO in MHGU, whereas the opposite is not true. Iceborne helped to alleviate the diversity in MHW, but not nearly to the degree of it solving the problem.- it's a MH game, so grinding is a huge part of the game. This point is mainly for people who've never played the series. MH is a grind. To get better weapons and armor, you have to farm the monster enough times until it finally drops the parts that you need. Then you need to grind it again for the armor. And if you want other armors or weapons, you have to grind those too. With the addition of Iceborne, if you want to unlock the true endgame content, you need to grind your rank and farm the correct monsters to unlock the other monsters. Then you need to make sure you have enough supplies so that you can craft enough ammo/potions/etc. Grind, grind, grind. If you are not a fan of repetition, this is NOT the game for you. If you're a veteran of the series, this point should basically be meaningless. Why do you think I have 1000+ hours and I'm still playing?One thing that I think is more of a misunderstanding or neutral point is the gameplay difficulty. In the old games, G rank hunts were more dangerous compared to Master rank hunts in Iceborne. There are a lot of factors regarding the difficulty which people tend to either overlook or disregard. In the old games, monster animations were a lot less telegraphed. Some attacks would happen with very little warning visually, and sometimes you had to guess which move would come out. Healing was different because you ate a potion, then stood around and flexed for 5 seconds with nothing to do except wait for the animation to finish. Skill trees were harder to customize because you had to hit a certain threshold of skill points before the skill would even activate. Not to mention armor parts had less slots for your decorations. Monster attacks did much more damage because there were less upgrades available to your armor. Combine all of these together and you get hunts that were more dangerous because visual cues were less forgiving, you took more damage, had less skills available, and healing made you a sitting duck.In MHW, monster animations are much more telegraphed, which is much more fair imo. It makes more sense that you can see a monster wind up to perform a strong move instead of the monster standing still for 3 frames, then unleashing a move that could kill you. This means there's less BS moments when it comes to taking damage. If you got hit, chances are you saw it coming but might've been preoccupied with something else. Healing is different because you can now drink a potion while moving instead of standing around and waiting for the animation to finish. Again, this is another QOL improvement that makes more sense and leaves less room for BS or blaming the crappy controls. Skills are more easily available because even if you only have a single point in a skill, you can at least gain a minor benefit of that skill. Armor parts have more slots for decorations, so skills are even more accessible. Finally, armor parts have more upgrade levels. This is more just putting 2 and 2 together. If you have more upgrades to your armor, you take less damage.People have complained that MHW is a lot easier than older games, but really they've just fixed a lot of the annoying issues in the old games and given the player more tools at their disposal. If you really want to emulate the difficulty of the older games, don't upgrade your armor so high, don't use the ""meta"" sets, use less decorations so that you have less skills, and stand in 1 spot while you drink your potions. The beauty of this game is that you're not forced to always use the best gear or all of the tools at your disposal. You can choose to make things more difficult for yourself if you want to. But if you use all the best gear and you complain that the game is too easy, then that's a personal issue.If you can look past these issues or if they don't seem that bad, then you have a wealth of positive things to look forward to!- huge QOL improvements over previous games. Mobility, crafting, movesets, loading times, etc. If you're a fan of the series, I think you'll love the changes. Now that a lot of the old crap mechanics are gone, everything feels so much smoother and streamlined. Farming supplies is so much easier, weapon trees and stats are way more clear, item boxes are all over the base instead of a single location, etc.- graphics are beautiful. Everything just looks so good. Honestly not much else to say here. You just have to see it for yourself- gameplay is very satisfying. All the weapons have their own unique playstyles and all of them are viable when you learn how to use them. There's so much to explore when you learn the small nuances of each weapon and learn how certain moves can help position you for success. The game rewards you for learning monster moves, their weaknesses, how to prep for the fight, etc. And when it all comes together, there's something so satisfying about all your hard work paying off. Of course you could just go braindead and wack them until they die, but to each their own.- Plenty of content for months of replayability. As I mentioned, this game is a grind. You grind for armor, weapons, supplies, upgrades, equipment, decorations, etc. Grinding is part of the core gameplay, so once you finish the story, there's still plenty more to work towards- Iceborne is an amazing expansion. It basically doubled the game's content and introduced a real endgame. Weapons got upgraded, movesets were expanded. Everything just got better, and with more monsters to boot. A must have imo.There's so much to explore and grind that it will keep you coming back for more. If you're a fan of the series or are on the fence about the purchase and you can look past the cons, this game is more than worth the purchase. And at the end of the day, you're fighting beasts, dinosaurs, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dragons. What more could you want?"
4,Kosmozuikis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kosmozuikis/,540,20,1,106.9,June,"6,","2,657",21,1,"I’m not a fan of coop games and I really hate grinding but the goal of this game is grinding in coop. After seeing lots of positive feedback I decided to jump on this game and I was very pleasantly surprised.For those who don't know what this game is about, it is what the name tells you – a monster hunter game. You hunt monsters, gather resources, craft new gear to hunt stronger monsters to get better gear. That’s it, very simple formula, but gameplay is really amazing.The game has a story mode which purpose is to teach you about everything slowly. Step by step you complete the assignments, unlock better gear and stronger monsters and when you finish the story the real grind begins. The grind is in no way bad in this game. Yes sometimes when you’re short on some common items going to hunt some weak monster could feel like a waste of time, but most of the time you’ll be hunting strong monsters.Hunting is not as simple as it sounds. First you need to track the monster by finding its tracks which could take some time if the monster is completely new for you.There are lots of weapons to choose and you need to learn the weapon you choose because they all are different and can change your play style completely.It plays like an action game where you attack and dodge. But the fun part is different monsters. They have different moves which you need to learn, you need to read their moves and prepare for their attacks. You can’t just run to the monster and mash the attack button to kill it. This tactic would only work on monsters bellow your level. First you need to choose the right gear with right stats for each monster. You need to avoid strong attacks and find a window to hit the monster and use healing items. You can also use other items like traps to capture the monster, but first you need to weaken it. You can cut-off and break various parts of monsters, like cutting off the tail for example. After you finish the monster you can collect its parts and use them on crafting weapons and armor. Oh and one more thing – you can use environment to your advantage, like shooting a huge rock which falls on a monster. Or another monster could wonder into the same place and attack the monster you’re fighting.You also have a little helper called Palico. It’s a cat-like being which helps you in the world. He can do some damage to the monsters or heal you. You can craft armor and weapons for him and make him cute little kitty.Number of monsters is pretty good, but some of them feel very similar to each other. They look similar and their moves are very similar. I wish we had more completely different monsters. I know dragons are fun and cool looking but it’s a game, developers could think of a way to add different monster while not completely breaking the lore. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a bear-like monster which could give you a deathly bear-hug?I love this collaboration with other games like Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy (which lets you turn your Palico into Mog) or Witcher. There’s even a Witcher quest-line and a monster from Witcher universe to fight.From time to time there are events happening which add more variety in quests and craftable gear. They usually are pretty challenging and require teamwork.The game can be played solo or coop. You can play solo but if you’re not very good you’ll have big problems defeating stronger monsters, so you can fire up the SOS flare and wait until someone comes to help you. Or you can jump into someone’s session who’s doing the quest you need and help him thus completing the quest for both of you. Surprisingly playing with random players are pretty good most of the time. But sometimes it’s either too hard to find someone playing a certain quest or people just leave the quest. That’s when you need to message your friends and ask for help.Graphically the game looks pretty good. It’s not something special, I guess it’s running on an old engine, but overall graphics are good looking. Performance on the other hand could be better. It’s not bad, but if you want to have 60fps on max settings you’ll need a powerful PC. The world is well crafted and locations look amazing. Maps are huge and there are lots of things to discover.Monster Hunter World is a wonderful game and I recommend it to anyone who likes action games and it’s a must have for coop lovers."

DO NOT USE THE DEFENDER SET. This was put in so new players could rush to start Icebourne DLC. But by using this set it will take away from the whole genuine experience (the way the base game was meant to be played). You will miss out on a HUGE part of Monster Hunter's rewarding progression. The crafting, the upgrading, and customizing of equipment and armors. Also, you take away from the challenge of hunting monsters by giving yourself this (Base) endgame set right at the get go.2. ASAP Try all the different weapon sets (before you even start your first mission). Each weapon has a unique playstyle and almost feels like playing a different game. There's many experiences of people who try this game and don't like it, then come back and try a different weapon and absolutely love the game (me included).(You can do this by accessing the training area. Go to your room, talk to the Housekeeper palico, and access training. You can change between all 14 different weapon sets in the training area.)---Please upvote this so new players can see this and really be able to enjoy the game."
6,BookishNerDan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BookishNerDan/,527,13,1,102.2,August,"21,",103,14,1,"I'm in my mid 40's so I don't always have a lot of time to play games but Monster Hunter: World has me hooked. Since I only can devote about an hour or so every night I just set a goal of what I want to do such as killing or trapping Anjanath to gather parts for the armor set. It's slow going for me, but I don't mind taking my time because the fights are fantastic and sometimes last 20 minutes or more of pure adrenaline-pulsing bliss where a well-timed Palico heal or quick dodge or a perfectly aimed hit makes you feel like you are actually fighting a real monster and that your own life is really on the line. This game is what I dreamed video games would be when I was a kid in the mid 1980's: it's fun, it's drop-dead gorgeous and runs at a nice buttery-smooth 60fps (on my RTX 2060 and Ryzen 5 2600x with 16GB RAM), and overall it's just insanely fun."
7,majii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/majiipajii/,772,25,1,867.8,November,"9,",266,34,1,"If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 4. The obvious, ""do all the quests."" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!"

Good dev response, important features added. Capcom cares.Probably the biggest recovery from launch of any game, ever. Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable. These guys care about making a good game into a great one."

You pick your character and your cat buddy and next thing you know is you get thrown onto a massive walking volcano. When reaching the main hub - while still confused about the start of your journey - you will be overwhelmed by a lot of choices and stuff that's part of the game: 14 different weapons - each with its own playstyle - tons of collectibles, craftable stuff, ammunition, potions, powders, bugs, plants, ... the list just goes on and doesn't seem to finish.Then there are main quests, side quests, event quests, special assignments to take part in.After picking a mission, you get thrown into the land and have to find out how stuff works, there's little to no explanation. You get some sort of a visualized guide by flies that show you the correct path - but they will confuse you sooner or later.When fighting a monster - while still not knowing how to fight due to the lack of tutorials - you might die a lot.Now this is the part that will either break you or where the game finally clicks. I stopped playing twice and didn't think I'd pick it up; because of the tough fights that didn't seem to make sense to me and because of the collect-athon that just confused the heck out of me.Well, I'm now close to 140h into the game and can't wait for the Iceborne expansion.What more can I say... the game made me want to play on and on and on at one point. The fights were challenging and the moment the monster got caught or died was super satisfying and made you want to go for ""just one more Monster before I quit"".I definitely recommend this game and urge you to give this game one, maybe two chances when you think ""No, this is not for me."" It most definitely is!"

Have not encountered any bugs so far.:GTX 1070CPU i7-8700 @ 3.20GHzHOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:  HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:  HOWEVER: HOWEVER: HOWEVER:On release of the new Iceborne DLC they also  released new items and gear for the base game.  One specific set of these  items are called defender items. Right off the bat Capcom gives you top tier weapons. Why? Because they want you to breeze through the early stages of the game and buy the DLC. Im not saying this was a terrible idea. In fact it was a good move for people that wanted to skip early instances of grind. The problem was how they presented it. New players coming into the game  would see that these items had better stats than anything else that they could get their hands on. There was no warning or caution. Even after beating bosses until  late game anything that is craftworthy is still outdone by these defender items. As of  right now im replaying  the game on a new character without the gear and it's  more fun because i actually have to learn attack patterns instead of facetanking and using the same move over and over. (it actually works like that with guardian gear). This is a very minor issue which is why im giving this a good review because it's still a bloody ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good game. And the expansion is massive so use  them to your liking. However you're paying money for the base game too and it shouldn't be spoiled just because you didn't know any better. tldr defender items and guardian gear ruin the novelty of an actual progression system until iceborne. don't use them if you want to enjoy mhw to its fullest.
16,Han Daimond,https://steamcommunity.com/id/handaimond/,"1,673",63,1,"1,749.8",August,"12,",330,84,1,"For MHW veterans on consoles: This version has faster loading times compared to the consoles, you will be impressed.For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.MY BUILD CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHzVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAMRAM: 12 GBStorage: Hybrid HD-SSDAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLDFrame Rate (cap): 60.V-Sync: Off. I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. FPS cost: HIGHResolution Scaling: Low. The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49"" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. FPS cost: LOW.Texture Quality: 1024. Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. FPS cost: VERY LOW.Ambient Occlussion: Off. Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. FPS cost: MEDIUMVolume Rendering Quality: Off. This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.Shadow Quality: Low. The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. FPS cost: HIGHAnti-Aliasing: Off. I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. FPS Cost: MEDIUMLOD Bias: Low. This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.FPS cost: MEDIUM.Max LOD Level: No Limit. Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.FPS cost: LOW.Foliage Sway: On. I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.FPS cost: VERY LOW.Subsurface Scattering: On.I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.FPS cost: LOW Screen Space Reflection: Off.How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.FPS cost: MEDIUMAnisotropic Filtering: Off.The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.FPS cost: MEDIUMWater Reflection: On.I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.FPS cost: LOWSH Diffuse Quality: Low.There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.FPS cost: MEDIUM Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.FPS: LOWZ-Prepass: On.I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.FPS cost: LOWAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say ""finish"", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better."

18,Aranrúth,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042897777/,217,2,1,"2,948.1",October,"7,",39,0,1,"As a part of buying a new Nvidia GTX 1060 , I received a game for free named Monster Hunter World. A game, which I had no clue what it was all about, mainly due to my lack of knowledge of the previous Monster Hunter installments from Capcom. I didnt even try to play the game, until one month later.It starts with a character who travels to ""New World"", a land mass filled with monsters. Along with the Research Commission that studies the land and its monsters, from a region named ""Astera"". The player begins the game by commencing a quest in ""Ancient Forest"". On hindsight it feels, along with the character, I had also commenced my ""journey"" - a journey to the amazing world of Monster Hunter. What an amazing journey it has been. How do I even begin to explain?MHW + its expansion iceborne, consists of many distinct regions like - Ancient Forest, Wildspire Waste, Coral Highlands, Rotten Vale, Elder's Recess, Hoarfrost Reach and Guiding Lands. Each and every region, along with its tundra, the materials, the flora and fauna, the wildlife are distinctly different from one another. The joy I had in discovering the regions, even the smallest of them, were nothing short of amazing. The amount of time spent on collecting materials from these regions is insane, since there is always something you would have missed.  The gameplay is very simple yet complicated - like most modern games, the player starts with the most basic of armor/weapons and eventually progress by defeating stronger monsters,thereby getting better weapons/gear. The real beauty of the game is that it allows so many different ways to achieve this, with the help of 14 types of weapons. Weapons, which i have never heard, seen or used before in any games. Each and every weapon is unique, has its pros and cons and not to mention their unique moves. I started the base game with dual blades, switched to bow till i reached a certain level and then changed to my favourite weapon charged blade. My current go to weapon being Long sword. I can keep on writing about the weapons, but it is something a player has to experience, persist and then slowly try to master it. Players will have a total different experience in taking on the same monsters with different weapons, the materials needs might be different and skills attached to it as well. MHW is not a hack and slash game - the player needs to understand the mechanics of weapons, how to build the gear around it, the preparation - in identifying the monsters weakness, the ""food"" the player needs to eat from canteen before a battle, how to use the environments in players favour, how/when to use traps. Last, defintely not the least and certainly the most important - studying/understanding monster movements , there by developing positional awareness in battles. This is crucial and is the main difference between a good hunt and tedious one where the player rage quits. The concept is simple, but learning curve is steep and the player needs to persist with it, in-order to have the best game experience. Monsters can still wreck you even after this :)The monsters in monster hunter world - starting with the Great Jagras to the big daddy of 'em all Fatalis - all unique and distinct.  Their strengths, weakness, movements and attacks are so different - that it shows the amount of work Capcom has put into them. I have lost count on the amount of monsters and their ""variants"" available in this game. This is nothing short of exceptional. Monsters are so diverse and so much in much in number that I can write an entire section dedicated only about the monsters in the game.I also had the pleasure of discovering something I have never discovered before (or shd i say avoided ) - multiplayer. This is the 1st game that i have played in muti player mode , since mostly i prefer only the single player side of things.  The in game experience quadriples when you go to an hunt with a full team of 4 - something i enjoy very much to this day and always brings a smile to my face. I have been extremely lucky in becoming friends with exceptional group of players and to this day we hunt as team. And that list just keeps on growing.The game is not without its fair share of issues. This is not a game known for graphical fidelity like many open world games, but still needs immense GPU power to play it smoothly. The online server disconnects, glitches like playes landing on impossible areas and not to mention the insane grind, in-order to get jewels, weapons and armor. Despite this, the game is still extremely addictive. I have played close to 2650 hours - managed to learn and use (frequently) 7 diffrerent types of weapons and still play with my friends as much as possible. There are so many things I have missed to address. This is mainly due to the immense depth of MHW, the amount of layers the game has, that I find it next to impossible to explain each and every aspect of it. Not to mention the ""events"" which keeps on pulling players to the game as frequently as possible - hats of Capcom, you have created an absolute beast.MHW - a game I never wanted to play and here I am, playing it almost every other day. The journey which commenced with me stepping into a world completely new, still continues and I am pretty much sure is gonna last for a long time. Quoting one of my friends - its that time of the day - time to bully the monsters.Peace out."
19,Flatulence Florence,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghost_turtle/,637,18,1,130.7,August,"22,",605,12,1,"Ive been waiting for something like this for a long time. This game has single handily murdered my RL commitments within its first 2 weeks of being out. This review may be geared more toward newcomers such as myself. It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it’s so damn fun. So wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you’ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculous. Things will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You’ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You’ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you’ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.As you progress through the story you’ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.You can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.As of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn’t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it’s not something that's constantly happening to us.Another thing, when you’re out on a hunt, you can send up an “SOS”. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven’t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.Other user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I’m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I’m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.So thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist. It’s a f*cking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.On 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them."

With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixed, it can only go upwards from here. Also, new content is added every few weeks together with events.Overall the game is a step up from the Monster Hunter series in both graphical terms and gameplay wise.<Comparison to previous MH titles>- Gathering is much easier and faster- More ways to use the environment to your advantage (dropping boulders, sliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)- A slinger which is used primarily for shooting flash bombs, sonic bombs, etc, but can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)- Turf wars between monsters, which can turn the hunt to your favor- Scoutflies which lead you towards points of interest or monster traces (basically they work like a gps)- Usage of armor skills got way easier, you shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MH- Customizable cat companion, with plenty of gadgets to help you out- Damage indicators which let you know if you are attacking a weak spot or just arent doing any damage at all- No G-rank, this is the only downside reallyTL;DR: Game is good, for both newcomers and fans of the MH franchise"

36,FISH,https://steamcommunity.com/id/onIine/,795,39,1,"5,150.5",April,"27,",152,0,1,"This is the best game I've ever played.Today I just hit HR 999 (max lvl) on my character, after 1128h of pure gameplay, and I figured I should write a review for it.So this is what I think of this game, after all this time:- This game is hard and rewarding.- This game is not made for lazy people.- If a monster wants to kill you, it will kill you.- It's really fun to use ALL the weapons in this game.- It's not boring at all to kill the same monsters over and over again...And about that, from time to time when I'm streaming, someone will ask me this: ""you don't get bored after killing this same monsters like 500 times?"". And what I got from that, after thinking about it, was that ANY game is a repetition game. Every game out there from FPS to RPG will be the same thing over and over until you decide to stop playing it. Every Dota2 match, every CS:GO match, every PUBG matches are the SAME if you think about it. In every one of those games you get toxic or chill teammates, you get a good or a bad match, you play on the same maps with the same available characters on the current META. It's not because MHW is essentially a single player game that it's boring or scripted. It feels like the monsters are alive and thinking about their actions, due to random factors + AI it really feels like a more challenging opponent than 1v1 a human being. Honestly, I've played CS:GO, Overwatch and many other FPS all at high level and the most amazing thing about monster hunter is that ALL of those games NEVER served me with the challenge MHW does. MHW requires a lot of skill, it's mechanically challenging and the best part is that you cannot blame YOUR faults on your teammates. This game taught me to own my sh*t and learn from my mistakes.If you are thinking about buying this game, you should do it, and appreciate the art that this game is. This game deserves to be appreciated, respected and enjoyed by everyone that likes well-made and challenging games.Thank you, CAPCOM, for this amazing experience.And yeah, I'm still gonna play it every day like I've been doing since release."

I would not recommend using defender/guardian equipment for low/high rank because it pretty much nullifies any improvement you might have going through the game. There are several mods on nexusmods that improve quality of life as well and they're very easy to install (though I don't personally like HP/Damage etc. meters existing but ultimately that's up to you). I play on a 5 year old 970 and can manage 60 fps with mixed high/medium settings. CPU usage is where this game is a bit high though I think that has improved a bit since they removed denuvo.During sales you'll usually save a bit if you buy the bundle with iceborne but if you aren't looking for a heavy time investment then base world by itself is still decent with challenging quests like arch tempered monsters, though they don't let you use the clutch claw/new moves unless you have iceborne which is pretty lame.I recommend trying out every weapon in the training area and even looking up weapon guides because sometimes the game doesn't explain things very well. I don't really know why I waited so long to write this but I almost have too much to say if I really kept going. I've met a lot of amazing people and had a lot of fun over the years and I am looking forward to future installments and even future mod development for this game. I still enjoy it even after all this time which says enough I suppose."
45,FYRNØX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shivathedeceased/,117,1,1,721.1,February,22,626,6,1,"This was my first introduction into the Monster Hunter series, and easily became one of my favourite and memorable games of all time. There's so many positive things to say about MHW and MHW:I that it's difficult to summarise in a review...There's not really much to say about the story, since it really isn't the point of Monster Hunter. It does the job, it's a little goofy, it's fun, it has positive moments. The story only really serves to introduce monsters. A problem this game has, that MH:R doesn't, is seamless story co-op. If it's the first time attempting a mission, you need to watch all the cutscenes solo and you need to back out and restart the mission with your friend once you've both seen it. This didn't really detract from me playing the game, but it was a bit tedious for co-op. Personally, I prefer to try out some missions solo before I attempt them with friends, so this didn't bother me much. There might be a mod to fix it somewhere on NexusMods.There are basically no games that manage to pull off the hard sell of a ""biological ecosystem"" right - including games which revolve around animals and creatures. This game is, by far, the greatest exception to that rule. Each environment seems to be painstakingly created by hand in a way that feels natural while also blending in the iconic ""zone combat"" feel that every Monster Hunter game has. The terrain itself in each area opens up a lot of possibilities in combat - ""Should I send the monster off that cliff?"" ""Should I drop those giant rocks and icicles on it?"" ""Should I get height and attack it from above?"" ""Should I destroy that dam and sweep the monster away?"" - all of these things, and more, are possible. Each location also tells a story through its scenery, if you really absorb the surroundings. And to top it all off, there are other creatures that you can catch (some rare, and under specific circumstances), that have background to them that really makes them feel like part of the world. The monsters themselves have interactions with eachtother and the environment (with some being quite hard to notice unless you're actually looking for them) in very natural ways that do an amazing job of establishing the food chain. No other ""monster hunting"" style game (let alone game) comes even close to MHW in these regards.There is an absolutely massive selection of weapons and armour in the game, with an absurd amount of ""build potential"". There are 14 unique weapon types, with different playstyles and strengths. Each weapon at least 35 different end-tree variations. You can design builds around creating explosions, builds around putting monsters to sleep, builds around the core elemental wheel, raw builds, builds that maximise specific combat aspects of your weapons. Some weapons you can even customise further through things like augmentation, using specific parts (if they're a bowgun), and decorations. Speaking of which... While many armour sets have bonuses that are incredibly important, you can always give your gear decorations to imbue ""perks"" (more damage? want to break monster limbs more often? more criticals? more elemental? more health? + so much more). And not even all of it is combat oriented. There are plenty of perks in the game that can be used to give you an edge on some of the more casual content, like gathering materials. ON TOP of all this customisation, there's the canteen, where you can create and eat specific meals catered to your playstyle, and plenty of consumable items that you can collect and use to assist you. So yeah, there's a ton of possibilities in MHW when it comes to your playstyle, and how you want to play. For every monster in the game, there's two to three armour sets, in each RANK. And they all look pretty cool, though because they look different depending on the gender of your character, there are cases where the male armours look better than the female ones, and vice versa. You will also absolutely look like a gremlin for the first part of the game, where you're basically just putting on whatever you've got. It does get better, and way later into the game you unlocked layered armor sets, so keep your chin up.There's a lot to say about the gameplay. The monsters themselves are incredibly well designed. There are rarely moments in MHW that feel ""unfair"" to me, an endgame player. The hitboxes are well defined. The movesets are flashy and varied. The roars, sounds, and musical scores are all beautifully crafted. Some monsters, specifically in the late game, have extremely cinematic attacks that easily make the jaw drop. There's only one instance of a monster that I did not enjoy fighting, and it is part of a collaboration event, not even a core part of the game. Outside of hunting monsters, you can relax and fish. You can catch creatures to place your apartment. In Iceborne, you can REALLY decorate your apartment. You can befriend Felynes and other Tailraiders out in the field on expeditions, trade with them, build reputation and do treasure maps, while unlocking cool gear for your Palico (your sidekick) that can significantly help you when you're fighting monsters. In Iceborne, you can do Lynian Researcher tasks, where you take pictures of monsters, creatures, and people doing their thing (I REALLY wish there was more of this). I think the only downside to this game is that it's quite challenging to get new players interested in it. It can take a lot of time, depending on your experience, to get comfortable using some weapons. It can be easy to get frustrated with the combat within the first 50 or so hours of the game, which isn't exactly a short amount of time. Using your weapon, the controls and camera, getting stunned, roars, hard to predict monster attacks, 50 minute time constraints, failing missions, grinding for materials,  etcetera... it can be demotivating. And the game itself doesn't really do a good job explaining some of the nuances of your weapon - you're really left to your own devices or YouTube guides, which definitely is overwhelming. Of the dozen or so friends I've invited to play Monster Hunter, I'd say only a couple actually ended up playing until Iceborne, which is a shame because there's an extreme amount of potential in this game that they can miss out on. I can't really blame this on Monster Hunter, though, or the players. There's such an incredible amount of depth to the combat and system that it would be a disservice to the players to attempt to explain how literally every aspect of every weapon worked. The tutorial is long enough, and there are already ""guides"" in-game. Button prompts are also available on screen. My only suggestion to a new player who's feeling frustrated is to take your time with it, try out different weapons, use the resources available (like the training area), tackle easier monsters to get used to things. It does get easier, and it does feel more fluid the more you play. And, oh boy, when everything finally ""clicks"" - you'll feel absolutely unstoppable. To condense things: I strongly recommend this game. It does things right that no other game seems to even bother attempting. You might have a hard time getting into it. Just take your time to enjoy it, and take it slow. Don't get trapped to one weapon - try a few out. You might find something more comfortable to your playstyle that way. And maybe one day, you'll see how deep the Charge Blade rabbit hole really goes."
46,Munna,https://steamcommunity.com/id/abrahamwatts/,109,5,1,981.1,February,"15,",320,0,1,"This is literally one of the best game I have played in a while. Got it during winter sale  and it's been just 2 months but the game totally got me engaged. Starting of with the story, It's real fun to know new monsters as the story progresses but as we move on it really gets challenging as their ability enhances. To be a better monster hunter one really has to know every bit of moves the monster has to offer. The game is such that once you hunt a monster u will again hunt the same for its loot and also to be better against it and also to craft it's incredible armor and upgrade it to its fullest. So at the end of the day the basic mantra is (Hunt-Loot-Craft-Repeat). Well seeing this people will say whats the fun in it, but trust me I thought the same and now I can't get rid of it. It can be played either on single player or multiplayer but more the player the more fun and less hard it is, but still even if its hard getting fainted also has fun in it's own way. The worst part about this game is having disconnection issues during multiplayer even though one has a stable internet connection . One more issue is that sometimes while playing if someone gets fainted or tail of a monster get cut the screen freezes for a split second or disconnection issue pops up. Coming to the best part of the game, there are a lot to mention but below I will mention a few which i truly love:1-> Yawning of monsters just melts my heart.2-> Palicio eating food and that purr sound.3-> Meeooooow4-> Poogie greeting you everytime to visit your base.5-> Kulu stealing eggs and eating it in the most fun way as possible.6-> The animation of cats when you order a foodBTW this review is pre iceborne."

48,FrozenHavoc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FrozenHavoc/,119,1,1,994.2,June,"10,",374,3,1,"Hoo boy, this review has been a long time coming. is a boss-centric action game that revolves around tracking monsters through exotic locales in what is dubbed the ""New World"" and, well, hunting them. True to its name, a bigger focus has been placed on making the environments feel lively compared to previous games; hunts take place in an vast, open world populated with diverse flora and fauna. Creatures have their own lifestyles and behaviours. Certain parts of the environment are dynamic and can be used in creative ways. And, perhaps most obvious of all, the graphics of this game are absolutely beautiful, amplifying the natural look. However, ending the review here and calling it a day would be doing it an extreme disservice.Throughout your travels in the New World, you will become very familiar with its feral inhabitants. Each has its own identity--unique designs, mannerisms, strengths, and weaknesses, all communicated in meaningful ways. From the adorable Dodogama to the ferocious Anjanath, monsters come in all shapes and sizes. One thing is certain: the monsters are usually many times your size, so you better get used to playing around their big attacks.MHW offers a diverse selection of 14 weapon types, each with their own nuances and weapon trees, allowing you to boost your damage and augment your weapons with elements. I am not kidding when I say I hope you like studying videos on how to use weapons, as even the simplest of them have their own unique uses and playstyles. For reference, throughout my MHW career, I went from maining the Heavy Bowgun (a big gun, not much to say) to the Insect Glaive, a polearm that excels in aerial combat, then to the Sword and Shield, a light weapon whose greatest strength is its versatility. I've long since completed the main story of both World and the Iceborne expansion, but I am still having fun trying out all the other weapon types and figuring out how to use them. There is a training area that allows you to experiment safely; I suggest using it as soon as possible to pick and learn a weapon. Don't be afraid to switch weapon types if you get stuck, too.We haven't even touched on the armour system yet, which offers a comparable amount of choice. Armour sets are comprised of 5 pieces; head, chest, arms, waist, and legs. Within these 5 categories, there is a wide array of designs, each offering different defensive stats. Most of the armour pieces in MHW draw inspiration from the monsters you hunt, letting your hunter look quite stylish, too. Additionally, armour comes with armour skills: abilities that strengthen you in a variety of ways, not just defensively.Hunts in MHW generally follow a straightforward pattern. First, you collect tracks of the monster you've targeted. Once you've collected enough tracks to locate the monster, it pops up on the map. You then run over to their location and fight. Usually the monster will run to another area; it's at this point you recuperate (heal, sharpen weapon, etc.) and give chase. This loop of fighting and chasing continues until the monster is slain or captured (the hunt is a success), or you faint too many times (the hunt is a failure).As noted before, a large part of MHW is its environments, including creature lifestyles. To help players engage with this part of the game, players must first explore and locate the tracks of their target before they appear on the map. This feature is a bit of a hit or miss; for some, this only serves to slow players down before they get to the action. For others, this helps develop a sense of familiarity with monsters (i.e. learning their habitats) outside of learning their attacks in direct combat.Combat is all about commitment, in the sense that every attack has an animation that limits your control until a certain amount of the animation has played out. Combat is also highly expressive; besides your weapon of choice, there are a lot of consumables you can bring into the hunt or find in the environment that offer benefits, from traps and bombs to items that heal or provide temporary buffs. In this game, combat is the smoothest it has ever been in the series; the player character feels very responsive, you can continue moving during animations such as using healing items, and attacks that are timing-based generally have large windows for use. By default, controls are also displayed in the top right corner of the screen and update according to context; this makes the game fairly user-friendly.At the end of each hunt, you are rewarded with materials that allow you to forge and upgrade equipment. Thus, the larger, overarching gameplay loop is ""hunt, upgrade, repeat."" Due to the random nature of materials dropping, however, this gameplay loop can get rather grindy at times. This grind is somewhat alleviated with the use of investigations, hunts that provide extra rewards, but it is still very much there.A large part of the  games is their multiplayer, and it is no different here. Hunts take place in sessions; hunts have a maximum of 4 players while sessions can have a maximum of 16, allowing for easy drop-in and drop-out. Additionally, you can fire SOS flares during hunts, allowing players from other sessions to join you. There is a restriction on story missions however; other players cannot join you until you've viewed all of the hunt's cutscenes, which generally entails encountering the monster and watching its introduction. This tends to be a very large downside when playing through the game with friends, as you will constantly have to wait for everyone to view cutscenes before being able to play together. In general, however, the multiplayer is a big point in MHW's favour. At almost 4 years after release, people still play this game. This also means that there is a good number of veterans willing to help new players find their footing if needed.Another point I'd like to address is menu navigation. There are  of menus and UI windows in this game. Additionally, the game loves to bombard new players with tutorial screens. As a result, it is very easy to feel overwhelmed by the amount of information overload if you're not used to the UI of, for example, MMORPGs. Thankfully, this is mostly only a problem outside of hunt. My recommendation is to slow down and take the time to process whatever you're looking at, or ask a fellow hunter for help. Half of these info screens aren't even shoved in your face, and arguably these ones are more useful as they pertain to things like weapon-specific controls and combos.I won't deny that this game isn't for everyone. MHW asks for a bit more patience than usual on the part of the player. However, if you can look past the grind, get used to the UI, and deal with the odd multiplayer quirk of the story missions, you'll find an absolutely huge amount of playtime here. This game has a lot of nuance, way more than I could ever feasibly cover in this review. It is this amount of detail that keeps me coming back for more; I love learning about how each weapon counters the attacks of certain monsters, and the surprising amount of ways I can use the environment to gain the upper hand. , to both series newcomers and veterans alike.I'd like to give  to Morgan, a Charge Blade hunter and absolutely wonderful friend who not only got me the game and Iceborne but also held my hand as I was learning the ropes. I am eternally grateful for your help, ya big ol' softie.I'd also like to thank the countless other players I've met in my travels for making my experience as great as it is. They've not only made for skilled teammates, but also great companions. Cheers, friends."

Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.Pros:+ Extremely engaging hunts+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.+ Unique artstyle+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.Extremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.+ The Switchaxe+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. + You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.Cons:- A mediocre story.- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it!-  Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times.- (Edit:) Co-op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in, which is just frustrating.If this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game is an absolute recommend!"

53,Gericonda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gericonda/,103,5,1,"1,492.8",August,"27,","7,207",0,1,"I came to Monster Hunter: World with no more than 45 minutes of experience played on some older PS2 game on a bad emulator.I knew the game's fame in Japan, and it was due to this fame the series stayed on portable consoles and then Nintendo consoles for a bunch of time.Gladly the PC gaming market was already big enough when Capcom finally decided to make a high bet on the series. So it was only a matter of months to receive the game.I pre-ordered as soon as I decided if I would go for the Standard or the Deluxe Edition(I chose the Deluxe even after seeing people saying that it was just some skin and stickers, but I had the feeling that I would enjoy this game, so... -by the way, if you're short on money, go for the Standard Edition, you won't be missing anything from gameplay perspective).The game is huge, if you know what you're doing(already played MH) and do just the bare minimum it will still take more than 30 hours. If you're fresh new and like to explore and try anything you see, it can take near 100 hours. And there still a lot of content after the campaign.So, I played a lot, finished the campaign and was still playing, when I was around 200 hours invested in the game, my save got corrupted, I tried to ask the Capcom support, but they said they couldn't do anything. Tough luck...On the next day I was creating a new char and playing everything again. That's how good this game is. I can't think of any other game that I would do this.About the game... you run a lot around the map searching for the monsters, after you encounter them you smash, slice and shoot them a lot with one of the fourteen types of weapons, you try to not get stomped, bitten, clawed, headbutted, ran over, flamed, iced, electrified, watered, dragon-ed(!?) or exploded and, if you did ok, after half an hour you walk victorious with your cat. Oh, I didn't mention the cat, sorry. You are hunting the monster together with a biped cat wearing armor and it calls you meowster.Being serious, this game has the best gameplay loop I've ever seen. Each of the 14 types of weapon changed the way you play the game, it would be the same as changing the class in other games, but you don't need to start a new character to see if you would even like to play as a different class. You just go to the blakcsmith and say ""My dude, I want to try this other weapon, here's some monster parts and some money."", he gives you this new weapon and now your character is totally different, you will probably yell that this weapon is ♥♥♥♥ because now you get hit by a lot of moves that you were easily escaping before, then after some tries you start to enjoy this new weapon and it's now your second favorite weapon. Because no other weapon will take the place of the hammer that goes boom!When you change weapon, all moveset of the character will be different, and I'm not only talking about the attacks, but walking speed, roll(or if you even will have a roll), time spent to sheath the weapon(yeh, even this is important), if you have a blocking ability or not, stances. So the moment-to-moment of the gameplay loop is always engaging. ""Should I attack now? Should I heal now? Should I move left or right? Is it better to keep lying on the ground after getting hit or stand up immediately?(yep, this is important too).The basic Monster Hunter: World is already a game where you can easily sink hundred of hours, you add Iceborne to that and you get on the 4 digits territory. The expansion is big enough to be a new game and you'll be revisiting all of the original maps for new things.So, yeah, I couldn't recommend enough. F*ck, didn't even talked about multiplayer... well, I do prefer playing as a single player game, but multiplayer can be funny, not so much when randoms are getting killed and making you fail the mission, but sometimes you'll even laugh watching those crazy suicide hunters... I do not recommend you keep calling for SOS right from the beginning, since this can bring people with end game gear that would wipe the monster in 2 minutes. Try to enjoy the game with players of similar level if you MUST play online. By the way, Capcom, how about porting some of the old games?Choose the biggest Monster Hunter before World and BANG!, I bet all the players who keep playing MHW would buy this thing at launch.Oh, and while you're at it, bring me Breath of Fire IV too, alright?"

Unfortunately I do not know why I have played for almost 700 hours at this point. Does this game have a great story full of memorable characters, emotion, and personal growth? No....no it does not, you pretty much kill monsters and use their parts to craft gear to kill bigger and badder monsters. There is something about that kill-and-craft system that got me hooked. Whether it is creating a new build or mastering a new weapon it just always feel great to play. I would recommend getting the base game first and take some time to get familiar with the controls. The learning curve for the game can be large if it is your first Monster Hunter game, and that applies to every aspect of the game not just the controls. I can not promise that you will get hooked on the (almost endless) kill-and-craft game of Monster Hunter.....but man if you do buckle up for a long amazing ride."

Let me first mention that I'm new to the Monster Hunter games. I was skeptical when I first bought it. I asked myself, ""Is this any different from Dauntless ?"", and within the first 2 hours of playing I realized it's nowhere compared to Dauntless.Of course, it's not fair compare a free to play game with another game by a very established developer: Capcom. But I thought it would just have the core of what monster hunting should be.I stand corrected. Monster Hunter has surprised me with the other aspects besides hunting, and the mechanics of hunting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind unique game. About 200 hours clocked in as I'm writing this review, yet I'm still not done with this game. Capcom is constantly pushing out new events and new monsters. They listen to the community on how the game can be improved, and they have proved themselves to be developers who care for their players. I'm only comfortable with 1 out the 14 types of weapon in the game, and I am planning to try the other weapons. If you're looking for a co-op where you can literally spend hours playing with your friends, this is the one to go with. It's even more fun with friends.Get this game while its fresh !"

They have kept up to date and added new monsters, new mechanics, and a new world. If any player has never played monster hunter they can jump into this one and not have a problem as it parts from the previous series well. Story is great and fights are epic my only concern was why they were so strict on mods for the iceborne part but creators worked around it and did a great job. I only use aesthetics as in looks and sound effects but there probably was cheaters out there, but you can tell by their skill. I am disappointed that they went back to the switch which is a hell of a downgrade graphics and mechanic wise. But 2022 proved monster hunter world 2 will be released and I will be looking forward to that as well.

If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.No server issues anymore as well.Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale."

Anybody who is a long time MH player will immediately notice how everything is more convenient. Whetstone is now an infinite use item that's always in your inventory, so no need to buy or collect them. No need for bug nets anymore either, since you actually collect visible bugs now. Pickaxes, those are gone too. Just get your ore and move on. No more having to paintball monsters to track them. Now there's a new system of tracking through footprints and leavings. As for hot drinks and cool drinks, cool drinks are only needed in very specific situations. Not for an entire zone. And hot drinks, I don't think they're even in the game anymore. Hell, there's even fast travel now. Now that's an aspect of ""modernization"" in game design that I can get behind. This is absolutely a reboot for the series. There's so much improved here from the old games that I would have a really hard time going back. Monster Hunter World is the new formula, and I hope it's here to stay."

Steam is for some reason incorrect, it's only logged 18.1 hours as of writing this, but my actuall game log time says 32:28:35 on main + 1:03:30 for the second character I made. (That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)I am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.I'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. My only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately. But even then, I am too distracted by what the monster is doing to worry about what I look like most of the time."

Are you looking for a game that has : 1.) Grinding mechanic2.) No loot boxes or pay-to-win walls that gives you an overall advantage3.) Can run both in Offline and Online mode without disrupting your progress4.) Has a level-up system5.) Primarily loot-based centered6.) A game that actually rewards you for your hard work7.) Purely PVE-based and doesn't have a niche of PVP in itThen my friend, Monster Hunter: World might just be the game you're looking for!Monster Hunter: World is a game that revolves on a near never-ending cycle:  If you're expecting a story rich or lore based game off of MH:W, then I'm sorry to say that MH:W isn't really that type of a game, as the title itself implies; you're here to hunt monsters. Now don't get me wrong MH:W does have a story and some lore added to it but it's basically just a pre-text to set up the main focus of the game - Hunting Monsters. You're an A-List Hunter off to the New World to investigate a migrating Elder Dragon.Let's start off with the  What I really like about MH:W is that it actually has a whopping 14-different weapon types to choose from each with it's own combo's and play styles. And countless armor pieces to  that suits your preferences. Mix and Match? What do you mean? You see, armors in MH:W has these specific skills that come along with it and when you pair an armor with that same skill you level it up unlocking more bonuses. Now choosing what skill suits you actually depends on what weapon you're using (i.e. If you're a Bow Bro, then you'd naturally look for a skill that goes along pretty well with a bow and many more). And this very mechanic is what I like, you actually have the freedom to build a certain Weapon and Armor Set based on your preferred play style. And what's more is each weapon type feels like your starting a new game since it'll take some time getting used to it. Which is why my advise is to start off with a weapon that's easy to use then master it first. Oh and each weapon upgrades has a skill tree, to get the weapon you want you need to do hard work which means no slacking off hunter!Let's proceed to the  part of the game. What's unique about Monster Hunter: World is what sets it apart from other RPG games when fighting monsters, normally you'd unsheathed your sword and dash into the fray slashing left and right until the monster actually dies right? In MH:W that's actually not the case;  actually feel like a true  in this game.  is key, you actually get rewarded by it than being bold and aggressive which makes hunting rather hard. How so? Because you actually die a lot and waste a lot time in the process, in MH:W you need to research first about the monster you're about to hunt, study it's weaknesses, it's habits and most importantly how it attacks.  Remember this. The game even has it's own ""Monster Wiki"" that tells you important info on a monster. The more tracks you gather, the more you'll be able to understand a monster's weakness and how to exploit it's weak points. Overall hunting is pretty self explanatory: You track a monster, kill it, skin it, use the materials you took to craft gear, then use that gear to take on a larger monster, rinse and repeat but it's more than that I assure you.The only thing I hate about the game is how your Hunter is basically mute, he/she does not speak and everytime an NPC talks to you, you just nod back! that's all you do, you nod as a reply! It's get's funny when an NPC asks you a question and you just nod. Bruh.MH:W is actually pretty fun, it has loads of content in it. You'll get to love and hate it at the same time, the greatest feeling you'll ever get from this is after defeating a certain monster after it's been drilling you in the ass for 2 hours as it effortlessly 1-shot you as you try to dash and evade for dear life (I'm looking at you Nergigante) that rush of accomplishment is what gives MH:W a 9.5/10 in my book, and I'm not planning on putting this game down anytime soon especially since the Icebourne DLC adds more freaking content, monsters and skill sets in the game! If that's not enough to get you to buy this game, you can also play as Geralt or Ciri from The Witcher 3 and fight a tough Leshen (ngl this is what got me to buy the game in the first place since I'm a sucker on anything that involves The Witcher series). You even play as Ryu from Street Fighter or Dante from DMC! Still not convinced? Did I forget to mention you can have a CAT a.k.a a PALICO as your partner in crime? BUY THE GAME!"

Really, all you do in this game is hunt monsters (the title is really accurate) for some kinda guild because of reasons. The characters don't even have names, they're just called ""Tracker"" or ""Field Team Leader"" etc.; I have 500 hours in this game and I have no clue what is going on.- weird Japanese aesthetics. Like, your sidekick is a fluffy kitten with a weapon and you run around with a sword the size of a bus;- awful controls which feel like driving a forklift in GTA;- convoluted mechanics. For some weapons you need to watch a 30 min tutorial on YouTube to even get an idea of what it does.- git gud difficulty- repetitive grind- co-op- grind- terrible endgame RNG- and grind.And yet I love it. I rage uninstalled it 3 times because I could barely hit a tiny monster that wasn't even a proper enemy.But once you wrap your head around the mechanics, stop mashing buttons like an idiot and approach it more like a turn-based action game where you need to think when to attack, it really shines. There's a lot of depth to these weird and nonsensical weapons, with each being almost like a different game, and it's really rewarding to learn them.The fights with monsters are long and epic, the difficulty increases not too quickly (although there are some moments late in the game when it gets stupid hard, like Alatreon at first).What is great about it is that the game doesn't try to be a book or a movie, it trades a story and logic/realism for a rewarding gameplay loop. Hunt huge monsters, loot them, make better gear, hunt nastier monsters. What made me stay is that playing the game in itself feels rewarding, not just getting the loot. You also get better at the game by playing it and practicing, not only looking up builds. It's also pretty challenging but not cheap, you have a lot of tools at your disposal, along with environmental traps, so you can approach things in many different ways on top of learning the monsters' attack patterns. It's also solo-friendly (I'm not very social...) despite being a co-op game, I managed to solo almost everything, except Fatalis.If you try to play this game like a button-masher, you're gonna hate it. But if you take a slower approach and learn how the game is meant to be played, it can be an awesome ride. One thing though - DON'T USE DEFENDER GEAR. It makes a lot of the game much easier, which will prevent you from learning it correctly and later on, once the gear becomes useless, the difficulty will spike so hard you're gonna quit."

It’s actually so much more than the premise would suggest. The title is true to itself: This isn’t just about fighting big monsters. This is about experiencing a  filled with monsters. Here’s what that means, and why I think you, the reader, may enjoy this game more than you thought.To quote the YouTuber Punk Duck: “This isn’t Monster Hunter. It’s Menu Hunter.”Monster Hunter: World is just as much about browsing through menus and managing your equipment as it is actually fighting that fire-breathing T-Rex. From start to finish, your character never gains any innate statistical improvements. You don’t get more health, more stamina, more damage, nothing. What changes is two things: your equipment, and your experience.Armor management is vital to success. The only thing standing between you and a “Quest Failed” screen is your armor rating and your abilities. As monsters get stronger, you need better armor to take less damage. As they get faster and tougher, you need abilities like Focus, or Critical Eye to charge up your weapons faster or increase their critical hit rates. Monster Hunter is a series about meticulous preparation, and while such min/maxing can turn many away, it also gives a greater payout when you succeed. These monsters aren’t just simple enemies, every one of them is a raid boss in and of itself; a lengthy and brutal foe to be overcome with endurance and meticulous preparation, not a Leeroy Jenkins-esque rush.But what makes World stand out so much, even amongst its own Monster Hunter peers, is its dedication to actually being a WORLD. Older titles had herbivores and smaller monsters that roamed around, but never at a scale like this. MHW has hundreds of non-megaboss creatures flying, crawling, and roaming around every corner of every area, and ALL of them can be collected and displayed. Crickets? Fish? Spiders? Bats? Birds? Frogs? Cactuar from Final Fantasy VI? If you can think of it, it’s probably in the game somewhere. You can observe them, capture them, even keep them as pets. This is the kind of experience you usually only get with games like Subnautica or No Man’s Sky: the wonder of exploring an alien and unknown place, to see what lives there and interact with it. And you get gigantic boss fights on top of that too!Just to add even further to the ecosystem focus of MHW, the large monsters themselves also interact heavily with the environment. Poisonous Pukei-Pukei can be spotted eating nuts from vines to refill their poison sacs. Carnivorous monsters can be observed stalking, killing and eating prey when hungry. All monsters, large and small, will go grab a drink from a stream every now and then. Territorial monsters will fight other large monsters mid-battle to defend their territory. In fact, some monsters aren’t even aggressive towards you unless you attack them first! Everything in World is treated as a living, breathing, REAL creature that could actually exist. Many players other than myself concur that some of the most enjoyable moments in the game can be had by just watching things unfold around you. There’s so much detail in every environment that it’s honestly a shame many people write the game off as just “fighting big dinosaurs” or worse, claiming that only the gameplay matters. The environments found in Monster Hunter: World are the best in the gaming business, and I wish more people were aware of it.MHW has a story, but it doesn’t take itself particularly seriously. Normally, that would be bad. But in this case, it’s actually quite nice. The player is part of an expedition force to explore “The New World”, a continent and land separate from previous Monster Hunter areas. This means everything you experience isn’t just new to you, as a player, it's new to the characters as well. You get to deepen your knowledge of this world around you as the game guides you to new areas and new monsters to fight.It guides you, but doesn’t railroad you. You’re free to straight up IGNORE the main plot for as long as you want, fighting the monsters you want, when you want. One of the best moments in the game for me was when my friend and I spent a full day attempting to bring down an Anjanath before the story quest to hunt it was ever brought up. It took us several attempts, but eventually we brought the beast down with help from a gargantuan monster we had never seen before, a Rathalos, that picked Anjanath up in its claws and slammed it down onto the forest floor with such force it made our damage numbers look puny in comparison.It was a phenomenal experience, and more importantly, it was 100% organic. We chose to do that, not the game. MHW gives you the freedom of choice and experience in ways few other games do, especially other boss-rush styled games.Monster Hunter: World looks . The environments are rich and detailed, with life seeping from every cave and treetop. The monsters are visually distinct and have memorable designs that make them stand out among other games and even each other. Each and every nook and cranny of this game’s design had so much clear love and effort put into it that it’s easily my favorite game of all time in the visuals department, even over games like Hades and Subnautica.Monsters move fluidly and with intent, as animated in their actions as they are in their visuals. Lighting arcs off the back of a Tobi-Kadachi as it glides between the trees. The throat of an Anjanath glows crimson as it becomes enraged, and the sheer level of intensity in the particles and lighting of Elder Dragon attacks defies words. Every second of a fight is desktop wallpaper material.Once again, Monster Hunter: World excels in another category. Monster roars are primal, powerful, and give off the true feeling of a colossal beast pushed over the edge. What other game series has video compilations of just enemy roars all over the internet?The sound of intense wind ripping by, fireballs exploding, ice shattering, all of it sounds incredible in the midst of the action. Every moment is an experience, visually and audibly, that other games wish they could have even a third as much.The game runs great on my hardware, but I also have excellent specs. A fair warning; all that visual spectacle comes at a cost, and the game is fairly demanding to run on high settings. Don’t attempt this with a potato PC.Also of special mention is the Iceborne DLC. This isn’t a traditional DLC that adds one or two new things into the game; Iceborne is an entire Master Rank expansion into the base game that itself is nearly TRIPLE the size of the vanilla experience. Double digit monster additions, an entire second story campaign, two new areas, expanded weapon movesets, more hunter tools, the whole shebang. If you love MHW, Iceborne is a must-have.Monster Hunter: World is a masterpiece through and through. It has its faults at times, and a very harsh learning curve (Use google, seriously), but the payoff is immense and deeply satisfying. If you see it on sale,"

Basically, you are a monster hunter from a guild of monster hunters on an expedition to a new continent when a big ol' mountain monster gets in the way and sets the stage for plot to ensue. It's not the most captivating plot, but it's got a fun, goofy, and sincere charm to it that keeps it from overstaying its welcome. You choose a weapon and get to hunting, taking on missions from the guild to take down monsters and use their bits to make better and weapons and armor that give you better stats so you can take down bigger monsters. You can also capture the monsters, which makes you feel a bit better since you don't kill the monsters, but you still get bones and stuff afterwards so someone's eventually killing that monster, apparently.Combat is fine-tuned and varied. There are tons of weapons in the game, from a sword 'n' shield to a heavy lance, to a giant sword the size of a table, to an axe that charges up and morphs into an elemental sword, to a set of bagpipes that buff your teammates and can also be used to brain monsters. The weapons all feel like they were developed and balanced with  equal care and attention, and attacks feel weighty and impactful. People draw lots of comparisons to Dark Souls, and they're mostly on the nose. Weapon swings can't be interrupted once you commit to them, but you've got more combos. You can't button-mash here and expect to come out on top. In addition, the hunts let you use traps and buffs and skills and environmental hazards that keep things fresh.Weapons and armor can be customized with charms and upgraded, and each monster has a different themed set. Stats matter, so make sure you've got good fire resistance going up against a fire-breathing monster, for example. But there are enough sets and charms to offset stats that you can absolutely lose hours playing dress-up if that's your jam (as it is mine). Also, you have a companion that goes on hunts with you, it's called a Palico, it's basically a bipedal cat, you can customize it to look like your own cat if you want, and it's wonderful.The monsters themselves are the highlight of the game. Beautiful, fantastical designs, that go weird places but are grounded enough in reality that they look like they could exist somewhere. The cool part is that they behave like real animals - during the tracking phase of the hunt, you can just watch them as they go through the world. They interact with the smaller animals, with the plants and hazards in the world. They have territories and nests. It almost makes you feel bad for hunting them!Multiplayer is great but a little janky. Personally, I played the majority of the game solo, and had a blast. You can join your friends on missions, but the cutscenes are unskippable and if your friend is on a story mission, you have to wait until the cutscene is over to join. It's all a bit weird, but when you get going, it's a ball.The game also has a ton of QoL improvements from the previous games - just off the top of my head, the zones are no longer broken up into areas, and you can walk while drinking potions! In previous Monster Hunter games, the levels were broken up into areas, with transition screens between them. Here, the areas are all connected, and once you load the level you're good until you go to a different level. It helps the environments feel so much bigger and less game-y.The game is still very heavy on menus and prepping before fights. There is a hub where you replenish your inventory after each quest (you can set loadouts to speed this up now) and eat a meal for a boost. The meal is accompanied by a very fun cutscene of the Palico chef and his assistants preparing a big delicious-looking platter for you, and it's also wonderful. But, yes, the menus can be a bit much. And often right at the beginning the game can feel like it just dropped you into an ocean of menus, while you slowly drown in inventory screens. Don't panic! You can get the hang of all that later.

You find yourself finally finishing an armor set, just to immediately move on to farming another. You will die in a very dumb way, rage-quit, and just hop back into the game 30 minutes later. The core game is very good.The music is excellent (except for the Astera theme, which I find very annoying after a while), the graphics are great, especially with the High Res pack. And the monster designs are great. The controls will take some getting used to. I already owned the game on Xbox, and found playing the game with the Xbox control to feel sluggish and clunky. I waited to buy this version, until after the mouse input control issues were sorted out. Overall its a lot more enjoyable to play, now.The community is....ehhhh....it's...a thing? As long as you know what you are getting yourself into when you leave your quests open, or fire that SOS flare, you should be fine. By getting yourself into, I mean...that the random people that join will usually make things more difficult for you. Every so often you'll get lucky and some high level pro will join you. But for the most part, you're gonna get people smacking you with their hunting horn and firing their bow in the wrong direction. You'll put the monster to sleep to set your barrels, just to have some guy smack you and the monster with his hammer before you can finish. You'll mount the monster, and have a guy drop a pile of rocks on you. Its REALLY a free-for-all crap-fest, so...yeah. If you want to play with randoms, just...make sure you bring your patience along. Otherwise, its definitely better to play solo or with friends.Overall I've definitely been enjoying the game so far, even with the quirks."

112,Mr. Bear (AFO),https://steamcommunity.com/id/BearyFunny/,110,6,1,439.2,August,"6,","1,380",0,1,"Capcom's Monster Hunter series has consistently remained one of the strongest performing staples in their roster of IPs. With its extremely wide range of visually impressive landscapes alongside its diverse stable of fantastic dragons, brutes, and other varied beasts, Monster Hunter has managed to carve out a unique niche in the Action RPG genre. And that's no small feat, considering the genre boasts other strong contenders like Dark Souls.The gameplay loop of a Monster Hunter game is simple.- You decide that you want to make a specific piece of armor or that you want to upgrade one of your weapons.- You load up a quest with the specific monster that drops the resources that you need to craft said upgrades.- You make your way through the colorful environments, tracking the monster in question.- You beat the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of said monster.- ???- You now have a shiny piece of new armor or a fantastic new weapon.Some might feel that this sounds like a grindy, tedious experience. You wouldn't be wrong in thinking that, as grinding monsters to look for rare parts (♥♥♥♥ the desire sensor) can be frustrating at times. But the feeling of finally seeing the rare part that you need for an upgrade that will vastly improve your power level is exhilarating. It's so satisfying.I've been playing Monster Hunter since the original PS1 days, and every game has hooked me in to the point where I now probably have about 1,500 - 2,000 hours across the entire franchise.That being said, I had to think long and hard about whether or not I would recommend Monster Hunter: World.Capcom has massively improved on the actual combat mechanics and added useful UI components that previous entries lacked. However, there is a noticeable lack of monsters in MHW when compared to previous installments in the genre. MHW currently features 31 Large monsters and an additional 17 Small monsters - which is absolutely pitiful when you consider the fact that MHGenerations featured 71 Large monsters and 31 Small monsters. Fewer monsters means fewer item sets and a noticeable loss of creativity in setbuilding. One of my favorite things in Monster Hunter is the ability to tinker with mixed sets and come up with some really creative and fun builds.At the end of the day, I settled on this: MHW is fun. Really fun. While I tapered off my playtime due to the lack of mixed set potential in the endgame, I still think that it's a game worth playing. With a new expansion in the form of Iceborne rapidly approaching (Jan 2019), MHW will continue to grow and I can only see it getting better and better as more monsters and environments are added."
113,Dinnyforst,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dicenaries-tech/,215,14,1,744.3,August,"25,",631,9,1,"I want to talk about my aspect of game as overall experience. Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn’t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon’s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. The story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it’s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant “Handler”), and bad lips sync.MHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it’s become handy once you get used to it.There are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It’s something you’ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce “slinger” as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have “Palico” as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.The game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. Hunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.After each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village “Astera” where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you’ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you’re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.On a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.While most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.MHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You’re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it’s still worth even though you only play main story.It’s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.MHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It’s not perfect, but it’s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it’s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.I hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~"

I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. The Pros: -Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. -14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. -Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! -Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. -Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!-T-Rex that breathes fireThe Meh: -Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called ""Handler"" and the like. -No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. -Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. The Cons:-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! -The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. -DenuvoIs this game worth $60 to you? Maybe not, but I had a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend at least playing through this game if you have never played a MHW game. The people who have given negative reviews are correct in that the optimization and connection issues are absolutely horrendous, but many of them also speak from the point of view of someone who has already played the PS4 version and expect better of Capcom. If you're a new player that has never played a MH game, you MUST play this game."

123,Stalwart87,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198307308311/,60,1,1,320.3,February,"26,",570,0,1,"For those who've followed the franchise since its humble beginnings, I'll be surprised if you haven't already got this. If you haven't and are planning to get into it, you might want to think it over. It can get pretty tedious for those who don't like the idea of its grinding but the experience it offers, can hardly be found in other games. Of course that differs individually. Many newcomers will either grow to like it or just hate it outright.  First of all, MH isn't one of those typical story rich JRPG games. Sure it has a pretty decent narrative, but the real unique selling point of Monster Hunter is, from the name itself, mastering the hunt and being the best hunter you can be. There's no experience points and level progression as the gameplay is entirely skill based. You'll learn, adapt and overcome. Learning everything about monster behaviour, attack patterns, where it sleeps, its weak spots and the effective weapon to use against it. Either way, there are no bad weapons in this game. I have found all weapon types to be extremely well rounded, fun to use, with some having impressive multi functionality. The only question is whether the weapon you're currently using has been upgraded enough to deal significant damage. Which brings me to my next point, in response to the tedium of grinding often mentioned by newcomers. It's offset by the motivation of crafting gear based on that monster's parts. The satisfaction of upgrading an existing weapon into a powerful elemental version, from materials you worked long and hard to get is an experience unlike many others. Payoff is huge. Same goes for armor as well and it looks damn good. Once you get the hang it, you'll start to appreciate the world that surrounds it, from the lush biomes of the ancient forest to the snowy wilderness of Hoarfrost Reach. You'll cultivate herbs, craft essential healing items and buffs, set traps for capture and simply just hunt monsters alongside friends. Frankly any game is fun with friends and even though MH is marketed as co-op, make no mistake that it's a solid single player experience too. When a hunt gets too tough, players can fire a signal SOS calling for online hunters to come to your rescue. Emerging victorious after a long and brutal fight, is in my opinion, one of the greatest pleasures in gaming as a whole, and that's based on my personal experience playing Monster Hunter since its inception on the PS2 and onwards."
124,Dislexeeya,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051017778/,94,,1,385.0,April,"4,",187,3,1,"Monster Hunter World has a  huge entry barrier. It practically has no tutorial, they're just walls of text that a new player (like myself) would largely not be able to read with much comprehension. But, once you get past that hurdle, your enjoyment skyrockets and the game gets even more fun the more hours you put into it. I highly recommend playing it with some friends. Were it not for my friends to keep me going, I probably would've given up on the game early on.Getting to know the game takes some patience, especially if you like to take your time like me. Even with my experienced buddies and watching some vids, it was a slow learn for me. I'll be transparent and give my timeline of learning the game:8 hours in: Just now getting comfortable with the  mechanics. I've found a weapon type I enjoy—the switch axe—but I'm mostly just button mashing.16 hours in: Controls are largely muscle memory, making mistakes here and there. I no longer have to think when doing combos with the switch axe when it's in axe mode.34 hours in (time of review): I understand how affinity (crits) work, and I'm starting to learn how elemental damage works. I'm only now starting to integrate the sword mode of the switch axe into my combos—previously I only used sword mode when a monster was stunned or otherwise immobile for a prolonged period of time. I stopped using the 'Defender' weapon tree, as I'm now confident in how to combo and don't need the crutch of that OP weapon.If I were to give recommendations to new players:1) Get some friends to play with, they'll keep you going.2) Go to the training room and practice with all the weapons until you find one that clicks with you. To get to the training room, go to 'Your Room' (it's labled on the map) and speak with the cat person (palico) that isn't your companion cat person. They'll give you an option for training, where you can mess around and equip all the weapon types in the game.3) This is a hot take: Use the 'Defender' weapon tree. The Defender weapons are OP and do a lot of damage. The intent is to allow returning players to plow through the main game and get them to the post-game/DLC content faster. This extra damage will allow you to kill monsters just by button-mashing. As a new player, this serves as a safety net that'll give you time to familiarize/experiment with the controls and combos without getting frustrated by having your ass handed to you. Once you feel confident, switch to a normal non-Defender weapon tree.4) Don't use the Defender armor. See point 3 for it's purpose. By using the normal armor available to you, you'll learn how to evade (dodge roll) properly as well as understand what/how skills work and how progression works in the game. It's a great game, but it's pretty unwelcoming and slow to learn. However, once you get there it becomes incredibly fun. Bring some friends with you."

129,Fancy Fish,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fancy-fish/,130,6,1,264.2,June,"29,","1,334",10,1,"|                    ᐁ ᐁ ᐁ  ᐁ ᐁ ᐁ has been around for a while now on PC () but with a new incoming expansion (I) and the price dropping I thought a review might help some people decide if the game was for them.The player take the role of a  recruited by the 5th fleet, and aided by a  and a trusty  assistant (). You are tasked by The Research Commission to travel to the  to study the activities of   (tremendously powerful monsters on a truly massive scale). Character customisation is good with lots of options and you can even customise your Palico.The game may appear a little complex at first but once you have played for a while the basics will become very familiar. The formula is essentially this:Capturing monsters involves creating  and ,  a monster sufficiently (), luring the monster into the trap and then using the tranquillisers to knock it unconscious. This can be done on both capture and hunt quests.Large monsters are pretty varied and will change depending on the area of map your in - Giant lizards (), Fire breathing T-Rexs (), Giant electric squirrels (i), Dragons (), Inflatable Albino bats () to list just a few you will meet at the start (). The more you track a monster the more info you will find out about them (), each has its own set of weak spots and each has its own set of resistances and vulnerabilities. To be most effective, hunters should use appropriate equipment for the monster they are going to battle. (for example having armour that is highly resistant to fire and a weapon that deals water damage when facing the fire breathing Anjanath)Map areas are grouped by biome (Ancient Forest, Desert, a Cora landscape, etc)  and each have a very different ,  and .  an smaller creatures can be caught in your net to craft potions or items later, some can even be kept as pets in your room. ,  and  can be harvested, you can catch  with your net or rod and bait, you can explore and find , new  and . Each location is made up of a number of different  seamlessly connected together and which you can travel between and explore freely. Levels have quite a lot of  and  and I often times find myself getting turned around or lost (but ) There are 14 main weapon types in the game each with their own  and , each of these types then has many different  which can be crafted using  collected and harvested during missions. There is also huge array of different  (for you and your Palico) which can be crafted at the forge, each has its own set of armour ,   and , as you progress through the game and fight more monsters more of these armour sets and weapons will become available. I would recommend testing out the different weapons in the sparing area until you find one that suites your playstyle (also don't be afraid of swapping around either).I've given you some of basics but its really only scratching the surface, this game has a massive  to it which really helps considering a few of its flaws. , you will in Monster Hunter World need to fight the same type of monsters quite a number of times before you are able to progress onto a stronger monster (especially if solo). This is to increase your hunters level and also to gather the required materials to craft new sets of armour, weapons and items you will need against stronger foes. Until you learn a monsters you may well have a hard time avoiding attacks which can be powerful (rage attacks) with certain monsters and cause you to faint (sometimes in one hit if under geared and under powered). Due to the way this works this can sometimes create something of a () where you feel overpowered against the weaker monsters but get utterly trashed by the stronger ones. If you meet one of these either find a good  to support you or  your equipment to best suit the fight and learn the attack pattern, you will get through eventually!Graphics are good, even better with the free HD texture pack, I would recommend using  (guides are available) if colours are a little washed out, that and turning off motion blur. Lip syncing in cut scenes for English is absurd but easily overlooked.Playing a mission in  () is a lot of fun, and I would recommend coop as the way to play the game, however there is an issue with coop and the story campaign. For some reason (s) Capcom require players to first play a story mission through until the end of the /   before other players can join them in coop. This often means to play a story mission coop you need all players to start the quest, play until the battle, abandon the quest and then restart in coop mode, its quite absurd but possible to work around. However story missions are only part of the game and  quests,  quests,  and  do not have this issue. In addition to quests you can free roam the different biomes in  mode, but to do this in coop you first need to complete a quest with your team and all select return to camp.Well done if you've managed to read this far, honestly there is so much more I haven't covered in this review and more still I have yet to explore in the game but I hope this review has given you a feel for the game and some of the basics. Despite a few flaws this game remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, particularly for coop play and I would highly recommend it."

Get it even if you never played any of the games before. Get it and try to at least get to the credits and see how the game treats you. It may be frustrating or stressful to play at first or seem maybe boring at first glance, but the second you make that first push, oh man, it's like nothing else in gaming. Maybe the servers seem to treat you badly but it's really not that bad compared to the sheer good the game offers. It's really not intrusive at all and you can reconnect from the main menu. Connection->recently played or somesuch. You're welcome.Full transparency: I am a huge Monster Hunter fanboy. Full-on, rabid fanboy. I can however, without bias, tell you that Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game made so far. From a technical, conceptual and executional standpoint. I could tell you the technicalities of the game, but everyone does that already so if you're into that then you're wasting your time reading this. This is why my first sentence is what it is. I can't do the game justice here. I've written and rewritten what I wanted this part to be many times but it's just not coming together. I can't say it easily. It can't be said easily. It has to be peeled back layer by layer, but if you're a newbie, then probably nothing of it would mean much, if anything at all. So you want to get into Monster hunter? Fine, ...fine.Go, and type: ""Monster Hunter Zero"" into the Youtube searchbar and watch the video from the channel: ""folga"". Even if you have the game already or have started Monster Hunting relatively recently. Done? Play this game. With friends/family if you can. Convince 'em. Did you like it? Play Iceborne when it comes. Play at least one of the previous games if you can. If there's a will, there's always a ship willing to sail you in that department. My recommendations are: Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Monster Hunter Tri and 3U separately, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. In that order and one by one if you can do all. FU&P3rd or GU if you can't. This is important: Don't rush. Did the new MH after Iceborne come out? Play it. Think you done enough? Are you satisfied? Can you swing a fish to beat up some dinosaurs with now? How about a chainsaw? Two chainsaws!? A bone? Use cats to beat up cats. Eat some Kirin Cheese. Eat some wyvern head. Shoot unlimited elemental works from a weapon no one cares about. Make the coolest looking sword straight out of Gothic 2. Or a drill from TTGL. Or beat up Gurren Lagann. Make a mix set. Make 50 mix sets. Try out a new weapon. Sharpen your weapon back up to yellow. Sharpen your hammer, sharpen your anvil, sharpen yor bagpipe, sharpen your recorder-bell, sharpen your wyvern head. Go into mud. Go into lava. Go into water. Go down into a hole. Go up a mountain. Get deep into the jungle. Lie down into sand. Listen. Catch fish. Catch bugs. Especially the Killer Beetle. No wait.. Shinig Beetle? Shine on you... Killer Queen..?? Take those sweet as.s jeans and dodge some bayblade spins and boom-booms from a living train. Get rabies. Eat a pill that gives you rabies. Curse that flying as.shole that he left the area again. Look into those blue eyes and hate them and then love them and then be annoyed and then be content. Pick up some poop, pick up some rocks, pick up some weed and shrooms to heal yourself with. Collect honey and post how many you got. Time out on trying to get specific fish. Time out trying to find a flying ♥♥♥♥♥. Triple cart, quad cart! Get rocks thrown at you by a cucumber, get rocks thrown at you by a monkey, get poop thrown at you by a monkey, get snow thrown at you by a monkey, get spit on by a monkey. Get blown up and away, get poisoned and die trying to find the antidote you didn't pack. Get eviscerated, get smashed and then get smart, get fed and get your revenge. Reload your bowgun, reload your flintlock rifle, reload your armcannon, reload the siege cannon, reload your axe. Look at those ruins, so mysterious. Steal some barrels and acorn from cats. Have your pills stolen by cats. Give your cats acorns and barrels and boomerangs. You can find that tower in the jungle right? Go up to the top. Find silver and find gold. Let your gavel ring justice off ther thin tin skulls. Find speed and find serenity. Find wind, find the flames, find the mists and find a phantom lightning bolt. Find yourself in a world of poison and fire, in a world of poison and water, in a world of greenery and blood, in a world of snow and wind, in a world of the sun, moon and sands. Then you know what? Go sail a bit. Sail on the sea of sand. Marvel at the swimming mountains. Then sail on water. Ponder why it's so strange. Ponder why the story is so bad, but the lore so cool. Wonder why the sky above Schrade is always dark. Then see it yourself. Hear about it, read about it. Hear the legend and then BECOME the legend!! And then.. disappear. Sail across the sea, see the new world. Started in the new? Then you know the essence of all this is here as well. Go and see where we came from, you won't regret it.

133,♡Gojira♡,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198323518896/,64,5,1,381.1,April,"22,",87,0,1,"Honestly, I don't have much else to contribute to the review pool that hasn't already been said, so I'll just speak from my personal experience. This game kicks an incomprehensible amount of ass, plain and simple. After over 500 hours pumped into the game between PS4 and PC, I can safely say this is my favorite Monster Hunter game, and one of my favorite games, period. Visuals: Holy cow this game is an insane visual upgrade from the previous installments. This franchise went from looking like PS1 - PS2 games to next gen beauty. So much detail was put into every little nook and cranny of this game's, well, World! A whole 450 hours in I realized that there's a back door in the smithy's shop that leads to a staircase. Go up said staircase and you will be welcomed with a view of the surrounding area, and it is stunning. That's not even considering the monsters, which also have also gotten their own graphical advancements. 9/10 in the graphics departmentSound Design / Music: This one comes down completely to personal taste, but in my opinion they nailed the OST and sound design in this game. Every hit, every roar, everything just sounds perfect. All the most important monsters have their own themes, and all of which sound amazing. 8/10 in the Audio departmentUser Friendliness: Unfortunately, the game falls short in this case, which sucks since this is a VERY important part of a game as complicated as Monster Hunter, ESPECIALLY to new players. The game tells you basically nothing about how to use most weapons. All the main moves are tucked away in your Hunter Notes, with the more obscure yet useful stuff just straight up never being told to you. For example, with Greatsword you have a tackle move. The game tells you about the tackle move, but not all the best, most useful times to use it. Only from watching guides online I learned that you can tackle THROUGH A MONSTER'S ROAR. This is an insanely useful way to use this move, yet the game never tells you it! Every thing this game tells you is the most basic ♥♥♥♥ slapped on some text. Affinity, the importance of eating, the various NPCs around Astera, how to navigate the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ancient Forest, how to build a proper endgame set, and many more are all vital to an efficient hunter, yet the game either tells you too little, or doesn't tell you at all how to best utilize your knowledge about them. 3/10 for it's bad user-friendliness. Difficulty: I've seen a few people say that the basegame is one of the easiest in a monster hunter game, but that's mostly coming from veterans who got desensitized by the hellstorm that was the first couple entries. This game starts off reasonably easy, giving newer players a chance to get acquainted with the game, then basically pushes them off a cliff once the mid-endgame rolls around. You go from a reskinned version of a monster you already fought to an Elder Dragon that literally eats other elder dragons in 2 quests. The game's pacing may scare off new players, but I personally didn't have too much trouble with it. Power though, and harder monsters will get easier through experience, trust me. 4.5/10 difficulty for early game6/10 difficulty for mid-game8.5-9/10 difficulty for endgameMonsters: Easily the most important part of this game, and in my opinion the monsters are awesome! You got a Dragon that shoots tornadoes at you, a wyvern that has explosive scales that it drops on you like a WWII bomber plane, a Hellhound that zooms around the map at breakneck speed, a T-Rex that sneezes fire, the list just goes on. My only gripe is that there isn't much in terms of diversity. Pretty much every monster is a reptile of some sort. Thankfully this is fixed in Iceborne, so I can't complain too much. 7/10 for MonstersConclusion: Do I recommend getting this game? Absolutely! Do I recommend going in blind? Hell no. NEVER feel bad about using guides in this game, they make all the difference. I recommend Arekkz, TheGameconomist, and Boomstick Gaming. Without these guys, I would've given up a long time ago. This game is also AMAZING with friends. I did my most recent run with my buddy, and It is so much more fun to kill monsters as a team. Overall, it's got a few rough edges, but it excels in most other departments. Overall, 8.5/10 Really makes you feel like a poacherCiao! :)"

136,Sjark,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Azeur/,137,6,1,"1,350.9",January,"23,",484,2,1,"Unfortunately it had a bit of a rocky start, in addition to some odd decisions.Most negative reviews on this game will most likely talk about ""connection issues"", MHW had quite the rocky start regarding server stability. Those issues are long gone now, the only times I get disconnected nowadays I only have my own internet to blame. If you go looking at the negative reviews, pay attention to how many hours they have played and think about that.The secondary thing I feel mentioning upfront is that while this is a game where cooperation is highly encouraged, for some reason other players can't join your story quests if you haven't seen the cutscenes first. This can be rather annoying if you are playing together with friends, and unfortunately there is no good solution for the players. So you'll end up having to do the quest alone, watch the cutscene and wait for the notification that you can use SOS Flare. At that point your friends can join, alternatively you leave the quest and group up together with your friends, doesn't matter.There aren't *that* many of the story missions, the meat and bone of the game is beyond the story so to speak.With that out of the way.... (just skip to bottom if tl;dr)This game is absolutely gorgeous! The environments are beautiful, there's plenty of places to explore, paths to find, things both inanimate and living to collect and obviously monsters to hunt...You'll be able to see a monster from far away, so if you have clear line of sight you can spot monsters much further away than other games would allow.The monsters look fantastic, and they actually have like routines to their daily life. So if you are sneaky enough, you can follow after a monster and watch it as it goes about its business. It'll mark its territory, leave foot prints, maybe spit/puke on trees and the ground and of course hunt. The monsters don't take kindly to others coming close, neither hunters or  other monsters. So while you're hunting one monsters, you might find another monster who decides to fight the monster you're hunting! In fact, everything in this game looks great. Except for the handler, but you can change her looks with mods if it is too much.This game probably has one of the deepest combat systems I know of.When you start playing, you'll get the choice between the basic metal version of all the weapons.Your choices are: There is no  choice when it comes to picking a weapon. While some situations might feel better with certain weapons especially if you're still learning, overall all the weapons are very balanced and offer quite different play styles.Not only do the weapons offer a nice diversity in play styles, most/all of the weapons have a surprisingly deep system of attacks and combos.As an example; the great sword might seem real straight forward, but it has a move that can be surprisingly effective against monsters. Normally you'll be slamming that baby down on the monster, and if it attacks you'll try to block or dodge. However! If you master the shoulder attack, you can interrupt the monster's attack and possibly even stagger it, leaving it exposed for more hurting.Another example is the insect glaive, essentially a polearm that comes with an insect that you can feed to make it more powerful. With it you can jump up a little to do aerial attacks, or swing around on the ground. But if you take the time to collect essence from the monster(s) you hunt, you'll unlock stronger combos and even aerial attacks that allow you to stay airborne for as long as your stamina and/or essence lasts!There are many examples like this, so if I feel somewhat tired of a certain weapon I can just change to a different one for a completely different feeling in both tempo, damage, and intensity. For example, if I'm lazy I'll just go gunlance and play it safe. But don't mistake that for gunlance being a tame weapon, in the right hands it can destroy monsters.In some cases, the weapon has a different playstyle based on the upgrade path you picked for it.The weapons can deal all sorts of damage. Anything from the typical elements like fire, ice, thunder over to stuff like poison, dragon (yes) and even debilitating effects like paralysing and even sleep. Yes the monster can be forcefully made to fall asleep during combat, for reasons you'll discover.When it comes to actually hunting the monsters there is  important thing to always do.That's dead serious. Capcom's Monster Hunter series is one that rewards patience and due dilligence. When you fight a new monster, focus on just understanding it first. How it moves for attacks, roars, where it normally hunts, where it roams and even where it sleeps... If you don't pay attention, the combat can quickly become punishing or as some might say, ""like dark souls!!!"".Unlike that game, the attacks of the monsters are well telegraphed (most of the time) and while a monster can feel really overwhelming in the beginning, with time you will conquer it and dominate it.The monsters are well designed, both for combat and movement. While some fights can feel frustrating because of the hit boxes being slightly misleading on certain monsters, it's overall a very fair system. You'll learn the ins-and-outs of the monsters in no time.There are no levels in this game. There is hunter rank, but it's mostly just an indicator of how much time you've spent hunting. So a HR 50 have as much HP and stamina as a HR 1 player.The difference comes down to the armor, decorations and of course the weapon they are carrying. The gear you choose will eventually have more to them than just defence and resistances, they will have skills available.Some skills will increase your max HP, some will increase your raw damage, some will increase elemental damage, some will make you dodge further or even make you eat faster! (yes)Additionally more powerful equipment will even have set bonuses. To obtain the gear you want, will require lots of hunting and that's half the game.The game loop can probably be summarized as plainly as thisHunt monsters for materials, use the materials to craft better gear, use the improved gear to hunter stronger monsters and keep trying to reach higher and higher!It sounds simple, but that satisfaction of finally beating a monster you've been struggling with is so good. It's a game where you can noticably see the difference between the ""old you"" and the ""new you"" after playing for a good while. I currently have 430 hours in the game, there is still so much for me to learn.I barely know how bowguns work, I have never used charged blade and there are many weapons I don't use much or haven't mastered yet. So I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself having more than 1000 hours in this, because it's just so  hunting with the weapons in MHW.Looking forward to the events that are still coming to MHW, and I especially look forward to the announced expansion Iceborne.I don't really know what more to say. I love this game, it's fun, it's a game I can keep coming back to for more action. In a way, this is my ""skinner box"" game. Good thing I picked a game that doesn't have microtransactions or loot boxes. Just pure quality and fun (and some pain...)TL;DRYou hunt huge monsters with cool weaponsYou can mount the monstersYou can use a wide variety of weaponsIt's a really satisfying game with a good repetition loop. It's an easy game to get into, and hard to master. Just gotta play it at your pace.Ignoring the nitpicks I have about it, a 10/10 game."

The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018.++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts. + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.o Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clichéd characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version.It deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.Recommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish.Keep in mind that this game is a random number generated grind festival. Estimated time for 100 % completion: +400 hoursSingleplayer achievements: 95Multiplayer achievements: 5"

139,PizzaKrydder,https://steamcommunity.com/id/foxkids123/,64,1,1,610.1,April,"20,",666,2,1,": The game is great for new players, and will feel familiar to returning players. There are a lot of QOL changes that may/may not be good depending on how much you liked the feel of the older games.If you are no stranger to the previous MH games, then you will feel more or less right at home with this one! With gorgeous environments and 'open world-ish' maps, it's by far the best looking monster hunter game of them all. The world feels alive in a way it never did in past installments which helps to make each hunt feel more like an actual hunt. If you have never played a MH game before, then this is a really good place to start. In my opinion, and that of most other hunters, world is the easiest game in the franchise to get into, but that does not make the game any less challenging or worse off than the others. But at the same time, if you end up liking world, and don't mind a graphical downgrade, then check out the older games as they're definitely still worth picking up and playing.As for gameplay, it's real simple -- It's pretty much given away in the title of the franchise. You create your character, get introduced to the world and your first few monsters, and then you hunt them. You hunt them for materials you can use to upgrade and craft both new armor, and weapons. You then use your new gear to hunt other monsters, and so it goes.I know it doesn't sound like the most thrilling gameplay loop ever, but it really works and that's all thanks to the fact that nearly all of the monsters are a blast to fight. Not to mention that you have a lot of weapons you can bring to the fight as well, each with unique playstyles to them. Finding the weapon that works for you, or experimenting around with the different weapons available is a lot of fun!Each hunt is essentially just a boss fight, and the difficulty of each encounter is mostly governed by how prepared you are to face whichever monster you're hunting. Combat is slow paced for  weapons, so positioning is important. You also have the option of teaming up with 3 other people online, or of course, bring your own friends along for the ride.All in all, gameplay is satisfying once you get the hang of it, and some of the end-game fights can get pretty crazy! That aside, if you're familiar with the franchise, there's a ton of QOL changes to the game. Like being able to move while chugging your potions, insta harvesting plants and quicker mining, monsters attacking each other instead of locking on to you etc. Some are great, some not so much depending on how much you enjoy the play and feel of the older games.Regardless, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to both returning players and new ones alike!"

145,TheTitaniumDragon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/,53,1,1,262.9,May,"24,","1,923",0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a 3D action-adventure boss rush game – and a quite good co-op experience, though with some significant annoyances due to questionable multiplayer game design choices on the part of Capcom. I played through the entire game with a friend, and I had a blast doing it – and yet, we had to engage in some shenanigans to be able to actually play through the campaign together cooperatively.The basic gameplay cycle of the game is pretty straightforward – you eat some food and craft some items in your home base, while talking to a few NPCs who give you various items for completing tasks and quests. You go and take a quest from the quest board, which is almost always to hunt a big monster out in the world.When you accept the quest, you are taken into one of a half-dozen zones and need to go find the monster. Typically, you do this by collecting some monster footprints, and once you collect enough of those, you get a trail guiding you to where the monster is. At this point, you start fighting the monster.You will battle the monster for a while, but eventually it will run off into another area of the map; you don’t have to track them again, and you can rather easily pursue them there, where you continue the battle. Rinse and repeat until you have killed the monster or have used a trap from your item inventory to subdue it.After you win, you carve the monster’s corpse up for body parts and are given a quest reward (which gives more body parts – and even more if you captured it, to make up for not cutting it up) and then go back to town to craft more items.All of this sounds pretty basic, but in practice, it’s actually really fun. There are dozens of monsters in the base game, and then dozens more in the Iceborne expansion, which is basically another game unto itself tacked onto the end of Monster Hunter World. These monsters almost all have unique attack patterns and appearances, with only a handful of monsters that are just recolors. As you progress through the game, you unlock first high rank, then master rank monster hunts, and the monsters at higher difficulty levels are not only tougher and deal more damage, but also gain new attack patterns (including entirely new attacks not seen at lower levels!) and are significantly more aggressive. This gives the game far, far more gameplay variety than is seen in many games – there are a huge number of fairly elaborate “boss monsters”, and your goal is to defeat them all so you can kill them and wear their skins.In addition, you are given a whopping 12 different weapon types to choose from. This includes nine different melee weapons and three different ranged weapons. These have a very high degree of variety – the attack patterns and reach of different weapons are wildly different, with weapons ranging from the extremely slow and powerful great sword to the extremely fast dual blades. Some weapons allow you to block attacks with shields (or in the case of the great sword, the flat of your blade), some allow you to move around while you have an attack charged up (instead of being stationary while attacking)… there is a great deal of gameplay variety in them, and they all favor different playstyles. All of them are viable in the game, though some are a bit better than others, and some weapons (like the bagpipes, which give group buffs) are stronger if you are playing with other people.In addition to all this, you have a “Palico”, a cat who you bring along with you. You get to choose their appearance, and dress them up in cute armor of their own. These also get “palico tools” that you level up and which give you various effects – be they healing you, stealing items from monsters, buffing the party’s attack and defense, or stunning the monsters with traps.There is also an inventory of, frankly, far too many items, which consist of healing items plus items that do various other things, like grant temporary invisibility, allow you to regenerate health faster, lay down traps for monsters, give you special ammo types temporarily, or buff you in various ways. Your inventory space is limited as well, which can be an annoyance when you pick up too many things on a mission.And on top of all of that, there are decorations and special skills associated with your weapons and especially armor that allow you to customize your character in various ways, giving you resistances to various types of damage, letting you use items faster, or buffing you in a broad variety of ways.The core gameplay, thus, is really good – you not only have a ton of different boss monsters to fight, but also a bunch of weapons that you can fight them with, all of which feel pretty different to use, and a high degree of character skill customization on top of that. You make your weapons out of monster body parts, so you can experiment a bit but also are given some direction on which monsters you want to hunt next. As none of them require too many parts, you generally don’t need to farm a specific monster more than a few times at most to craft a better weapon.The cooperative gameplay is pretty good as well – you can join someone else’s session and go around hunting monsters with them, joining in on their quests with them. Additionally, there is an “SOS flare” that can be fired off during a mission to allow any player in the world to join your game and help you out. Up to four players can play together alongside each other at a time.The game uses a scaling mechanism to make monsters tougher when you play in multiplayer – playing with two players doesn’t quite double the monster hit ponts, while playing with 3-4 doesn’t quite quadruple it. The result is generally that multiplayer makes things easier, as the monster ends up more distracted and you have more time to heal or otherwise prepare yourself. Playing with two players felt fairly ideal – you get to keep your palico companions, which is useful due to their special abilities, and it also doesn’t feel as unfair as it can with four players all beating up on the monster simultaneously. The only downside of playing in multiplayer is that missions are failed based on the number of faints for the whole team – so while a single player fainting three times would end the mission, so does three players fainting once each. Against some enemies with powerful area of effect attacks, this can be something of a liability.The biggest problem with cooperative gameplay is that the core missions of the game are ill suited for it. You are not allowed to join a mission until the host has seen all the cutscenes – but if you haven’t seen all the cutscenes for that mission yet, you can’t join theirs, either! The only way to play through the story together is for one player to enter the mission, trigger the cutscene, then exit out, then wait for the other player to get to the cutscene so they can enter their mission to complete it together. This is even worse with 3+ people, as all of them have to do this in order to play through the main story together. There is no reason for this – indeed, some of the later special missions have cutscenes but allow players to play together on them from the get go, meaning that the restriction was entirely arbitrary.The other weakness is that the game's endgame is very grindy and not very fun - but after playing the game through, you'll probably be pretty sick of it by the endgame. I would recommend taking a break between the first game and Iceborne.All in all, Monster Hunter World and its expansion, Iceborne, is a really great game. It takes a bit of getting used to the combat, but the game is a blast, especially with a friend. Just don’t keep playing after you’re sick of it."

Not gonna lie but this may be the best action RPG or perhaps the best game on steam to exist yet and I maybe obsessed with it at this point. It offers everything that one may desire in any game. MH games aren't plot driven but this game offers a decent one compared to all the other previous line-ups which had little to none. (Whoever decided to make cutscenes unskippable, please don't) Possibly the best co-op experience out there. (Soulsborne games should learn a thing or two from it) May very well end up creaming your pants. Close to being perfection. Absolute bonkers. Can surely say that it's 2x or 3x bigger and better than the base game by miles. Get prepared to lose your touch with reality. Non-tedious and amazing in most cases. (Yeah I'm looking at you, GTA Online) Endless. Riddled with jaw dropping in-game collabs.All in all, it's a game crafted with love, passion and admiration by the devs. The support this game got was truly out of this world. Devs really listen to their community. Triple AAA studios should really take notes from this game. In the end, I'll wait for the sixth gen MH to top this one."

156,Dfactor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/,109,3,1,230.1,September,"5,","1,739",7,1,"Monster Hunter: World is a solid way to experience the franchise on PC. If you've been curious about the series then this is a good starting point: the gameplay mechanics are nicely refined, there's enough in-game content to keep you occupied for a while and you can always have a blast with friends or strangers. The initial release was pretty rough, but this PC version was patched up over time and eventually became on par with console counterparts and better.This game has tons of content, enough to keep you occupied for months. The base game already had a respectable amount of hunts to do and the gradual free content updates that have been rolled out throughout the years have expanded the game even more. New gear, new events, new monsters have been added and all of that requires a solid time investment. This, without a doubt, is the biggest Monster Hunter game ever created.Each weapon class has a distinct play style. You're given all the weapons from the get go, so you can go out and try them all out. It's possible to jump in directly into action and do the trial and error way or, alternatively, check all the moves in the training area. This area is perfect for figuring out your favorite attack strings, as within this area all your damage output is shown and the game provides the player with an overlay of all basic attacks, like in a fighting game. You can pick your favorite weapon class and pretty much play until the end of the game. Of course, it's best to be familiar with multiple weapon classes, as different monsters may require a different approach. There's only one place where the player might be forced out of their main weapon comfort zone — the arena. The arena challenges are essentially time trials that offer players set gear, weapon and item presets to fight with.The quality of life improvements in comparison to previous titles are immense, there are tons of tweakable options and interface shortcuts. The development team took everything they knew from the previous games and made this the best Monster Hunter game yet. It's possible to customize your item inventory, putting everything in your own personalized order. Then there are the radial menus that allow you to pick any item or even gesture without scrolling through the inventory or going through lengthy menus. Item management in general is easier and things like gear and weapon stats are more descriptive, even if they look a bit too overwhelming at first glance.It's important to point out how refined the game play mechanics are. Monsters have very distinct attack patterns, character controls are solid and if you screw up then you know it was your own fault and not the game's. The general controls are tight and require precise inputs and timings, cue the Souls-like comparison. The series are indeed known for the difficulty, however, the learning curve in this game is just right.The story has never really been important. Any Monster Hunter game that I've played had it and I can't say that I can remember much, because it quickly becomes irrelevant. It's used as a reason to hunt monsters, a reason to gradually introduce more difficult monsters, but it's really unengaging and bloated to say the least. Tons of text and dialogue is thrown at you with all the fancy names and terms just to confuse even more. Racing games are plagued by the same approach and the situation with story engagement there isn't any better. The inclusion of the story by itself isn't a bad thing by any means, but in this case it's closely tied to the gameplay until you've finished all story arcs. Then you can do whatever you want without any restrictions whatsoever.The amount of story, tutorial, messages and things that you're supposed to check and remember is overwhelming, headache-inducing even. The introduction sequence is fine, but when you're thrown in the meat and potatoes of the game there're tons of things that are thrown in your face all at the same time. Granted, you don't need to do much to start your first real hunts. Since this is the most ambitious Monster Hunter title yet, it makes sense that this title has a MMORPG feel to it.This isn't the first Monster Hunter game to feature Co-Op, so the team has experience, but it's the one that has dumb and backwards story mission Co-Op system. To make the cooperation system more confusing than it should be there's a restriction which prevents the player from playing a story mission together with someone until the player has seen all story-related cutscenes within that particular mission. Meaning that if you were planning to just sit down and seamlessly play with your friends, then that's not going to happen. The host needs to view all cutscenes and then either shoot an SOS signal (which opens the floodgates for any player to join in, so your friends might miss the opportunity) or quit the level and make a new lobby for it. Why couldn't the other players join in to view the cutscenes is beyond me.Every time I open the store page for the game it never ceases to amaze me how many DLCs are put on sale. I don't have a single game in my library that would have ... 174 DLCs on sale. Sure, like 10% of them are free, but this is something that you'd see on milked Koei Tecmo games, which isn't exactly a favorable comparison. I can understand that since this game has received countless content updates and is somewhat a live service then some players can opt in to spend extra money on bling. At the same time I can also say that this game has been a huge success across all available platforms, is Capcom's most sold game of all time and that it's still selling even now. Point being that with these kind of sales alone there should be enough revenue to keep the game afloat with content updates, reeling in new players and keeping existing ones interested.It's no big secret that initial first impressions of this game weren't favorable. With the huge maps filled with monsters and various visual effects the game hammered both CPUs and GPUs alike, even if you had a high-end system. In my particular case both CPU and GPU have near 100% utilization at targeted 1080p60 and that's not even with all of the effects maxed out.In terms of performance, I can't say that much has changed since the release. The console version frame rate is all over the place and goes as low as 20 FPS, so being able to experience this game at a responsive frame rate ranges is worth it. What did rapidly change is the hardware market: thanks to AMD, high core count CPUs are now available for cheap and newer graphics cards rip through this game easily.One thing that was soon discovered after the game's launch is that the texture quality on PC's highest settings was a step below the consoles. There was no real excuse to have dumbed down texture settings while also offering other visual settings that go way above the console quality. It took way too many months before this was finally addressed and now you can enjoy the game the way it was supposed to be from the get go.Another major issue that I personally didn't encounter much is that people often had connection issues and got kicked out of the lobbies mid-session. Considering that hunts can be up to around 50 minutes long, such behavior is really frustrating. This undesired behavior was patched, but even today there are people (probably on weaker connections) that still suffer from this.The game leaves good first impressions. If you get drawn into the cycle of enjoying the combat and grinding for better gear to whack even stronger monsters, then you'll spend hours upon hours in this game. Content patches and game fixes addressed majority of my complaints, so I can easily recommend Monster Hunter: World in its current state.Review copy provided by Capcom Co., Ltd."

Simply making your own builds and testing them gives so much joy, especially considering how, while there is most certainly a meta, you can use pretty much any weapon, and any build, and find some amount of success. No other game makes me feel this way; there always seems to be some build that is just better than the rest, and if you want to go to the higher levels, you are all but forced to use that particular build. For this reason alone World is one of my favourite games of all time."
158,ღ Ayumi ღ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CuteGrillNoticeMePls/,78,1,1,475.7,August,"29,","1,738",0,1,"I would argue that MHW is the best game in the series. For those unaware, the premise is to simply kill monsters, obtain their materials, use those materials to craft stronger gear, and fight stronger monsters.There is a skill involved in learning monsters attack patterns to play through the fight, where each hunt can take 10-20 minutes on average. You get eased in with weak large monsters at first, until you eventually hit a wall. You'll know it when you get to it.Pick your new weapon main, learn your combos and how to play out the hunts, and you'll have some of the most fun you can have in an ARPG.It's worth full price, however if you could get it on sale with the Iceborne expansion, you'll be busy for hundreds of hours. The game is absolutely beautiful, so make sure you actually meet the recommended specs. If you don't, MH:Rise is a great option, however Rise is noticeably easier than World which is one of the few reasons World is a superior experience."
159,Armored Core,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aclr_gg/,42,2,1,"1,769.7",May,"1,",171,1,1,"I waited until I've played at least 1000 hours to post this review:I love this game to bits and would buy it again in a heartbeat. However, this game is not for everyone.Do not buy this game if you are not into grinding. Monster Hunter is all about fighting the same monster again and again to build gear or to learn the monsters move.  If this does not sound like a good time to you, turn away now.That said, the big improvements come from the Iceborne expansion. All the favourite monsters make a return as well as gear. I think the only con would be that you will not be able to experience any of these monster early because they are all tied to the expansion unlike in previous games where you may get i.e a Tigrex in low rank (granted that Tigrex came in a full release expansion game in MHP2G), so thinking back, low to high rank was very short story-wise and gameplay-wise too. But that's a very tiny nitpick."

The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. I have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge."

If I could go back in time and experience my first blind playthrough again, I absolutely would. Monster Hunter World is probably my favorite video game of all time. If you're on the fence about Monster Hunter (any game in the series, not just World) I would say it's a little bit like learning an instrument. There's a lot to figure out, you're going to feel like you don't know what you're doing, and it's probably going to be hard at first. But if you're not afraid of being bad at a video game, you're in for one hell of a ride. Is this game... Overwhelming? At times, sure. Grindy? At the endgame, absolutely. Full of RNG percentage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥? If you want to be top-tier-meta, you have to get lucky, sorry. But All of the negatives I found with this game are entirely optional, kind of like NG+ and all the *walls* I ran into came after about 80 hours or so. I could've stopped playing the instant I felt that the gameplay loop was giving me diminishing returns, and I would've 100% felt that I got my $60 worth. (I didn't, but that's not the point.)People often say a Monster Hunter game doesn't begin until after the credits, just like all gigantic JRPGs, but that's not how I remember World. Exploring some of the most beautiful levels I've ever seen, learning how to properly use my weapon (only to discover a new move after another hundred hunts), seeing patterns and learning how monsters telegraph their attacks, and the addiction of getting the one item drop that lets you finish a new armor set. I imagine this is how people who only play SoulsBorne games feel, minus the  masochism. In terms of sheer joy, this is up there with those moments as a kid playing Guitar Hero for the first time, or staying up until 4am at a friend's house playing Smash. Again, this is probably my favorite video game ever, and I wouldn't even say I'm good at it. After 350 hours I played 99% with 1 weapon, and so you could make the argument that I've barely scratched the surface, with 11 others waiting for me to pick up on a replay. (I won't, but again, that's not the point.)For what it's worth, I played mostly solo, but multiplayer is a blast too. I don't really have a conclusion or closing statement or anything like that, I just wanted to gush about this game. Thanks for reading this far, hope you're having a nice day :)"

Combat is incredibly fluid and heavily centered around performing combos to maximize your damage output. On the surface all looks and behaves well, but the game in general is quite the resource hog (focused on more below). Be that as it may, the game's combat in itself both looks and feels great, and so comes off as a positive point.+Hunts: This is the main thing you will be doing in the game, and I can happily say that each new creature you hunt is enjoyable, in the sense each hunt feels similar to a boss fight, as it should. Fighting each new creature, figuring out their attack patterns and weaknesses is what makes each new hunt so thrilling, and MHW does just that with this release.+Graphics: The game looks great, simple as that. Each creature you meet and the expansive environments to travel in are stunning.+Variety: You have a total of 14 weapon classes to choose from. Each providing their own sets of benefits and demerits, and allowing you to take on different means of approaches for a hunt. These varying classes basically allow at least one fit for any hunter to mesh with their preferred playstyle.+Cats: Your Palico companion, and chefs, are simply adorable. That's really all I want to say, but your companion in specific is very helpful and still gives you a partner if running solo. Your Palico can assist in a variety of manners be it in damage, defense, or restoration. -Optimization isn't the best, more modest rigs are going to have a tougher time of running it (my 1080 barely passes 60 fps on high in 1440p, even when out of combat). UPDATE: After turning off volumetric rendering for the fog in the advanced settings I'm getting between 90 - 100 fps on high. Hard to say how much of an increase lower end rigs will experience so I'll leave this up as a ""buy with caution"" point.UPDATE 2: According to hardware monitor my i7 8700k almost reached 100 degrees celcius, this is NOT okay. Yes the game is more cpu intensive, but to the extent that my hardware is well past the threshold any CPU should reasonably take shows that the game is more poorly optimized than initially thought.-Denuvo: people seem to be experiencing a lot of issues and from what I'm seeing it seems mostly due to the anti tamper denuvo in the game. If it's as bad as it seems, you may want to make sure your computer is compatible which, if it isn't, will suck for more than a few I'm sure (knew there was denuvo but didn't interfere with my experience, guess I was lucky). -Online: It's only kinda functional, at first playing with my friend was a bit confusing due to how lobbies worked but after figuring it out we got to hunt together, BUT we have experienced connectivity issues in the game and randomly disconnected from one another. As we were continuously communicating through discord, it's evident that this isn't an issue with our actual connection to our internet.-Controls: I've personally opted to use a controller from the start, and have no real complaints about the controls. But experimentation with the KB+M felt very off. The mouse in particular behaves like a joystick rather than a mouse for aiming with the cursor, and causes for some incredibly awkward movements. There doesn't seem to be any way around this either. I'd recommend a controller if possible for other buyers, but this will come as a bummer to many if not (unless this is later fixed of course).My first real Monster Hunter game in the series and I love it, recommended to all, newcomers and veterans alike. Will update more if need be as I play through the PC version.Additional info: After playing through the game a bit more, more issues have sprouted up. The game works and I am indeed enjoying it, but there are many who are going through worse due to these stated issues. As such, I advise caution to purchasing this game immediately, it may be best to bide your time and see how the game is patched."

186,Makobean,https://steamcommunity.com/id/makobeef/,40,1,1,"1,690.4",July,"12,",128,2,1,"With the release of Alatreon it has officially been 10 years since I picked up my first Monster Hunter game and if it wasn't clear enough by the amount of hours I have on PC alone, I am very in love with MHW. With that being said I would hope that I am more than capable of giving some insight on my experience with MHW as a whole.Firstly. The developers deserve all the praise in the world for releasing a great game brimming with tangible content. Ever since release they have also been consistently updating the game with new exciting monsters, weapons, armor, etc. for free! They have also been continuing to do so after the release of the Iceborne expansion several months ago, which alone had already doubled the amount of in-game content. A lot of triple-A titles these days charge you absurd amounts of money for extremely small content packages with little to no support following afterwards. This isn't even mentioning the small fact that MHW's cosmetic DLCs don't make you feel obligated to buy them when comparing them to the cosmetics that the base game has to offer.Being the first world-wide Monster Hunter to release on all major platforms, there is without a doubt a handful of things the devs have not handled perfectly following its release. The major killer being co-op in the early game, primarily just for the story quests which normally only last a few hours anyway. I for one think the story should be handled alone for the most part so new players can steadily learn and adapt to the game to avoid frustration in the future. Besides that I still do encourage seeking guidance from veteran players when needed without ruining the game's experience. I myself have helped dozens of friends in the past learn the game because I knew it was entirely worth the effort.With all that being said MHW is indeed an objectively grindy game on paper when you really start to sink your teeth into it. As with a lot of games there's an expected level of tedium when it comes to any kind of grinding. Regardless, as with every good game, there is always some sort of repitition to be had in it's own right. The game is only ever ""grindy"" if the player makes it so. Yes there are times where new players will have to take things slow but for the most part anyone can just casually progress through the majority of the game without any huge stops(Depending on the player of course). There is always something meaningful or important to do regardless if it has anything to do with grinding. However if you're the type of person who does enjoy min-maxing gear or heavily personalizing your play-style then it's a very rewarding grind if you put yourself through it. Hence all the players who enjoy the game.Moving on. The game offers the player 14 different diverse weapon classes to freely choose from. Some weapons are easy to learn but have higher mechanical skill ceilings, while others are more technically complex but are easier to master, some just outright more stylish than others. Armor can be mixed and matched to your liking to provide different skills and abilities to help further personalize your play-style, whether it's situational skills or ""comfy"" skills. All of this on top of the game's straightforward yet beautifully in-depth character customization at the start of the game(Which is permanent unless you pay a couple cents to re-edit your physical character). Also I'd like to mention that even though there is a clearly defined meta when it comes to dealing damage in this game, the vast majority of the hunters who abide by these ideals are mostly all bark and no bite. You can't do damage if you're already dead. Therefore I strongly encourage everyone to play the way they want as long as it helps them survive.Speaking of death. In regards to frustrations with the harder content, every single quest in the game runs on a timer... I think it's perfectly fine if the devs want to give a couple of endgame monsters damage checks. The game was never meant to be easy. The game gives the player literal solutions to every problem in the entire game. It's just up to the players themselves to step out of their comfort zones to prepare for and overcome them all(Alatreon is not as hard as people make it seem). The only real penalty for death is the loss of used items, time, and reduced quest rewards assuming the player can actually complete the quest. Nothing too hardcore here.On a small tangent for active players. There have been lots of frustrations stemming from the newly introduced clutch claw mechanics. While I do believe the clutch claw is a perfect addition to MHW it was executed horribly. I feel the best way to implement these mechanics would be to have all weapons soften in one clutch but to allow certain normal attacks from slower weapons to straight-up soften or at least prolong the softens when making contact.Gameplay is insurmountable. When animations and sound design are done as good as this, it goes completely unnoticed and even taken for granted at times. Everything happening in the game feels so real and natural. Monsters have intention, weapons have believable weight to them, and the player characters make everything they do seem deliberate. Other games slowly lead you to a climax in which they grant a reward after. Where as MHW is one of those games where the climax is the reward, but that's the secret of MHW, you're always at the climax. Every second is a fight for your life yet also a display of power and finesse. A truly intense back-and-forth of instinct and endurance of whether or not you or the monster tires out first. All of that isn't even including the best part. The experience of fighting alongside other hunters. You see a lower-level hunter struggling so you offer them help and then cross paths with them, better than they were, in the future. Or you see another hunter using the same weapon as you so it turns into a competition of who's better with the weapon but you both end up completely in sync with your movesets while attacking the monster. Or the monster pins you down and that one annoying teammate who kept knocking you over with his weapon earlier ends up being the one dropping their weapon to save your life.It's a game. You're supposed to be having fun.Is all the time you put into having fun with something gone to waste because something else on the surface made you upset with the it at the end of it all?If this game at all sparks any sort of interest to you and you're willing to go in with a clear and open mind to experience the world of Monster Hunter World. You won't regret it~EDIT: Sorry for the edits. OCD things~"
187,Joker,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Amathor929/,43,,1,241.9,April,"9,",107,0,1,"Pros:- Very in depth, varied combat system where mechanics change drastically based on the weapon you wield.- Very in depth gearing system where gear gives you passive effects that you can stack up to be very good at a few specific things, like dealing a certain type of elemental damage or knocking monsters out or breaking certain body parts quickly.- Good variety of monsters to hunt.- All monsters (except the 2 siege monsters) can be done solo with enough practice, but you can always bring in other people to make a hunt easier, or if you just like teamwork.Cons:- Very grindy, you will need to hunt the same monsters multiple times (sometimes numbering near the 100's) to get the items/decorations you need for your build.- Combat is very unforgiving and learning new weapons can sometimes require weeks before you are able to use them effectively.- There will be no more additional content updates for the game.

It came to the point where I lost my girlfriend because of it. The game is not for everyone though. It can be described as a grindy game to get gear to progress. The way to feel a sense of progression in this game is not through a level-up system. It is done through acquiring new gear, learning new monster's moveset and finally overcoming the monster with your new-found knowledge and skills adapted to slay the target. It is said to be grindy because, defeating the target monster once, usually does not give you enough materials required for the full set or a particular piece of equipment you need. You have to fight the monster on average twice to obtain that monster's gear. Collaboration events unfortunately will fall in the same rule most of the time. For those who wish to be a completionist, like me, it will easily burn you out since the quest will become repetitive. To counter the mundane gameplay, there is an assortment of weapons to choose from, each with its unique styles and variations to play any given weapon. Some weapons may not be favoured for certain monsters, while some just outright abuse them. Picking out and trying new weapons are always a treat and learning techniques is always refreshing to learn or re-learn whenever you come back to pick up the game. So if you're ever bored, try out different weapons.Personally, I came from older titles such as Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Tri, and XX. Translating skills from previous titles to here is smooth and in World, there are many quality of life changes that just makes the game so much easier to play. So for returning players, I would recommend trying out World as well. For those that are considering getting the Iceborne expansion. I would also recommend getting it. Tired of walking from one place to another with your joystick or pressing ""w""? Iceborne introduces Uber. Experience riding on a monster. It is also possible to use items to sharpen your hammer or hunting horn while in transit. It saves time and looks hilarious by itself. However, I do recommend completing the base game before proceeding with the Iceborne content/region. Anything else would be spoilers beyond this point.Great game, one of my favourite games of all time. I thoroughly recommend it!"

Contrary to what a select few are reporting, I'm actually able to play it (and that seems to be what the majority are experiencing) but averaging about every hour/hour and a half, the game gets an error and kicks you out. (EDIT: Since the patch, this issue appears to have completely disappeared. There may still be crashes but I can only presume they're very rare)Before people flip their ♥♥♥♥, the issue actually appears to be related to Steam's newest reworks to their friends system and ecetera, so you can blame Valve for trying to fix what wasn't broken, and breaking things in the process.Anyway, the game's excellent. I'm not a series veteran but I had played Monster Hunter prior to this one, and this is certainly an excellent entry into the series. Expect:-Slow but satisfying combat. While the series can be compared to something like Dark Souls' systems, don't expect to be mega-mobile 24/7, with the ability to turn on a dime and run as fast as a speeding bullet. This game's combat is, relatively to even Dark Souls II (the slowest of all the Soulsborne games), even more methodical. While some weapons like the Bow or Insect Glaive let you be pretty mobile for those who prefer that kind of style, the game will demand that if you want to do serious damage, you'll have to commit to a position and stay there. The same, however, goes for the monsters you fight, so it's not exactly unfair.-This game to be more welcoming than pretty much any other MH entry. Now, don't make assumptions: This game is complicated as all hell (what with over a decade of new iterations adding more and more features), and there WILL be mechanics that will confuse you and you'll likely resort to guides on the Internet to fully understand, but this was explicitly made to introduce Monster Hunter to people who had never played it before, and it's also certainly not a dumbed down version of previous MH games. If you can handle the complexity of, say, an MMO, you can absolutely handle Monster Hunter.-A single gameplay loop (hunting giant monsters) that the game will repeat, a lot. If you're playing Monster Hunter for the campaign, don't. This game is made for people who enjoy that formula of planning, tracking, and execution that the series has refined to a knife's edge, and most importantly, it's made for people who are interested in repeating that formula into the post-game. If you just beat games and you're done with them, MH might not be for you, I'd recommend something more singleplayer-driven. (though this game can be played singleplayer and you can still enjoy it)-Slightly less ""content"" than most other Monster Hunters, but that's probably because they strimmed down the more grindy elements. Even then, we're looking at a 30 hour campaign, a post-game that'll bump the playtime to at least 70 for anyone interested, and a core game that can entertain people for 200+ hours if the core gameplay really hooks them. If you think 30 hours for JUST the main story, in a series heavily centered around post-campaign content, AND in a game that already reduxed the core gameplay of the series into the modern era in a way that feels more smooth and polished than it's ever been, is ""not enough"", I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to tell you.Overall, a very fun entry into the series that will hopefully serve as a good introduction to those who are new."

206,Randaru,https://steamcommunity.com/id/randaru/,"3,467",294,0,"1,356.9",October,"21,",139,165,1,"MHW, and specifically its PC port, have made huge leaps since the vastly inferior version a lot of people, myself included, slammed for blatant lack of care about their paying customers from Capcom. There is no denying it definietly got better. There is also no denying that there still are major problems (for example, lack of optimization got even worse and all redundant 3rd party software that this game utilizes got exponentially more intrusive) that do not justify ceasing all the work on fixing port problems. Yes, most of these problems can be fixed by mods. No, those mods are not included in ""box"" product, hence this point. With Iceborne's release, parts of main game combat got axed and moved into a new Iceborne-exclusive crutch feature (that majority of players either find unnecessary or downright hate, by the way), so only DLC owners can fully experience the main game content. This is just a petty, disgusting practice that no sane person will ever defend. About aforementioned crutch aka clutch claw feature - yes, despite all the steps made by Capcom in final title update to make it less frustrating and demanding, it still is what it was - a stick in combat flow's gears that forces people to interact with half-аssed mechanic that doesn't work properly 20% of the time, just to be able to... do exactly what you used to do without it in the base game? A new shoehorned mechanic wouldn't be such a big deal if it wasn't for the fact that most of new bugs, as well as random outcomes in combat, are directly tied to the fact that player is forced to constantly roll a dice whether it's gonna work properly, or randomly fail in many different possible ways and get them killed. New content coming up post Iceborne release was fun and challenging... until it wasn't. I know it is very hard to come up with new challenges and engaging fights within established rules, but completely breaking the rules is not the right approach in game design, which is exactly the path Capcom took with all the latest title updates.For example, there used to be unblockable attacks, and a skill to guard unblockable attacks. So, Capcom in all the light of their genius, gives monsters attacks that are... even more unblockable, and bypass that skill entirely? There are already monsters that you are safer just eating an attack from and going into invincible recovery than guarding and getting unsafe blockstun for several seconds, mind you, so why not just use that, to make the game obey its own rules? You have hyperarmor, but some attacks go through hyperarmor because... muh difficulty? You have a mantle used specifically to get a safe clutch claw on the monster, so now some monsters either ignore it or destroy it instantly with fast startup attacks? Why not design new fights in such a way that makes those options less safe, but without just making them obsolete? You did it right with Rajang's unique interactions with clutch claw, why take the lazy path and just disregard the tools you gave to your players in pretty much all later title updates?Some weapons being a better matchup than others against certain monsters was always a thing in Monster Hunter franchise, but certainly not to a point where you dump a weapon you have 1+k hunts on in favor of a weapon you've never played due to how little return you get on all the effort you put into playing your main weapon. Before title updates, some matchups had mandatory build adjustments: you pretty much had to slap a shield on your heavy bowgun to fight Ruiner Nergigante; however, now you just have to ditch the entire heavy bowgun just to not hate your life when fighting Fatalis or AT Velkhana, while there are weapons you can literally mash a button with and win those ""challenging"" fights.This is not challenging, this is just inconsistent and wrong - don't take my word for it, most of the experienced players from multiple game communities I play with agree that the entire weapon matchup balance against latest monsters is all over the place. If that's not convincing enough - look at your average speedrun differences, where all the fast melee weapons' gameplan is to just go in and proactively hit the lategame monster while dodging attacks mid combo, while all ranged weapons and some slower melee weapons are standing there and having a stare contest with the monster, waiting for a good AI RNG since they don't have any tools to counterplay most of its attacks.Anyway, later title updates - cool hunt designs spoiled by rule inconsistencies and artificial, inflated difficulty. With how little flexibility you have in your playstyle, they play more like gimmick bosses than actual monster hunts. I still can't tell if it's a core gameplay design flaw, or just Capcom being lazy to balance later hunts for all weapons and competent playstyles. Capcom made a wise decision to bring some of missing collab content on PC, which is a good thing, and one of the major grievance in outdated version of this review. They also synchronized updates for all consoles, but way too late, when it didn't really matter anymore. Most of existing input/GUI bugs or port-specific code artifacts got fixed. that conditions of obtaining some collab contant may vary, you may have to pay full price for things PS users had options to receive for free."

Haha.The game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom, Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad, but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now:- No more server issues.- Mouse camera controls are very fluid.The graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series.  Some people are complaining about low texture quality, but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt, don't usually pay much attention to it.The gameplay is challenging as ever, with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword & shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest, but with the most awkward last hit. ""A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante, bam, quest finished. Okay I guess, let's carve it.""I think things that lacking now are, the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1-F4 first before using items in quest), and the lack of meaningful event. I get it, baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one, or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.All in all, I think this game deserve to be put in your library. Just find a friend to play with 'cause hunting alone is somewhat boring in the long run."

You get 14 weapons to choose from, each with lots of moves and some even have different play styles among them. It's a game that even after thousands of hours you can still improve and learn new things. The monsters of course are the stars of the show and there's a wide variety of them (60+ if I recall correctly) and there's tons and tons of content even outside of proper monster hunting. Crafting gear, augmenting and upgrading it, improving your ""farm"", obtaining special items called boosters and mantles, collecting decorations to make builds, capturing pets, fashion hunting, exploring every locale... So much stuff to do. Also, blessed be the last update. Fatalis is amazing.EDIT: Updated for the Steam Awards, yet again"
214,Słonecznik,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheIronClover/,76,4,1,848.2,October,"22,",428,3,1,"Now, I love Monster Hunter and I whole heartedly recommend this game to fans of the originals as well as those who'd like to dip their toes into this amazing franchise. However there is a lot of controversy around World and especially the PC port which some people might read about and get worried about the game not being good enough and I'd like to adress some of these points. For those who aren't interested in these, just scroll down to the bottom for my thoughts on MH:World itself.First of all: The delay between Console and PC release.This one is actually quite simple. Compare a console with a PC, what PC you ask? Well, I don't know, Everyone has different hardware and it's hard to say what a ""standard"" PC looks like. And thats the big problem here. Consoles all have the same hardware, meaning developers can efficently optimise their game for those platforms without worrying about differences in performance, which is why for the PC release they had to take some additional time to properly port the game which from my over 300 hours can say they did quite well.Quality of the PC port.How well does the game hold up compared to the console counterpart? Quite well actually. Sure the game is resource intensive but the performance is smooth. Even mid-level PCs can run the game at solid 60FPS given they set up the video settings correctly.The one issue the port has is the interface which is clearly made for controllers but those menus are not gamebreaking. Opening the ingame text chat sure has a few clicks too much, but that aside, most things can be streamlined by taking a few minutes to adjust the control scheme of the game.The connection issues the game suffered from early on during the release also got resolved, making the online experience as smooth as never before as long as everyone has a stable internet connection.Lack of content compared to prior games:This is one many returning players like to bring up, which is fair. You pay a good chunk of money so you expect a good amount of content for it. But many seem to ignore one important feature of the franchise. World marked the beginning of the 5ft generation of Monster Hunter games. What does that mean for all those who are new to the series: Every generation includes multiple games, each effectively being an expansion of the prior one. Like MH3U being an expansion for MH3 for example. If you consider World as the first game of this generation and compare the amount of content with other first games of their generations, The amount of content is actually very comparable with the difference that World has reached a new level in world design which of course takes up a lot of dev resources as well. Iceborne will be acting as the second game of this generaton, except it's an expansion so you do not need to buy a new game, just a DLC. And you dont need to start fresh if you don't want to but can carry over your existing hunter unlike previous games where you effectively just grinded through the same content as the first game of the generation. So overall I'd say this is a massive improvement.Monster Hunter: World is a game not without flaws but thanks to the streamlined gameplay and quality of life features it manages to stand out from all other titles in the franchise as a unique game and a perfect entry into the series for new players while keeping all the core elements that made it so addicting for everyone who played the prior games. Is it easier than older games? Yes, quite a lot so, but with Low Rank acting mostly like an extended tutorial for new players while returning veterans can rush right into the endgame where their skills will be tested by Tempered and Arch-Tempered monsters.And lets not forget the mod support. The community made a vast array of mods already ranging from minor visual upgrades, to information focused interfaces and even custom quests which players can challenge themselves with."

For a very long time a lot of games never really drove me to play them, either because there was little to no replayability, or the concept of the game was cool and all but a lot of things get in the way of the experience whether it be because of an annoyance or the gameplay gets repetitive. However this game has a lot of those issues solved for me- Mechanics are quick and easy to learn- There's unique ways to fight each monster (even if it may be like darksouls in some cases)- The environments are well crafted to not only look good but have practicle uses in navigation - There's no hand holding because the game expects you to learn how to play it instead of tells you everything anytime- Tons of replayability due to the amount of weapons and the various trees that are available- Multiplayer capable (so that it can make some particulary difficult monsters a tiny bit easier though it auto balances them)- Well crafted DLC that feels like it's own thing but without feeling like it should be just it's own game (plus it adds to the replayability because it adds more stuff to grind on)Any many many more but I don't want to make this review any longer than it already is, but yes I recommend this A LOT"

Still, there's enough predictability to give you a sense of accomplishment when you complete a quest a little better than your last. And enough chaos you can't help but laugh at some of the monster's antics, other players, or even yourself.You can easily devote dozens of hours in the endgame to defeat a certain monster, and be quite satisfied to succeed in twenty minutes. A feat few attain.At this point, many players will think they've done all there is and move on to other games. But some will find themselves devoting hundreds more hours to complete it in ten minutes! In any case, they're no longer the same player: they have a much deeper understanding of their weapons and monsters. It is also inevitable that they find themselves bumping repeatedly into other like-minded players, and discover this ongoing journey is much more fun with friends.And it doesn't seem to end: there are communities who still find room for improvement, especially with a little teamwork. Among those with several thousands of hours under their belt are hunters who can accomplish the quest in under five minutes.You will meet all sorts - join us for an amazing journey."

220,GG.Sunshiners,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GGSunshiners/,34,,1,519.1,June,"29,",720,3,1,"Monster Hunter World is a co-op loot gathering action game that i will say its one of the best coop game that i ever played. Why it is that good you asked? I will tell you all the good things and the bad things about it in this review!I will first address the elephant in the room, or should i say... The big monster in the room, its the combat gameplay. It is really fun and challenging, the game basically has you fighting this big ass monster with their own move set and behavior that you learn and adapt with. It makes every battle feels like an epic boss fight that can last between 10-50 minutes. Just like every loot focus game, when you kill a monster you will get loot that you can combine to make weapons and armors that will make you do more damage and take more damage. With the new higher tier equipment for example, can make the monster fight that you epically beat after an exhausting 45 minutes battle with the lower tier equipment, be beaten in 10 minutes. The best thing about it is that you still feel the excitement of beating it cause it can still hit you, although it hit you with less damage cause of the new equipment, you still feel like you have the challenge to beat it faster and with less damage taken.Outside of the main combat, the gameplay also has you getting loot from your monster hunt and make equipment from it, i do have to say although i usually don't like a loot-based game cause it can get very grindy. In this game, the combat is very fun that i can tolerate having to grind for loot. It's still a very grindy and RNG-based game sadly. There's some method to lower that grind time like a way to get a coupon that can be traded for rare loot by doing the weekly quest. But it still only lower the RNG part somewhat, since there's still some loot that you can only get by hunting monster and pray to RNG God that you get the loot that you want.The great thing about this game is how many combinations of playstyle that you can do by using different weapons. There's 14 weapon type in this game and every one of them really changes how you approach to combat entirely. You can use lance and basically be a walking tank, really slow but can block a lot of damage coming to your way. You can bowgun and shoot them from far away and run away when the monster gets closer. You can even fly and comes down just to hit the monster at the right time using glaives. You get the point, there's a ton of different playstyle in this game and each of them can take a while to master. Giving the game a longer playtime assuming that you enjoy the core monster hunting gameplay.The story its... Okay. I really do try to follow the story and i just lost interest halfway through. The story basically can be summed up to, a group of hunters go to a new world, see a new monster and basically try to fight it all. Other than the main monster, i honestly already forgot why we need to hunt them. The plot really not the strong point of the game and its easily forgettable. But that's fine because most players that play Monster Hunter: World didn't play it because of the story. It will be better to just think that there is no story.The graphics and music! First is the music, it honestly got the same treatment as the story. Easily forgettable, outside of a few that stand out. I feel like they just put music not to enhanced the experience and more as a sound to make the game less quiet. I wish i have more to say about the music but i don't. The graphics, i will have to say that i play this game on the lowest settings, so it may have really great graphics, but i can't experience it. So, i can't say anything about this one.The question still remains, is it good enough for your wallet? I will say that its a very good game, despite a few flaws in it. I will recommend it to the fullest if you like action challenging boss fighting game, you will feel right at home with this one and will spend countless hours on it! Recommended!"

223,Alex Corner,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexCorner/,140,13,1,"3,817.4",December,"22,",127,4,1,"[Edit] After completing the game and achievements 100% , I wanted to write a detailed version of my review as I wrote the previous one excited. Before that, I want to tell you that I am new to Monster Hunter series and this is my first game.RPG , Single player , Multiplayer ( 4 players max. ) , Action so on as the tags says| Slaying Monsters | Make weapons and armor our of their bodies | Slay bigger and harder monster |Upgrade the weapons and Armor | Amazing story | A tough game | 14 types of balanced weapons | 4 Maps + 1 expansion DLC Map incoming | 40+ Monsters and more to come |Appropriate for Any age.• Graphics are Amazing and does run from Low end PC ( but on low settings ) as well. • You don't need to create new character and level to be support or DPS. The same character and any weapon can go however you like to. • Monsters feel realistic. They don't just fight you as AI. They have ecologies , turf wars ( fighting for ones turf ) , eating when tired or hungry so on. • Updates , DLC and collaborations constantly updated. • No Pay to win. All the DLC are costumes and visual beneficial except the expansion map incoming []• No long loading screens. They last around 2-14 seconds mostly. • Tough game but worth it and rewarding. • Even the grind doesn't bore you. • Fantastic Story and doesn't need you to play previous games to understand it.• Connection issues are fixed long time ago. Its not of an issue now.• Constant seasonal events updating. • Performance is amazing in all kinds of specs. Low mid and high. • High End PC can run High Resolution Texture pack  DLC to make it even more high quality textures.• Complexity & learning curve. For me the complexity and learning curve isn't very steep. But for my friends, some things seem to be hard to understand. I guess they are enjoying game too much rather than observing at least thats what they said. But in this generation everyone just googles the things that bothers them and find answers anyways. • Volumetric Rendering. This is an option in settings that boosts your performance a lot and reduces VRAM consumption by 1.2 GB. It just adds a fog that covers objects which are a little further away, most of the people don't like it as well. Especially considering that much of performance increase. Either way its your personal preference.• The game is Addictive. Seriously , I have spent a lot of time just watching at monsters mind their own business. The monsters just doesnt wait there to attack you. They in fact live like they are real living organisms. And a lot of detailed stuff.• Progress through your story (Assignment Quests) to unlock various perks. Armor Improvement , weapon Damage improvement & .• Herb + Phial = Potion , Potion + Honey = Mega Potion which heals you by huge amount of health. Flash bug = flash pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster face to make them blind or make flying monsters fall down. Dung = Dung pod , equip on slinger and shoot at monster which you don't want to fight yet its irritating you. It will flee away by doing so. • If you hit a point where its very hard to move on , inside the quest , press escape >  fire an SOS flare. Make sure you do it within the 10 minutes of quest started. If not people who comes to help you doesnt get rewards and those who know it ( most of them ) won't join. If the time has passed away , you can return from quest ( you will have the items you farmed and used items will disappear ) or Abandon quest ( you will return to town as if you didn't even go to quest , without losing items or gaining items from quest ). • If you fire an SOS and someone comes to help you , try not to die. As there is a limit to where you can die ( 2 is normal limit and 3rd time you die, quest is failed ). They are unable to help even if they came because of quest failure. So there goes my honest review about the whole game. Hope this helps you decide if you want to buy the game. And I am right now reached endgame and I am happy to help if you guys need any help. If I am not busy, I would surely help you. Ping me at discord ( AlexCorner#9324 ) or comment on this thread if you have any questions or if you don't have discord. I blocked incoming friend requests as I am selling some stuff in steam market and I don't want to negotiate on them."

229,Faunts,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115503354/,42,5,1,61.8,October,"4,",284,5,1,"While little pricier than most of the games I recommend I can definitely say getting the complete package is worth it. I'm also quite fresh to the Monster Hunter franchise as any of the games that did make it here were on the Wii and by the time the 2010s rolled around I was starting to move on from that platform. So here is an unbiased review of the game from the perspective of someone fresh.Pros:+ The game simply looks gorgeous, and while you certainly couldn't run this on a work laptop the game is really well polished with no crashes as of my near 40 hours playing thus far. I've had some frame dips when there are a lot of particle effects thrown into the air but they're immediately corrected the second after. I would still tone things down just to make it easier on your computer.+ Tons of really well designed armor sets that you can upgrade and continue to use even in late game, so nothing feels absolutely useless as you become more powerful. Because the armor sets have unique resistances the game encourages you to change your armor and weapons to fight the monsters you are hunting accordingly.+ There are so many different ways to approach your hunts that it's almost countless. You could bash the dinosaur's head in with an over sized mallet, OR you could bash the dinosaur and capture it, OR you could wait for the dinosaur to go to sleep and then blow it up with a powder keg to weaken it for the fight. With a total of 14 weapon types to choose from and several branching upgrade paths, added on top of that with countless utility items, the world is pretty much your oyster so it's entirely up to you on how you want to punch dragons/dinosaurs in the face.+ Music isn't exactly anything to write home about, but there are particular tracks featuring flutes and violin play that have caught my attention. All the music feels fitting and does a good job of going with the environments or fights so no complaints there.+ Sound design is almost flawless. I can't really say there's anything I would change except for making the impact sound of weapons a little bit louder and some of the monster sounds. I have noticed a couple chicken noises as well as stock audio animal sounds you would typically hear in cartoons overlayed with other noises. Other than that, weapons sound satisfying and the monsters sound fairly intimidating despite those two points.+ I'm not one for paying attention to video game food or even anime food, but damn does this game make food look GOOD. There is no point to this point, it simply must be pointed out. There is nothing more satisfying than eating a meal before punching dragons and or dinosaurs in the face, until you consider the fact that your food is being prepared by anthropomorphic cats... And they are indeed not wearing hairnets.+ Crafting is really straight forward. None of that ""You need to have an alchemy level of 30 to craft healing potion II !"" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You gather the stuff to make stuff and you can go to a botanist to generate stuff while you're gone so you can collect stuff to make more stuff. In other words, if you have the stuff you can make the stuff and not even my pessimistic ass can complain about that.Cons:- There are SO MANY useless animations for things just to deliberately waste precious seconds for no other reason other than to waste precious seconds. Getting on the giant iguana to chase whatever you're hunting? Better pet it first and ask how its day is going. Getting revived by your cat? Better get up and give him an exaggerated anime thumbs up and nod. Need to just take a quick swig of potion to cure yourself of poison? Better take two seconds to down the whole Gatorade. The last two I mentioned as examples can be helped to a certain extent such as just not dying like an idiot or making herbal medicine but that does not make this ♥♥♥♥ in the moment any less annoying.- Whoever thought it was a good idea to have unskippable cutscenes should be shot.- As far as I am aware you cannot skip the tutorial at all, and it goes on, and on, and on... I don't think the tutorials let up until I was 20 or so hours into the game. To make matters worse aside from wasting your time, I found myself having to check the wiki or Reddit forums for extra information on things anyway. So the game puts you through this long tutorials with a dump of information but it's not even enough to fully explain what it is trying to explain.- I feel like some of the vendors you can visit could have very easily been incorporated into the menu, such as quests, investigations, and the bestiary. I find it quite ridiculous that I have to go to the research facility, another hub, just to manage my investigations. Again, some of the design decisions made in this game feel like a giant conspiracy to waste the player's time, not to pad out the game time, but just to be an annoying ♥♥♥♥.- The story... I had no expectations coming in, none at all, but damn is the campaign a slog to get through. Disjointed dialogue even with Japanese voice acting, cringe deliveries, CANNOT SKIP CUTSCENE, and apparently they didn't care to even fully voice act the characters, so most of the voice acting is limited to cutscenes while out of cutscenes you read what they're telling you as they just spout unrelated vocal lines such as ""YEAH!"" ""OKAY!"" ""LOOK OVER HERE!"" and ""REMEMBER TO TAKE A BITE!"" You will feel more like a captive audience playing through this game for the first time, and simply perturbed the second time.Those are my thoughts on the game overall with 40 hours and no previous experience with this franchise. I think the game gets mostly everything right it's just a death of a thousand cuts where there are small inconveniences that stack up on one another as you play. For me it greatly annoys me, but for someone else it could be no big deal. I still highly recommend getting the game if you have a computer that can run it smoothly, but because I'm a broken record and I love penny pinching pick this up during a sale. Why impale your wallet for Capcom? Get everything in the deluxe as low as you can go!"

237,Tomatoshadow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tomatoshadow/,41,,1,559.7,May,"13,","1,811",0,1,"I think that Monster Hunter: World is basically everything I could ever ask from a game.I would not consider myself a veteran of the franchise. I played MH3 quite extensively and loved it. I tried to get into some of the other ones but hated playing on handheld... I had this idea that MH: World was going to be very different from the other games and put off playing it for a long time, but I honestly wish I hadn't!Everything I loved from MH3 was there. It felt like everything I liked about the game but better. I feel like they just improved everything.I love the concept at its core: You hunt monsters, harvest materials and craft better gear. The gameplay is fun and you have a huge variety of weapons that each have very different playstyles, so it's grindy but it's fun to grind.There are only a few maps. Each are pretty big, but especially rich in details and in stuff to find. Instead of having massive, empty worlds, you get very iconic zones that you learn to recognize over time. Instead of progressing through the game and forgetting ""old"" zones, you get to play in each of them for the whole game. I found myself constantly finding new shortcuts, new little hidden places with materials I hadn't seen before. It's fun even just to run around and gather stuff. If you've played any of the previous games, it's one big map now! No more transitions between zones.Crafting doesn't feel like a chore. The system is very well made and shows you dependencies when you've unlocked them and allow you to craft them first before crafting the item you want. You get plenty of ""loadouts"" or presets of items for your inventory, your equipments etc. So you waste less time managing your inventory and more time doing things that are actually fun. I think it's a great ""in-between"" having a tedious crafting system and removing it altogether.Playing through the game, I felt like there was always something new. Whenever I thought I had finished the game, I would unlocked 30 new things, new monsters I had never seen before, new zones when I thought I had unlocked them all. This game does a great job at giving you a sense of progression.There is always plenty of stuff to do, it's easy to set goals for yourself and even when you do run out of new content (after 100+ hours), there is still tons of things you can do.The gameplay is hard but rewarding. You learn how the monsters move, where they go, their weak spots. A lot of it is simply knowledge. You don't necessarily need insane technical skills if you're patient and you know what you're doing. But it always gets harder...One thing I also found interesting it's that it's one those games where everyone seems to like different weapons... I've heard from different people that different weapons were ""the best"" or ""broken/overpowered"". I think that it shows pretty good balancing in a way, when everyone feels like a different weapon is the strongest.It's overall just a very satisfying game. It's fun, it lasts a long time and there's tons of things to do.If I had to think of a few things I liked less... I wish I progressed ""slower"", especially in terms of armor. I found that I progressed so fast I was skipping lots of sets of armor and crafting the strongest I could instead. I think a lot of them look really cool and it makes me sort of sad I never got to wear them!I also dislike how cool sets look, when most of the time you'll have to mix and match different pieces to get the best skills, and ""layered"" armors (cosmetic overlays) are not exactly very varied.I would say that I wish there were more maps and more monsters... But there's already way more than I would expect. There's a new expansion coming too! I just hope that they will keep expanding on that game. I love being able to play on PC at last!If it sounds like your kind of game, don't hesitate to grab it. I promise it's worth it."
238,Kiri,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BHakm25yMZo/,31,3,1,645.1,October,"22,",131,0,1,"After over 600 hours poured into this game I've finally found myself qualified to provide a somewhat objective view on this game with my own personal thoughts mixed into it. With Monster Hunter: World, Capcom delivers us a wonderful product filled with love and passion from the developers, and lets us discover a wonderful new world filled with many different living creatures and a gorgeous display of flora that differs on each and every map the game lets us visit. While story-wise you shouldn't expect to be blown away with amazing dialogues or any intriguing plot lines, you can definetely still get immersed into this world of people working together to fight a common enemy and overcome any problems coming their way. Our character gets a very warm welcome and we can feel the gratitude of people around us for risking ourselfes by fighting monsters and gathering materials for them. As the story progresses and our achievements pile up, we gain more and more respect from characters that are introduced as our superiors and it gives a great feeling of acoomplishment.Now for the main point, gameplay. Monster Hunter once again provides us with a staggering amount of different weapons and armor pieces for our use, which we can craft or upgrade using materials from the monsters we slay or capture. From the start we are given an option to set off on a hunt with one out of 13 different weapons, each and every one of them being very unique and different to each other, and an enormous amount of combinations of set skills from different armor pieces and decoration jewels. Speaking of which, this is what the endgame focuses on progression-wise. Now about the hunts themselves,early on the game can easily make you feel underpowered and leaves many new players frustrated, however with time and experience we learn about the monsters and improve which is one of the main points of hunting them. With time we learn that every monster has it's own elemental weakness, a weak spot or even a behavioral weakness that we can exploit to gain an upper edge. Visually almost every monster is stunning and we can see that a lot of work went into them. All monsters feel like they have a will of their own and we can sometimes see them interact with the enviroment surrounding them. Now when it comes to the fights themselves, to be blunt, some aren't perfect, some are wonderful and feel like a duel between you and the beast and some are just painfully bad and simply not fun. Fortuneately, most of the bad fights are only in the early game and we don't have to witness them that much but there are also some that stay in the endgame and could be a source of frustration when grinding for better gear, HOWEVER a credit is to be given where it's due, and I must say that when Capcom makes a well designed fight, they do it really well and fighting these monsters feels amazing and the better you get at it, the more good things about it you notice so I would say that the good easily outweighs the bad. After beating the main story we are left with 2 options, stop playing having completed the main tasks that were given to us or take on the loads of additional content waiting for us to challenge. Although the game has a main story for us to complete, most of the content of Monster Hunter comes from all of the stuff we can do after we beat it. We can face off against stronger versions of monsters we encountered earlier or just more of them at once, try to upgrade our gear even more, complete event quests that give us unique rewards or perfect your build for any weapon you like. The amount of things we are encouraged to do besides the story is amazing and the feeling of wanting to get better at beating a certain monster and cutting down the time it takes us to beat it and finally acoomplishing it is what makes people pour hundreds or even thousands of hours into this game. Apart from the main feature of the game which is hunting said monsters, we also have things to do on the side to ease our next hunts. You can set off on an expedition to gather materials, hunt smaller wildlife or even enjoy some fishing, and while all of this is optional, it does reward us for engaging in it. Monster Hunter features a quite lenghty list of things we can craft to aid us during hunts and some of them are pretty essential later on. Things like better health potions, drinks that give us damage or armor buffs, traps, smoke bombs, poisonous knives, ammunition and so on. All of this almost never makes you feel like you did it for nothing.To summarize, Monster Hunter: World is an amazing game packaged with amazing and unique gameplay and a living world inside it. Even though it isn't a heavily story-focused game, I still felt emotional when finishing it and immediately got hooked into the content that was waiting for me later on. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is interested in it. There is a reason that it's Capcom's best selling game, and hopefully after Monster Hunter: Rise we see an another entry on this scale as soon as possible. This concludes my review of Monster Hunter: World, specifically the base game, as there is an amazing expansion that has twice as much content with it, but that deserves a review of it's own.           Good luck to any of new aspiring hunters who just got into this wonderful game and hunt on!"
239,Galaxy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069012496/,31,,1,199.7,February,"16,",117,0,1,"Each of 14 weapon types makes combat feel like an entirely different game, from the grace and familiarity of a sword and shield, to the explosive pummel of an ammo-switching Bowgun, to the downright oddity of the Hunting Horn, a massive hammer that plays stat-buffing tunes.Monsters themselves come with a wealth of strengths and weaknesses and many, many materials to harvest, all of which can be used to create tens of possible items. You also have an adorable cat companion called a Palico which can be outfitted with its own gear, all offering different bonuses for your character. And when it all seems like you’ve got it sussed, along comes High-Rank, Monster Hunter’s “post-game” content, which changes some monsters, adds new ones, and essentially doubles the amount of gear to lust after.The deeper you look, the deeper it all seems to get - and that sheer level of complexity has historically been what stops Monster Hunter from offering mainstream appeal. But let’s get something out of the way: there’s been an assumption among the waiting audience over the past few months that - despite the protestations of Capcom itself - World would simplify the series’ more obscure ideas to help court a western audience. After just the first few hours, it becomes abundantly clear those concerns are unfounded.Monster Hunter has always been opaque, its menus pebble-dashed with byzantine statistics, and its combat purposefully designed to be methodical and challenging in a way that feels strange next to modern action games’ fluidity. Practically none of that has changed. This remains a game where learning is as important as doing, from potion recipes to intricate combos.World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience.“What’s changed in some ways is how they’re presented. Quality-of-life improvements have smoothed off a few rough edges, making crafting simpler, armour skills more abundant, and introducing quicker, more efficient looting. But many difficult-to-grasp aspects still remain (it’s still crazy to me that weapon tutorials are still so meagre), and few have been made with the first-time player in mind. Playing in a party alongside new hunters, I’ve been bombarded with questions ranging from the simple (“Where can I change my weapon again?”) to the slightly more specific (“Why does my glaive come with a huge insect buddy, and what does the dust it leaves behind after sucking the juices out of a lizard do?”). The bottom line is that World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience - this is full-fat, waterfall-of-information Monster Hunter. In that respect, it’s the same as it ever was.Those coming in looking for an all-encompassing adventure story will find World a little lacking, too. The central plotline - of travelling to a new continent in the wake of a migrating Elder Dragon - is a neat one, and pleasantly naturalist in tone (well, as naturalist as you can be in a game about killing mythical creatures to make shoes), but it’s nothing more than a pretext for the near-endless hunts ahead.But as far as opportunities for new experiences go, World just never seems to stop providing them – and I love that feeling. 50 hours in, it’s still regularly throwing crafting possibilities, monsters, even entirely new systems at me and expecting me to put time into learning how they can benefit my character.One of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played.“But no matter how much I or any other fan tries to convince you, there’s a chance that a game that requires this much management alongside its maiming simply won’t be for you. I urge you to at least try. Find an experienced friend to guide you or sit down for a few video tutorials, because Monster Hunter: World is one of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played since, well, the last Monster Hunter game.A disclaimer: though I’ve completed the story quest, I’m absolutely nowhere near “finished.” Side quests are clogging up my menus, I haven’t touched the majority of the weapons, and even the end of the campaign opens up a second, much more difficult half. This isn’t an admission of guilt, it’s a demonstration of what kind of game we’re dealing with. Above and beyond anything else you can say about World, there is a lot of it. It’s still stupendously generous with content and, better, matches that with consistently making your time feel well-spent instead of wasting it on empty-feeling grinding."

Big boss enemies similar to a T-Rex or Dragon just to describe a few. Successfully completing a hunting quest will get you various equipment upgrade parts. Eventually you will want to repeat the same quests multiple times to get all the upgrades. It's also exciting to fight them partially because they have a wide variety of attacks. The game does have some RPG elements like upgrade paths for your weapons and fishing side quests but it's an action game at its core. There is also fighting game lite elements with a 3 button attack layout and combos. Controls are responsive and are good for an online 3D action game. Not really surprising since this is a Capcom game after all.The 3D graphic offers a wide variety of exotic locations and it does feel like a living monster world. You traverse vast desert hills, climbing vines and cross over streams. Exploration of big levels and gathering from your environment are portrayed nicely and help the world be more immersive. The soundtrack is awesome and offers some nice modern style classical music.It's not a perfect game because the story is a bit weak and there are hit detection bugs. But fortunately the gameplay and graphics make up for it. The online 4 player co-op only adds more to the already good replay value. Overall if you like grinding then   is a very enjoyable action game."

I can say that it runs very well and looks amazing on both, but pc of course allows more graphical options for those with lower or higher end pc's respectively. It is one of my FAVORITE games of all time, especially with friends. 1: The Monsters are great. 2: The characters are decent enough except for one *cough* ""handler"". 3: The story is serviceable but you don't get monster hunter for the story anyways. 4: The combat is very fluid and rewarding, and so is the monster hunter ""grind"". Getting that armor set or that weapon you've been trying to craft for the past couple hours is a great feeling. Overcoming that one monster thats been giving you  a rough time still gives you  a very satisfied experience. Of course just because i love the game and the franchise as a whole doesn't mean i cant criticize it for it's downsides and straight up failures. 1: In my honest opinion this is probably the weakest monster hunter has been in terms of weapon design coining the phrase ""bits on sticks"", it just doesn't have the fun design as the older games had. Like beating a fire breathing wyvern in the head with a thing of ham, or a giant teddy bear, cooking utensils against a literal dragon! They got better with iceborne but unfortunately worlds weapons for the newer monsters just look dull in comparison. 2: Not being able to join a friends quest until they've seen the cutscenes is a real pain. Seriously, could we not have watched it together? or how about being able to skip the cutscenes all together? At least give us the option, especially for players like me who have beaten the game already. If they added that option i haven't seen it. 3: The clutch claw.....its not the best. You can learn how to use it yes, pretty easily actually, but it feels like if you wanna do a quest rather quickly you have no other option than to use it. Always scrambling to latch onto the monsters head to knock it into a wall, or its legs to soften the hide kinda slow things down for me ironically since its supposed to make things faster. 4: WHY THE CRAP DID YOU NOT PUT IN A PAUSE FEATURE! I don't care who it is, sometimes you gotta get up for something. Your dog telling you they have to go outside? Someone knocking at the door? Forgot that you said you'd clean the house while the're gone and you hear the car pull into the driveway? Well sucks to suck, you better find a bush to hide in so you don't faint. Look i know it seems like i'm being harsh with the game but that's only because i want them to do better. and i know they can do better since rise improves on basically everything i just complained about. In the end i still adore this game despite the flaws, the good far outweighs the bad. And i hope that whoever gets this game has as great a time as i have."

This is by far my favorite game and greatest time sink. I spent roughly 500 hours in the base game and have played through both mhw and mhwi twice. I have nothing left to farm but still play regularly because the mechanics are so deep and satisfying. This game is on sale for $20. You should buy it. And then if you love it, buy iceborne. I got this game for free, it came with my graphics card (gtx1060) on my first PC build. I built the PC to play battlefront 2 and the forest (also good games). I downloaded mhw and played up to the first large monster quest. I picked hammer because it looked cool. It was clunky and slow and I uninstalled the game. I was talking to some friends months later who play pc games and they said they liked mhw, and i laughed at them. But I gave it another chance. I tried other weapons, I watched guide videos, and I fell in love with the game. Button mashing is clunky and feels awful. Learning the weapon feels like a dance. I have since spent way too much money buying this game for friends and making them play with me. I have learned to play all the weapons and farmed everything there is to farm (I have not done all the achievements, that does not excite me). I even play weapons that I don't really enjoy (sns, lance) because they still feel better than combat in other melee games. I love this game and I cannot wait until Rise comes to PC. For those that do not like it just starting out, do not uninstall like me. Try a different weapon. Watch tutorials. There are some moves that would take hundreds of hours to learn organically (perfectly valid way to play if you want though). Try different armor skills that change how a weapon plays. You will be glad you gave this a shot."

This review will mostly cover the PC-port related issues. I've also added some Iceborne-related info.IMPORTANT: Base game + expansion pack (aka Master Edition) is usually the better buy (updated to reflect price change over time).Oct 2021:They removed Denuvo, Still around 55-70 FPS on GTX1660 Ti depending on settings.Still crashes sometimes, dunno why.Haven't tested netplay for a long time.Dunno if other issues fixed or not.Apr 2020:Loading much slower, even on SSD.MORE ANTI-MOD. Some can't use Reshade anymore.Random Err12 crash.DX12 randomly locks PC since 4 patches ago, requiring reboot.Took 2 weeks to fix MHW triggering anti-virus.Still very laggy, even on powerful PCs.Still unstable online that makes raid events impossible to clear.Jan 2020:Iceborne breaks everything. Crashes, freezes, save corruption, anti-mod, very laggy anti-cheat.Oct 2019:In May, I upgraded from GTX 970 to 1660ti and got ~50+ FPS on the title screen, but I still got the same old ~45-50 FPS in-game, regardless of graphical settings.Non-Denuvo DMC5 proved that Denuvo limits video card by bottlenecking CPU. Up to 20% performance hit. I later upgraded to a new CPU, same video card. Now MHW runs smooth as silk.PC Iceborne came out way too late. On PS4 they've finally started dripfeeding 2 year old fashion armors, despite being fully implemented from the beginning. They know it's always been the most requested feature.Quick summary:Not a terrible port, but has extremely terrible CPU optimization. You need a powerful video card to use the high-res texture pack, otherwise many textures are very low-res. But it's still superior to console because of higher fps, much faster loading, and mods.I can't recommend a game with major issues that shouldn't exist. I'd be annoyed if people recommended me a game and it didn't work properly. So I'm not going to do that. I paid for this game, I want them to fix it. Years later, still many unfixed issues.Major issues (STILL relevant as of December 2019):- Stuttering on any kind of input. Capcom has only very recently acknowledged this and are finally looking into it. AFAIK not fixed.- Special K author Kaldaien says the game has worst ever CPU & Denuvo usage. Iceborne also has Denuvo. Early reviews suggest it still runs like crap because of this.- Blocky skin in cutscenes. This problem exists on PS4 Iceborne, too. STILL.- Still lacks disable bloom option.Fixed issues:- Keyboard settings error and ""can't save game"" error occurs if you store your backup files in the same folder as the other save games. If you move them out, both problems stop.- You can now see friend sessions even if private, and join friend sessions easily.- There is now an official high resolution texture pack. Almost a year late.- Newer Nvidia drivers fixed the huge MHW frame drops.- Effect huge frame-drops fixed.- Online disconnection issues seemingly fixed.- Mouse and keyboard supported.- After months, they finally added disable DOF and Motion Blur. DOF is still forced on during cutscenes.Unconfirmed past issues:- Not sure if clientside can still cause all session players to disconnect via mods.- Months ago there were reports of crashes on startup caused by Steam Overlay, GeForce Exp, Ansel, Reshade. No idea if fixed.- Some reports of getting randomly locked out for a day after an update, due to Denuvo.- There were reports of the Taroth event having crash/freeze issues. Probably fixed.- Very, very rare bugs (sheath bug, infinite machinegun sound, cannot interact with anything and have to restart).- All versions of this game reportedly have a small chance of corrupting savedata or refusing to save. So you should try to backup regularly.PC port positives:- Loads MUCH faster than the PS4 version, even without an SSD. PS4 takes a minute or two. This loads in a few seconds, presumably if you have enough RAM.- Looks nice, when it runs properly.- Minor improvements to the GUI over the PS4 version, which were added to PS4 Iceborne.- Modding. Now you too can easily wear the tons of NPC-only outfits Capcom keeps making. On top of fixing tons and tons of other issues.- Several graphic options have a ""variable"" setting that auto-adjusts graphic options in realtime. Some are noticeable, some not so.- Gamepad support and key config via Steam Big Picture. I've heard there are limitations.- Option to configure confirmation and cancel buttons (fixes the Asia vs West button swap problem).Conclusion:It's pretty obvious Capcom didn't test the PC version enough. Yet they saw fit to give early access to streamers and reviewers, who (as far as i'm aware) did not seem to notice any of these significant issues. Next time, get real testers to test your game.It took them a long time to admit to and fix many of the problems. CPU optimization (ie. Denuvo) is still so bad that it can seriously impact the frame rate. Outside of the ongoing major issues, I think you'd still need to have a clear understanding of what the Monster Hunter games are like. I get the impression many people jump into this game expecting it to be something totally different, and end up disappointed.As a game, it feels like just barely enough content. By endgame you'll realize it's stretched thin, with heavy reliance on RNG in endgame. It's designed in such a way that you end up fighting the same few monsters over and over until you get burned out.There are some things that are done well, and several things where it feels like they dropped the ball, or are seriously trying to troll customers by doing the opposite of what everybody wants (no joke...for example, despite players complaining about this for almost a year, they keep adding exclusive outfits and hairstyles for NPCs, despite NPCS and players sharing the same models).That being said, if you do enjoy the core combat, then you may end up playing this for a long time. I won't go into detail about the gameplay in this review, but I will say that if you just want something to spend 30+ hours on (rough minimum time to complete story) and you don't mind RELATIVELY ""clunky"" (ie. compared to what people normally expect) high-risk controls where you cannot rely on lock-on, then you may want to give this game a try.If you want to try it first, and maybe refund it, then be careful not to spend too much time on character creation. Just use a preset, get past the unskippable lengthy intro, and jump into training room to try out the weapons. This is a game that relies very heavily on whether you like how the weapons and combat feels. If you don't, you won't enjoy this game.Also note that this game is easier in solo. Multiplayer has a high chance of people screwing up, resulting in quest failure. Monsters can chain multiple attacks to kill you off a single hit. This happens often when you're learning the game. You're supposed to try not to get hit. Three deaths means restarting the quest. If that sounds frustrating to you, you may want to avoid this game.Part of the fun is overcoming these challenges. Once you learn the monster patterns and how to use the weapons effectively, it can be a satisfying experience.UPDATE: Iceborne actually fixes many of these issues. Monsters are less cheap and give you more breathing space in Iceborne. So again, you should probably wait for Iceborne before buying the PC version.By the way, I'm not a veteran of the franchise. This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've fully invested into. From what I've seen others say, compared to previous games, this one is a few steps forward (eg. much better audio/visual, easier to obtain crafting materials, weapon improvements), and a few steps back (eg. less monster variation, story/setting too ""casual"", annoying NPCs, poor fashion support, lack of things to do in endgame, reliance on limited-time events). Also, you can't do events offline, unless you mod the game."

I went into it thinking I was playing the Witcher or a fast paced game like Destiny(I know it’s an FPS, but I’m talking about the approach to gameplay), I was getting it all wrong, and at first the game didn’t convince me.The amount of materials, different consumables, different weapons and armour confused the crap out of me, it was a lot to take in and I took it in very slowly, cause I didn’t get really into the game until Iceborne came out.My friend got Iceborne for me and, I have to admit, I fell in love with this game. I approached the game in a different way, I started looking into stuff and studying it, started learning more weapons, and started playing in a more methodical way, slowly and with decision making in the middle of it, instead of the usual spam I did before. When that all clicked the game started flowing, and it feels like a whole different game to me.Now Monsters don’t feel as unfair as they did before, and it feels like I can actually control the battle (well, not always, but you know what I mean).Don’t want to drag this on forever about gameplay, but I just want to say that it’s one of the best gameplay experiences I ever had. Oh, and to finish this segment, if you haven’t already, do yourself a favour and start using a Charge Blade!______________________________________________________________The lore is still very new to me, in this game you found a new world and you’re sort of colonists trying to make a living there and what not. Not much to the story in this game to be honest. The lore that surrounds this franchise as a whole is the most interesting part! I’m still learning about it slowly, but how the world came to be with dragons creating it, and humans creating the following with their scales is astonishing!The great war between the ancient civilization and the dragons because of the forbidden act is also pretty interesting, how it all started, how it all ended, and how the ancient civilization still influences the one where you play, especially in the weapons department, cause everything else seems like the world is still in some sort of stone age.Another thing I find fascinating about this world, are the legends within it! The black dragons like Fatalis, which is nothing but a legend until you face one in one of the older games! Just the legend behind these monsters make them so intimidating!As I said, still learning about the lore, but it is very good, makes me feel like I’m drooling over Souls lore again!______________________________________________________________Only have some things I’m not a big fan of in this game…One is, I can’t seem to figure out how in the world they haven’t made it so, when you go fight a new monster, you don’t have to go in alone, see a cutscene and then tell your friends to join, it makes you go in alone, make your friends wait and then after you find the monster, wake them up to come in.. I can’t understand, because they made it work for Shara!And, I guess, now that we are in Iceborne, wanting to craft something for current content and having to go all the way back to low rank to kill monster or pick up some bones is kind of annoying, I’m just nitpicking to be honest, if I had played more in the base game I probably wouldn’t have this issue!"

The single player game is good, fun even, but the lack of any proper online connectivity, something the series has always had, is pathetic.They took 7 months to finalize the PC port? What in the actual hell were they doing? We have found serious game breaking problems inside one week. This was not tested at all, just fobbed off on the paying customer. And the list of things Capcom tries to tell people to do is the same list you would give to your QA team, but they don't have one, instead we get it, the customer.If I pitched you the idea of half-assing a product, spending more than the budget on advertisements, and making the customer pay for the job of being a QA tester, you would laugh me out of the room.Yet, that is exactly what this company has done.People want the game they were promised, the game they paid for, and all we get is silence from Capcom.""Oh, we're aware of an issue causing people to disconnect from groups and are looking into it""That does no one any good who can't even connect in the first place, Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Capcom said, ""Open these ports xxxxx-xxxxx""We did, still Error 50382-MW1People have said to add -nofriendsui -udp, or -nofriendsui -tcp to the Steam launch options.We did, still Error 50382-MW1The online ran so smoothly the first 2 days, exactly 2 days then it all became Error 50382-MW1It's really foolish of Capcom that now they have to try and fix what they should have been fixing for the past seven months. And who gets punished? Capcom? Nope, they get to count their money.It is the paying customer who is now punished for Capcom's absolute laziness.They wanted to push the console versions out the door so they could focus on the PC port?The console versions look, and run like crap. A sign that they didn't even know what they were doing on the consoles.Then they said they wanted to take 7 months to make sure they get the PC version right.I am just stunned by how little effort was made by Capcom, but all the while they charge full price, not a reduced price to reflect their reduced effort.MHW PC has incredible potential, but if Capcom continues ignoring the reports, the only one they'll have to blame for this mess is themselves."

278,Molf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yvetaman/,30,,1,162.3,January,"26,",395,1,1,"The first thing i'd like to say about this game is it is one of the best games i have ever played, the world is beautifully crafted and sometimes i get the moment in between hunts to just sit for a minute and appreciate the beauty that this game is.The one caution i'd give to potential players is don't play this game if you're not prepared to grind, multiple monsters require hunts of most likely 4 or more times to get the gear you want, depending on the gear you want you could even hunt a monster over 100 times and get unlucky and not get the right decorations. However hunts are very variable, the small changes in location, large variety in weapons and encounters along the way can add an amazing amount of freshness to a hunts that could become boring. In extreme cases you can even change to one of the many weapons that allow you to basically completely change your game experience.The biggest downfall this game has is probably the difficulty. MHW can become quite a hard game and there are many skill jumps that a beginner must leap through to be able to experience the game properly, these skill jumps can and have deterred players from continuing the game and have caused me to have to take periodic breaks as i reach those jumps. I know difficulty is quite a  touchy subject in video games but I feel like less able player might enjoy a way to experience the content they may have been locked out of.However the thing that in my opinion ties this game up into a brilliant bundle of fun is the sound design and sound track. Its quite rare that I add most of a games soundtrack to my spotify playlists but MHW has that honour, the music for fights such as the elder dragon fights and the Bazelgeuse fight have a unique Adrenalin pumping energy that has me ready for anything these monsters throw at me. The sound design, especially in iceborn, is exquisite. The ice crunches under both the players and the monsters feet with a beautifully satisfying sound and the roars of every unique monster feel right for each monster, if I have my headphones on some roars have even given me shivers.Overall this game is nearly a true masterpeice,9.5/10 IKGN"
279,Washi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlonelyWish/,32,1,1,318.1,July,"3,",188,5,1,"I was a bit skeptical about getting into the  franchise as i've never played a  game before, but after playing the game for around 2 hours i was instantly hooked. the game is fun, seriously fun. and quite challenging at some times, one of my favorite things about the game is that, your character doesn't get any stronger\better like your avg MMO, but rather  do. obviously your equipments DOES get better too, which also plays a role in the whole thing BUT at the end of the day, the biggest factor remains that, the more knowledge u gain about how to play the game and use it's mechanics, the more efficient your hunts will be, because your equipments can only carry you so much ! So you need to dedicate some  and  solely into understanding - Certain monsters behaviors\weaknesses - Certain Game mechanics - Important parts of maps, etc etc~ and while i KNOW this may sound like a chore to do, Trust me ... it REALLY never felt like it is. it was just really fun to learn all sort of stuff about the game and how it works and how to deal with all of these monsters and all~ so even the learning process of the game is really fun! ---------------------------------Now If i had an issue with this game it'd be just how  breaks the base game in a really unfair way. you see, most dlc's are just ""Adds-On"" to the existing game, they may have a couple of op weapons here and there buuuut they don't really totally ""Break"" the game at all.  on the other hand, Is Like .... a WHOOOOOLE game, it's like.. as good as MHW2 ! It's got everything the base game has, but just BETTER. So let's say you've put 100 hours into the base game and you've grinded so much and you feel like you've really built an endgame setup for the game and all of that. Well... You could have put the SAME amount of time and effort into the  dlc and gotten like a ten times stronger setup. The Huge Gap between the dlc and the base game just really makes the base game itself not worth playing anymore... because you know all the people went over to the iceborne dlc, and they can join your quests in the base game, and most of the time they just end up killing the monster in under 2 minutes at best and that just really ruins the fun for you cuz u just really did nothing. and i KNOW u can just ""pLaY tHe gAmE aLOnE"" but it's a multiplayer game ... why do i have to avoid mp in a mp game- (Also you REALLY feel left out if you only play the base game lol)And This Brings me to the Point of, While YES the base game is Absolutely great and fun and worth the Buy, You're Still not gonna get the full experience if you don't buy the DLC, and i'm just not a huge fan of this whole thing if i'm being honest with you. BUT aside from that, if you have no problem getting both the DLC and the Base game, then you're really in for a one hell of an experience !"

287,Illuya,https://steamcommunity.com/id/illuya/,31,1,1,155.8,December,"4,",146,26,1,"revolves around hunting monsters and crafting new equipment with their parts. It’s a straightforward concept at core, but with many intricate systems expanding upon it. The simplicity leads to complexity, and the result is a game that keeps on giving as you master its abounding aspects. The forty-hour main quest is only the beginning; a mere introduction to your journey as a hunter. And trust me, this is a journey worth taking.Starting off with the selling point - the hunting. Before you can fight the target, you must locate it. It’s done by examining tracks. Once you’ve found enough, your scoutflies will lead you to the monster. These are a pivotal part of the gameplay, as they point you to resources in the wild. It’s a clever way of implementing markers as you’re not distracted by them. I wish more games did something like this. Battling monsters is like a riveting dance; not only do you have to keep up with your foe’s moves, but also combine your attacks in the process. Combos are a central part of the combat, and rightfully so. They’re satisfying to pull off and also vary the gameplay, but timing them right is important. You’re not mindlessly hacking away at enemies; instead, you have to watch out, as a monster can interrupt your chain of attacks. Grasping their behavior is vital if you wish to be successful in the field. It should go without saying, but different monsters behave in different ways. The dragons, when overwhelmed, will take off. You can either wait for them to land, or use your tools to force them down. Some monsters will be quick, moving around as you struggle to land a hit, while others will be slow, but devastating when they make their move. Monster Hunter’s combat never gets old - each slash, each slice, every single cut  impactful. It’s not going out of its way to punish you; if you can learn its principles, the tables will turn, and the monster will no longer be the boss - you will. With thirty-one large monsters and five unique locales, there’s a lot to do, and luckily, hunting the same monster doesn’t get repetitive due to the fluidity of the combat.Once the hunt is over, you’ll be rewarded with items corresponding to the parts you broke. You can use these items to craft new gear at the smithy. One hunt rarely cuts it though. Don’t expect to craft an armor set after killing a specific creature once. It takes time to complete your desired build, which makes it satisfying to accomplish. With more than a hundred sets of armor, the options are almost endless; each piece comes with a set of skills that you can mix together to suit your needs. I only have one complaint. You can acquire  for your gear; these function as charms granting additional skills. Unfortunately, it’s random which ones you get, meaning that you can play for hours without acquiring the desired decoration. It’s the opposite of the great gameplay loop I described earlier, and it puzzles me why they chose to include it. You can choose to overlook them, but your builds won’t be as powerful as they could be.In terms of weapons, there’s 14 types in total. Each comes with a distinctive moveset and new mechanics to master. The  focuses on quick, long-reaching slashes and will satisfy any katana fan. Its key aspect is the , which charges up as you deliver blows. Once full, you can unleash a string of attacks, followed by a devastating blow. If you’re afraid of personal contact, the ranged weapons are for you. The  is a half-rifle, half-bow hybrid capable of unleashing a hail of bullets from afar. It also comes with the task of conserving ammunition. The weapons are just the tip of the iceberg. From traps to a slinger, you’ve got an array of tools to use. Is a foe too aggressive? Stun them with a flash pod. Did a monster interrupt your fight? Throw dung on it, and it’ll be gone in the span of seconds. Want to capture a creature? Lure it into an electric trap, and calm it with tranquilizing bombs. It’s a given that learning all of the systems takes time, but once you master them, you can take your hunting experience even further. Sadly, managing your equipment is a hassle. The menus are cluttered with information, and thus, hard to navigate. If you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard, something as simple as moving an item to your inventory is a struggle. Rather than allowing you to drag them around, it works like on a controller: first, you have to click on an item, then on the slot you want to move it to, before you get to select the amount you want. This is only one of the difficulties when it comes to UI, and it adds up. You do get used to it, but there’s no denying that it’s flawed.  Dynamic - a word that perfectly captures the world Capcom has crafted. It would’ve been easy to place you in a small area with only one monster, but they didn’t take that shortcut. Instead, each area contains a variety of creatures that interact with one another seamlessly. It’s common to witness two beasts brawling - a surprising event that can occur during a battle. It allows you to take a break, and potentially patch yourself up.There’s also a story, but it’s nothing to write home about. Serving as a guiding wind, it teaches you the ropes of the game. It’s uninspired, clichéd and most importantly, insignificant to the experience. They didn’t even bother to name the characters. Your companion goes by the name of , and is the eager and slightly irritating stereotype we’ve seen so many times before. It’s not a big con, since the game doesn’t need a compelling narrative, but it’s worth mentioning nonetheless.Thanks to the art direction, the areas you visit are stunning. From the lush, green colors of the  to the pink and blue ,  never ceases to amaze. Sadly, the same can’t be said for the graphics. Despite shoddy performance, there’s nothing to be amazed by here. Distant objects look blurry, and the textures, while good, are nothing to be amazed by. It would’ve been fine if the optimization was good, but that’s not the case.  | 1440p  While complicated and time-consuming, Monster Hunter World is an outstanding game you can play for hours upon hours. The combat is satisfying, the world is dynamic, and there’s enough content to keep you playing. What more could you wish for? There are issues, such as the confusing menus and poor optimization, but the game remains amazing despite these."

It's scenery/locations are absolutely beautiful and provides jaw dropping textures and graphical upgrades that Monster Hunter really needed (Since the 3DS quality graphics are getting quite old now :P Though MHGU is pretty good graphically wise on the switch).I've enjoyed every single second of this game and is definitely worth every single penny you invest into it, the content updates are free (Excluding some DLC's which are rightfully paid ones, not everything can be free lol). The weapons feel and play how they should, the monsters are wonderful and highly creative and the overall soundtracks to the game are perfection.However, I do feel as if the endgame did lack somewhat as it really didn't feel as interesting and as great as what previous titles offered (Deviants and so on). Though it's how I feel and in my opinion overall I think they should at least make some effort to improve the endgame in terms of what monsters drop streamstones and so on, grinding elder dragons all the time is getting really meh...Having that more variety with other monsters like Bazel, Jho and so on would make the grind more worth doing than just 5 elders.But with the iceborne expansion coming it's way pretty soon I'm pretty excited what Capcom has in store for it's G-Rank tier difficulty (Not calling it master, it’s always been G-Rank for me and keeping it that way). Nargacuga is coming and I'm already pumped for it.Overall Capcom you did a splendid job on this game and deserve every single bit of respect for this high quality game that you don't see much of in today's game industry.Odie~"

299,Mel,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079745572/,20,2,1,"2,038.7",August,"27,",734,0,1,"I've played Monster Hunter: World (MHW) for a small amount of time, however I believe I can say that I've done it all and seen all there is to see in the game. This honster munting game has captured my attention enough to ascend to the top of my library in playtime over other time-consuming games I've played like Team Fortress 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, PAYDAY 2, and Warframe. There are plenty of great aspects which have caused me to stick it out for this long and flaws of the game that I’m aware of, but I'm going to simply list the main reasons for my playtime.It's a Monster Hunter, one of the best top-selling franchises in that well-known island in the far east, but more importantly; a Monster Hunter on PC. MHW is currently the only Monster Hunter you’re able to play on PC without an emulator and it's a bonafide mainline entry. This means no more manhandling a handheld console and cramping your hands while barely possessing any real estate on the small screen. You can even play with keyboard and mouse (albeit with a couple rebindings) or plug in any controller you'd like. There’s even a modding community if you want to spice up your game and sate your need for variety or other… needs you may have.Content is a key ingredient in the recipe of any long-lasting game and there’s loads of content in MHW to be had for both the folks who desire an adventure with respectable length or a part-time career in aggressively euthanizing monsters. Strolling through the main content with the Iceborne expansion and monsters added post-release is likely to take at least 40+ hours and if you can get into ""the loop"", this time figure can be multiplied tenfold. Not to mention the large roster of intriguing monsters and their variants you’ll be driving into extinction during the gameplay. Sure, there are a few palette swaps, but it ain't a Capcom game without some recycling. Factor in the weapons too and you got 14 methods to disrupt a colourful ecosystem. I've utilized all of these weapons and they are all marvelous; my personal favourites being the Greatsword and Hunting Horn. Side Note: MHW is also great for Fashion Souls, thanks to the layered system added in later Iceborne updates.The last main reason which made me enjoyed the game so much, is the SOS system or how the multiplayer functions in general. The game easily and hastily allows you to pair up with other hunters on the quests you actually want to do by letting you send out a signal for assistance or seeking out those in need of aid with the quests you’re interested in partaking. In addition, you can create a public session with up to 16 players for a hunting orgy at the hub and 4 players at a time on the field. These sessions are possible to be made as friends-only for buddying up with the lads for some casual hunts or a professional execution. If you’re not interested in multiplayer though, the game is progressed just fine on solo and most non-event quests are playable offline.All in all, these are the main reasons that have kept me playing for so long all this way from release. I have no regrets in MHW compared to the games I mentioned previously where I felt somewhat unsatisfied with my investment of time or felt I stayed longer then necessary. The base game + Iceborne is a bit pricey, but I truly recommend it on a sale as the value is worth the cost."

For example, for me it was a certain desert horned foe, took me a few days before i could take him out and now can beat it in under 2 minutes!Now with Icebourne being a paid DLC, that may turn some people off from getting it as they may feel that it'll just be like other games DLC with just 1 map and a few new monsters and weapons, but I can assure you that is not the case. I personally have done a bit of research on other Monster Hunter game series and have found that in the majority of cases, the DLC or in other words the ""G-Rank"" expansions have massively increased the total roster of their respective games. For example, going from MH: Generations to MH: Generations Ultimate there was 20 new monsters added aswell and a new difficulty rating (G-rank), as the normal difficulty setting in MH are Lowrank and Highrank, and with each difficulty increase the monster get stronger, more hp and new moves. As of right now Capcom has only shown a handful of the new monsters coming to Icebourne (Although some are returning from past games) The current known monsters are, Beotodus, Banbaro, Tigrex, Nargacuga, Glavenus, and Velkhona.I'd like to close this off by saying that getting into MH: World was an amazing experience and one I wouldn't trade for anything.

When I heard a new entry was coming, I just had to try it out. After giving it a spin, I’m happy to say that MH:W lives up to the hype. I was astonished by its beautiful graphics, amazing soundtrack, and the variety of monsters to hunt. There are some minor hiccups here and there, but I could argue that the pros far outweigh the cons, and it’s definitely an entry worth trying. Before we get into it, I just want to say that this review includes the .Whenever a friend of mine ask whether Monster Hunter is a good game or not, I used to say: “It depends, are you looking for a game with a story or not? Because if that’s the case, you’re better off playing God Eater.” Storytelling was never the strongest point of Monster Hunter games. However, MH:W delivers on the storytelling aspect. As a part of the fifth fleet you are tasked to investigate an oddity centered in the continent called New World. As you delve deeper into this newfound continent, you discover that the so-called oddity is not at all how it seems. Long story short, the plot is pretty straightforward, but I love how they presented it. The pacing was great, and while the narrative can be pretty dumb at times, the major reveal were spot on. , I implore you to play with the Japanese dub instead of the English one, as MH:W has a really awkward lip-sync when it comes to the latter. What MH:W brought to the table was a breath of fresh air to the old hunting system. Capcom took notes on how having to enter a loading screen each time we switched zones was a huge pain in the ass, instead they made one huge open world  for players to roam around and hunt. This seamless hunting experience was a brilliant move by Capcom and it made a more immersive hunts. Each locale had a beautifully designed landscape, from the breathtaking Great Forest to the snowy peaks of Hoarfrost. However, while the Great Forest was indeed a wonder to look at, it is not a favorable hunting spot due to the random FPS drops during hunts – which isn’t the case for the rest of the locales. Monster Hunter games always tried to simulate the ecosystem as realistically as possible, and MH:W is the fruit of their labor. At times, you can find large monsters having turf wars and many endemic creatures roaming around, there are even several achievements for collecting these rare “pets”  – yes, these tiny critters are collectible. Furthermore, Capcom upped their game by implementing dynamic transition between night and day to keep the hunting experience from becoming stale and also interactables such as vine traps and boulders that could help you on your hunt. These additions are what I love the most about MH:W.Now, for the juicy part of the game. MH:W made several quality of life improvements in terms of gameplay and online experience. Gathering resources is far easier and there is no need to use specific tools anymore. The Iceborne expansion introduces some new features to the slinger action called  and . I won’t deny their usefulness when it comes to hunting as they add another element to consider during hunts – applying wounded status to monsters for extra damage. However, it can be a bit annoying as you need to keep reapplying it. The new  was a godsend, this feature allows you to ask for help from players online midway into the quest. In addition to that, I love how they increased the maximum number of players that can fit in a single hub – making the area actually feel like a real gathering hub since in the previous entry one of them can only fit four hunters. Crafting armors is a lot easier with class restriction removed, when it comes to weapons, however, I feel like MH:W lacks its usual Monster Hunter aesthetic flair. While there are some unique looking ones, most of them are just the basic bone design slapped with some extra skin of different monsters.Layered armor and weapon crafting are back. Now, we’ve reached peak Monster Hunter gaming, fashion hunting. However, most of the materials you need can only be found in The Guiding Lands, which is an entire map dedicated to farming and grinding end-game materials. Labeling this place as a grinding hell is no exaggeration because it is separated into several regions, which have levels that you have to progress before unlocking specific monsters. The kicker is that when one region increases, the other region could decrease, so you have to find that sweet spot where all the region levels are balanced. MH:W, alongside the  introduces several new monsters and brings back several of the community's beloved ones. Capcom made the monsters' movement a lot more fluid and added a mechanic from Monster Hunter Frontiers, which is supernova - a finisher that some of them have. While I do like the directions where this is going as it tickles my love for the fantasy genre, some hunts are just pure pain. For example the , supernova of a certain end-game monster that forced you to do a DPS check using specific elemental damage; failure to do so will result in a wipe, regardless of what you do - this was pure pain.Monster Hunter: World is a solid entry to the Monster Hunter series. It inherited the soul of what makes a Monster Hunter game and made improvements in the parts that were lacking. With its high replayability value and beautiful graphics, it’s no surprise to see people willing to burn hours into the game. One thing for sure, MH:W took a step in the right direction and is most definitely worth getting, even at full price. See you on the hunting ground, future hunters!"

This has never been a problem in past games. There are good alternative but you chose the poopiest which is to block friends joining in story missions unless they've seen all cutscenes. And in doing so forcing people to jump hoops and do janky workarounds just to play with each other. Where's the fun in that. Does it even matter that theres 16-man room at this point?

323,Eulerian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Eulerian/,24,2,1,422.1,November,"16,","1,251",0,1,"This is a very grindy game. However, it's a fun grind (most of the time). I was pleasantly surprised by this one.If you're going to buy MHW, definitely get Iceborne too. The High Resolution Texture Pack (free) is also worth getting if your system can handle it.There are a few pros and cons I'd like to highlight. I'll start off with the cons and end with the pros:Cons:-There are arguably too many systems and menus. Assigned missions, arena quests, optional quests, investigations, event quests, special assignments, expeditions, SOS flares, deliveries, bounties, special events, item gathering and general management, abilities + decorations, set bonuses, charms, pendants, the various forms of crafting and melding, sieges, meals, ingredients, weapons, loadouts, radial menus, defense armors, layered armors, sphere upgrades, Palico management, augmentations, enlightening, steamworks, mantles, crowns, fishing, buff handling, capturing, cultivation, safaris, tribal friendships, treasure hunting, photo hunts, camp establishments, the Guiding Lands and its leveling system, crowns, room decor... it just goes on and on and on and on and on. You get hit with tutorial after tutorial throughout the game, and it never lets up. There's a lot to learn and take in. Maybe I'm just slow, but I felt like by the time I finally had a strong grasp on everything, I was several hundred hours in and the game was (mostly) over already. I can't help but feel that the game could have been simplified in several places.-Solo play is disproportionately brutal. Which is not to imply it's always too hard necessarily, but rather it's lopsided. This often incentivizes ""getting carried"" - where if you get stuck, you can just pop an SOS flare (or arrange a game with friends) until you get stronger players on-board, and then finish the quest + move on with all the rewards. Even though the monster's HP scales/increases as more people join, the splitting of the monster's focus makes it way easier to heal and easier to find openings for attacks. When you have multiple people hammering away at a monster with overpowered gear, the end result is often fewer player faints (and thus more rewards) and a much quicker fight. Meanwhile, if you go it alone, the fights will be way harder, you'll faint more often and get fewer rewards, it'll be harder to heal, and the fights take forever... it's a largely thankless endeavor.-I wish the fights were faster-paced. Swinging your weapon often feels sluggish, which is very frustrating when you're up against a monster that is jumping around all over the place. I'd rather have faster attacks in exchange for slightly tougher monsters. Pros:-This is a fun game, which is really the best thing I can say about it. The monster designs are really cool and I often enjoyed just  at them. It's neat that different monsters have different weak spots, and the progressions of certain fights are a blast. The fight against Raging Brachydios, for example - he starts off as a foreboding juggernaut of a beast... but by the end of things, you're underground in an active volcano area and the monster now looks like a beat-up overgrown piece of burnt pot roast that is fighting tooth and nail for its survival. The ground is blowing up and lava is raining down upon you, all while this huge monster is charging in your direction -- ♥♥♥♥ gets wild. Intense moments like that are fantastic, and those fights always end with a huge sigh of relief and satisfaction.-There is still challenge to be had even with the best gear. Whether you're going up against Alatreon, Fatalis, or Arch-Tempered Velkhana, these fights will require you to have mastered the game mechanics, lest you become deadweight and fail the battle for yourself or the entire team. This helps keep the game interesting, as you'll always have a reason to go back and replay a tough fight."

335,Sparlight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Twikle_Sparlight/,188,4,1,228.3,August,"23,",723,23,1,"People are the biggest drama queens about this game.Monster Hunter: World is an excellent game.  It is a pretty game.  It's definitely a game for people with more powerful rigs.  If you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life before, this is superb.  Even if you've played Monster Hunter games before and want to get back into the franchise, this game reinvents and does away with many annoying mechanics.  No more paintballs and no more loading into 12 different zones.  That's always nice.So, why is this game mixed?  Somewhat simple.  People don't understand how games these days work.Here's the lowdown on the mixed review.When the game launched on PC, it was met with a very unforgiving issue:  Multiplayer only worked when it wanted to at best.  You could never start this game with the expectation that you'd be playing with your friends.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  We had to try dozens of placebo fixes in the remote hope of ever possibly playing with our friends.Today, August 22, about two weeks post PC launch, this issue was patched.Now, instead of people changing their minds about this, they're angry it took two weeks.  I work quality assurance for a small company and I inspect developer work.  It is not unusual for something to take a full week to pass QA sometimes.  There is a lot of testing that has to go on and be reproduced that often goes underappreciated.  People are so used to day one patches that they don't realize that day one patches or patches that soon follow a product release are often things that have been caught by QA/Dev prior to launch and have been worked on before it actually hit.What I suspect happened with the connection issue is that it honestly went unnoticed until launch.  Granted, that's a pretty big problem to have go unnoticed, but sometimes things go through to production that maybe shouldn't.  Bugs happen.  It takes time to fix these bugs.  Two weeks isn't unreasonable for what seems to be a beguiling intermittent bug that can be observed, yet not reliably reproduced.  Even the large userbase of players that were so disgruntled couldn't find an extremely reliable way of reproducing it other than ""It just happens"" and ""I can't connect at all.""  Things like this can take a lot of work to try to figure out the underlying cause.  It's just a nice thing to have watched the SteamDB page show that their dev repositories were constantly being updated -- they were actively working on fixing it for the whole two weeks, not sitting around with their thumbs up their rectums.Now, two weeks post launch.  Connection issue is fixed for the most part.  According to the devs, it's still occuring in some cases, but their fixes have reduced the frequency of it.  Chances are you won't see the effects of this review bomb go away, which is unfortunate.  Without this connection issue, I could see this game being at least in Very Positive territory.  Only very positive because there are still outstanding issues with the game's graphical issues.One thing you need to be very aware of is that Monster Hunter is a pretty game.  Many pretty games aren't very well optimized to run on all hardware.  This is very much the case with Monster Hunter.  Do your homework and look for the minimum spec, because this game is about as hard on your computer as an Ubisoft title.  Lots of horsepower is required to get this game running nice and pretty, but I've made it work on three different computers.  One with a 1050Ti and an i7-3770K; one with an i7-7700HQ and a 1070; and one with a Ryzen 1700X and a 1080.  The 1050 Ti needed to be put to low graphics settings at 1920x1080 to achieve a good, playable framerate, but I don't think it could manage a silky smooth 60 fps.  The 1070 machine can run the game beautifully at high settings with no real issues.  Perfect smoothness on the i7-7700HQ/1070 build was achieved by turning volumetric fog to low or none.  Finally, the Ryzen 1700X/1080 build managed just fine on max settings, though volumetric fog was turned down to help assist in certain frame spiking situations.With that said, your biggest enemy to performance will be the volumetric fog effect.  It looks pretty if that's what you're used to, but turn it to low if you want to keep it.  The difference is minimal, visually, but the FPS impact is very significant.  Turn if off if you don't like fog in the distance.Now, the last performance hitch of note is the lightning effects.  Heavy lightning effects occurring on screen, especially from player-based attacks, tend to drop frames for no understandable reason.  Avoid having more than 2 people in your party using lightning-based weaponry, or you'll start to get into unplayable framerate territory.  I have faith this issue will be patched in time, but as of the time of writing this on August 22, it's still ongoing.Finally, one last major gripe I'm sure you're going to see coming out of the bag of negative reviews is that the game uses Denuvo.  You'll hear all sorts of horror stories about it destroying solid state drives and killing your CPU performance.  It does no such thing, and such claims are unsubstantiated.  I will agree to the sentiment that most games I've played that run Denuvo DRM tend to hurt on the CPU performance side.  You will find that people have articles up about how Denuvo tanks performance, but you often find rebuttals about it.Point is, Denuvo sucks.  Maybe in a decade it could lock you out of the game if it goes under or support drops or whatever.  The bottom line is this:  You will not be playing Monster Hunter World in 10 years.  You just won't.  Games For Windows Live was dropped a long time ago, and some computer games 10 years back were still using it.  When is the last time you touched a GFWL game?  Very likely you haven't in the past few years.  Stop worrying about Denuvo maybe someday making this game unplayable.  When that happens, you'll have long moved on from this game.---Would that I had more space to write about the actual game, because there's a lot ado about this game.  Check the positive comments that offer proper reviews on what the game is made of.  Monster Hunter titles are exceptional fun.  I wrote a few paragraphs in this review before being interrupted by the character limit here.To sum things up, Monster Hunter games are about bringing low very big and powerful monsters.  To help with this, you have a very wide and fun arsenal of weapons and hunter tools to go about this job.  You must track monsters, find these monsters, then target their weak points while addressing shortcomings of your own, such as elemental resistances, to take them out.  There is a wide variety of them to hunt and it is difficult to get bored in this game.If you've played other Monster Hunter titles in the past, this game is more streamlined than its predecessors.  No more paintballs, no more zoning in to a dozen different spots.  It's all interconnected.  You have scout flies that loosely guide you to your hunt mark.  There is a shorter list of monsters in this title compared to others, but QoL improvements here make the game worth it.If you have any pressing questions, feel free to comment on the review and we can chat."

Although It is better with friends, I pretty much played the game solo for 700 of the hours, since my friends stopped playing with me around the 300 hour mark, and it was still incredibly enjoyable. I've 100 percented the game's achievements, and I have also caught ALL endemic life including the Great Fishes. The only thing that awaits me now is Iceborne come January 9th, which will almost surely bring me another 1000 hours at the least.Let me say this, I am a long-time Monster Hunter Veteran who has played all previous Monster Hunter titles, and a lot of the things Veterans complain about are the dumbest things. People complain about difficulty in this game being too easy, but are blinded by nostalgia that in older games, enemy AI was about dumber than a box of rocks, and not even Terrible hit boxes could make Freedom Unites monsters harder since first of all in Unite flash bombs and shock traps/pitfalls were OP. Those items worked perfectly and the monsters did not have resistance build-up, that means every trap and bomb lasted just as long as the very first one thrown/set and these traps and flashes last WAY longer than they do in Monster Hunter World. That alone is enough to cheese 90 percent of the game barring elder dragons, who also can't be trapped. Not to mention in Freedom Unite, it doesn't matter what rank you fight the monster in, there are no variance in the move set of the monsters. its exactly the same in low rank, high rank, and g-rank in the older monster hunter games. The only thing Veterans complain about that is right is about how dangerous mobs are in the old games. The little crabs, vespoids and all dromes are incredibly annoying, and proc status way too frequently. The little crabs also have a unique move that only they have (not even the crab bosses have this move), where they move at the speed of inter-continental homing missiles to your location and smack you onto your ass, where bosses then follow up. And then there are Bullfangos........For the most part Monster Hunter World has its fair share of difficulty just without all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that existed in the older Monster Hunter games, and the removal of ultra aggresive mobs is quite a welcome one.CHANGE is GOOD! there are tons of new things to be excited about coming from older games. Movement while drinking potions and items are a welcome one. The ability to re-stock items from camp is also a good one. Re-newed move sets from the main series games, that offer great and enjoyable changes.Another thing Veterans always complain about is that they want to find monsters by themselves and that the scout flies are being too hand-holdy. Ok.....hold on....so these veterans are telling me they would rather spend more time just looking FOR the monster instead of just fighting the monster???? if you know exactly where the monster is, that means you get to fight the monster faster! In Monster Hunter World monsters have several set spawn points that are spread out across a map, and *knowing* where they are immediately instead of having to run around and paintball or waste time using a Psychoserum/ waving at the airship just to find a monster is way better than the previous games.THINGS TO NOT BE EXCITED ABOUTKUSHALA! This monster is so ass in monster hunter world, I would rather fight the Lvl 140 Guild Quest, 200% HP, Black wind Kushala from Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. The normal version you fight in the story is ok, not to many problems there because you have flash bombs, but the Tempered one, and the Arch Tempered ones can suck it. The monster creates Huge Tornados on the area that it attacks you with, and not only does your framerate drop after 3 big ass tornadoes, you literally can't see ♥♥♥♥. When the monster is almost dead it flies to its nest where if it enrages, it forms 3 BIG ASSS ♥♥♥ tornadoes that along with its own tornadoes its already spamming everywhere. I literally got stuck between a wall and and 2 tornados once, and couldn't get out, pretty much just awaiting imminent death.LUNASTRA! This monsters name might as well be ""F***ing trash"" because it does damage over time, that cannot be blocked, it cannot be dodged, and it also Windpresses at the same time. Also since the Stun mechanic still exists, you will get stunned at the worst moments. Unlike Teostra it also has no tells for certain moves like its tail-swipe. It sorta just comes out of nowhere and gets you immediately. her basic attacks also leave huge areas of effect blue flames that constantly tick your HP down, and her SuperNova unlike teostra's explodes twice, and it also windpresses twice. You will find yourself doing the saving grace dive or the superman dive A ton when fighting her. Her fight is the worst fight the Monster Hunter team has ever re-designed. The only reason I've killed her so much is because her AT equipment is great for my main weapon, Gunlance at end-game.DECORATIONS, they pretty much swapped farming charms with farming decorations from previous games, and now charms are crafted while decorations are farmed for. Absolutely terrible choice, in Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, and 3 Ultimate, as long as you had decorations, even on bad charm tables you could make quite powerful 4-5 skill sets with the skills you wanted, but in Monster Hunter World, if you want certain skills like guard, artillery, and certain other skills, expect there to be absolutely NO variance in the equipment that you can use to fill those roles. Literally everyone has the same exact looking sets, there are no unique sets anymore since everyone needs to use the same pieces to get certain skills, and making special sets with mixed skills become even harder since certain decorations will NEVER seem to drop for you. I've done so many investigations the counter has literally stopped counting at 999 investigations. It was only much longer after reaching 999 investigations did I then get all the decorations I wanted for my sets.But even with the terrible decoration grind, and 2 Monsters re-designed so terribly, I still love this game, they weren't enough to steer me away from how much good there is to enjoy in this game.ICEBORNE IS COMINGA huge number of my complaints regarding the decorations, will be fixed when Iceborne comes, and that is in the form of the new decorations. Dual skilled decorations that contain many of the essential skills that players need like artillery and guard jewels come in Iceborne and are gotten quite easilly this time around, instead of the terrible grind in Base game. Even jewels that contain critical are mixed into these dual slotted decorations can be gained quite easily just playing through Master Rank, as I have observed many players going through Iceborne's main story getting many decorations with attack jewels mixed into the dual slotted decorations from even early master rank bosses. I would rank this game as my second favorite main series game, with Monster Hunter 4 ultimate as my number one favorite game in the series."

For anyone who like grinding, it's just pure paradise.Monsters looks cool and are challenging for a newcomer, especially endgame iceborne monsters.Fighting Fatalis was easily one of my most enjoyeable gaming experience.The only downside of the game that really annoyed me, is the fact that in multiplayer, if you want to play with a friend you have to wait until they saw the cutscene and then you can join.A mod can probably fix that, but i was too lazy to mod my game back in the days.But this issue doesn't exist in solo, obviously.Besides that it has became my favourite game, and if I had anyone i really vibe with to play it with, i'd have 1k hours more.Feel free to add me if you're up for it !

340,Ploxxon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ploxxon/,54,4,1,429.4,December,"26,",65,0,1,"When Grind is Good!TLDR:  A little grind that rewards you with a unique playstyle of your choosing.The Monster Hunter games have always required time for grinding out components for your desired armor and weapons and accessories. However, these game does not utilize purely cosmetic pieces very often at all. Pieces that appear purely cosmetic often require little real work to obtain, and can even have some mechanical benefit at times.Monster Hunter is a game where you spend a little time in combat getting your a** handed to you as you learn your enemy's patterns and timing (much like Dark Souls, whose combat was inspired by the original Monster Hunter). The game also lets you play however you wish to play: do you like using environmental traps and calling local tribal peoples to your aid? spend some time discovering them all and ""contacting"" those peoples and you will have just what you wish for. Speed running is also a method of play: build armor and attachments (called decorations) to focus on the elemental damage a target is weak against, or just get your crit chance (called affinity, and ill admit this ones a weird naming choice) and crit multiplier up and wallop the beast's softer portions.The story leaves a bit to be desired, but this is not the Monster Hunter game for a story experience. If you prefer Story, then please be patient for another release of Monster Hunter, as previous games in the series (Monster Hunter Dos and Monster Hunter 4U, to name a few) had outstanding stories and gameplay, while other games (like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate and Monster Hunter World) are more for the player experience and the devs testing out new ways for the player to enjoy hunting dangerous beasts."

It's endgame grind is very worth, where you go on ever more complex and challenging hunts across diverse, tangled open worlds in search of rare items needed to craft an armor set that’ll no doubt crown you the min-max champion of the world. But Monster Hunter’s essence and greatest strength are its tense, desperate, and tragic fights with beautiful beasts that can go on for the better part of an hour. Overall if your not afraid of grinding and are up to 30 min to an an hour fights then your good to go. I also highly recommend the DLC, there are monkeys :3"

First of all it's absolutely mind-blowing and impressive the amount of options and attention to detail put into this game. The game is really fun and was a joy to play with my friends.Kill za monsters and then use their body parts to get better weapons and armor and then fight better monsters and use their parts for better weapons and armor. This is the gameplay loop.I'll be honest this game is hard , some of these monsters will open a can of whoop-ass on you and you'll just be sitting there crying on the floor. You literally cannot spam any of your combos on the endgame monsters , how do you beat the monsters then? You learn their moveset , and when they take a breather after a strong attack and find a window to attack and punish their dumb ass. But if you get too greedy the monster will punish yo ass. Learning the patterns , dodging and punishing at the right time , the game forces you to master a fight , and it's really rewarding when you are belting a monster than tortured you for 10+ fights.There's many playstyles and weapons you can play in this game , like greatsword : slow af , big hits , insect glaive : you have a vaulting pole you can maneuver easy , lower damage compared to GS , long sword : weeb katana. There's many more and many things the game won't even tell you like jumping off mushroom ledges and new attack combos.I would say , if you can play with a friend or a group of friends , go for it. I would say it's a masterpiece , story is bad , that's not what it's for , The gameplay is gawwwd. Thank you,A fellow monsta hunta playa"
346,Insane Scientist,https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanescientist/,23,3,1,"1,229.3",April,"23,",305,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World is an amazing game, I picked this game up a few months ago and it has quickly converted me to a new fan of the franchise and become one of the few games I've ever played long enough and been passionate about to seek 100% achievements for. The game is, unsurprisingly, about hunting monsters. There is a story in the game but it is average and more a backstory for the sake of the gameplay. This game is very much boss-fight centric and if you like the boss fights in games like Dark Souls there is a very good chance you'll like this game too and many similarities in mechanics carry over, but this is still very much it's own game and distinct from series like Dark Souls.There are 14 weapon types in this game, the weapons in this game are among the most satisfying I've ever used in a third person action game, each is highly unique and very different to each other, each varying in complexity and having their own unique mechanics and combos, you have the Longsword with swift and graceful precisely timed combos, the crazy over-engineered Charge Blade with an answer for every situation, the hardhitting tanky Gunlance with explosive burst damage, the Insect Glaive that allows you to take to the air like an acrobat, etc, there are ranged weapons like the Bow too unlike ranged weapons implementations I've seen in other games. The weapons in this game are all relatively easy to pick up and learn but have extremely high skill ceilings, a lot of the satisfaction in this game comes from mastery of the weapons, and some players get into competitive speedruns for monster kills to demonstrate their mastery of the weapon and the monster fights. (Tip for new players: At your first opportunity, try out ALL the weapons in the training room, you might not be enjoying the game if a weapon doesn't click for you or you find it boring, but with how varied and unique each weapon is changing weapon can make a world of difference.)There are a total of 71 monsters to fight including the Iceborne DLC which I highly recommend any player gets as it more than doubles the content in the game and adds lots of high difficulty challenge, there is also a lot of mods for this game too, some of them add new fights. If I were to compare boss/monster difficulty to Dark Souls I would say MH:W is easier on average, in-fact I would say there is almost no real threat of outright failing a mission to the majority of early game monsters, but the peak challenges and endgame bosses are significantly harder than Dark Souls, in Monster Hunter you have 3 carts which are the number of shared lives you as a solo player or your team playing co-op have before you fail a mission, boss fights are more of a Marathon than a sprint, while Dark Souls bosses are generally very cheesable and have WR kill times of under 60 seconds for even the hardest NG+7 bosses, MH:W has much longer fights and will demand you learn the monsters and master each fight if you want to survive the more difficult bosses, not all attacks will have clearly telegraphed wind ups or tells, monster health is deliberately hidden in this game and you must pay attention to it's behaviour such as if it's exhausted, drooling or enraged. I have thoroughly enjoyed the monster fights in this game with the very final boss, , now being my favourite boss fight in any game I've ever played.The core gameplay loop is great, there's a huge amount of story quests and even huger amount of optional and special quests stuff including stuff like raid boss monsters intended to be tackled by a full team of 4 hunters and Arena quests with premade loadouts. There is a decent amount of grind in this game and it is somewhat core to the gameplay although it is far more generous and less time consuming than other grindy games I have played, it is entirely possible to get the best possible endgame loadout setup for multiple weapons within 300 hrs of play from new game. There is no player class or level-up system in this game, your character remains the same at end-game as you were at start, instead what changes is the weapons and armor you use, along with the item and tool loadout you carry + the skills you developed. All armor pieces in this game have skills associated with them that can have a multitude of effects which can be further customised with slot-in items. You hunt and maybe farm strong monsters, then you'll use their parts to craft weapons and armor from that same monster to prep for the hunt of the next stronger monster. Monsters can inflict a variety of statuses and ailments and have innate weaknesses and resistances to different elemental types you can attack them with, preparation for each hunt can be important with the items and armor skills you'll bring. e.g. You might want to bring poison resistance for the monster that inflicts lethal poison or evade window for the monster with large AoE attacks.The World is semi-open and the biomes are beautifully designed with large sprawling areas to explore, between hunts there is chill downtime to do things like gathering and foraging for items, fishing, or finding secrets on the maps. This game has so much character to it, the art design and soundtracks are incredible, the co-op in this game is also great and it has one of the least toxic and most positive communities I have ever encountered in gaming. Co-op in the main storyline can be irritating with some hassle and obstacles but beyond that it's a mostly seemless experience. You have things like crazy gestures, sticker emotes and customisable auto-shoutouts you can use to goof off in co-op and with the Iceborne DLC you can craft transmogs for your weapons and armor to make your character look how you want with some crazy variety in armor choice varying from edgelord badass to cute or sexy, this game has a bit of an anime aesthetic to it, might be a negative for you, maybe a positive. Monster Hunter is a franchise with developers that loves their fans, there is a lot of attention to detail in this game and a huge amount of free post-game updates and content were released during it's support lifespan. At the time of writing this review a newer portable release(Monster Hunter cycles between console and portable game releases), Monster Hunter Rise has come out, Monster Hunter doesn't have sequel games but instead has new titles each game with a new focus, the devs aren't afraid to experiment and innovate, they listen to player feedback between games and continue to innovate and improve with each release, I can see this franchise becoming a lot bigger in the future and I'm definitely now a fan! (Final tip for new players if you decide to purchase this game: Don't use the default opt-in defender/guardian weapons or armor on a new playthrough! They were added so returning players could speedrun the base game to get to Iceborne quickly, but they are incredibly OP and will be better than anything you will find for the entire base game story even 50 hours in, it removes any challenge and ruins the experience.)"

348,rtem1s,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rtem1s/,25,,1,"1,943.1",June,"7,","1,258",0,1,"The basic  gameplay loop is still here: prepare, hunt, make some new gear, repeat. But  changes a little bit of that by adding some more of the ""hunting"" aspect. You need to follow the monster steps by observing footprints, analysing mucus, etc. This, combined with large open maps with lots of details to explore (with no loading screens between the zones), endemic life, plants and gathering points makes the experience more immersive and fun than just going to kill/capture a creature. Of course, all of that changes rapidly after the player starts to get more experience on hunting — it becomes just a way to find the monster faster through the maps — but it's also a great way for newcomers to the series get into the game. When you find the monster and the combat begins, this is where the game shines: epic confrontations with engaging and fluid battle mechanics, traps, lots of artifices to help from bombs to literally poop... all of that with a variety of weapon types, each one with different refined movesets and combos that are satisfyingly amazing to pull them off — absurdly tactical, but also strategic. The combat, environment and encounter designs are top-notch, with excellent pacing and great presentation overall.After that, with the materials collected on the hunt, you craft some gear. Crafting is also way more convenient but still not intuitive at first glance. There is a massive amount of options to customize and make your build so it will consume some time to fully understand the mechanics behind it and even more time to craft it. Congratulations, you completed the loop... now you just need to prepare for new/harder monsters and do it all again! did a great job ""dumbing down"" the most complicated features to welcome beginners and adding QoL changes that are absolutely worth it for veterans as well. If you've never played  before, jumping into  is an amazing chance to get in!: If you are new to the series or just wants to start fresh,  utilise the Guardian/Defender equipment. These weapons and armour are extremely overpowered at the beginning, making the game not challenging at all and probably not fun as well, since you will never have anything better to craft until the mid-end game. Also, you will not learn how to ""play properly"" if you can tank it all without needing to dodge or even use potions (although it's a valid playstyle, it's not the best for someone who wants to get into the game). The Guardian/Defender equipment were designed primarily for players from other platforms who wanted to sweep through the base-game campaign as means to access the  DLC expansion content quicker (because the PC version launch lagged behind the consoles).: this game really needs your time. Although you certainly can love the first 20 hours of it, it doesn't mean you won't like the game if you don't. What this means is that the core gameplay loop is present early, but the real challenges and the  are present late, and they make a world of difference to the fun.

349,A Vacuum Full of Bees,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spessmarine/,53,8,1,437.9,October,"28,",651,0,1,"I have had an absolute blast with World, after bouncing hard off multiple previous entries in the series.  The monsters are a joy to fight, which is important when that's the main draw of your product.  The atmosphere of each environment is engrossing, and the monsters really feel like they belong there.  It can be surprisingly relaxing to just head out on an Expedition with no quest or goal in mind and wander aimlessly through each zone, collecting materials for crafting, doing some bounties, catching some fish, or going after the monsters that happen to be in the area at that time on the fly with no faint limit or time limit(aside from when the monster itself decides to leave the zone).  Each zone being one contiguous location instead of chopped up into several smaller bits like previous entries really helps give it a lived-in feeling, like coming upon the remnants of a turf war between two monsters that happened while I was busy halfway across the map with something else is a neat touch.  Monsters, especially the notorious Bazelgeuse(Bagel Goose), often get wrapped up in your fights with other monsters, and can sometimes provide a much-needed distraction or deal a hugely damaging blow to the one you're focusing on.  The weapon systems are extremely varied and unique, with many weapons using completely different mechanics making them akin to fighting game character selections when you pick which to use.  I personally have only ever used the Greatsword, there's something so totally satisfying about landing that last overhead wallop with it that sends a monster crashing to the ground, stunned.  I have heard from other folks that pretty much every other weapon system is fun to use and engaging.  Collecting materials to build and upgrade each weapon can be difficult and the requirements of some extremely rare drop items for later high-end craftable gear can get super frustrating to acquire, unfortunately.  Same goes for certain consumables, though there are alternative options such as the Melding system to acquire rarer items you need using lesser-desired items you already have.  I run the game on a pretty beefy system, but even at lower settings I've heard the game runs pretty well.  The only complaints I really have about the game running well is it's a big CPU hog, and the textures in cutscenes can be real nasty, but I hear that's a bug that's set to be fixed in an upcoming patch.  Otherwise the game runs at a buttery smooth framerate, dynamically lowering object/texture quality ingame to keep the framerate steady, and the load times are basically nonexistant.  The longest load time is when you first boot up the game, and even then it's like 15 seconds tops.  Every other load time is so fast you don't even have time to read the loading screen tips.edit: I should mention I play the game entirely solo, I have never done multiplayer.  I am not a fan of the faint limit being tied to all players, so one goober can ruin it for everyone else if they're bad, which I've seen plenty of times on streams.  The Palico system, your cat-shaped AI buddy, is very helpful in fights, acting as a distraction, support, summoning helpers, looting extra monster parts mid-battle, etc.  Plus dressing them up in the various goofy or cute outfits is nice.  I just wish there was a dog option.  A Palicorgi, if you will.  Odogaron's armor makes them look like some sort of ancient japanese wardog thing, but other than that it's all cats all the time, which sucks.  I'd totally buy dog-shaped AI buddy cosmetic DLC.Overall, Monster Hunter World's been a real surprise.  I'd caught some streams and felt it would be worth trying myself once it came to PC, but didn't expect to fall so far into it, I think as of this review I've got 150 or 170 hours in it, beaten the story, downed every optional quest, found every food item(except a few different boozes), captured/slain every tempered monster, and still have fun playing it.  I heartily recommend this game, and can't wait to see what new zones, monsters, and systems they add in future updates/expansions!"

It didn't 'hook' me. This game came out, same thing. Liked it but no hook. It felt like it'd be a better time with friends. Recently, came back after playing Stories 2, and have friends that play this game with me now. So much better. Even playing solo feels better now after all the content that's been added. So if you've always been on the fence about this game? Now is the best time to pick it up and try it out. Have fun with it, and when Rise comes out next year, you'll be ready to go :) Friends help though - bring'em if you got'em."

This review isn't for you. For everyone else, especially PC-exclusive gamers, I have to tentatively give this a thumbs down for two reasons. The first is what can only be described as an assinine multiplayer system that is so convoluted I can't being to understand what they were thinking: storyline missions can't be attempted together as a group without first watching all the cutscenes in a mission, abandoning the mission, and then rejoining a group. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out multiplayer. The second is that raw mouse input isn't supported, meaning a controller is HIGHLY recommended. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out raw mouse input.I love the monster hunter series and will continue playing this as a solo game until the high rank missions, where I'm assured it gets better, but until these issues are fixed I can't recommend the game in good faith."

Monster Hunter World has disappointed me, honestly. Both in terms of gameplay, and on PC and new generation consoles it can be quite old, given that it needs a lot of grinding, although I know that the Monster Hunter saga is characterized primarily by the mechanical one, but I just don't like it , I can't do anything about it, on a portable console, during my frequent weddings on the train and in the car it wasn't a problem, they blocked the travel holes, but on PC I can't accept it, but it also disappointed me in the setting, these ""small"" hunting areas in which it is divided have not satisfied me at all, on the contrary ... I think it was my Achilles' heel, which led me to abandon it for many months. But why do I recommend it? Why am I going back to playing it now and is ""enjoying"" it? because playing in company entertains me ... and not only that, monsters are cool, they are well made, perhaps made with too much care, I really like weapons, armor, they are really aesthetically beautiful, I really like the soundtrack, despite a rather sparse narrative, the story manages to catch you and although it is very far from a crystalline narrative, however you manage to enter into sympathy with certain characters and with whom less, I like to see that during a hunt some monsters collide with each other, changing and making the fight dynamic. I understand very much why Monster Hunter World has conquered many people ... and not only, I understand why many people defend it against negative criticisms, in fact my criticisms are extremely subjective, but I really believe that Monster Hunter World will become a classic going forward with the time. Graphically nothing to say, I love the yield of forests, deserts and more, I also love the character design, very ""rough"" that manages to highlight the robustness of these monster hunters, intelligently giving up the classic character design that makes the characters come out of Victoria's Secret, which I think has always been out of tune, if you want to make a video game of this genre, the appearance of the characters must be hard, rough, you have to make it clear that they are dangerous. So yes ... I highly recommend Monster Hunter World, albeit with its flaws, which however will not spoil the game experience."
357,schlafen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YjSIdxUM/,159,9,1,275.1,August,"18,",360,9,1,"MONSTER HUNTER: WORLDWhen you first came to the store page, you probably thought"" What a trash  game, look at these reviews.""While I agree that this port needs a bit of polishing in terms of connection stability (which is not due to the game itself, but due to steam), the game itself is far away from being what people consider as ""unplayable"". Lots of whining about motion blur, mouse acceleration and ""terrible controls"" is just hilarious. A lot of new players who probably never played a monster hunter game before and just button smash on enemies get frustrated and leave this game a negative review. Reading things like ""ANJANATH IS OP!!!1111"" and ""I get oneshot everytime"" just doesn't trigger me anymore, it rather makes me smile.I was looking forward to the PC version due to the ridiculously short loading times and the better framerate. Having played the game on ps4 for hundreds of hours, I just gotta say that the PC version is more enjoyable due to that. The PC controls are very well made for a port and it's quite easy to play any kind of weapon, even the ranged weapons. It takes a bit to get used to it, but once you are, it feels very fluid.Of course if you're new to the game and the monster hunter series, it will be difficult to get into it and probably be frustrating. The key to win in this game is to learn when to attack and when to retreat. Learn the attack patterns of the mobs and their behaviour in normal and enraged status and you're getting closer on being successful. Always eat before a hunt and be fully prepared in terms of equipment and consumables. Being greedy might work sometimes, but most of the time you get punished for that. Especially in the end game, you usually wanna play optimal since any mistake may lead to death. Only use your fully charged attacks, if the situation makes it safe to use, e.g. when the monster is stunned, paralyzed, exhausted, mounted or laying on the ground.Oh and as a fun fact, did you know you're invincible when you're laying on the ground? See a monster charging at you while you're at low HP? Just jump in your camera direction and play dead, even if the charge hits you, you won't get any damage! This may safe your ass especially against mobs like Nergigante with his Spike-attack dive."

Takes a few seconds upon hosting the game. and when you choose a mission, they have to also choose the mission and TADAA!All story missions with cinematic scenes are solo, which scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. But the moment a boss appeared I could choose between:1. Send up an SOS flare and get random help2. Go back to town and rehost the quest, at this point it is no longer a solo mission and you can do it with your friends.A lot of peopl are complaining about disconnects from the multiplayer lobby, it's only happened to me twice in my 25 hours so either I'm lucky or these guys are spoiled. I've seen people complain about the game feeling sluggish - that's monster hunter, try a different weapon. I personally think it's a great port, it switches from keyboard to controller with ease.

365,GOLD PIMP WANG,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wangdjaosgjaohgsnsjkvbvghbvssdsj/,63,2,0,199.9,August,"18,",633,0,1,"So, since Steam's recommendation feature is completely binary and doesn't allow for ""maybe"", I need to preface this by saying that this game is actually the perfect place to start for anyone new to this series and that if you can look past everything outlined here, then I  recommend it.That being said, I can't recommend this game in good conscience for a variety of technical reasons. Allow me to start with a quote from the game's producer, Ryozo Tsujimoto; """". The PC release comes seven months after the PS4/XBONE version and it's fair to expect a polished release based on Capcom's own statement. Unfortunately, the PC version is absolutely riddled with bugs and annoyances that bring down the whole experience.It took Capcom two weeks to fix a major network issue that made it nearly impossible to play multiplayer. It was difficult to complete or even find quests to join because the game would constantly disconnect. During this time, I had completed everything in the game up to Hunter Rank 50 almost entirely by myself. That is essentially all of the worthwhile content in the entire game. This was not a serious issue for me since I enjoy solo hunting, but for everyone who purchased this $60 game expecting to play with their friends, this was a major slap in the face. This issue seems to be mostly  by now but some people have reported that they are still having trouble staying connected.The PC version suffers from some serious performance issues on certain hardware configurations and many people are reporting massive frame drops even with top-of-the-line hardware. There are some pretty common frame drop problems with particle effects, particularly with Teostra's supernova attack and any weapon that uses lightning effect particles. Modder,  has stated that the game, for whatever reason, is using over 100 threads which creates massive CPU overhead and is ""the most insane piece of software he's ever looked at"". This is always a highly unpredictable aspect of PC games so just keep in mind that this game may not run to your expectations until Capcom does what they said they'd do and  the game. Alternatively, you could try Kaldaien's mod but I haven't had a need to, personally, so I can't endorse it.The game also doesn't even have graphical parity with the PS4/XBONE version. Textures are currently bugged and many character/equipment/environment textures are stuck on low resolution regardless of settings. Ironically, this is the  looking version of the game at the moment. Most of the game looks really ugly and blurry and I find it incredibly distracting. Digital Foundry mentions this in a  comparing the PC and XBONE versions.The keyboard and mouse support for this game is so bare-bones that I would personally consider it non-existent. There's a lot of keys that can't be assigned because they're reserved for things that the game seems to have arbitrarily decided you're not allowed to change. The mouse controls are laughably imprecise and I believe it is just emulating analog stick movement because it doesn't feel anything like proper mouse aiming but a fix for this is . I would recommend using a controller and I assume many veterans will gravitate towards that control scheme anyway since it has changed very little outside of the addition of the radial menu.. Many people reported a save corruption bug after beating the final boss of story mode but this turned out to be a case of a cutscene failing to play due to the system not having a . Of course, this wouldn't be a problem if the game just came with the necessary codec so it's not really an excuse. Keep in mind that your game may crash and you'll be unable to load your save until you track down whatever codec the game expects. It might also be a good idea to manually backup your save every once in a while anyway just in case any save corruption bugs  occur.My final issue with this game is one that probably won't effect many people outside of those who have played a lot in these few weeks directly after release. The PC version currently doesn't have any of the extra content already released on PS4/XBONE. That means no Deviljho, Kulve Taroth, Lunastra, or Behemoth, along with any of the events and equipment released alongside these monsters. Since the only thing I have left to do is grind the same four monsters over and over again to get to Hunter Rank 100 and pray for the right decorations to finish my build, I'm pretty disappointed that I have to wait for this content that should have just been in the PC version from the beginning.The Monster Hunter community is full of obnoxiously zealous fans who would beg you to look past all of this and claim that anyone who rightfully criticizes this release is being unreasonable. I wouldn't blame you for thinking that you stumbled into a cult. This is more of a personal gripe and I wouldn't let it influence my overall recommendation but I felt it was worth mentioning anyway. I won't be updating this review as these issues are resolved since I think there is value in looking objectively at the state of a game at its release. I will allow Steam's recommendation system to do its job and separate all reviews from recent reviews as time goes on.Anyway,  the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥' broken and Capcom completely failed at what they set out to do by giving us a ""great optimized PC experience"" but for anyone with low standards like myself, there's still about 150 hours worth of fun to be had here for anyone looking for a sort of reinvented Monster Hunter experience or for anyone who wants to experience Monster Hunter for the first time."

The game itself counts with a lot of weaponsYou have the Great Sword, the Sword & Shield, the Dual Blades, the Long Sword / Katana (wich I use most of the time), a Hammer, a Hunting Horn (The Support weapon), a Lance, a Gunlance, a Switch Axe, a Charge Blade (The most complicated melee weapon in the game) it's a sword and a shield but both transform mid-combat into a giant axe, Insect Glaive, a Bow, a Light Bowgun, and finally a Heavy BowgunSo there are 14 weapons in total, Monster Hunter is well known for giving the player a lot of weapons and you can change it before any mission if you want (but don't forget to enhance them so they do a good dmg)And there's still one important thing left: ArmorsIf you never played Monster Hunter before, what makes this game really adictive is getting the parts of the monsters you hunt, and those parts of course are used to craft monsters and boss armors, and of cooourse they look cool as ♥♥♥♥In this game, they implemented a new mechanic called ""Scouting"" to find the monsters around the map, they usually leave scratches and footsteps on the ground and you can act with them to track down the beast you want to hunt, then a green trail guides you in the direction of the monster.There are 3 levels of Scouting in each beast of the game, and you level it up by simply Scouting (interacting with the footprints) once you have reached level 1 the green trail will guide you to the first footsteps of the monster and it helps a lot at the start, level 2 tells youi where the monster is on the map, and level 3 adds stats of the monster on the map and not sure if something else.Monster Hunter: World is more focused on Online than other games of the franchise, this being the easiest of them all if you want to play with friends, the game will always try to put you on a ""Online session"" but you can always play Offline, so don't worry.And that's itIf you like the franchise I would say it's a 8 or 9/10If you didn't it's a good game to try againAnd if you are new to MH, you can just like it (7/10) or love it (9/10)But of course this is just me guessing and my personal opinion about itYou can always tell me if you did buy it and what did you liked about itThank you for reading it all, hope it helps <3"

When playing this game for the first time, really take it all in at your own pace and appreciate it, as it will become very nostalgic upon finishing the game. This game beats every other monster hunter game including Rise in every single way. BTW like others have suggested, I suggest for new players do not use the defender armor, it gives it to you for free but if you use it it kind of ruins the experience by vastly reducing the time of the grind by greatly boosting your stats, which makes the game lose some of its appeal imo.. its kind of like easy mode since the normal game is pretty difficult"

(Hammer user here, yes it feels way better).overall,its a great game, buy it, check the guides on the community hub so you can mod it and fix the issues, have fun."
384,Proudly Toxic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/r4tking/,507,70,0,438.6,March,"13,",357,10,1,"Latest update has made the game unplayable for a large portion of the playerbase that can only be solved (for some) if they turn off their anti-virus or add the game to the exception list. I've done both and the game doesn't work and won't work until they patch it.The annoying part is that this is happening because capcom is using a third party for their game's DRM and anti cheat. So either the anti cheat update they've done, or Denuvo is making the game unlaunchable.This anti cheat by the way was the same reason the game had so many problems at the launch of iceborne, which made the game largely unplayable for another large part of the playerbase due to framerate problems that didn't exist prior to the update. This problem affected players even if they didn't buy Iceborne.Edit: Crash on launch issues fixed for players for whom adding the game to the exception list hadn't fixed it, but players can't complete raid content because the game keeps either crashing or disconnecting users from the online thanks to it's great anti cheat system and DRM.Players who couldn't launch the game were given a wooping 15 days where they either had to play something else or got a Totally Legitimate tm version so they'd be able to keep playing the software they paid for.10/10 would play again."

As someone who never touched the MH series, this game is absolute GOAT and I am looking forward to try other MH games. With 369 hours in,  this game still have something for me to do, the community is very friendly (99% of it). The hunters are all nice people, some which helped me pass a few big walls. If you plan to buy it and play with a friend or solo. Sure, its worth it what are you waiting for?? Get the  expansion too! You will never regret it since the Iceborne expansion is GOAT. Based on the stats,  Everyone whom finished the base game should get ICEBORNE as it brings out the most of game, both gameplay and story-wise. Word of advice, don't SOS on every monsters. Try to conquer it yourself solo, learn about the monsters, then if you failed the quest for over 5 times, feeling fed up and want to continue. That's when you should call for the help of the gods (hunters who cleared the game and reached godhood). Defender equipment is ugly but strong, the hunters have mixed feeling about this armor.  Unless you tried and failed a quest a lot, still wanna solo the quest instead of asking the help of the gods, then sure defender is the way to go.Game is good. 10/10See new monster-> tries beatin it-> beat/fail-> craft new armor from new monster/ farm equipment to beat monster-> SOS if all things fail->"

(sorry vets, you're not convincing me to go back to a charge blade-less monster hunter game in a thousand years)Are you willing to overcome any and all odds stacked against you and thrive in a world of fantastic flora AND fauna?Then this is the game for you!At first i wasn't sure i should delve deep into this game, but when i've learned you can get a sword+shield combo that can turn into a big ""F*ck you"" axe that CAN ALSO BECOME A CHAINSAW, i was sold. This game's whole experience for me was learning and mastering the charge blade, and that weapon is HARD to master (at least for the poor pea-brained me), yet it was one of the most fun things i've ever did.If you really want to master an weapon, look for guides on youtube, because all of them have secret bits and bobs of info that could give you the edge on any future hunt.Do not hesitate to call for an S.O.S. flare. Hunters togheter, legends forever. And you might even meet new friends as you do so.Overrall this game's gameplay is fantastic. Heavy weapons feel heavy, light weapons attack fast but it's a death by a ten thousand papercuts.

It has been an excellent experience and I can't wait to play more in the series if it comes to PC. A plethora of combat options and a world that truly feels alive. Every monster is a joy to learn its weaknesses and take to school with your weapon of choice. The beasts all feel like they really occupy space and have weight behind all of their attacks. Everything is difficult without being cheesy. I am told this game has the least options and is the most watered down of the Monster Hunter games but for a new player, you would never know it. If you ever wanted to play something like Dark Souls but against giant monsters and nothing else, this is your game. As a mostly PC player, I played the whole game with a mouse/keyboard without any issues at all. The controls felt responsive and fluid and I never felt hindered by my control choice. The menu options aren't ideal for mouse/keyboard but you get used to them fast enough. My only gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn any armor into a 'layered' armor set as by the end of the game, most armors are rendered obsolete which limits the ability to play a version of fashion souls as you might do with Dark souls. Change the town music.Kill the handler."
394,Scoot the Boot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyscootaloo/,91,11,1,"1,187.6",September,"3,",211,9,1,"Pros,- It's Monster Hunter. Combat joy. See below.- Fights that require learning and improvement.- Progression through gear *and* personal experience+skill.- It looks great. (even at low settings)- Plenty of weapon styles.- Monster Hunter language for speech available. 10/10.- All weapons are great. Except Longsword because ♥♥♥♥ everyone using it. Including me.- High variety and decent depth of tools and their respective uses.- Lots of gear building.- Inspiring soundtrack.- Long grind and lots of stuff to do.(the stuff below was added because a dumbass made a good point)- You have a pet cat that sort of talks. It fights with you in duos/solos if you allow them.- Cats have armour and weapons.Cons : - There are bad players, beware. (reviews about how the monster 'predicts' your attacks)- There are bad players hoping you can wail on monsters just because you dodged.- Some of these players did not just give up and are still playing, BEWARE.- This game is not for potato PCs. Seriously.- Low settings can take awhile to get used to. (still looks alright to me,  but it is a bit of a downgrade from high/medium)- The AI is pretty scary if you're not prepared. (If you want a punishing beat-em-up, go to Dark Souls, instead.)- There is a long grind. It's what this game is about. Grind for parts, make stuff to grind for more parts.- Disconnection issues may have been improved upon, but are still there. (possibly caused by Steam, rather than MHW?)- Again, this game is *seriously* taxing on one's system. Potatoes be warned.Summary- I am having way too much fun.- Soloing is easier, don't let scrubs mislead you on this. They're just bad. Multiplayer is dealing with a harder AI to read and way more HP to break through with reliance on teammates who may or may not be good.- This is not a game for people who believe that if you outplay the monster by dodging, you get free hits. All you did was dodge. Now find your damn opening, because dodging me spitting at you doesn't mean I can't still punch you in the teeth."

400,Average Mom Enjoyer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/anrunxyz/,14,2,1,563.2,May,"26,",44,1,1,"(edit: I have not played any of the previous installments of Monster Hunter.)Great game overall. Went from being on the verge of refunding it to putting in many hours in just a short period of time and purchasing the DLC. Unique combat system that reminds me of Dark Souls (dodging mechanics, reading monster's wind up animations, etc.) However, the overall flow of the combat is very different from the Souls series. Absolutely adore how there's no punishment in wanting to switch weapons. There's no ""respecing"" or anything like that, you really only have to farm material to craft other weapons. Each weapon offers a unique play style: everyone can find something they like. It's  I selected weapons that didn't fit my play style, and that's what drove me to dislike the game initially.HOWEVERBoy... does this game have issues with it's online play... With co-op hunts being such a huge part of the game's selling point, you would think that multiplayer is seamless. That's certainly not the case. Between all of my friends, we've had problems such as the following:1) game freezing when someone faints2) random disconnect from online sessions 2a) subsequent forced withdrawal from quest3) quest difficulty not readjusting due to the forced splitting of party 4) inability to rejoin each other's quests due to player cap reaching limit before forced splitIt's made my experience significantly less enjoyable; in fights against any elder dragons, tempered monsters, arch tempered, etc. this terribly frustrating. Please be aware of this when purchasing the game, especially if you're planning to play with friends. If changes can be implemented to make online play better, this game would be in a really great spot."

404,Reign,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DevReign/,40,3,1,838.8,August,"14,","2,171",0,1,"As a veteran of the series; having played nearly every monster hunter game released in the US since the original game on the PS2, I'd recommend it to new and experienced players alike. I think the series was starting to feel stale, but they changed a lot in this iteration which made for a new and refreshing experience. However, this game seems poorly optimized and while they made a lot of good changes, some are questionable. I'm also annoyed with how they changed the controllers shoulder/trigger button functionality and the lack of controllers options to fix the issue. With that in mind I just decided to play with the keyboard and mouse instead which seems to be working well enough. It feels like it lacks content compared to some of the previous entries like freedom unite and a lot of the weapons look really similar because they reused a lot of the models instead of making new ones for each path. I enjoyed this game, though I don't know if I enjoyed it much as some of the older games. I think the 2nd and 3rd generation of monster hunter may have actually been my favorite, but this one's good, especially if you're new to the series. The mechanics are explained a lot better, its much easier, has better collision, but even with those improvements its just lacking something the older games had. The monsters in this game lack variety compared to the previous games, it feels like they all share too many similar moves. I also think the movement and combat being so fluid now with the forgiving collision just takes away from really having to learn each monsters attacks, look for openings, master good positioning and timing, etc and most fights are too easy now. I don't like that the game has 2 DRMS (Steam and Denuvo), one is plenty. But at least it seems to work without an internet connection which is a big plus considering a lot of newer games don't. GAMEPLAY:If you never played monster hunter, the gameplay is 10/10. Monster hunter has always been about the intricate combat system that rewards knowledge, creativity and skill. Combat is very similar to dark souls. If you like boss fights in games than you'll love this. Each monster has different attacks they telegraph that you have to find ways of dealing with while also looking for openings where you can get some damage in. Each monster has different strategies depending on which of the 14 weapons you use. There's a lot of replayability in trying to master fighting each monster with all the weapons types. There are also a ton of items you can use against them like traps. Winning a fight against a new monster is exhilarating, and when you get back to town you always want to rush to the smithy to see what new equipment you can make to further customize and improve your character with. It's all very enjoyable alone or with friends. CHANGES:My favorite change is the visual weapon tree that shows all the branching paths so you can see what's good without having to look it up online while you play. You can also downgrade weapons which refunds your materials making the upgrade system much more forgiving. That's something I think the series needed for a long time.Gathering is now much faster and fluid so it doesn't interrupt the pacing of game as much. They streamlined EVERYTHING which is good and bad, but I think they went a little overboard in some areas. The new the graphical user interface is less intuitive than the old one and not as appealing. I was really skeptical about the new tracking mechanic until I fully understood it, but I think it's a good improvement over the old paintball system. They removed the loading zones between maps which changes gameplay in a few ways. The new maps are really big, complex and beautiful, but can become infuriating labyrinths at times. All pieces of armor seem to give you a skill instead of points toward a skill which seems like a good change.Charms are no longer farmed but crafted which could also be a good change since it alleviates some of the farming and RNG. Performance:I haven't experienced any crashes, but it seems poorly optimized for a AAA game. I've been playing on basically lowest settings(textures aside) and get an occasion hitch where the game freezes for a few seconds. I'm running it on windows 8.1 with an i5-4670k processor and 760 gtx video card. This is the only game aside from PUBG I can think of atm that makes all my fans run at high speeds to keep my pc cool while playing on lowest settings. TLDR;I'd highly recommend it to anyone that thinks they might enjoy it if you have a good PC that can run it. Like with all steam games you're probably best off waiting for a sale to save money, but it's well worth the full price imo."

I expect these issues to be fixed in time, however it is disappointing that they were not able to iron these out in the extended time it took them to release a PC version.- Frequent disonnects, trouble joining other online matches. I have a low-end connection, however this should be supported and handled accordingly- Steam rich presence will spam your entire friends list (even those who haven't bought this game) with messages of you playing every 5-10 minutes. Pretty bad bug as it affects everybody around you, not only those playing.- Heavy load on hardware. Game looks great but is absolutely unforgiving for mid-end rigs or lower. Impossible for me to go anywhere beyond 60fps and I have a decent rig- By default, game will force steam into Big Picture mode (can be disabled in steam settings)Currently, I recommend avoiding the game and waiting for most of these issues to be alleviated.

With some story, more or less.I do believe its content is disappointing compared to older monster hunters, but the QoL changes more than make up for it. I love the game even if i'm not that very good at it. There's a weapon type for almost everyone, there's also a lot of gimmick builds. (Wish the damage builds would be nerfed to make room for other cool stuff though.)Most of my complaints is going to be fixed in iceborne, so there's no point complaining about it.I hate its forced narration, unskippable cutscenes ( I know you worked hard on them, but still), weird co-op intergation.The game also doesn't tell you things as well as I hoped. The leap of faith is never really explained (I believe?), and stuff like mount damage isn't  but it's a lot better than older monster hunters still.Also, I very dislike how delayed the game was and how terrible it was at launch. Mouse controlled like a trackpad and disconnection issues were off the charts. Content was also 'accelerated' to match consoles, but there were months where we didn't get anything for a long time, even if we suddenly get a month of jampacked stuff..Overall, not bad.

409,Starl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starl0/,213,6,0,116.4,August,"10,",174,54,1,"This PC port has massive issues (almost Dark Souls 1 level) and i cannot recommend buying one.   First of all - controls are messed up. If you were going to buy this game and play on mouse+keyboard, i cannot recommend you to do so. let me explain why:  The game in its essense emulates a gamepad. In case of mouse it emulates right stick. The word 'emulate' is not an exaggeration. Your mouse has acceleration always on and has capped max speed. You cannot turn fast no matter how fast you move your mouse, you cannot target something precisely because inertia in emulated stick movement. it feels HORRIBLE.  The game has lock-on system and you switch targets with a mouse. Oookay, but do as much as lightly touch it and your screen goes all over the place, switching all the targets possible 3+ times each. Apparently developers never heard of 'dead zone'.   Radial menus. You think one would press Q, mouse over something and use it. Wrong! You have to use WASD to navigate radial menus, which is ... bad. At the very least it's practically impossible to drink a potion while moving. You can use F1-F4 and then 1-9 instead, but it's not very convenient (mostly due to pressing F1-F4 buttons beforehand, try pressing F1 then 7 very fast).   And now we get to keybindings, which are implemented horribly. Once again, emulation. If 2 actions are on same button on gamepad, they're on same button on keyboard. You cannot detach them like in other modern games. For example, on gamepad Special Attack and Interact are both on B, if i want to move Special Attack to side mouse button for example, i cannot bind interact to E separately, it moves to side mouse button as well.   Now that we're done with controls, let me also mention low graphics quality for 2018 in form of multiple low resolution textures (on max setting, mind you)  and mid 2000-s lighting. It's just not on par with other modern games.   Another weak point is multiplayer which is derived from old mobile (PSP, 3DS) ad-hoc parties. You have to join open session with up to 16 players, none of them you can see anywhere in the world, and then may form parties with them for specific quest. This design feels wrong and outdated.   Also, you cannot play co-op with your friend, because game does not allow you to join your friend on story mission you did not complete solo (or with somebody elses help) first.  All in all, the game is decent, combat is fresh and interesting, monster design (gameplay wise) is good, but overall quality of this port detracts from the experience big time. That kind of quality has no place in this day and age. I would recommend to buy it on a 50% sale at least, it's not worth full price."

422,uhruhri,https://steamcommunity.com/id/uhruhri/,51,3,1,610.0,August,"29,",386,0,1,"As for now other than technical issues, I really can't give bad review for this game. I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.What I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use ""SOS"" feature to help random people- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.What I dissapointed from the game :- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. - Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customizationMixed feeling :- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too. Hope Capcom will add more monster other than the one they release in Console version"
423,fireandice,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114706295/,454,58,0,550.8,August,"25,","1,457",0,1,"Allow me to start out by stating I am a huge fan of the monster hunter series, having played every game released since 2009, more than several thousands hunter ranks across these games. Having fought hacked quests for increased difficulty such as Tripple furious Rajang in an arena, amoung many others. Having loads of hours into this game as well as top 30 in speed runs for a few monsters, I can state that the game itself has allot of pros and cons to consider before purchasing - PROS-Quality of life changes ( gathering can be done on the run,crafting simplified, Armors not needing rare gathered items often times making no sense. Such as several rare beetles that can only be found at volcano in a single spawn on a 7% chance.)   ^-Attacks from players no longer send you flying backwards ( gunlance shells, etc ) This allows for most diversity in the weapons that are usable online.^^- An interactive map that allows markers and waypoints to be set, it also shows all events in real time ( small monsters moving around, plants and gathering materials etc)^^^- waypoint traveling at any time not in combat on maps, as well as access to change your gear and item box during a mission, you can also eat food on a mission as well. -Smooth combat, terrain based attacks add a nice new element to the game, this often allows for interaction with the enviroment to pull attacks off that normally wouldnt be possible. For instance trapped against a wall and a monster is rushing at you? No worries, if this is one of many walls that you are able to run up, you will be able to dodge a charge from an angry diablos and turn the tables with an arial attack.All weapons mostly viable- Despite what you will hear from allot of players, all weapons are mostly viable across the board. There are certain weapons that are niche situations however all have decent across the board balance for the most part.-All the weapons are in a single game with updated move sets, and terrain based moves.-Terrain traps are an interesting addition to the gamewith addition of the terrain came traps, certain areas have these that can be triggered in a number of different ways, each resulting in a specific effect. CONS-Game based cons-- End game RNG grindHaving been a 10 year veteren of the series, I am certianly no stranger to the grind in monster hunters. However gems for your armor are now only obtainable through melding( specific low tier gems can be crafted through melding) and randomly after a mission. After hitting an HR nearing 100 and 4xx missions under my belt, I am no closer to finding any gems that I have been looking for. ( these are ofcourse among the dozens of gems that can not be crafted and only can be obtained through RNG) This RNG is further made worse by the augment system in endgame, requiring random drops from special gems specific to your weapon type.-Roar into xxx true comboThis is honestly the first monster hunter in which nearly every monster has a Roar into XXX move, be prepared to get that evasion + or ear plugs, as it will save you a load of frustration.-Poor hit boxes on large number of the monsters--Many of the monsters have rather perplexing hit boxes on their attacks. For instance often times at the tail of a rathian/rathalos durnig the standard run attack you will be hit, to the left or right of the tail slightly? -still hit - The rule of thumb is treat all monster attacks with movement as a giant cube, you will find yourself less confused and hit less often.-Monster physics?-momentum is overratedIn Most all of the monster hunter games, aside from X ( astalos) Monster hunter monsters were generally bound by at least their own weight class. You were able to see a heavy large monster move like it had weight to it, and its speed and acceleration would show accordingly. However that does not seem to be the case this time around in world. Many of the cast move like this was dragonball z fighters. For example, teostra has a leap in which he instantly accelerates to break neck speed from a leap nearly teleporting to a location, and seemingly stops standing like he had been there all along. This becomes rather difficult to guage the pacing of a monster when they do not abide by their own physics at random times in a fight.-Hallways and more hallwaysThe game has moved from large open areas in which to fight monsters, and instead chosen to replace it with terrain revolving around many channeled hallways. There are more open zones in the maps, however a vast majority of each map are a series of tunnels or hallways in which the fights take place. Fighting azure rath shooting fireballs down hallways is something I could do with out.-Lack of monsters move diversity-Most monsters share a large majority of their move set, for instance rathian/rathalos is a standard for most games, however many of those movesets such as tail spin/ tripple fireball, tripple run, are shared across a vast majority of the cast. Elder dragons all share the right and left paw swipe, amoung other moves, making it rather stale after some time.-No G rank-For long time fans of the series we all know what comes with G rank, much harder monsters, larger defense values ( or Hp pools) and most of the moves 1 shot. However with this trade off comes armor that allows the highest tier of slots and skills, This allows for numerious amounts of builds and sets that would not be possible at high rank. This G rank level often times allows weapons such as hunting horn or other lower damage weapons the ability to make sets that help the weakness of low damage or other such weaknesses of weapons. The game does have a psuedo G rank option of augmentation for your armor, however it is still nothing close to the experience of true G rank.-Difficult to communicate with othersIn past monster hunter games you could rather easily send text to other players you had on your huntercards ( friend list ) In this game however sending anything to another person is nearly impossible if you do not know them in real life. The system of simply sending them a notice or a small sentence is a thing of the past.NON GAME BASED CONS--Delays and more delays---The PC version of this game is already vastly behind in content due to its near a year long delay compared to the console. The updates are coming in slowly, if at all. Many monsters have been pushed back months when capcom has told the community that it would be recieveing events at a faster pace than console in order to make up for lost time. The inverse it true, console is getting events at a faster pace.- Poor Online support-- ( AMENDED-ISSUE FIXED FOR MOST PLAYERS)For a AAA title, having the online hosted on potatoes is unacceptable, even after the ""fix"" patch you will be hard pressed to go for any period of time with out running into errors and disconects. As it stands currently the SoS flare feature ( access to recieve help from other players during a mission) is nearly non functioning. 10 million copies sold, one can only assume that at least $500,000,000 has been made on monster hutner world. Paying a small amount of that to purhcase your own servers rather than skimp and use free hosting is unacceptable. - Lacking graphics options standard to PC gamesAs seen hundreds of times on many other reviews FOV, Advanced graphics options such as motion blur, bloom, acceleration on the mouose, ect ect should be included in a PC release. ====UPDATED- Motion blur toggle added, Direct mouse input added.The main reason for the negative review is the lacking of online, as well as graphics settings. This review will change when these issues are fixed. As a long time monster hunter fan, it pains me to do so, however a title that has sold 10 million copies should learn its lesson for next time, to not pinch pennies on servers for the community that has purchased those copies, or wait nearly a year in delay with nothing to show for it."

If you as a dev are not competent enough to make a save system that works properly ALL of the time, then either build your own damn backup contingencies, or at least let us save the same file in different slots so we can stagger-save.From what I've found out about this issue, even steam cloud saves might not have saved it, so that particular brand of hindsight is extra useless.If you want a game that might spit in your face for daring to love it, that might demand you start fresh if you look at it funny, be my guest and roll them dice, but don't blame me if you experience the same incandescent rage that I do right now."

But, hey, its okay because Teostra keeps violently mating with Lunastra, which I highly avoid going to if you have allergies to exploding. Spoiler alert; you do.Also, we don't talk about her...

Most of those problems have been fixed or mitigated since. You might still encounter some performance issues but I think most systems meeting the recommended specs shouldn't have any problem as long as you lower the settings to medium or low.Very good entry point for players new to the monster hunter series, and tons of content for veteran hunters, with more free content updates / events planned through 2020."

I've played ALOT, like ALOT. I really enjoy the combat, I love how you have to earn every step forward. The multiplayer is wonderful if you've got 1 to 3 friends who play games with you. If you're looking for a game to have near endless hours of fun and you've never played a game that challenges you to ""get good"" this game will do it.The only drawbacks I can think of are the limits placed on sieges (raids), it can sometimes make it difficult to party with friends, but that can be easily overcome by hosting your own session. Also the story is a little cheesy, but it does bring a sort of entertaining hack and slash naivety being, you're murdering these giant monsters to make cool stuff from them. Meanwhile all the NPC's are positive and smiley about it. Final drawback being occasionally you get disconnected from the sessions and are now solo fighting the monster instead of ganging up on it with your bros.Like many games MHW has a base story line you play through then extra end game content, part of that is building your multiple end game sets much like Diablo or Path of exile it can become a gear grind to build your ultimate sets; for some like myself, this is a plus. However if you're a casual gamer that doesn't enjoy the satisfaction of building your ultimate set, you'd prefer the game just give you stuff this probably isn't going to be as fun for you. Think ""Call of Duty kill grind"" to unlock attachments vs ""Legend of Zelda"" I found the thing now I can use it and all of it's capabilities.The multiple weapons in the game give you a variety of play styles and even then you still get a variety within the weapons themselves of play styles. Which is wonderful because it gives you many different ways to tackle the next big bad monstie.For me going on safari in the monster hunter world to collect all the different pieces of parts which allows you to make the ultimate armor then adding to it decorations to polish off the skills I want is super satisfying.To summarize if you like skilled game play with lots of ways to customize play style with the satisfaction of collecting pieces to build the ultimate god tier hunter then you'll love this game. Oh and the mulitplayer is hella fun but not required so you don't HAVE to have your bros on to go hunt you get a little partner to assist you."
438,Jay,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hybridizm/,17,,1,81.6,October,"27,",440,0,1,"Having been with the franchise for a quite a while, I was excited to see MH return to home entertainment systems with the announcement / release of World. It is quite honestly, one of my favourite games of all time, let alone one of the best games in this franchise. I have 1500 + hours in the PS4 version + Iceborne as well. - With 14 weapons to choose from and varied, enjoyable to play around with move-sets, coupled with a fantastic combat loop due to great animations and fun-to-fight monsters, once again, MH hits it out of the park on this front. No weapon is truly bad, all of them bring something to a hunt. Whilst it's fun to main (and I implore you to join the swag-axe crew) a weapon, I'd encourage trying them all. Clocking in 200 hours with a single weapon and then going to use another will honestly, feel like an entirely new experience. The monsters may not change as your weapon does, but how you go about fighting them, will. - Whilst not the sort of game where you'd find yourself adding music from the OST to your regular playlists, it still manages to nail the music thematically, for both the monsters and their regions. Sound design is top notch too, the roaring crunch of a GS user landing a True Charged slash, as well as the power from a Swag-Axe enthusiast letting off an elemental discharge sound fantastic. Monster roars / noises sound great too. Voice acting is okay, the lip-syncing doesn't match up with the English VA at all thus, it'll look weird during cutscenes. - Probably one of the weaker areas in the game when talking about weapon design. Armour and monster design as per usual are great, but for some reason, many weapons fell prey to Iron / Bone design with a monster element thrown in, akin to a topping on a pizza. There are some stellar weapon designs here, just a shame that many look rather basic. Regions all look good, nailed their themes. - What you get out of Monster Hunter is ultimately what you're willing to put into it. You could complete LR, HR and the MR and do a couple of hunts / investigations outside of the main path and be on your way. Many of us though will continue the hunt, the grind for parts to fill out our collections and pamper our dopamine receptors, all whilst engaging in a fantastic game-play loop. There is plenty here to feast on, but it ultimately comes down to you.--- - Amazing game, worth every penny at full MSRP let alone if on sale. I personally prefer World to Rise and would sooner play World or MHGU over the newest instalment."

These issues persisted for a little while and are now the result of steams heavilly mixed reviews. Now with all the online multiplayer modes being mostly fixed, up and running, hopefully we'll see all of that change now because honestly this is a game that's worthy of much more credit. Whether you're new or a veteran to the series, there's plenty to be enjoyed with this charm. The combat sytem is legenday with various different weapons to chose from, which all function completely differently with their own set of combo's and tactics to learn, making learning them all the more rewarding. Fights may be intense, especially the deeper you get into the game and may not be for the faint hearted as you will be punished hard if you slip up, but it's that kind of challenge that makes the monster hunter series so entertainingly addictive.With additional DLC including new maps and monsters expecting to be added to the game in future, it leaves one with plenty to look forward to."

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2019 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he friended and invited me to join him. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

It’s a great one for beginners. However it’s really annoying if you’ve played them before, there’s a lot of handholding. And I mean A LOT. Constantly when you’re out and about you’re led by “scoutflies” which are glittering paths leading you right to your target. It takes away the satisfaction of feeling like you’ve actually tracked the monsters. You can even see them on your map all the time which takes away half the fun. The music is nice at times but gets lost outside the villages. It’s all fanfare most of the time. But then again nothing's ever as good as the Pokke Farm theme. I still wish there were more non-orchestral pieces.The story is easy enough to ignore. It doesn’t have many striking or engaging main cast members really. There are some interesting ones later one once you get past the first two environments. It doesn’t read like a MH game in the way it’s so in your face; on top of that the writing is mediocre. In the older ones the story was in the quest descriptions so it was more a background deal. Writing really isn’t a strong point for these games.The environments are visually pleasing, the variance between locations is massive. When they say World they really mean it.The new monsters have a lot of character and are unique. Very pleasing aesthetically and don’t seem out of place in the MH universe. While they have a lot of variance and creativity in their attacks, the combat still feels the same between all of them. It’s extremely easy to find materials for armor and weapon upgrades so the difficulty margin doesn’t feel like it increases from one monster to the next. All of them feel very at level if not slightly below. The three times I’ve fainted in combat didn’t feel like I’d deserved it. They were all a result of unavoidable attacks and waiting on the recovery frames. Overall great for beginners to MH, but the excitement for those that have experienced Freedom Unite/Generations will ultimately be a bit dissatisfied with the combat. Definitely worth playing even then, I’ve still enjoyed it to some extent.Honestly I can see myself going back to Generations after a while. I’ll give MHW:4/10 Music4/10 Story7/10 Character design9/10 Environments10/10 Monster Design6/10 Combat and gameplayIf you haven’t played MHFU or Generations, grab yourself a 3DS and get to it."

Picking a weapon and actually understanding how to play it helped me a lot! As soon as you understand the basics of how to use your equipment it's a ton of fun! The world is engaging, watching the monsters interact with each other, fighting or hiding and all that, is very interesting. Progressing through the game will bring you into contact with most of the monsters naturally, just by following the main and side quest lines. The late game contains more challenging versions of all the fights. I had some frustrating moments, where I just could not find a plant I was looking for or where a monster constantly pulled off a move I could not yet deal with or interference in a fight by other monsters. So I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to my friends about it, which had them laughing at me for being so ragey about silly stuff, but all in good fun, I never felt like giving up or dropping the game ^^There is just a lot of content and things to learn about, items, NPCs that sell or do things for you, systems and menus in the game and all that.I really enjoy the graphics and designs of the world you're in. Especially fun to play with people online. You can just post/join a quest in an online session with people and they can join you for the hunt. Or you can send an SOS signal, which then opens it up to people from everywhere, not limited to your session. It definitely has grindy moments, when you're trying to get a very specific piece of armour or a weapon (which you should to be honest, there's certain effects that will greatly boost you, depending on your playstyle/weapon). Great fun! Put some time into character creation so you feel good about your character and then see where your journey takes you :3"

Monster Hunter World is truly a new world in your own computer, every day, every hour while playing this game you will learn something new or notice something you haven't before, whether it be a new sub species of little critters you can find during your hunts and expeditions, a structure or pathway you've never taken, or an interaction with the monsters living in the various areas, Capcom really focused on the small things in this game that will leave you awestruck at the absolute amount of effort put into the game, overall, the environments and level design in this game is top notch, something that's very rare and should be experienced.              The gameplay design of this game is very repetitive and extremely grindy, you will find yourself fighting the same monster over and over again, in usually the same place, you'll need to forage the land and do it all again for as many times as you can take it, there are additions in the game that allow you to over time passively gather resources that you'd have to forage for which will make the game a much better experience, it will also give you a sense of power creep, which is the satisfying part of playing through the game.              The beginning of the game is very lacky, the story is very forgettable and kind of annoying seeing that it is mandatory in order progress and find new monsters and areas, that being said, the fights are still crazy fun and a good start to prepare you for hard mode, which is where you'll spend most of your time fighting the various monsters in order to progress your weapons and armour. Farm, craft, repeat.              Gameplay wise [The combat itself will be judged in a separate paragraph] this game is repetative, grindy and only for those who are willing to farm the same thing over and over and over again, though once you're around HR15 the game opens up to a whole new variety of things / monsters that will really balance repetition and content.              Lastly the combat and monster design, the reason the game exists, the bois you will be constantly farming and dying to, the huntees. Im too lazy to write a paragraph large enough to put into perspective how well designed the monsters are, so you'll have to see for yourself, the character, in game render and overall concept of the monsters rivals that of any other game i've played, these things are truly like beasts in another world that live in their own environments, interacting with the things, people, other monsters around them, its pretty amazing.              The combat in this game is like dark souls with a rogue twist, you can use your weapon to hunt, you can use the environment, you can get other monsters to help you hunt your monster, the possibilities are almost endless with what situations and environment you find yourself in. The weapons are well put together, each with their own flashy fighting style and design, if you don't like what your weapon is capable of, use one of the other 10+ weapon types that fit your playing style, the animations are smooth and the combat is very satisfying and well executed for a ""I hit the thing until it die"" kind of game.Overall TLDR:"

The PC release had a rocky launch in terms of online stability and some graphics related issues (the issues I experienced were related to poor framerates in specific game environments, and major framerate drops and game stuttering during thunder elemental attack effects, which not everyone was experiencing. I'm playing on an i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz, 32 GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti). Online stability has vastly improved for me playing both in random online sessions, and with friends across NA and EU, since the first patch was released a couple weeks after the game's launch. I have faith the remaining issues will be resolved as the franchise's first PC release continues to grow with the huge success of this game across all platforms it's been released on so far.In terms of the game itself, I'll include my experience of the PS4 release of MHW combined with the PC release, because it definitely feels like to me, the hours I'm putting in on PC now are complimenting the 400+ hours I played on PS4. As my first MH game, even hundreds of hours into the game, I'm still finding myself learning new ways to play, whether it's figuring out a new way to use one of the 14 weapon types available, or discovering a new strategy for any of the (currently) 31+ large monsters available as hunting targets. The behavior of the monsters varies enough from hunt to hunt, and across multiple environments, to keep me on my toes when I start getting a little too cocky or comfortable. Many aspects of the game remind me a great deal of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, another Capcom game I very much enjoyed.As the PC release of MHW catches up a bit to the content released on consoles up to now, I have plenty of confidence that my enjoyment of this game won't diminish for many hundreds of hours to come. And to me, that's absolutely been worth the purchase across multiple platforms."

473,Leal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bevash1029/,10,,1,15.8,May,"6,",217,0,1,": 8/10Monster Hunter: World was a game that interested me back in 2018, and with the time my hype grow a litle bit to much, and I was waiting for some fantastic thinks in some aspects of the game, what I don't really saw.The game is beautiful, the landscape, the design of the several monsters, characters and biomes, are something of amazing, it's just soo well done, whe can fell every single place that we travel, the sadness, the happiness, everything. Monster Hunter: World combat its just great, the combat mechanics in the begging can be a litle hard to learn and use in the best way, however with the time you will become better and better, starting to do the combos, etc... Killing more easily the several monster that you have in front of you.The map it's not huge, but we can say that is big, being divided in zones that after are divided in areas, this can sound a litle bit confuse, however it's just that, per exemple in the forest zone you will have several different areas, starting with the 1 and ending at the 12.I really liked the co-op implementation to the game, it's just a way that the desevolpers found to don't let the players leave the game soo easily if they have some friend also with the game, it's obviously more fun and a awesome aspect of the game.I loved the costumization of the game, it's just something of amazing, you will get items killing obviously the monsters, and after you can forge new weapons/gear to you and your litle cat or upgrade what you already have, and that is just something of insane, you will have different family trees that will lead you to different buffs, fire, water, etc... thinks that will help you really much in your hunts.Talking about costumizate your cat, yes you have a cat that will really help you, in the bigging I thought that the cat was just a stupid implementation that don't really help us in nothing, and I found that I was terrible rong, the cat is the reason that I just died 3 times in my full experience, he helps you a loot, attacking the monster (not giving much dmg, but helps) and giving you heal, and that yes, will save you a loot if times, image yourself against a powerful mobster, and without heal pontions, say thank you to your cat for saving you.Let's end the Gameplay topic with the cherry in the top of the cake, let's talk about the hunts, I loved what the game done, Monster Hunter: World don't just show the monster that you wanna hunt, you literally need to hunt him, following his footsteps and his marks to find him, it's just soo immersive.For more impressive that this can sound, about gameplay I don't really had any trouble bugs, glichs, none.I hated the story, I just played the first half because I was soo frustrated that I don't even wanted to play the rest of the game, I was waiting for something of amazing, and I don't received that, I will not say that is a terrible story, but I will not say that couldn't be better.Probably other players that don't played the other franchise games understand better than me the story of Monster Hunter: World, because I just understanded 3 thinks, I hunt monsters, I'm in a new world and I wanna find Elder Dragon, just that.In terms of characters, I just liked the cat because he helps us, the others are just there making place. In other games with great stories, we start create inside of us kinda of friendship with characters, however in Monster Hunter: World if they all die, you will litlelary don't care.I really think that the story becomes better after the first half that I played, because you start being a high rank hunter and that really makes the game more interesting, because it's when the co-op implementation starts being really useful and it's also when the game really makes you explore, so you can hunt what you want, to explain better what I wanna say I need to give some spoilers, and that I really don't want to give. So basically the story becomes better after the first half, so don't become like me and just finish.I will be really honest, Monster Hunter it's fun, and don't fun, it's that kind of game that is just too repetitive, with the time you already know the full map and the hunts start being every single time the same, however if you play with your friends, in my opinion the expirence isn't not even close the same, it's just one hundred times better and more fun.Monster Hunter: World it's without any question AAA game, have one of the best gameplays that I had the opportunity to see and enjoy this year, however the game could not be soo repetitive, having other modes, and could easily have a better story."

The story is interesting. And it all looks really beautiful! It's fun to play with your friends and its one of my favorite games! But there are some downsides to the game as well. For example the game is very poorly optimized, for example it uses about 95 to about 100% of my CPU, while I'm running a GPU that's a GTX 1060 6GB. I know that's just a little above the recomended GPU, and my proccesor falls inbetween minimum and recomended requirements, but 95 - 100% that's just crazy! Also if you're looking to play story mode with your friends, don't bother, you have to have seen all cutscenes first, why they decided to do this is a complete mystery to me. Another thing that is really bad about this game is that it has very bad connection issues. Every 10 minutes or so, I get booted from a lobby. When I alt tab I can litterely see my Steam connecting and disconnecting... (which is prolly why everyone gets these annoying pop ups of people playing monster hunter world every 5 minutes. I have a connection speed over 200 Mbps, so trust me I don't have a terrible connection. Something is very, very wrong with this game. Also the fact that they haven't released a patch yet is beyond believe. Very bad rep for Capcom if you ask me.Note that even with all these issues I still think it's an amazing game, and in no way am I trying to discourage the devs to release more monster hunters onto the pc. The game just needs a good patch that fixes the optimization, performance, connection issues, and also the whole cutscene thing needs to be dropped, I just wanna play story quests with my friends!  For now I'd say I give it a 5/10 but if these prolbems are fixed, I'm willing to upgrade to a 9 or even 10/10 since its one of if not the most fav game I got at this moment, so at the end of the day I would still recomend it! I'm just trying to be fair and not be a complete fan boy that ignores issues, besides, being a bit criticism might only help improve the game, if devs would ever read this (which they prolly won't)"

Playing with an Xbox controller everything feels just as smooth as it should.Keep in mind that the first hour of this game is almost entirely cutscenes and moving from A to B.   That's allotting some time to create your character and palico, so your 2 hour refundable ""trial"" if you are doing that won't be much time to experience all the game has to offer.. The game is alot more fun if you have a friend or friends to play with, though the multiplayer allows for randoms to help you and talk to you, and there's some auto-chat messages in combat to help you know what your ally's might be up to e.g. ""Mounted the beast"" or your Palico informing that they need to heal you. But yeah, as of writing this I have 6 hours so this is more of a first impression kind of review, but so far I have nothing to complain about aside from some monster fights becoming a little tiresome after a bit."

I got the game a fair back ago but never gotten into it due to my initial weapon of choice, so whatever you do - make sure you try ALL of the weapons to find your gameplay style. There's a lot of them and combat changes drastically with every new weapon.With that out of the way, the game offers exactly what the title says - you're hunting huge monsters that are very detailed, have fantastic interaction with the environment and require preparation to deal with before each encounter. Gameplay loops are solid and there's a clear indication on what to do and where to go. The story itself is ""meh"". No real NPC backgrounds and it serves its purpose to drive you forward into new zones and new monsters so it kinda gets the job done - but don't expect much from questing and character backgrounds.The absolute worst part of the game is the UI. It's a clunky mess of tens of different UI elements that in different menus serve the same role. For example - managing inventory / quests / items is done via a scrolling interface in one context, then via a paginated menu in another, and finally in a tabbed context in the third one.Finding your friends and joining coop sessions is a PITA and it will have you jumping through menu hoops for quite some time before you get it right. Then there's the gear craft/upgrade system that has a whole different UI with some weapons inside submenus, while some are right there in the main menu making the whole thing extra confusing until you actually get familiar with all weapon types. The ""esc"" menu is also a submenu hell just as the UI parts that you use to transfer items between your bags and storage. Sometimes you need to click the amount of items transfered, and sometimes it's already pre-selected so if you click by muscle-memory you will simply deselect it and go back to the main menu...However - even with the horrible UX flow, Monster Hunter: World has that ""mmo"" feeling to it that will always make you log back in and do ""just one more quest"" while trying to land that massive combo with the awesome animation as you slay yet another huge monster.Oh... yea... and there's cats... CATS!"

It's seriously a lot of fun to ignore the missions for awhile and go on ""Expeditions"", a free-roaming experience where there's no time limit and you're encountering NPCs with little quests around the area. Doing small quests gets you points and upgrade runes for your armor, too, so there's a lot of reasons to do them alongside the story. The main storyline itself seems lighthearted enough, too. Not really doom and gloom so far, and not really in your face either.英語の勉強のために英語版買いました。キャラクターのセリフごとの微妙なニュアンスもちゃんと翻訳されていて納得です。(ただし優しい英語ではないです)勉強になりますね。難易度は高くないと思いますが、十分楽しめます。 {enjoy your weekend by watching this ridiculous singaporean short video.}"

My husband and I were playing through the story together, but it doesn't let you start missions together until you've both seen the cutscene(s) for the mission.

Hunt monsters.Though the story is relatively bland, it's far from the key focus of the game. The repetitive grind-fest that Monster Hunter becomes late-game is ironically what makes Monster Hunter so great. You'll not only be grinding, but you'll probably enjoy it and the progression that comes of it! You'll have the option to use various different weapons and armor as well as nifty trinkets and gems, all of which add bunches of variation in accordance to how you hunt each monster. There's also plenty of events and unique items to unlock as well.The game has had its' fair share of glitches over-time. Generally speaking, it's well known that Capcom doesn't give the same ""love"" to their PC port as they do their console port. Therefore any problematic glitches on this PC port will more than likely take that much longer for Capcom to address. They do address most of these issues at some point in time, though again it's simply no where near as quickly as they address their console issues.8.5/10- I still love Monster Hunter: World, despite the issues it has faced over time. It's a game I keep coming back to, even after not playing it for months at a time. The replay-ability of the game is great and the fact it's fun and addicting make it the epic game that it is."

Having to rebind is problematic, since you are binding vague classes of actions, not actions themselves. Getting melee and ranged comfortable to play requires them to have wholely different, and still unintuitive at times, control schemes since it requires buttons to be moved for one mode and not others.--- Online is broken. For a team game whose PS4 online implementation was essentially bulletproof, but not flawless (parties that would be consistent through runs, rather than having to disband every. damn. time.) the online just doesn't work. You will constantly get disconnected, you will constantly have failed to joined quests even though you are on Discord with your friend. You will get dropped from lobbies, you will have lobbies entirely disappear and dump everyone in them out into their own offline instance. You cannot attempt to rejoin aside from failing your mission then going back to town and manually trying to reconnect and rejoin. After PS4's multiplayer made MH so good to play in groups, this is a horrible thing to do to a great game.-- Obviously a port. Sometimes keyboarding works. Sometimes it doesn't. Enter generally works when you need to confirm somethine, backspace and esc are less likely. So many ""This button does 4-5 things"" situations when we have a whole keyboard we could use for binds. And then the keyboard version of the radial menu (which isn't enabled by default, which is BS) is entirely unbindable.Verdict: Playable if you enjoy the series and game. If you have the option, keep playing it on console or hold off buying until it's fixed. If you're a solo player, the broken online won't matter and it will just be an annoying to control game instead of a vast disappointment."

I had a few friends who had already beat base world before I bought the game at their recommendation. This game is very welcoming to series newcomers and was an absolute blast to play both solo and with friends. I am amazed by the lack of toxicity I have encountered while playing and happily beat both world and iceborne. With friends this game is nothing but a good time. On your own it is still a fun experience that gets the adrenaline pumping while still providing a challenge that hooked me to the franchise for years to come.The only negatives I can give are the connection errors in multiplayer and that, if doing a hunt for the first time, YOU are required to watch an in-game cut scene before other players can join the hunt. The lack of scaling for both 3 and 4 players as opposed to 3-4 being combined also sucked when I had two friends online and we knew that we would be fighting a monster that was scaled for four people. Overall, if you are thinking about trying out Monster Hunter then world and iceborne is probably the best place to start at square one."

Anyway, I obviously did give it a chance, and after 450+ hours, I think it's safe to say I enjoy the game. I miss some aspects from Generations (beyond the aforementioned), but all and all it's a nice game. It does have some aspects that I can see a few people not loving, namely the grind elements that it seems all Monster Hunter games entail for you to build your armor and weapons. Not sure how they could improve upon this to be less grindy and more fun, but hey, it is what it is. MHW has a lot to offer, and looks and sounds great, wether you're a long time Hunter, or new to the series, this is a great game to jump into."

Thankfully, most of these problems have been fixed and I can confidently say that the PC port now delivers the best Monster Hunter World experience. ·The game loads areas super fast (5 secs vs. consoles' 30+ secs) ·Maintains a good framerate even on high settings (60FPS vs consoles' 30~50FPS)·Has the option to play with controller or mouse and Keyboard·Can play online multiplayer without having to subscribe to PS Plus or Xbox Live  ·Mods·Peer-to-peer multiplayer connection can sometimes be wonky·Release of additional free content is behind by 1~2 months compared to consoles·Performance varies by PC specs; a crap PC will perform similar or worse than consolesGameplay-wise, Monster Hunter World is an action RPG where you fight big, bad monsters and collect their loot to craft weapons and armors that will help you fight bigger, badder monsters; this is the core gameplay loop of the game and what others might call ""the grind"" but the combat is so enjoyable it hardly feels like a grind. The combat system is deep with 14 different weapon types that vary greatly from each other - each weapon type has their own nuances and quirks that it sometimes feels like a different game when you switch to a different weapons (check  for a basic intro of the 14 weapons). Mastery of your weapon type determines the success of your hunts much more than just having better gear. Mastery is the most rewarding aspect of Monster Hunter - as you gradually get better, so too will the success of your hunts go.Asides from hunting monsters, there are many other activities in MHW to keep you busy - finding ingredients for the canteen, collecting and catching native wildlife, befriending the local tribes of humanoid cats, gathering resources, and fishing. Most of these activies will also help you in your hunts in some way so it doesn't feel like a waste of time when you do them.The game is tons of fun playing with friends online, and playing with randoms is also very easy as you can join anyone that fired an SOS flare (or fire one yourself). Playing solo is also an option and the whole game can be soloed."

Can't they see it?!"" and with my disingenuous looking (received this product for free) text I'm sure people will hesitate to read this anyway. The games have always been challenging and incomprehensible from the outside, with people asking me ""Surely you don't JUST hunt monsters?"" Monster Hunter: World bridged that gap though. In previous games in the franchise, it was mainly just about hunting monsters and that was what I loved. Yet here we are, Capcom added features to Monster Hunter World to keep you hooked for months. On top of this, the Iceborne expansion is setting the standards for DLC in the industry. But why?Firstly, I want to express that the game is designed near-perfectly to represent fantasy ecosystems. The engine has had a rough time before with my PC(s) but fortunately Capcom has fixed that. The reason it had a problem was probably because everything is living and breathing in this game. The attention to detail of the flora and fauna that live alongside the monsters is staggeringly good, as well as realistic. As a result, there are immersive environments and landscapes that enhance the experience, and as you become a better hunter you learn to use these areas to your advantage. It emulates a real learning curve of exploration and discovery, and that is why I love it. I cannot think of a single other game that does this at all, let alone to this extent and detail. The hunting is great. Each monster boasts attack patterns that become increasingly more difficult as you scale the ranks, but all are possible to beat. When something isn't, the game forces you to reflect, to take a step back and go on an expedition to hunt other monsters, gather materials and build something to better defeat the hurdle you come across. This system is used widely in MMORPGs, but Monster Hunter: World still adds a touch to make it unique and engaging all throughout the game, into endgame, and somehow even beyond that. The monster designs are possibly my favourite of all Monster Hunter games, due to the attention the creators paid to emulate evolutionary traits. Finally, we can speculate how Elder Dragons might be related, the similarities within the monster ""families"" (for example, Brute wyverns sometimes have similar attacks, and once you learn how to defeat one you become more familiar with the others by default, even if they look completely different and have other moves).There are in-depth reviews on the combat system so I won't divulge on that too much besides saying I love chargeblade and I can imagine my character sleeping with hers. Seriously, its an artform.The issues I have had with this game aren't too bad, but I will warn others despite my bug reports usually being dealt with in patches. Firstly, the support for a PS4 controller's buttons aren't in game. It defaults to a microsoft controller, presumably because of Steam's integration, but I would like an option to change this. That being said, every controller I've tried gets input lag sometimes. The keyboard and mouse controls are great in this game, but I played about 200 hours on PS4 so I neglected to learn them, I do use them when I play ranged weapons though.The game is CPU and GPU intensive for the reasons I described; it is a BIG game. There's shadows, v-ray reflections and complex lighting that used to mess with my framerate (they patched that, runs okay now). It still is completely intensive on my PCs though, despite them being high-end. Sometimes I think this causes the input lag, and on newer fights (with many particles), there is a very rare chance of lag. This could still cost you a whole hunt. But I digress. With the introduction of Iceborne, most of the issues have been fixed and clearly there is work to keep fixing it. I have yet to see a game that has been ported to PC that patches as effectively as Monster Hunter: World, the dedication to the PC playerbase is great (despite the waiting time before launch). The PC version outscales PS4 pro and Xbox as the best platform due to the improved loading times, the far better graphics (even on a lower end PC) and the overall immersion.I seriously recommend this game to new players, the community is amazing and you will inevitably make friends through this. There's a strong sense of community if you're struggling, and a lot of resources to help you both in-game and amongst other players. If you're a Monster Hunter boomer like me, you'll love it (if you're not nose-deep in it already). The odes to older players within the game are just brilliant. I hope other people love this game as much as I do, as it makes me happier than any other. Thanks for reading."

Shouldn't have taken so long to fix some very inherently broken parts with the game (scaling monster health when someone DC's). Variety is great, there's tons of content. Don't really care too much for the story, but you hunt monsters so who cares about the lore. Some monsters are unfairly punishing in the sense that if you get stunned you can just be locked in tot he point that you're just dead, but it's a double edged sword. Palico's are still useless as they almost never help you at the right time. They almost never hit you when you're stunned, and they insist on random Vigorwasp deliveries to you almost right after you heal up. Also the point of having a health bar for the Palico is almost useless as they can't die. Overall it's a great game to play with friends and they seem to have fixed a few things in Iceborne that are awful in the normal game, such as health scaling, but connection issues and rejoining is still a pain that plagues it from time to time."

548,Natt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BShiv/,9,1,1,45.2,August,"10,",432,0,1,"As a monster hunter veteran and someone that helped many get into the series, I can’t recommend this game enough. It is my game of the year for sure. I played the Xbox version for over 500 hours (nearly 100 %ed it) and looking to do the same with this one. Even after doing pretty much all this game has to offer I will still play it. I already have way more friends to play with now that it is on PC, and that’s great!If you know nothing about Monster Hunter it is essentially a game where you hunt monsters. Constant mini raid bosses that can take up to 50 minutes sometimes. The leveling up in this game just unlocks more quests, not stats! It is long endurance fight for parts to make a variety of weapons and armors. It honestly makes the grind fun. Even though you are hunting for all these parts the game is essentially relying on your skill. A skilled player can beat this whole game without wearing a single piece of armor. The armor is just to make things interesting with the combination of skills you can come up with to customize your playstyle. The game rewards using items to make fights easier and almost feels like you are planning a hunt any time you come across a new monster. Each monster has unique strategies to learn and plan for. The game rewards reaction time and learning the movement of the monster like real hunting as well.Everyone is welcome here and it is awesome! If you are new to Monster Hunter this is the one to get into! The game is much easier to learn and get used to. Older Monster Hunter games took like 20 hours before you go “oh yeah I got it”. This took about 4 or so from what I seen with the newcomers I tagged along with.  If you are a veteran of Monster Hunter you will most likely love it if you can accept change to a more modern game. I still go back to old ones and play them for that unique experience but this game is so worth it! There seems to be a split in games now, which is totally awesome in my opinion. Old school vs new school. This monster hunter is the modern new school and if you are old school you can fit right in as one of the cool kids. Before you buy you have to remember some things. The beginning will seem overwhelming if you never played a Monster Hunter, but if you stick with it you will find a great game I feel. Each weapon has a learning curve, some easier than others. But each with a depth to be found and enjoyed. Most weapons are super unique and change the way you play the game completely so if you aren’t enjoying one, try another. The game can be soloed (I soloed or did duos with one friend most of my first time through the game), but it is so much better with friends. The online community for Monster Hunter has always been welcoming so if you don’t want to solo you can easily find a group willing to do hunts with you. Since I am a bitter old man I only like to hunt with my friends. I will solo before joining randoms. Some quests have to be started solo and if you are playing with friends, that can be annoying. Once the cutscene is triggered it its joinable though. So just have your friends back out and join you or vise versa. Other then that just take your time with it and learn the game at your own pace!Now if you own the PS4 or Xbox version and want to double dip like myself I highly suggest it. I was blown away in the first few minutes of this game. The game looks gorgeous. I played on an original Xbox One and the graphics were acceptable (Monster Hunter has never been about the graphics so I didn’t mind) but oh my god. It’s like receiving a random nude from your crush at 4 in the morning when I opened this up. It’s beautiful. I may get ripped a new one here but frame rate as long as it’s higher than 30 doesn’t ruin a game for me. As long as it’s fun it rarely bothers me. But the uncapped frame rate here is just like taking my favorite dessert and saying “HEY NO CALORIES WITH THAT BAD BOY, EAT UP!”. I also have way more friends to play with on PC cause a majority of them have PC’s over consoles. So, if you have few good people you want to make a hunting party with then go for it!Like I said this is my favorite game of 2018 and its going to take a miracle of a game to beat this for me. I gladly will buy this game twice… which I did just to experience it with a PC coat of paint and more friends. TLDR: interested in it? give it a shot. It has a learning curve but not as bad as previous installments. Owned it on consoles? Buy it again anyway cause this game is a great PC port.A veteran afraid of “new” MH? I was willing to accept the modern twist on it. The old ones will always be there to experience again."

The overall game is amazing and oozes with quality, but you have to invest a lot of time and engage with the mechanics. Farming is an awful overall affair, which gets worse starting with master rank, where monsters get tons of HP and Damage. When I started to look at some drop chances I got sad and wondered if I need to finish this game with my bad gear, or if I must waste dozens of hours killing the same monster again and again.(I dropped the game after getting my ass handed to me a few times too many by the Tigrex in Iceborne. INSANE HP values and random oneshots make this fight impossible for me.)Overall I would say the game was amazing and extremely fun, if the difficulty wasnt that inflated starting with Iceborne. (Although I dropped the game I would still recommend the base game to anyone and Iceborne only if you are extremely frustration-resistent or have too much time on your hands.)"
557,minusthedrifter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/minusthedrifter/,714,113,0,352.0,October,"6,",466,0,1,"Not recommending this game isn't easy for me, given how many hours I have invested in this game it's pretty obvious I enjoy this game. However, sadly Capcom has seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥ over the PC port and they do not deserve to be rewarded for this behavior.First off, the game was delayed ~7 months from the console and it was reported that the delay was to make sure the port was the best port they could possibly make. That was absolutely not the case, the PC release was crippled with connection issues, mouse and keyboard issues and texture problems. Months later while the connection issues have largely been solved the PC still cannot display textures on High without mods and a number of keys cannot be rebound. However the biggest issue and what caused me to finally not recommend this game is content. As previously mentioned the PC port was delayed over 7 months and unlike every other game ever they decided NOT to release all of the already released content for PC and instead opted for ""accelerated release"" of that already completed content. However that accelerated release was nothing but a bait and switch. The only monster we got early compared to the console was the Deviljho, over a month ago, and since then? Nothing. They were mum on the Autumn Festival until the last minute leading many to believe we weren't even going to get it, however what we did get is a SHADOW of the amount of content the console. The PC got exactly one new quest from the event and no new monsters or events beyond. Literally the entire event can be finished in about a half hour to an hour. Now, today Capcom has revealed the PC won't be seeing Kulve Taroth, the big raid everyone's been waiting for until sometime in November. That means for another month the PC will have nothing the the base vanilla content for another month for a game that's been out for nearly a year. Absolutely unacceptable. The game is a total blast and I've loved all my hours in it but I cannot honestly recommend this game given Capcoms handling of the PC. We're missing so much content, our holiday event is neutered and there are still numerous bugs romaing freely. Capcom doesn't deserve your money."

The graphics and animations are gorgeous, the story is entertaining and keeps me interested, so is the monster hunting! I can hunt a monster a hundred times and I won't get bored, simply because this game is heavily skill based when it comes to dodging attacks and sneaking in a potion or two. This game keeps me on high alert when hunting for Monster bosses!Let's not forget the cats! Oh my god they are IRRESISTABLY ADORABLE! I cannot skip the Canteen cutscenes, these cats are just so... Damn.. Cute.. I squeal in delight every time I hear their little meows! What a perfect touch to such a game!Fortunately, the quality overall of this game makes up for it's very, very minor flaws- such as the targeting system and the delayed attacks(by this I mean you have to wait until your attacks are finished before you can turn around or move in SOME cases). It would be lovely if they added some sort of attack cancelations besides the sudden dodging. Overall, however, I rate this game a 10/10. I can't wait to see how much more it progresses!"

With every update, they seem to break a portion of the community's ability to play it. From insta-crashes, to stuttering issues, to massively high CPU/GPU spikes - every update breaks something for a decent sized portion of the player base. Just go to any of the discussion threads on it and see for yourself - a lot of people have no issues, but there is definitely a lot of complaints about performance problems. Even if the game runs for you with no problems, there is no guarantee it will do so in the future. Of all of the games I've played, this is the only one that continually breaks. But if it runs, the game is a massive amount of fun. While it may be a little grind-y and the monsters repetitive, it's entertaining to get together with a few people and take on the challenge. If Capcom can fix the performance issues, this game would be a 9/10 easily. But with all the problems it has and the lack of communication from them on those issues, it's  a 0/10 because it may not even run."

567,seleszi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/seleszi/,119,23,0,"1,913.1",April,"14,",184,21,1,"I have had it with this game. Before you jump to conclusions and figure I'm just another person mad at Alatreon's Escaton Judgement, cease. You would be completely wrong.Having first disliked the game (never played MH before or heard of it) I got a friend to buy the game in April of 2019 and went on to no-life it with him for the next 3 months, I was hooked on it, and even that's an understatement. The game seemed like one of the best games I've ever played in my life (and I've played a lot of games, both ""difficult"" and casual). I could see it being praised by basically everyone, all the mainstream reviewers, even reviews on Steam were decent (obviously skipping the people mad at the game's horrible launch). Base MHW's endgame was *garbage*, I know it, you know it, we all know it. But at the time, I didn't think much of it, blinded by unreasonable adoration. There was one thing the base game was better at than the expansion, I'll get to it later though.As content for World ended and Iceborne was announced I was thrilled, absolutely thrilled. I mean, my ""favorite game"" was getting even more content! There wasn't anything not to like. When the betas came out for PS4 I tried them both and had mixed feelings, but still had an overall positive opinion of what was in them (Hoarfrost + Tigrex, at first I didn't like Velk much).Now, having been left in the dark in regards to Iceborne's PC release I needed to find something else to do, I wasn't much of a public multiplayer type of player and my friend that I previously no-lifed the game with got bored of it and uninstalled. With time my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to try the older games (all of them from Gen 2 to Gen 4, with a focus on 3U and 4U). Naturally, having started the game in generation five, filled with quality of life updates such as rolling backwards, mobile item usage etc. the older games left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.I was shocked, people played like this? Why would anyone defend this? Yet I kept playing them despite my, at the time, complaints. After some time something flipped in me, and I started appreciating these mechanics I used to question so much.Here is where ""base game was better at than the expansion"" part comes in. Something truly polarizing among the community, the ""Clutch Claw"".As I started Iceborne's story I immediately noticed the spike in difficulty, at first it was a bit overwhelming, but after that it was manageable. Something didn't seem right though - hunt times went on to be around 25-30 minutes, now obviously at first I thought ""well I'm in low tier MR equipment, it'll probably sort itself out later"", but no! At around later M2 or early M3 I started forcing myself to incorporate the claw to my style of play and voilà, hunt times went down to 15-20 at most. Now this left me in a very, very ambivalent mood. Was this good or bad? I couldn't really make up my mind at the time. Keep in mind I was a regular mantle user, kept up Temporal and Rocksteady as long as I could, usually putting them on before even engaging the monster (something I nowadays find as absolutely absurd, not just the act but mantles in general) up until I reached around MR100 and killed that god-awful Nergigante variant. Clutch Claw is the worst thing to come out of Generation 5 besides sieges and it needs to go. It ruins the flow of combat and is horribly implemented, being based on move hitboxes, creating absurdities like Kushala knocking you off its head when it does a paw swipe that doesn't even touch its head.Huge, huge improvement over base World's endgame, I mean *literally anything* would've been better than farming the same couple elder dragons over and over. I really like the system, but even that isn't without flaws. Having to level regions up and down just to get different materials is tedious at best, I get where it comes from - it's there to entice multiplayer among players but I refuse to accept it. It's great for MR levelling too, but let's be honest, it doesn't even matter in this game, as explained more in my next point:In the old games we had a lot more quests, sure we got investigations in exchange, which make farming rare parts easier than ever but this isn't the point here. I am absolutely appalled by the fact that a damn Black Dragon is doable right after Iceborne's Story, and something much, much easier (Ruiner Nergigante) is locked behind MR100, it just doesn't make sense, not in the slightest. I prefer the old way of gating certain quests (Elder Dragons and so on) behind MR thresholds (going by the example of Elder Dragons, it'd usually be MR35), however this doesn't always end up being the right direction to choose (see: locking some of the better fights in the game: Metal Raths/Brute Tigrex etc. behind MR70), I have to say the developers absolutely failed at pacing the game here, again: why is something as powerful as Furious Rajang or Raging Brachy accessible to people who just did  when they probably aren't even able to do it?Another disadvantage of the game's current pacing is that with new content updates and meta shifts, doing certain old monsters becomes absolutely useless, therefore shortening the gameplay loop.This is something I'll never accept. Having left MMOs for good after over 8 years of constant play, I wished to never ever return to mechanics I despised (as someone who always played a healer), mechanics such as: DPS checks and instant team wipes. Now, again as I've said in the beginning - I am NOT angry about Escaton Judgement, in fact I see it as a balanced attack that can be countered as long as you understand the mechanics, that doesn't mean I accept its presence in a game like Monster Hunter.Honestly despite my passionate hatred of what I and many call ""MMO mechanics"", I have even more hatred towards time-gating content, something that the brainiacs at Capcom thought was a good idea when developing World, previously all DLC quests were available upon downloading them and it was fantastic! You could play them whenever you wanted and removing that by creating ""festivals"" (renamed seasonal events that are [surprise!] also a MMO trait) was a horrible decision that is inexcusable.A classic feature of older Monster Hunter was putting together mixed sets, because armor actually mattered! This has been thrown into the dumpster in Monster Hunter World in exchange for RNG based decoration grinding, just great. You don't even need 90% of the armor in the game, cause so many skills come from decorations, this shouldn't have become the case and hopefully they get the memo in the sixth generation.We have way too many armor skills and are overall too powerful, it's like Capcom gave up on balancing in Iceborne. Why? No one knows. And don't try to say it's not true. Easiest examples to back this statement are: Aquashot Sticky Spam and Guard 5, 3x Shield Mod Spread HBG or hell even spamming ZSD on Switch Axe while clutched to a monster.The social aspect of Monster Hunter was also thrown into the dumpster, the SOS system is a HUGE step back from the old 4 player hubs and should also be reverted. No one sticks around after SOS flares, no one stays in the Gathering Hall expect when it's siege time (again, yuck). Why? Just why would they go for this approach?Overall, it's not like this game is bad, hell if you're only starting this franchise you'll probably love it like I did or maybe you won't, I don't really care. I have gone through many burn outs and many breaks, but eventually my nerves popped and I cannot recommend this game after all it's been through. It has lost a lot of its identity through westernization and hopefully the rest of the franchise doesn't end up this way."

I was incredibly wary of it given all the things I heard about grinding as I am generally very anti-grind. Despite these reservations, I just could not hold back and had to buy to the game. And I am so, so glad that I did. It has been an utterly superb experience. I've sunk almost 60 hours into it by the point of this review and I'm still jonesing for more. It is rare for me to be able to get 20-30 hours out of a game before I get bored. I've still got so much more content to go and I'm really excited to see it still.The gameplay is really fantastic. It is weird at first, especially the combat can seem clunky, but it really isn't once you start to figure it out and learn the ins and outs of fighting the monsters. It becomes second nature and just a great deal of fun. And with there being so many play styles due to the varied nature of weapons in the game, you've got a lot mileage with regards to finding a weapon style you'll like and also being able to just vary things up if you get bored with any specific weapon style. Outside of the weapons, there's so much you can do to use the environment to your benefit with fighting the monsters. There's just an impressive amount of interaction that lets you really control the flow of combat if you just take the time to study the world around you and use it.Visually, the game is stunning. The characters are amazing. I just cannot get over how good they look. The world itself is nice, colorful, and visually intriguing. There's a lot going on around you and it really lends a sense of a living, breathing world.The story is fairly barebones, but it is delivered well enough and it is charming in its own regard. I wouldn't go into this expecting some grandiose plot that will hook you. It just mainly serves to pull you into hunts. Despite that, it is just a very charming little world they've crafted here. I like the Monster Hunter world. It is almost comforting in some ways. I deal with a lot of depression and anxiety and the game helps to put my mind at ease when I can't do it on my own.Ultimately, I love this game and I think everyone should experience it. It is very much worth a shot!"

It's quite an action packed series and this game lives up to it for sure. You can expect big monsters, big weapons and quite the challenge. This game is the newest in the series and is getting a new dlc very soon. This dlc will add a bunch of things to the main game and from what I've seen on ps4, is really darn good. So there will probably a lot of you wondering if you should get into this series. And I'll tell you right away, that if you like action games and monsters. Then this is the game for you, but in world, the developers also added a whole world for you to explore. There are several maps where you can discover different ecosystems, from small creatures to the big ones you're actually fighting. This game keeps you excited throughout the game and made me scream in joy when beating some of the bosses. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to get into the series as well, this is probably the easiest game to get into from the series since it's more user friendly than the old games. Now I'll rate some aspects of the game.Graphics, the graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. (10/10)Story, I don't think the story is anything to brag about, it could've been a lot better. (7/10)Gameplay, there are tons of weapons to choose from and monsters to fight. (10/10)Maps, the maps in this game are quite complex and detailed but don't go expecting too many maps. (9/10)Music, the music in this game is really good, also the in-game sounds really work well to improve the overall experience of the game. (10/10)Bugs, haven't had any issues myself except for bad connection with friends a few times.Duration, the duration of the game really just depends on you. I got about 140 hours out of the base game, but some of my friends got way more (or way less.) Overall this is an easy 9/10 for me. Especially with the new dlc coming up, this game and the dlc will be 60$ together which is a really good price for what you're getting. There is one thing you should take note of however. You have to grind a lot, like a lot. These boss fights are really hard for the average person, I managed myself but if you're having trouble you'll have to grind to get new gear. But you shouldn't have to worry about grinding too much in the main story, however post-game you'll have to start doing some grinding.

Let's use the money from PC sales to make events exclusive to consoles.Capcom staff: FACEPALMSEDIT:Seems like a few fanyboys have misunderstood the context of my review.So to avoid any further misunderstandings let me explain why I've given it a DO NOT recommend.Firstly let me say that i am a big fan of the game and the series and it's not my first monster hunter game but i'm not going to ignore some of the issues I faced during my 300 hour playtime.If you played the game at launch then you will be familiar with the error code 50382-MW1. Want to play with a friend? sorry get disconnected.Want to help a someone through SOS?nope sorry MW1 incoming, want to play alone? guess what? it's your buddy 50382-MW1.Such a big issue should've been fixed within the first week itself but it took Capcom 3-4 weeks to patch this.This is the main reason why the game has lot of negetive reviews.That said,they HAVE FIXED the issue and there's no complaints on my side regarding server issues anymore. So if you're considerding not buying the game cause of server issues then let me tell you they HAVE BEEN resolved.On the same note you can ignore the reviews complainting about mouse issues as well.They HAVE also been RESOLVED.So if you like the base game(killing the sht out of monsters) and were on the fence of buying cause of these 2 issues.Then you can safely jump over the damn fence and get game already cause the issues have been resolved.So why did i give this game a thumbs down??Here are my reasons1.can't join quest until host has watched cutscene(WTF??)2.Horrible keyboard+mouse optimization.3.Graphics performance. It's looks worse than Witcher3 and yet does not run as well as the Witcher3 which was a 2015 game btw.4.Events and updates not included. There is no reason why they shouldn't have included all the patches of consoles in the PC version upon release.I don't believe that the developers should go without criticism when they take 7 months to ""optimize"" a game and yet release it with such glaring issues.If no one complainted about the servers then we probably wouldn't have got a patch in 3 weeks(which itself is a long time).Similary I believe if no one complaints about the events and additional content they are going to take longer than we hope to see new content being released.Once we start catching up to the consoles.I will change my review to recommended."

If you have friends to play with, it'll be even better as the co-op is a great experience here. PS: Some people might claim this game has generic MMO roles (tank/healer/dps) but that's a huge lie, the focus of the game is improving the hunting by hitting and not getting hit, these so called ""support builds"" only make the hunt take longer and it's suggested to be kicked as soon you see them (a real HH user will play monster's requiem while smashing its head instead of hiding on a corner so pay attention). Aside to that simple fact, play with whatever you want and have fun :^)"

You get to taste the meat of the game quickly, so it doesn't feel like you're just collecting trinkets until you get to have fun. After that, there's hundreds of hours of fun in getting better equipment, honing your skills and mastering your weapons, but even if you end up only playing 20 hours, I still think you'll leave the game satisfied.I would recommend getting some friends together, single player is more of an acquired taste. Also the story is very nothing, more of a hindrance than anything else."

There are a lot of problems going on. For example, the game takes up %100 of my GPU & CPU. That means I basically can not have anything else running in the background. Even music buffers. I have way higher then the ""minimal"" requirements they list here, and my game could hardly run on the lowest settings. Now if you only have a PC and really wanna play this, me and a few others did some research and found out a few things you can do to help with the problems their settings are having, that should last you until they actually fix it.You need to completely turn off all of the following settings:~V-Sync~Volume Rendering Quality~Anti-Aliasing~Z-PrepassYou also need to do the following:~Play in ""Borderless Window"" instead of full screen.~Set your Frame Rate to ""60"".When I found these fixes out, I was then able to play on the highest settings (minus the above obviously) and have things like music, Twitch, Discord, Pandora, or YouTube running in the background.Now the game itself is amazing. I have it for both PS4, and PC. Amazing graphics, amazing fighting, amazing armor, amazing hunting techniques, just... amazing. I very much recommend playing it."

The PC port would be passable if only it didn't take them 8 months to release a port and ""get it right"" and on top of that you cant get an online session going for more than an hour to save your life.As a bonus the PC release currently doesnt include any of the updates added to the console versions, I can understand their reasoning behind this (and their excuses) but just keep that in mind if you absolutely really want this because of the latest monster they added to the PS4 version or something, because it's not on PC yet (hopefully).I would love to but I cannot recommend a full price purchase of this game at this point in time, check back after (and if) they fix it.

599,Caramel Frappe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaramelFrappe/,9,,1,267.5,August,"21,",135,3,1,"Like most people, I haven't played Monster Hunter before. I've heard about the previous installment being good, but I couldn't be bothered to play it. Then Monster Hunter: World came out for the PC / consoles, and because I owned a PC, I figured why not try it? So after giving it a good 40+ hours and getting far into the game, I can safely say .... There's a lot to tackle in this review, so i'll try to narrow everything down to the best of my abilities.This game offers a lot, and I mean a LOT of variety when it comes to your weapons and armor. To start things off, the game allows you to pick  off the bat, each with their own trees. Like, it's one thing to have so many unique weapons, but each weapon having multiple trees based on the monsters you've harvested? Now that's awesome. There are so, so, so many different looking weapons and armors depending on the monsters you've hunted down and the materials you have collected. As the game goes on, you unlock an altnerative look to armors so now you have 2 choices or more among the monsters you've slain. Each weapon path causes it to change form, and the more you dive into that path, the more your weapon begins to change appearance. I can't even explain how many choices you have, it's enourmous.The world map is quite big, and each area can take you awhile to fully explore. Even then, there's other beasts and monsters roaming about, not just your target. Hunting down a monster can go on for a bit, tracking down it's footprints, gathering it's scales / feathers / ect. and finding out where it lives. Once you find it, all bets are off when the fight happens. It can go smooth or chaotic at any moment, and other monsters can intrude on your fight what's called a ""turf war"". Really fun to watch, and rather exciting. You can do multiple combos with your weapon to either weaken the monster, break apart it's armor plating, cut it's tail off, assist your allies by slowing it down, tank the hits with your shield- the capablitlies you're offered is again, impressive. So much thought was put into how to take down these monsters, hell they give you over 99 items to use, all with a useful purpose in helping you take these baddies down. Oh and you don't have to always kill them, capturing them can not only help you understand their weaknesses, but you gain more loot as a result.I'm happy to say, there's a lot of them. Each unique, stands out, and will definitely take time fighting. Even though some monsters look 'identical', they will have different animations or have abilities that are different from their counter part. You can read up on how they behave, see how they interact with the world around them, even watch some monsters eating other monsters. The beauty of this game is, you really feel like you're hunting a beast, not a demonic force that's over the top. It's just an animal that's wild, and you're putting your skills as a Hunter to the test. I love the way each enemy has a particular weakness and how they act when on the verge of death (they limp away, cry, try to fly away or do things that feels immersive). Gotta hand it, there's way more monsters than I imagined there to be, and it made me satisfied.A few big issues revolve mostly around online co-op. Day 1 was really bad, people dropping from servers constantly while during mid fight, people would disconnect. While patches have made the game's servers more stable, I sometimes run into this problem. Another issue that irritates me, is that you must see particular cut scenes to co-op with people. You can't just start a mission, you must activate a cutscene before you join / play with someone. Only people who have seen it all can join anyone's server, but if you haven't seen a particular cut scene, you can't have co-op until you've seen it. Then there's the fact you have zero reason to make another character. Because you have access to all the weapons / paths / armors / ect, you have no reason to try making another character and because you CAN'T skip cutscenes, it would be a huge pain to watch them all over again. So it's best to stick with one character. Another problem is certain bosses can one shot you, even if you're blocking or dodging. The hit boxes aren't always great so you will find yourself getting ripped off at times. The difficult curve can spike depending on the bosse's combos and how well equipped you are.My review is pretty vague and I didn't get to cover everything I wanted. But, there's so much to do in this game. Gathering materials, helping your base research species to improve your armor / gear, seeing how beautiful the world is, astounishing fights and epic fights all about, even the grinding is fun because you're hunting down Monsters without the game ever feeling dull. I haven't gotten bored or tired once, so that's something. Character creation is alright, and the lip syncing is meh since it's a Japanese game translated / subbed into English, but if you can look past that- it's no big deal. Monster Hunter: World has a lot going for it, and I love this game. I will continue playing it because each bounty / mission gives you a lot to do, and co-op just makes it all the more alive. Game is a solid 8.5 / 10 for me, 8 sometimes when the game's server gives me a hard time. But it's worth buying."

Lots and lots of improvements have been made on a lot of fronts that I have noticed in my 100+ hours.  There is a lot of quality-of-life stuff added here that just hasn't been a part of any other installment prior --- but don't let that trick you.  There is a rabbithole of complex things for a newcomer to navigate.You no longer have to load between zones.You no longer lose money when you faint.You no longer have to build whetstones (am I remembering this right?).  Crucial items seem more plentiful.Farming the same monster over and over again is not as necessary as before.New Hammer spin attack is great.  New environmental ""wall run"" areas are great.Farcaster is nearly unnecessary since you can just quick travel back to camp (as long as you aren't under attack).You can eat once out in the field.You can resupply once out in the field.Elemental resistances for meals have been lumped into 1 category (less meal variety needed).Cat gadgets are seemingly much more helpful and interesting.You can upgrade and forge equipment while others are able to ready up for a mission.Animations are true to older monsters revisiting.  You'll know what to do when you see that Rathalos about to do some signature moves.The game looks incredible.The new locations are more fantastical.Optional Quests sometimes give really useful stuff.Health boosts and attack boosts stack with food.You can cultivate things you have zero of.There are plenty of missions to drop in on if you have no friends available at the time.I've seen 3 monsters in one location before with 4 players simultaneous and it was great chaos.The new chef is amazing.Of course, I have my gripes, too, but they're small and I forget I even have them.  Learning how the lobby and flow work is awkward.  There is very little reason to go to the gathering hub, which used to be the only way for someone to connect.  The early game is more annoying than late because you and your friends have to be caught up on cinematics to do the main progression.  Once you have a number of those missions under your belt and it isn't so pressing you can do a lot of investigations and optionals, though.  I really dislike that there's no bell sound when someone else posts a quest.  It used to be very helpful. If you're going to post a quest and someone else posts a quest, you won't know until you back out of that menu.  Mounting seems to have been made much harder after the first mount, which sort of nullifies the Insect Glaive to a degree.  Monsters resist certain statuses exponentially each time a new player is added - if you want to use a hammer it is absolutely required to place Slugger (x3) in your gear if you are wanting to KO the monster more than once per fight.  In my 100+ hours I have only gotten 1 attack gem, and haven't seen a single Tenderizer or a few others I have been farming for.  Those gems basically feel like they were removed from the game they are so amazingly rare.Unskippable cutscenes are a real drag - especially if you want to make a 2nd hunter.Kirin seems a lot more annoyingly tuned than the original Kirin, and is incredibly chumped by ranged.  Kirin just feels kind of in a bad state.  Thankfully I only have to fight it at key points.  And the damn Bazel.  Bazel has shown up in 99% of my missions for the last couple days no matter what area I've gone to.  That just seems excessive and takes away the allure.The majority of my run has been great, and the patch has fixed 100% of my connection issues.Bring back Zamtrios.  Bring back Zinogre!

Little did I know at the time, that I would gradually get hooked.At first I felt overwhelmed, because not only is this my first time getting into the series, there is a lot to learn as the start of the game throws a lot of information at you. Of course it's not all intruding, so you can play the game at your own pace. The learning curve is quite huge (especially for new players to the series), sooner or later you'll probably realise that there just isn't enough explanations for everything and one may find themself looking up guides and videos frequently. There are plenty of weapons to choose from (14 in fact) and they all have their own unique combat style/techniques. Monster variety for you to slay/capture is also plentiful, so you'll always have something to pick a fight with. Playing the game solo is pretty fun, but I think battling monsters with other people brings out a lot more excitement, so if you have friends, do invite them to tag along! is a great game, especially if you enjoy JRPGs and 4 player co-ops. And if you do, in due time, you will find yourself logging dozens if not hundreds of hours into this wonderful piece of work."

If you're a true monster hunter then you've been playing this game on a psp/3ds/wii u without proper 60 fps or such options for years now. People seem to forget that this is a 'MAJOR' upgraded version of the oldies and yet people are still complaining like no tomorrow. Heck, the reviews were freaking bashing the game left to right lcimaing many things out there about low fps and not working on GTX1080 while most likely not even touching the option menu to focus on the graphics options. Shame on you all!The only thing I'm not really happy with is the constant disconnects with the multiplayer but when I was playing the PS4 version I had that as well. I mean, ya'll have that with any newly released games so I don't see why you never said anything about that for the other AAA games for those times either. If you really like the MHW series and you got a PC, this is a game you shouldn't miss out on."

The massive amounts of tutorials and ""tell, don't show"" can get very overwhelming. Many times in the start, I wanted the game to show me what to do, instead of just telling me. That way you'd learn faster. Learn by doing, after all. However, when you get through most of the tutorial (The story, really), you're greeted with a world where you've unlocked most things and you're free to to everything you want, and it's magnificent. After the story is where the game really shines. Harder versions (Tempered/Arch tempered) of monsters unlock, from which you get better rewards, to get better gear, to kill even harder monsters even faster. The grind/farmfest in this game is real, but it's done in such a wonderfully rewarding way. Killing big monsters with your oversized anime swords or other ridiculous weapons feels good. Hitting the monster on its feet until it dies has never been more exciting.From a gameplay perspective, the game is amazing, and it's the most fun I've had with video games in years.From a technical perspective, the game is a mess. The optimization is nonexistent. I get my 60 frames just fine, and my specs aren't the best, And just forget playing this on anything but Windows 10. They've clearly not done anything at all to optimize this game for other OS, as my friend went from 40 FPS and stutters to flawless 60 FPS after upgrading.The mouse controls like an emulated joystick, the keyboard controls for ranged weapons are.. Questionable, and the multiplayer errors are frustrating to say the last.But through all this garbage lies a fantastic game that you will kick yourself for not trying. They're working on the mouse controls, the keyboard controls can be rebound, the multiplayer got a patch just yesterday, and they're gonna keep fixing it. It's much better now than it was. Not perfect, mind you, but way, way better.Overall, the game is amazingly fun, and you'll do yourself a favor by trying it out. Don't let the reviewbombing scare you off, as the main issue has been fixed.Also you can dress up your cat and it's the best thing about this game.***EDIT:  fps drops has been fixed since I posted this review."

If you're looking for a challenging and exciting hunting experience with a variety of unique monsters to track and take down, then this is the game for you. The maps are beautifully crafted with a refreshing variety, from lush jungles to creepy monster graveyards, and you can even catch and keep all sorts of creatures as pets. The graphics are stunning, making this the best-looking Monster Hunter game yet, and the combat is well-balanced, making it accessible to players of all skill levels.However, if you're looking for a co-op game or a lot of new and different monsters to hunt, then you might be disappointed. The multiplayer aspect of the game is lacking, and it feels like you're fighting the same monster over and over again with only slight variations. The story also feels weak and outdated, and the need to constantly eat to boost your character can be a nuisance.In conclusion, Monster Hunter World is a great game for fans of the series and for those who enjoy hunting challenges.

Not too many microtransactions, not pay to win, just a good looter with fun combat. People like it, others have their complaints. The monster roster was lacking, it was too well optimized, the endgame was too rng, there should be more layered armor, were some of the biggest. Well, and expansion is announced, people were hyped (I sure was). There really isn’t a good notion around the term expansion, with tons being released with very little content, and not actually expanding on the game. Well these devs went all out. They 100% have been listening to the community from the beginning. They added more monster variety, improved the endgame, slowly but surely, made every single piece of armor and every weapon a layerable piece, and basically doubled the size of the game for only $40. It wasn’t too optimized at release, but it surely improved and the rng decorations still existed, but it doesn’t seem as tedious, at least to me. I think this game’s biggest strength, besides being fun, especially with friends, is the amazing dev team. Listening to the community and genuinely providing the player with meaningful content. In today's gaming industry I do believe this to be diamond in the rough. If you like looters, making builds, fun melee and gun combat, rpgs, or just want to pick up a game to play with your friends, I do believe this to be a good purchase. With 100s and even 1000s of hours of fun, there is no mistake to be made. While getting into it at first can look daunting, once you get into the flow, trust me it gets good. I do recommend you play this with someone who has played before or watch a couple videos on the game because unless you like reading the little tutorials, it's gonna be a minute before you truly understand the game.  If you want to just get a taste, you can’t really go wrong with just buying the base game. If you think you are gonna like or really want to get invested, you should buy the master edition, which includes the base game and the expansion. All the other versions you can ignore unless you want some small cosmetic items. You sadly are not able to skip story cutscenes, which makes playing this game throught with friends pretty hard. Another issue is the often occurring disconnections. There are some fixes and how often you disconnect seems to be linked to your processor and how far you are from the host of the online session because this game is peer-2-peer. Besides this, there are minor issues, but nothing that really bothers me personally, just know that this game does get a little hard later, be ready.  Yes, just look at my hours."

645,Mysfyt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mysfyt/,6,,1,607.9,September,"8,",778,0,1,"Hello, World! Having played this on both PS4 and now PC (and having put hundreds of hours into the portable games), I have been very pleased with the quality of this console port... with a few footnotes. The first few weeks were chock full of connection errors that made it difficult-to-impossible to play with others. Capcom pretty quickly acknowledged the problem, and it took a little time for them to fix it, but fix it they did. Although this game is completely soloable, playing with friends is hands-down some of the most fun gaming I've ever had. I realize that, as with any big PC release, there have been a wide range of experiences with actual performance. For me (with my newish CPU and oldish video card), it runs wonderfully, never straying from a rock-solid 60fps. The only change I made was to drop fog down a notch or two, which (subjectively) looks a lot better anyway unless you like a LOT of fog.This is a game designed around controller play, and I'm finding my experience with a Steam Controller to be excellent. Gyro toggle on left trigger soft pull makes kinsect/bow/bowgun aiming SO nice and fluid. Mouse-like joystick for the right touchpad feels very smooth and natural. Keyboard controls, on the other hand, are... well, they're bad. The mouse emulation feels so ""wrong"" that I cannot play it more than a few minutes without getting severley nauseated. I hope for KB/M loyalists that Capcom improves this soon.As for the game itself... well, if you've played any Monster Hunter games, you (mostly) know what you're getting into. World doesn't have the breadth of content of the portable games (yet), but I feel its quality-of-life upgrades, and the whole ""World"" bit (living zones full of endemic life and environmental tools/hazards), more than make up for this. If you have never played a MH game, I'm not sure how to explain it with any brevity because this franchise is really quite unlike anything else out there except for that new kid on the block, Dauntless, which definitely takes queues from MH but feels so shallow in comparison. My gripes are relatively minor and mostly aimed at the questionable design decisions Capcom sometimes makes. The Gathering Hub is a nice place to prep with your group, but since it doesn't have access to all facilities, I hardly ever go there. Session IDs feel like a kludgey way to handle private groups. Steam Group integration is completely pointless right now.I personally feel like Capcom did an amazing job making a modernized, full-sized version of this long-running, mostly portable franchise. It's far from being just an upscaled copy of the earlier games, too. They obviously put a lot of thought and effort into making a game with potential for mass appeal that still feels very true to the franchise. It WILL NOT be for everybody, though. Monster hunter games are very challenging and take some dedication, but when things start to click, it's a uniquely satisfying gaming experience, especially when you can play with friends."

It feels like I can actually play the game without dropping to 5fps everytime, It's like jesus blessed my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for once in my lifetime, but I won't make a biased as ♥♥♥♥ review because I played this game like a console pleb.First things first, when i saw the port at first I thought I was playing Umbrella Corps. It's a bad port, especially if we wait for 8 months to get a proper PC release and it feels like they pulled this port from their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. This causes literally everyone that doesn't have a Titan X SLI + Intel i9 Extreme edition to literally get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by changing every single setting until you have a proper smooth fps experience and good graphics. Which is in my opinion unacceptable. It just shows how lazy Capcom is and how much they obviously care about their players and upholding the name of an extremely popular Nintendo franchise. All the issues I have with this game is just mainly lazy optimization and a literal copy of the Umbrella Corps Port that Capcom made. The game itself however is amazing, I played it on console like I said before and it has been enjoyable as hell. And for me playing this game finally at a smooth framerate is like heaven to me. It is enjoyable and the hunting is really fun. I really can't wait for Nergigante to spread my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wide open and just penetrate me with his T H I C C horns. The diversity in weapons gives every type of player a chance to enjoy hunting some big plebs. The storyline is.... well lame af tbh, I don't give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about the story really. Is the game good? Yes Is the game well optimized and has a good port? Lol no. The decision is up to you whether you buy this game or not (although 60 dosh for a crappy port and optimization is kinda a huge meh factor right there) If you are someone that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about every port and optimization and that 100-120 fps is not enough for you then don't bother with this game, If you are someone that just wants to play a game where a Nergigante literally assrapes you then be my guest.

With the live service portion of this game's lifespan essentially over, I can confidently say that MHW is one of the greatest gaming experiences I have ever had the pleasure of having. While the story and characters are fairly bare bones, the actual monsters in this game completely make up for that lack of personality and then some. Complex move sets and masterfully composed theme music make each the monsters feel unique, wild, and alive, making subsequent hunts even more entertaining against more challenging or even aesthetically pleasing monsters, depending on one's taste. On top of that, there are 14 weapons types in this game, all with unique niches and move sets. Mastering your favorite weapons' mechanics, as well as understanding the myriad of ways in which those mechanics can interact with all of the monsters, is consistently challenging and rewarding as the game's difficulty naturally increases over time. The only criticism I can offer is that this game is not one you can take lightly or dip your toes in from time to time so to speak. It requires some dedication and desire to learn, but it will absolutely make the time worth it.TL;DR:If you have the time to dedicate to this game, I can not recommend it enough for the amount of fun and satisfaction this Monster Hunter offers.

650,Pirate☠️Pocah,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pocahawtness/,5,,1,"1,095.5",August,"10,","1,002",0,1,"Monster Hunter is a PVE team hunting game. A number of players set out to track, kill or capture, and  use the rewards to make new gear.One thing that is very unusual with the game is that it's open-ended. Albeit the main quests have a definite end, there is no real end to the game. It just keeps going, which is very unusual indeed. Ok let's deal with the bad...1. The control system is horrible. Basically they haven't changed anything from the console, so you get ridiculous skill menus, and just insane key sequences using as few keys as possible rather than making full use of the PC keyboard.  And everything is just plain stupid.  There is no logic in the control structure so <esc>, for example, can mean different things at different times. Not only is this very confusing but it can also end up in you getting lost in menus where you have to stop and read the screen to get out, rather than just hit <esc> a few times like in other games. 2. Optimisation? There isn't any of that in here! It sure do run slowly. I have a pretty good PC yet I don't think I have seen it hit walking pace yet, let alone running. With a 1440 screen you really need a top-end graphics card.3. Gear is confused. Even after hundreds of hours of play I still don't understand what philosophy has been adopted by the developers towards gear. Often new gear becomes available but there is no clear reason why you would want it. Gear just has too many attributes that have been seemingly randomly applied. Often you find that items have one or two strengths but a large number of other attributes that are all over the place, and that makes choosing very difficult. For example, bowguns have many different ammo types and each ammo type  has different fire rate, recoil, magazine size, reload time. All these values are different for each different gun. To make matters worse each gun supports a different list of ammo types. Not only that but all these attributes can be modified, but the degree to which they can be modified is different  for each gun. This makes for a bewilderingly complex system. There should really cut down on the complexity by limiting the variation. Each gun should have a set of basic attributes which are added to by specialist guns rather than varying everything all over the place without purpose. 4. The character feels sluggish and cumbersome, especially playing solo. Most of the time you are fighting the game not the monster. This is not even slightly a PC game. It is a console game. The port is atrocious. They have completely failed to take advantage of the  PC. That's fine if you like console games but I hate them so this review is doomed from the start!  Having said that, it is still a good game.  If you are a console player then yes, sure, buy it, but this isn't a review for consoles and I am afraid on the PC, Monster Hunter disappoints.The good thing about this game is that it's insanely fun and addictive! Why? I really don't know. It just is.  It's a very unique game, that undoubtedly has a lot going for it. For a non-mmo it has a lot of gameplay for the money, and it sure is very addictive. It also seems to be well balanced in that it's not too hard nor is it too easy. Honestly, I am on the fence here as to whether to give it a thumbs up or thumbs down. I think I have to give it a thumbs up, but for many people it will undoubtedly be a thumbs down. I wish I could give it ""Mixed""."

Year after year, i had to suffer through not absorbing hundreds of videos, news articles and guides giving this game high praise and showcasing many of it's features to instead go into it blind in order to write the most neutral review possible as someone whose completely unfamiliar with the monster hunter world universe as a whole - AND someone who haven't had any of it be spoiled.Unfortunately after nearly a year of delay, this game has now arrived on the PC in the most atrocious, technological train-wreck of a broken state I've seen for a game in the last 5 years.. And that's saying a lot since I'm active on Steam. To not make the incoming wall of text be too much of a discouragement, I'm gonna segment and number my current gripes with this game below.To put it bluntly, this game needs another 1-2 years of polish and development before it's anywhere near ready for the PC market. The servers/connectivity system is as of right now (still ongoing since release) a complete, spam-disconnecting clusterf*ck which you've probably noticed if you had even a single friend play this game as they will be CONSTANTLY disconnected and then immediately reconnected, over and over and over and over again. This was a reported issue on the PS4 but has since then been patched.. Meaning, the PC version is literally an outdated pile of cràp. To prove it, here's a picture of a chat-window after 30 minutes of me playing this:Unfortunately, the technicalities doesn't end there. Ontop of being dysfunctional, the game also completely lacks even the most basic (and arguably most important) options, such as being able to disable mouse acceleration (currently a boot-legged autoaim clunky console garbage system) while most graphic-options simply aren't even working right now, like snazzier textures refusing to load or, hilariously enough, people being completely unable to change keybinds on their controllers despite this being a console port with console controller buttons being littered across most menus & the UI for extra salt in the wound.Perhaps the worst part of anything is the fact that, and I shìt you not now:YOU CANNOT CO-OP THE MAIN STORY QUEST due to whoever's joining getting this rètarded message:REMOVE. IT. NOW.You may or may not be aware of this already but this game is infested with a particularly dogshìt ""Digital Rights Management"" software called Denuvo. It is a piece of DRM that has been bought for an excess of 100.000€+ from the game's budget (that could have been spent on sorely needed polish) that the game developers then had to spend tons of time, energy, effort and manpower to integrate it into their game. Much like a tick, Denuvo requires itself to be injected into and around another DRM in order to try and protect it for 'slightly' longer while also requiring an equal amount of time and effort to removed later.. If ever.All worth it to keep those naughty pirates at bay though, right?.. Well..This is a displacement study commissioned by the European Union for 360,000€ that statistically shows (and proves) that Online Piracy (video games included) have no negative affect on sales.. If anything, they have a positive effect on them through word-of-mouth and free advertising. Meaning: DRM has been proven now, almost a year ago to be pieces of completely unnecessary shìt that does nothing but punish the paying customers through decreased performance, inconvenience, breach of privacy, increased download & install times and more. When DRM's like Denuvo was first coined, they were spewing out mounds of garbage like, and I quote: ""OH SHÌT VIDEO GAME INDUSTRY, LIKE 95% OF PEOPLE USING UR PRODUCTS ARE PIRATES, YO!!! BUY AND INSTALL OUR DRM!!!!"" with no studies, research or scientific bases whatsoever.Denuvo's release was 4 years ago and since then, gullible producers (and developers) like CAPCOM continue to gobble these lies up head to toe and regurgitating it back out for another eating on a daily basis and today, we are still suffering through this shìt for no excusable reason whatsoever and their greedy behavior only seems to be getting worse that they are now also selling day-1-DLC for a full-priced, console ported game. This shìt has to stop.For more info on Denuvo, visit: To put it bluntly many pure design systems in this game like the online portion for this game are shìt-caked, putrid, convoluted f*cking piles of garbage and they don't have to be. Here's a sub-list of some pet peeves I've currently got with the game.a) Online sucks through and through. Restructure it ASAP.b) The control scheme is REALLY confusing and convoluted. 3-4 buttons for sheating a weapon, what the actual f*ck?c) Wheatstones for... Sharpening hammers, that are literal huge round chunks of iron or bone. Get off the bottle, CAPCOM or more preferrably, remove the stupid concept of weapon durability alltogether or replace it whereas you can sharpen weapons to do more damage instead of having 95% of their efficiency flat-line in a game that's already riddled with ginormous HP pool mobs.d) Hitboxes can be 'REALLY' lynchy depending on the monsters you're going up against with X/Y weapons.. And this is coming from someone who poured hundreds of hours into Dragon's Dogma & Dark Souls.e) Currently, the character creator lets you make things like this:  and while hilarious for some, it smashes the immersion for others.f) Despite me having all the options to the lowest possible and my specs being in-line, this game inexplicitly tends to freeze up for 2-4 seconds randomly (even in SP, probably work of Denuvo) while also randomly making my GPU run incredibly hot for no reason.g) The lock-on system REALLY sucks a big one once there's more than 1 monster on the screen as it will begin to wildly fling in-between everything it can get it's crosshair on from the smallest of twitches.h) Forced motion blur? Are you f*cking kidding me right now, CAPCOM?i) Monsters (especially flying ones) simply leaving the locale mid-fight and otherwise. What kind of cocaine addicted, head-bashed developer pitched this at a meeting and everyone said: ""Hmm.. Someone fighting a monster for 30+ minutes and then having said monster leave mid-fight with no loot and rewards to speak of in the exploration mode that advertises a 'Take your time' mindset?.. Put it in!""j) Lack on cause & effect when breaking monster parts. If i spend an exhorbent amount of effort, grit, time, weapon durability and general pain & suffering to break a specific part of a monster, say, wing(s) or leg(s), the last thing I want is for said monster to use that broken bodypart like nothing has happened to it. STOP (or SEVERELY cripple) A LIMB'S FUNCTION IF IT'S BROKEN. Don't leave it as some incredibly shìtty, low-effort whack-a-mole stun spot.k) Multiplayer scaling is completely defunct. If someone joins your game (or you join someone else) and either one of you gets disconnected and put into separate matches, the monster scaling will stay the same as if it was for example, a 4 player game, giving mobs basically 600% health permanently. Limb/tail breaking is also made borderline impossible which means that if you need a tail or X part from a creature, you're basically forced to do it in SP.I could go on, but Steam needs to buy my day-1 review DLC first while i splooge this out way too early."

660,Lord Gremory,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198160234595/,7,,1,603.4,October,"14,",69,0,1,"I've been a huge fan of Monster Hunter thanks to Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Freedom 3 from the PSP. I played nearly 400 hours Freedom Unite and I honestly loved its difficulty and hardcore feeling to it as well as its huge number of monsters, maps and weapons from the previous titles and new ones and the addition of the G rank... it was a blast! let me tell you.Since then I've been trying to get my hands on a Monster Hunter title but couldn't decide until I saw this as the perfect chance to revisit the franchise. Now the big question is , did it live up to its expectations? Well, yeah.. but I can't wait for more!Environments in this title are probably its strongest point, each map really gives you this sense of immersion to it thanks to the different ambiental sounds and different little kinds of animal and fauna that mimic and portray nature to a higher level than previous titles, even though Monster Hunter games have always been famous for making the most out of the platform that they are released on. It's a shame that we only have 6 maps to enjoy though, being my favourite the ancient forest.Speaking of weapons, I love that they included all different types of weapons this time around but I could've hoped for a better and wider weapon design, weapons feel the same from each other more in this title than any other and there are really not that many. On the other hand, combat is awesome and feels fluid and great, which is something really important considering we are in for some hunt.Monsters in this title feel real and physics are fine, (as much as you could hope for a pretty old engine). They brought back to the series main important monsters like Rathalos and Diablos and Elders like Kushala and Teostra and added new ones too, they also interact with each other which feels as a nice addition. Despite monster´s improved AI, I can't help but feel that they wasted the chance to present us the new generation of monsters in a bigger way, with a wider arange of new additions, and that feels a little bit lackluster I'm not gonna lie, I really was hoping for much more original monsters.Quests are fine in this title and they add new events from time to time but Astera (the village) could've had a better farm and much more new things, it feels that there are not much things to do in Astera.The difficuly in this title is average, it's not hardcore like previous Monster Hunters, you can play and end this game without having too many problems and the hardcore content this time around is fighting the same monsters in its strong form (tempered) which doesn´t feel all that hard to be honest. In Monster Hunter Freedom Unite you had to struggle just to get resources and Monsters really felt tanky and strong, you could fail missions because the monster didn´t die. This time around, all monsters die within 10-20 minutes, even tempered ones, and you won´t have trouble farming for materials.Summing up, Monster Hunter World is a great title that will give you around 70 hours of fun just for completing its many different quests, (some are occult and will give you new equipment). The end game is basically fighting the same monsters in its strongest form (tempered), which gives you gems that you can use for further upgrading your equipment if you wish. If you have friends to play with, the game gets even more fun and don't you think that this title is bad because of its negative reviews since they are mostly from network issues in its first couple of weeks which are solved now.I can't end this review without thinking this title definitely had potential to be bigger, Capcom didn't go all out, but after seeing that the title did great on sells I hope the next one has more of everything: more maps, more weapons, G rank (more difficulty please, I know you want to aim for all people but the difficulty is the main charm of Monster Hunter games), better village, more quests and more duration. This title could've been a 9 out of 10 but stays at an 8 for its lack of content compared to previous titles (8.5 if you dont compare it with other MH games). It´s still 70 hours of fun and an experience that you won't regret.. but this is Monster Hunter, we are talking about high end game content titles.UPDATE// Kulve Taroth mission is a nice and original siege of 16 people on separate groups of 4 in the same session, which is brilliant since it makes you join a session with other players and have some fun together. It also adds quite a few weapons just like deviljho and lunastra, which were monsters added later for free.Behemoth is a TRUE challenge and I´m really looking forward to G rank. Keep it up Capcom!"

They hold your hand a little bit by giving you a high grade beginners armour but overall if you're new and have friends that play already or you just want to get into the multiplayer a little quicker it's a big help. The game offers a lot of free content at the start, old event content and care packs you can download are great. The multiplayer isn't dead and I think even after Rise releases there will be people still playing this. I know I will. This is one of them games where it can be fun with or without friends, I haven't met a player in MH world that was mean or tried to ruin a hunt. Maybe i've been insanely lucky to not meet those people in 197 hours of playing, who knows.I honestly think that the Iceborne DLC is required because it adds some great quality of life improvements to combat (clutch claw, extra combat moves) that the game needed. I think that would be my only criticism of the game overall, that the DLC is needed for you to really open up the late game enjoyment.The other cosmetic DLC isn't required at all to enjoy the game, unless you want to change the handlers appearance. Even then the Handlers appearance changes depending on which seasonal event is happening so you never need them.All in all Capcom did right with the game, they recently removed the copy protection bloatware completely, all the event missions are live at all times so you don't have to wait to hunt specific late game monsters, they give you a lot of free stuff at the start to help you out. Good work Capcom. This game shows that FOMO isn't needed to keep a player base active."
664,Badguy292,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Badguy292/,7,,1,324.8,February,"5,",614,0,1,"This game is one of the best adventure games I've played in a long time, you hunt Monsters that are very reminiscent of Dinosaurs and Dragons of ages ago, with huge swords, axes, spears, guns, cannons and bows. The New World has so much to offer.Gameplay is broader than you'd first expect if you've never played a Monster Hunter game before, I only played a bit of Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii prior to this, but this game captivated me so much more as the world feels more alive and I can play with my friends.Your main hub is Astera, a nice little village assembled from wreckages of ships from the Hunter fleets, here you Craft, Buy and Upgrade equipment and take Bounties and Quests before going out into the wild.Gameplay in the wild is comprised of Hunting Monsters, Dead or Alive. The Skill, Speed and Technique needed for this, depends on the kind of weapon you select, I advice testing most of them out before settling on one. Don't disregard the Hunting Horn though! I use the Kinsect Glaive and Dual Blades myself, as I like fast paced Hack & Slash gameplay. The Hunting Horn is an underestimated support weapon though it requires some tweaking to use solo, but it's more fun to play with friends either way~Other than that, there's Gathering and Exploration you can do in the wild, mining materials for armor and weapons, gathering plants for potions and buffs and even find new camp locations so you can pick different spawn locations when on a Hunt! The game is well optimized and run at a smooth +45 FPS (Not much, but good enough for me.) on my old 2GB GTX 750 Ti that's like... 8 years old by now or something. Overall, I highly recommend this game."

668,✩☠✩KING✩☠✩,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlxEllis/,8,,1,90.9,September,"15,","2,618",5,1,"Monster Hunter on PC AT LAST!First off my specs: GTX 1070, i7 6700K and 16GB of ram (For reference)So how is it? well it's pretty good actually! but it's not perfect, no sir!. For starters, the fps in this game can TANK from a stable 80 to 20 or under in some scenes (certain monster attacks that spray particles or extreme bright light are when this normally happens) also TURN THAT FANCY LIGHTING OFF, it will grant you around 15-20 frames more ensuring you stay in the 60s most of the time. The only reason I make an issue out of this is while the graphics are good, they aren't good enough to warrant the frame drops (as I mentioned in my 7 Days to Die review)Now, moving on to disconnections, for me personally I rarely got disconnected, but when I did it was FRUSTRATING as all hell, the simple reason is, if you are in a team of 4 people hunting a monster and you get disconnected, you are left ALONE to hunt the monster, BUT you are fighting a monster that has had the difficulty scaled to 4 players...by yourself, for the same rewards, which can be a serious pain. My controller ALSO did not work when I first tried this game, but restarting my PC fixed it.Other than those gripes? it's a DAMN good game, If you've played a MH game before you'll be familiar with how things work, pick one of the many weapons, practice with it, choose which one suits you, kill monsters, upgrade weapon, repeat. However MH: World has some quality of life changes mainly being able to ""track"" monsters, saving you from running around the map like an idiot searching for them like in the earlier games, this makes hunts alot less tedious and allows you to get the job done with far less faffing around.The crafting system in MH: World seems daunting at first but it's really simple and there are SO many things to craft so GRAB EVERYTHING YOU SEE!. There are many guides online to help you get started in this game which can seriously help give you a less rocky start, so get googling/youtubing guys!Overall I LOVED Monster Hunter: World, ESPECIALLY the music, it is simply amazing! I like the Tzitsi Ya Ku and Arena battle music the most. The online is also awesome, providing you don't get stuck with a team of imbeciles it's pretty enjoyable as a team game, and multiplayer is a big part of this game, plus you get your own individual LOOT so no fighting over materials. Another thing I liked was I kept thinking I would grow tired and bored of the constant repetitive quests, gathering etc but I didn't, I still loved every minute of it hour after hour, this game is VERY addicting.Technical issues aside, I definitely recommend Monster Hunter: World, but I also advise you do some research into it, this game is NOT for everyone and the 2 hour limit for refunds really isn't enough to get to the meat of this game, so be ABSOLUTELY sure you're gonna like it before dropping £50 on it!. However, if you DO end up liking it? KISS YOUR SOCIAL LIFE GOODBYE, the only social life you'll have from now on is joining multiplayer hunting sessions.But seriously...social life is overrated...Monster Hunter: World however...IS NOT!"

And having a lesser product on PC after waiting half a year is outrageous for the price. And the worst part was the incredibly bad netcode, with constant errors and random connection failures. Add the random bugs / bad keyboard controls and you can't really recommend the PC port as something positive (even if the game is amazing and you enjoy it as i do)FYI Also double check DLC issues before buying it"

This is just me writing a review with my current thoughts and opinions for this game. I love this game! And as much as I want to recommend it to someone, it isn't a game for everybody. So I guess I'll start with my pros and cons? Monster Hunter always had a variety of weapon choices and each one of them has their own unique playstyles. When I get bored of one weapon, I would spice it up by using another. The game has great graphics and most importantly multiplayer! Even if multiplayer isn't a big selling point for you, single player can still be fun and challenging. You can always try to beat your best time/record by learning the monster or ""cheesing"" it. Comparing Monster Hunter World(MHW) to other monster hunter games, MHW has so much quality of life. For me this is a game changer because everything is so easy to organize/manage.Now then to what I don't like! Its really hard to play multiplayer as a new player. I think this is my biggest turn off starting the game. I would be unable to play multiplayer if I have not seen the ""cutscene"". The storyline of MHW feels like a tutorial than a story and it honestly sucks. Once you completed the story, its a grind fest.(I enjoy this but others may not) You grind to power up yourself so you can kill monsters easier is the gist of it? This game is also easier compared to the other monster hunter games and I think its because they are targeting a new player base. MHW does have plenty of mods that can step up its quality of game. If you like to be a fashion hunter, there are mods that makes you look super spicy! With that being said this is just a summary of my summary. I hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I do! Happy Hunting!"

Yes, the original reveal was terrible and gave the impression of some completely different game, merely wearing the skin of a monhun game. Yes, you can run while chugging potions and won't flex at the end. Yes, mantles are an absolute crutch.All of that rubs me off in a bad way. I certainly don't agree with some of the weapons changes, either.However, this is finally a monhun game officially on PC! No emulation! By GOD have I waited for this day where I wouldn't need to claw grip a PSP or... whatever you could call the way I held my 3DS for monhun.Just keep in mind that as a PC player you'll be rated as a second-class citizen by Capcom. No content arrives together or close to consoles on PC. Even though the PC version is currently paired to console in content and has a larger playerbase than Xbox, consoles will receive the shiny new expansion with all the goodies like monsters, areas and G-rank this September, while PC is merely slated for ""winter"", which could very well mean not even this year. Do take that with a grain of salt however, as that might change over time since both PC releases of REmake 2 and DMC5 released on the same day as consoles since the MHW PC release.All in all, Monster Hunter World is a great game and certainly deserves to be bought at full-price.I also highly recommend using something like ReShade to boost the color and black levels of your game so it doesn't look like some soulless AAA shooter from the past generation."

When you first arrive in this world, everything is so big, alive and so amazingly beautiful, the level of detail put into this world is really stunning.After a while, you start to acclimatize to this world and it loses a bit of its wonder, but the game still keeps you surprised with new small details which never really caught your attention before. And even when you found most of them, it still keeps being a fresh experience for a really long time.Each fight with each monster feels great and keeps you on your toes. They all got their own special abilities and looks, they also really fit so well into this world. Almost too well actually, since you occasionally get a bad feeling for hunting these magnificent beasts for the 10th time, just to make yourself a new hat.Old issues like connectivity in multiplayer and performance issues vanished completely. I regularly play in multiplayer and have yet to find a disconnect (there were some problems in the beginning).Never really had much performance issues (except for some particle-heavy monsters), after the recent NVIDIA update all of them disappeared.

698,Isohadron,https://steamcommunity.com/id/isohadron/,5,,1,"1,328.0",November,"22,",276,0,1,"Let me preface this review by saying that I have accummulated hundreds of hours on older iterations of the Monster Hunter franchise on the Playstation Portable, namely Monster Hunter Freedom/Freedom 2/Unite. It has always been a wish of mine that this franchise makes the leap to the PC.With Monster Hunter: World we have exactly that. World is a great starter for newcomers to the Monster Hunter franchise as it has plenty of tutorials to show you how the variety of weapons function. The addition of the Training Area where you can test out weapons to your heart's content is a wonderful addition. These luxuries were certainly not present in the older games and therefore took some time to get into.In MH: World you can get right in and slash away at a monster with your starter Longsword or shoot it in the face with your Bowgun. The power you feel when you release a charged attack with your Greatsword or Charge Blade is immensely satisfying.Monster Hunter is exactly what the title implies. You hunt, get materials and craft better gear. There is no character leveling which give you increased stats like in an RPG. Damage output is dependent on what weapons and armour you bring to the fight aswell as your own skill in handling that weapon and anticipating attacks. That encourages training and results in great moments when you succesfully dodge an incoming attack and are able to release a well-timed flurry of attacks right afterwards.This time around you are able to play with randoms through the SOS system and not just only when you are on the same online session. If your friends did not buy this game, the thrill of hunting cooperatively can be experienced just the same with this system. The ability to matchmake into an online session with randoms is also available.Unfortunately there are still rare disconnections during hunts or in an online session which dampen the fun factor. A hunting party of 2 or more results in the monster having more health balancewise and when a disconnection occurs, the health stays the same. This results in a lone hunter having to deal with a monster for much longer as it was balanced for 2 or more players, which is quite frustrating.Optimization-wise, I had occasional pop-in in the town and some texture-loading issues in some levels. Fortunately these are not things that will sting the eyes much as you are mostly concentrating on the monster instead of the world.That doesn't mean to say the biomes they built are dull, on the contrary. When I first explored the different biomes MH: World has to offer, I was amazed. To see all this in HD after playing on the PSP was wonderful. The verticality and colour of the Coral Highlands or the densely overgrown Ancient Forest were a thrill to go through the first couple of times.The variety of monsters here is somewhat lackluster compared to the older games but definitely enough for a newcomer to the series which will see you sink 50-100 hours in before it gets too repetitive. The good thing is that Capcom can build (and is building) on the existing palette of monsters and introduce monsters from older games which were so dearly loved. I really hope World can stand next to the likes of MH: Generations Ultimate in terms of monster variety one day, for endless hunts.Endgame-wise the gameplay stays the same but instead you hunt for decorations and items to augment your armour and weapons to get even stronger. It is very satisfying when you finally defeat a monster that has killed you and your friends countless times. When you are able to slay that same monster in under five minutes with your hard-hitting endgame build, that just feels so **** good.I can whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys solo or cooperative play where personal skill comes into play alot and you want to wield ridiculous weapons to make a monster come crashing out of the sky. If you were ever considering to get into the Monster Hunter franchise, this is the game to go for."
699,Trail-Dave,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trail-Dave/,7,,1,308.1,October,"30,",392,0,1,"Monster Hunter finally comes to PC in the West. This can be played on mouse and keyboard but I prefer it on and would recommend it on gamepad.Been aware of the Monster Hunter series for last decade or so, never played due to not having the want to play consoles. I always said I would check it out when it finally came to western PC.It clearly was worth the wait as I put in like 48 hours in the first week XD.I have read there have been some changes and quality of life improvements of previous games in the title. The graphics are vastly improved over all titles and there is no loading screen between zones now.Monster Hunter is just that you hunt monsters, gather materials, get new weapons, hunt new monsters, repeat.I'm currently 58 hours in and have got so much more to do. There are 14 different weapons to try all with there own unique play style (SNS GANG! lol). There are 31 large monsters and 17 small monsters all with unique fighting styles and weaknesses.You can play through the story, hunt freely in expeditions, take missions for specific monster hunts, hunt with friends, help random strangers via SOS flares, fight in the arena, grind supplies to make weapons and armour, harvest and grow plants for potions, complete your hunting and research guides on monsters.I love the Palico companions they add so much fun and charm to the game. If you like cats you will love them. Your loyal palico will follow you into battle and buff you or provide a great distraction for the monster.The Iceborne expansion is on the way which promises to add a massive amount more of content with rumours of it doubling the base games life which can easily breach 150+ hours.Again its great to see another Japanese company embracing the Western PC culture with a “Predominantly Japanese only release” With SEGA giving us gems like the Yakuza series and Super Monkey Ball and Capcom giving us Monster Hunter etc. The PC gaming future is looking great!"

Yes, the controls with Mouse an Keyboard are not the best, but I never saw so many review complaining about essentially requiring to use a controller one other games, for example Dark Souls, which itself is somewhat unplayable without a controller. And for me, playing as an archer, the K+M controls are solid enough, after doing some slight remapping._Grapics_Overall, I like the Graphics and the generell look of the game. I have to admit, there are some framedrops here and there and the optimization could be better, but thats nothing that can´t be patched. Just a quick note: None of my friends nor me have a high-end-pc, most of us have something in the mid-range, around 3-4 years old....it still runs good._Gameplay_Hunt big stuff, kill it or trap it to get the parts needed to build better equipment to hunt even bigger stuff. Repeat. Thats it basically. And its glorious!_Multiplayer_Yes, you can make things unnecessarily complicated, and CAPCOM went pretty much miles and miles in that direction. Want to play through the Main quest with your friends. Nope, not until the host has seen the cutscenes. Want to open up a lobby with a password? Nope, you have to send around this cryptic session-ID to have a private lobby. Wanna have a clan? Nah, just use the steamgroups, even though they don´t offer the same amount of features like the squads on consoles (as far as I read into that matter). Just come to terms with that or wait for a patch, its not the end of the world.Now, let me say my short opinion about a few reviews I read so far, all of them negative by the way:""I tought, this is a RPG"" - Well, its not and is hasn´t been marketed as one. Don´t thumb down a game because you didn´t inform yourself before buying the game.""Its to grindy!"" - Again, inform yourself about a game before buying it.""Just play Dark Souls"" - Nope, those are two extremely different games to compare. ""The Monster keeps running away!!!! What is this crap???1!!!"" - Its called a HUNT!Overall, I like this game very much.

(The time I reviewed this game, I still loved it.)Game is really fun to play. It's also addictive where it made me spend most of my time into this game. I've played Monster Hunter Portable 3rd back when I was still a kid with my PSP. When I heard this game was coming out, I was very excited. Later planned to buy this game but happily a very kind friend of mine gifted it to me. So now, to the pros and cons.Pros :- Amazing scenery.- Variety of monsters. There are so many different types of monster you can encounter that will keep you out of boredom.- No pay to win features. I love it.- Variety of weapons. You can also try so many types of weapons.- Helpful guides and very helpful starter kits. They basically give you all types of weapons at the start so all you have to do is to choose what kind of weapon is suitable for you.- Events. Oh boy this keeps me awake!- Turf wars. Watching two monsters fight in such an unique animation is just satisfying. For example two horned monsters beating each other with their horns.- Cute pets. Yes. Cute pets. Pigs, cats. What else do you need?- Multiplayer. Really fun if you get to play with your friends.- Musics. I love the musics.Cons :- Horrible, ridiculous, terrifying hitboxes. Yeah it's a joke. Hope they fix it in the future.- Unskippable cutscenes. Wastes too much time. Real gamers wouldn't want to spend their time watching some animations would they?- Long introduction of the game. Like I said above, waste of time.- Low quality voice chat.- Terrible server issues. Don't be surprised if you ever encounter an error during the game. It's just Capcom's bad server issues.- Badly optimised for medium spec gamers. (Personally I don't really know since my computer is a high end pc but the information given from a medium spec gamer, seems like it's true.)- Palico AI. Absolutely horrible. Probably one of the worst Ai coding done in a high quality game.- Default settings are a joke too. Especially when you are on a pc.- RNG. I mean mostly everyone hates RNG right?- THE HANDLERSo there's my review. Hope you enjoyed reading it. I personally do recommend you buying it. Although, on a cheaper price. Honestly even 10 dollars off would be a suitable price but 60 dollars? That's a no no. Wait for the sales.P.S. The DLC ""Iceborne"" is pretty costy too."
716,Master Rhokai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/masterrhokai/,No,,1,257.9,March,"22,",455,0,1,"After additional 170ish  hours ive decided to change my Initial review which was posted during an update that made the game unlaunchable for most users, including myself.There are a few bugs which I believe are mostly tied to lag in multiplayer, however, one I still cant figure out is why the stamina bar continues to shrink over time in hoarfrost even when taking hot drinks. Overall the game is enjoyable, and if your like me and don't mind a good grind, you can skip the Defender/Guardian gear. However, I wish that it was noted in-game that it was meant for an Iceborne rush. At the time I didn't own Iceborne and the in-game guide suggested to get it regardless. Which ruined the learning curve for me. It wasnt until I reached the next area did I realise my mistake.The game IS fun. And i'm sure the other reviews have a much better time pointing out the positives, with that being said...Learning curves. the game misses out on many in-game tips about the available mechanics. - The absolute Importance of the Canteen- Firing Torch pods at the ground clears Effluvial damage around you- How the damn Clawshot works, Yes there is a mission to guide you through this, but I wasn't even aware    until my friend pointed it out to me.- Stacking decorations with armor to boost skills- how to capture monsters (this one it does technically tell you, but assumes you do every side quest or just   so happen to pick the right ones)- Grimalkyne Tribes that unlock palico gear and tailriders- and likely more that I am yet to find out.It could be because I'm using a keyboard, but the controls for ranged weapons are absolute garbage.I feel that the two handed weapons are under-powered. There is no point using a weapon that does an extra 10-15 damage if you can pick a much lighter weapon that doesnt lock you in an animation.And when it comes to animations. Stuns and Paralysis lasts way too damn long. By the time your character even starts to stand up again the monster has already eaten you, your palico, and your ugly handler.Honestly there is so much wrong with this game that I don't know how to keep it in order.6/10would be a  7/10 but minus 1 point for dodge not working half the time."

And it's probably an amazing iteration if you're already a returning Monster Hunter player - but you'd already have known this if so. Monster Hunter: World, unfortunately, can quickly become a downright boring game if you're new to the series and don't fancy its game structure. Pretty much every quest in this is a boss fight and there's not much variety other than that - that's what the series is about. The problem is that the game can feel highly repetitive and even exhausting (if you aren't quite as skilled) that makes it difficult to enjoy. Its end game is essentially made up of farming the same monsters over and over again for a chance to drop rare streamstones that you need for augmenting your gear - and the worst part of it is the RNG.This is a great title and it was fun for me initially. However, the fun factor drastically went down as I progress towards end game. Halfway through this game, I've already found it to be a chore - perhaps it's my own pacing of the game. I don't think this game is for everyone, and I certainly find it difficult to recommend it to players who are just looking for some casual fun."

Has online capability + Single player , It isn't the typical MMORPG where it eats into you when other players are cashy or too strong. It does not force you to stay on multiplayer too , Unlike MMORPG where Dungeons must be run with certain amount of players. In MMORPG , normally you would have to retrain your character from scratch just to be able to try out another weapon/job/class. In Mhw, you could simply switch out weapons and be able to try them out or even change your main weapon easily without having to retrain from scratch all over again.If you are looking to complete the storyline gameplay , It would roughly take you <48hours or way less if you know what you are doing. Other than fighting monsters , you could catch pets and there is a pig with unlockable costumes waiting for you.I can only pray that there will be more future updates."

727,WAVΞ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mashunt12/,7,,1,"1,185.0",August,"11,",91,0,1,"I am a huge MH fan and have been playing it since the Monster Hunter 2 and collecting all of the MH series until now. MH has some new mechanics that makes player more convenient and relatively easier to start compared to the other series. One of them is we can enjoy a free-roaming experience through an ""Expedition"" mode to gather all of the resources we wanted without a time limit, where the natural resources are regenerable and have many large monsters in that area.This game has a gorgeous graphic, epic gameplay, and an interesting storyline. However, this series has some major concerns. From my perspective, the biggest concern is the performance issue, connectivity issue, and MHW weapon designs. MHW performance has become inconsistent through every new patch launched. The performance varies between players, some people experience a severe performance issue and some are experiencing smooth gameplay despite they both having the same specs in their PC. Secondly, even though I rarely had this issue, some players reported got disconnected very frequently inside the game or unable to participate in the current live event. Thirdly, is the weapon design. One of the reasons I hooked to MH and why MH is very satisfying to grind is because of those gorgeous weapon designs. I tend to collect every weapon from all of my favorite monsters in the previous series. However, MHW has some weapons that just been re-designed from the base weapon such as the bone or iron weapons. We can take an example from Zinogre great sword (Severing Bolt II) which shares a design with Banbaro GS (Mammoth Greataxe II), and Great Girros GS (Naaga Guillotine II). Another example is Glavenus GS which has the same design as Nargacuga's GS. Capcom has the potential to create its original design based on the previous generations and I understand based on the video ""Making the Monster Hunter"" that the developer is trying to make realistic weapons that have a philosophy revolves around the monster itself such as its monster's elements. However, this develops a less encouraging and satisfying grind experience. In addition, in my honest opinion, sometimes I found the clutch claw mechanics to be painful and inconvenient as we have to wound the monster's part to deal more damage but on the other hand, the clutch claw is a really interesting and unique addition to MH series. Overall, I love this MH series and would like to keep playing the game while waiting for the next MH series."

I wholeheartedly agree with this statement. I 1st tried this game back in 2020 and couldn't get into it. I towards the middle of 2022 decided to give it another chance and do a bit of research before starting. This was the best idea because I feel the game throws a lot at you very quickly and it can be overwhelming. This gave me a place to start and I actually started to enjoy the game.

You hunt big baddies with fun weapons, and can also go into freeroaming to collect plants and fish and butcher innocent, largely defenseless animals. You court a sweater-wearing pig back in the hub city. The combat is fun and interesting, though you'll need to try out the different weapons for a while before you land on the one you'll enjoy - I thought I didn't enjoy the combat very much after the first mission, but it's just because I picked a weapon I didn't end up liking (there are over a dozen weapon types). On top of all this, almost the entire game is coop-capable.There are a few minor issues I have with it:* Motion blur (not that bad, but can't be turned off)* Some kind of mouth smoothing thing (it's a little strange, and unnoticeable 95% of the time, but can't be turned off)* Going on expeditions (free-roam) with friends is kind of annoying to get to (you have to do a mission with them first, so you can't rejoin an expedition nor can you join an existing one)And some extremely miniscule gripes:* Fishing isn't really engaging* As far as I can tell, there's no way to transmog gear or otherwise customize its appearance* Headgear visibility has options of ""visible,"" ""invisible,"" or ""invisible during cutscenes."" I would have liked an ""invisible in the hub"" option* The menus take a little bit of getting used toIf you somehow think that any of these things cripple an otherwise amazing game, then yeah, avoid it.

I decided to forego this precaution and bought it. And boy was I glad I got itThere are three games that I can name that has sucked the life from me when I first played it. The original Combat Arms when I started my FPS childhood. Team Fortress 2 that has basically defined who I am as a gamer for basically my later half of my life. And now Monster Hunter World which has enticed me to sink countless hours into a game that has never stopped being fun.From the humble Sword and Shield to the staggering and sluggish power of the Greatsword, there's a weapon for everyone. And what's fun about a weapon without monsters to smack around.I'm unsure if people are aware but yes, there are monsters in this game. Shocker.It's no surprise that the monsters in this game are near lifelike for what they are. Movements feel fluid and natural (as natural as fictional dragons and lizards go) and the attacks are well telegraphed to feel fair when combating these beasts. I haven't really had many times outside of a few certain monsters where I felt frustrated. And when you are hunting down these beats it makes you really FEEL like... batman... wait.I haven't played any other Monster Hunter games other than this one.

This is one for the history books.I'll only be addressing the gameplay section since it's the only part where I feel as though quality has any dipping.Monster Hunter: World remains faithful to the franchise as it focuses on the thrill of the hunt, making tweaks to keep the game's mechanics both fresh yet strikingly familiar to returning players.  For new players, the game's well-paced campaign ensures that first-time hunters do not fall behind the learning curve.Monster Hunter: World shatters the norm by giving each of its weapon sets entirely different and unique mechanics, which, coupled with near-perfect balancing, allows all weapons to be effective and viable.  Players are given a plethora of weapon choices from the get-go as well, allowing them to explore the playstyle which suits them the most.  As such, the core combat mechanics of MHW, though deceptively may seem very similar to games such as , actually finds similarities with a slew of other games such as Devil May Cry.  In the five-course-meal of a game, however, the combat itself is just the dessert.  Monster Hunter: World brings the thrill of the hunt to a new level with sprawling maps and biomes--each with their own fitting wildlife.  Expect to trek through sludge, toxic gases, or cross gaps swinging along a vine as you track your target with the help of your scoutflies, passing other monsters along the way as you follow the food chain up.  The game feels exactly as advertised, with your surroundings dynamically changing with the fight and monsters interacting with each other: a true spectacle to behold.  Only hunters who successfully track down their target and make full use of their items and skills can take down a monster after 20-to-30 minutes of fighting, having to track it back to its nest where it retreats upon realising it is no longer the king of the jungle.The condiments to this delicious meal are the way Capcom designed MHW's gearing system.  Hunting gear is forged using materials gained from skinning kills, meaning the more you kill, the better chance you'll have at taking down the next biggest thing in the jungle.  There are just enough required materials to make the grind for the materials needed for the upgrades a challenge, without making it feel like a painful, boring grind such as with cases like Diablo 3 where a player could spend hours accomplishing nothing.  Instead, MHW ensures that the player makes steady, but slow progress with the eventual promise of good loot, as opposed to the blind gamble of most grind-for-gear, dungeon crawlers currently in the gaming industry.Overall, Monster Hunter: World proves that despite having a rough couple of years, Capcom still has its touch and is a breath of fresh air.  Despite it being a port, the game runs without much worry, though I would still recommend a beefier setup (follow the game's recommended system specs, perhaps) to get the most enjoyment out of it.Alas, nothing is perfect, and we finally have to address the game's shortcomings, which come in the form of its highly unstable servers and confusing multiplayer design choices.   Make no mistake, Monster Hunter: World is absolutely not an MMO, but rather, a very well-balanced multiplayer experience which does not intrude with the player's experience, unlike how Dark Souls' instantly makes the game a cakewalk.  Instead, the issues like in Capcom's decision to make connecting to multiplayer both frustratingly difficult and infuriatingly unstable.  Not only do online sessions drop out quite often, the game confusingly requires players to put down everything they've already set in motion in order to connect to an Online Session.   I find it frustrating to always be shown the error message notifying that I no longer have the ability to send out SOS flares to call for aid so other players in the session can help when I'm about to get knocked around until the next time I visit the hub world--ostensibly entailing that I'll have to completely drop the hunt if I hope to get any hunting companions. Please, Capcom, the game is damn near perfect.  Fix the servers and everything will be well on its way to being flawless.Overall, the game is a stunning visual and mechanical masterpiece.  Monster Hunter: World boasts a game of legendary quality truly worth every cent and more of your precious money.  Yes, it's expensive, but for $60 you get an incredibly crafted world with detailed animations and design, and a living, breathing jungle filled with bigger and bigger monsters to hunt and kill as you climb your way up the food chain to become an apex predator yourself.  I have never recommended a game in a Steam review more than this.  Happy hunting."
759,Coldrestia,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072761325/,6,,1,706.8,June,"29,",892,0,1,"Monster Hunter is one of my favourite game franchises of all time, with thousands of hours played across various titles it's probably my outright number one. It's been cool to see it go from a fairly niche series to what it is today. And World is a worthy title to bring the franchise into a new era. You don't need to have played through previous games as MH has always been light on story and they don't have a continuing story line past a couple references to older titles. This is about gameplay first and foremost so if you're looking for a deep story line driven game this probably isn't for you.To start off i see a lot of the negative reviews for this game are based on performance or networking issues, i haven't had any problems myself so i won't be speaking about them, the game has ran perfectly fine for me though i know many have had legitimate issues. Capcom have done a decent job of patching the game and ironing out problems. I'd also like to note that this game can be played co-op or entirely solo(a select few bosses may give you trouble on your own but that's about it), i enjoy both a lot so don't worry about needing others to play with.For those that have not played a MH game before the series put into simple terms is kill large monsters, carve them up to make better weapons/armour and repeat as you work your way up fighting more powerful monsters. Ranging from very easy to extremely challenging in the late game. Sounds simple enough but there is so much more depth to the game than meets the eye. Some other tasks you will be doing just to name a few: Exploring zones, gathering resources and managing your farm, fishing, mining and of course upgrading your gear and making builds.  The main strong point of MH for me and i believe many others is the combat and World is no different, in my opinion having the best combat to date. Monster Hunter combat is not spamming or hack n slash rather more comparable to Dark souls, attacking when you find an opening and part of the fun is learning the monster attack patterns and how much you can get good at abusing those openings. World has 14 different weapons to use and each feel satisfying and distinct in their own way, the heavy slower weapons feel like they have a lot of weight to them and you can really feel the impact on each attack where as the faster weapons give you the fun feeling of unleashing large combos while still retaining the satisfying feel of hits. There is no class system in the game so you can freely swap to any of the 14 weapons. There are skills that can change the way you play however, skills come from the gear you are wearing and can vary from improving how many i-frames you get when rolling to something as simple as being able to gather more herbs. Either way you can be sure that you have a variety of ways to build your character and this will be what you spend a lot of time doing in the end game.Each Monster has a different moveset and abilities it can use which is what makes learning attacks patters so enjoyable as you have a new task ahead of you each time you fight something new. Then add in that each fight can feel vastly different depending on what weapon you are using and you have a good recipe for engaging gameplay that can feel fresh after many hunts. The core gameplay loop of hunt>craft gear>hunt is a tried and tested formula that the series has been successfully honing for over a decade with World being arguably the finest iteration yet. World brings the the most quality of life changes and small tweaks the series has seen to date. Add in the signature MH charm such as the Felyne Cats or scoffing down comically huge plates of food mixed with some relaxing downtime when you go back to your Town hub or just chill in your house and you have yourself a unique experience i don't believe any other game can offer.At this point you can probably tell if this is the sort of game that could interest you. Even though i didn't even touch on half of what Mh has to offer a lot of the fun comes from learning the game mechanics and nuances of which there are many.Main Positives+ Massive amount of quality of life changes make World the best MH game for new players    by a long shot+ Best Combat in a MH game to date and top class for Action RPGS in general.+ Challenging and engaging content that can be difficult to find in a time where lots of games    prioritize *cinematic experiences*  over everything else+ Fantastic Environments, they did a great job making each area feel like a living ecosystem.+ Easily 50+ Hours of solid content, way more IMO this is being conservative.+ Monster designs are top notch.Minor Negatives(mainly for veterans of the series) - Since World is effectively MH 5 in all but name the monster roster can seem small   compared to Gen 4, though this is being improved upon with Iceborne coming this Winter.- Weapon visual design is probably the worst of any MH game, many weapons just look like   bone/iron with monster fur coming off of them instead of unique models. The weapons that   do have unique models however are top quality, they are just too few and far between.- Maybe a controversial point for some but very end game content Arch-Tempered Elder   dragons are severely lacking interesting mechanics, a lot of the time just making them   annoying to fight rather than a harder but fair approach. Some are way too easy and barely  change the fight (Kirin) and some are hard just because of frustrating mechanics                (Vaal Hazak, Lunastra). - Monster Hunter games have always had an element of grinding in them, not a personal   negative for me but if you really hate grinding then that is something to keep in mind"
760,Artemis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtemisDergon/,5,,1,128.5,December,"26,",196,0,1,"This is a game about hunting monsters, but more importantly about finding cool glowing armor and eating food that looks better than anything you’ve ever eaten in real life. If you’ve ever felt the need to bash in a dragon’s head with a hammer that looks like a flower, then this may be the game for you. With those initial thoughts out of the way, I welcome you to my in-depth review of Monster Hunter World.I’m going to get this out of the way first, because let us be honest here, you aren’t getting this game for the story. That being said, you find many spoilers here as the story is quite bland and doesn’t have much variation. You’re a hunter that has been sent to a new world with a bunch of other people to investigate a phenomenon known as the elder crossing. Though there are some cutscenes and story specific quests, they’re basically just filler content to get to the monsters you’ll be fighting. Most monsters are introduced, because your handler (an NPC who works with you) can’t get her priorities straight and decides that food is more important than her life. It’s either that, or her utter reliance on the fact that you’ll save her after running headfirst into certain death.There is so much to choose from in this game when it comes to armor and weapons. You can build armor out of various materials that you collect from the environment and by defeating monsters. Each armor has its own specific bonuses and resistances to different elements. In the early game you’ll mostly just want to mix and match armor components in order to get the most defense points you can. Later on you may want to grind out quests to build specific armor sets. Most of them look really cool and it feels satisfying to build the armor sets. Overall there isn’t anything too difficult here, just go for the best set you can build.Weapons are a different story. There are lots of different types of weapons, all with their own unique movesets and use cases. I’ve only ever really used two weapons regularly, that being the hammer and the charge blade. It feels incredibly satisfying to master a weapon. You’ll find yourself pulling off all sorts of cool combos and dishing out massive damage. However, you will most likely have to look up a guide, find a youtube video, or know someone to give you tips and tricks on how to use the weapons. Some weapons, like the charge blade, have lots of different combos and mechanics which you need to know to dish out the maximum amount of damage. While learning combos through the practice tool is possible, some of them require specific time frames and it's easiest to find those time frames by looking up guides. Weapons also have way more advanced build and upgrade paths than armor does. There are several types of base weapons and you can use different monster materials to upgrade them into the more defined variants. These variants usually have different elemental aspects which allows them to do more damage to different types of enemies. And of course they also have different overall appearances. Overall, I love having so many different types of weapons and it really adds another level of complexity to the game that you wouldn’t have otherwise. That being said, it's also really easy to switch up your build at any time, even if you mostly play from far away, you can easily pick up a hammer and just go full melee mode. You don’t have to dedicate to any one build.This should be quite obvious, but the entirety of the gameplay is focussed around fighting monsters, be they big or small, your task is to kill (or capture) endemic life. There are two main ways of going about this, either by doing quests, or by going out on expeditions.Expeditions give you the open world experience. Just choose where you want to go and walk around. You can collect materials for making health potions, or special ammo. There are smaller enemies to fight in order to get some simple early game armor. And of course there are the large monsters with the most rewarding loot. Most monsters will not attack you if you don’t attack them first, however there are some exceptions to that rule. Also since its open world, it's very possible that you will be fighting one monster and another will join in and start fighting as well. This isn’t necessarily one sided and usually results in a big three, or sometimes even four way brawl. However, you probably won’t be doing many expeditions outside your first few times within an area. The better loot and rewards come through completing quests.Quests give you an objective to complete such as slaying a monster, or gathering a certain number of materials. It will also associate a time limit with the task and put a cap on the amount of times you can faint before failing a quest. This can be completed with other players either by randomly having people join you, or by specifically inviting certain friends to join you. But more on that later.All the monsters are relatively unique in their moveset and appearances. You’ll get to know some better than others and it really is a work of art to master fighting against a specific enemy. You will start to learn when to roll, when to hit them, and when to run away. Enemies get progressively harder and more advanced as you go through the game, but so will you. With all the different weapons and moves at your disposal, you will learn how to take care of each one.That being said, there is an obvious learning curve to this game. It's not something you’ll be able to figure out immediately, it's not exactly intuitive, and there is a good chance you’ll still be learning new tactics even after you’ve spent many many hours in game. Once you get over the steep learning curve though, you’ll have a lot of fun and you’re definitely going to want to keep playing.This game has lots of potential and if you give it a chance you will spend many hours in this game. There is so much to do and the challenge is very real. I love playing this game and though I feel like I’ve put a decent amount of time in, I still have way more to discover and look into and I’m certainly not getting bored. This is more of a personal point, but I’ve reviewed a decent number of first person RPGs and this is the one I’ve spent the most time in despite only buying this a month ago. There is a lot to love here and even though the story is quite dull, the game really shines in what I consider to be the most important, the actual gameplay. The cool graphics and good soundtrack are an added perk and really add up to make this game feel amazing to play. You will not regret buying this game, especially not at this price point. And if you love the game you can get even more use out of it by buying the Iceborne DLC, although it definitely isn’t necessary to enjoy the game. Playing with friends makes the game even more fun and I highly recommend getting together with a group of four to get the most out of the experience.I hope you found this review to be helpful and happy hunting!"

763,medli20,https://steamcommunity.com/id/medli20/,5,,1,157.0,August,"20,",85,36,1,"TL;DR at bottom.The PC port of Monster Hunter: World has been something I've been looking forward to for a long, long time. Having been a fan of both 4 Ultimate and Generations, I have a bit of experience playing the core games, which set up my expectations for MH:World. Things I was expecting: * fighting monsters* Palicoes of varying levels of helpfulness* loooooots of micro-managing* agonizing over which combinations of armor pieces would create the best set* Trying to figure out how the hell to upgrade my weapon to get what I want* That feeling of despair when the monster flees your area and you forgot to mark it with a paintball* A maybe-not-quite-immersive-but-still-fun and reliable multiplayer experienceHaving said that, this game has taken my expectations and thrown them in a blender, for better or worse. I've seen some comments/reviews from other people complaining about the amount of foraging and micro-managing there is in the series. This is a series staple-- it's to be expected. Embraced, even. There's still monsters to fight, and they are challenging. Palicoes in this game are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they are invaluable supports that can dig you out of a tight spot. The actual hunting feels AMAZING. While there aren't as MANY locales to explore as there were in past games, they're incredibly dense, immersive, and are full of all sorts of things to explore. Even when you're looking for a monster, finding a shiny gathering point or a new endemic creature to add to your collection of pets is a joy. Best of all is the tracking. In past games, if you forgot to bring paintballs to mark the monster, you were SOL if the Rathalos you were just fighting flew off to another area. In MH:World, tracking has been made easier and more immersive. You really feel like you're stalking a dinosaur through a jungle, rather than just checking your minimap for a big pink dot. Actually fighting the monster you've been hunting is also a delight. Damage counters are a delightful new addition and really help you keep track of what parts are more vulnerable than others. I've really only tried using the Hunting Horn in this game, but even just that feels weighty and satisfying to whack things with.This game has taken the idea of armor skills and weapon upgrades and simplified the process significantly. Gone are the days of lamenting over the fact that you couldn't get enough points in Evade Dist to actually get a useful skill. ANY points in ANY skill will leave an impact. Being able to visualize the weapon upgrade trees is a godsend.Overall, the game is fun as hell. disregard that, this has been fixed. I'd still like to see LAN support though. At the very least, this information should be on the system requirements.Overall: 10/10 gameplay, when things go wellEdit 25 August 2018: Game's been fixed. After playing for a good few hours on the newest patch (as of writing this review), I have no further issues with this game. A+ game, would highly recommend. Stayed up way too late playing with Boyfriend and now we're both extremely sleepy and satisfied with our purchase. Apparently, changing the rating to ""recommended"" also clears out steam user ratings so I want it to be on record that this review had a rating of 348 ""helpful"" and 43 ""funny."" I'm a very delicate person and I need every bit of validation from strangers to make life easier for me. Waaaah. Great game tho, definitely worth the loss of internet points.

766,Jhin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenvar/,5,,1,395.5,August,"10,",481,0,1,"is an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom. A part of the Monster Hunter series, it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version in August 2018.In the game, the player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces. If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of parts from the monster and other elements that are used to craft weapons and armor, amongst other equipment.The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down more difficult monsters, which in turn provide parts that lead to more powerful gear. Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of up to four players via the game's online services. is an open-world action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. Similar to previous games in the series, the player takes the role of a player-created character who travels to the ""New World"", an unpopulated land mass filled with monsters, to join the Research Commission that study the land from their central command base of Astera.The Research Commission tasks the Hunter to hunt down and either kill or capture large monsters that roam outside Astera to both protect the Commission and to study the monsters there.The player's character does not have any intrinsic attributes, but instead these are determined by what equipment the character is equipped with. This includes a weapon, selected from the series' fourteen archetypes (such as long sword, bow, or hammer), which then further defines the types of combat moves and abilities the player can use, and pieces of armor, which can lead to beneficial or detrimental combat skills if matched properly.While some basic equipment can be purchased using in-game money, most equipment is built from loot obtained by slaying or trapping monsters, rewards from completing quests, or items gathered while in the field. This creates a core loop of gameplay that has the player fight monsters they can beat to obtain the right loot to craft improved weapons and armor to allow them to face more powerful monsters and the potential for even better equipment.After taking a quest in Astera, or after choosing to simply go on an open-ended expedition, the player is taken to a base camp in one of six large regions that make up the New World. Each region is made up of numbered zones, but unlike previous Monster Hunter games, these zones are seamlessly connected, and there are  when moving between zones.The player must traverse zone to zone, though they can quick-travel to any of the base camps in that particular region when outside of combat. From camp, the player can acquire limited provisions, rest to restore their health, and new to World, have a meal that provides limited-time buffs to the player.The player sets out to track down monsters, which in World is aided with the use of Scout flies, which hover near tracks and other signs of large monsters, or highlight resources that the player can collect such as flora, ores, bones, and insects. Investigate the traces of the monster leads to improving the Scout flies' abilities for the quest, eventually enabling them to lead the player via their glowing flight path towards the monster they seek; further, investigating these help the player to gain research towards the monster that helps them gain insight on its strengths, weaknesses, and behavior.The PS4 Pro and Xbox One X players gave you a tough choice where you could either prioritise visuals, frame rate or resolution – depending on your preference.Even when you opted for framerate it was clear the consoles were at their limit. Playing on the PS4 Pro though, you can still notice drops, even when you set it as a priority.On PC you’re free to tweak the settings to your heart’s content, so in theory, if your hardware is up to it, you can have all three and play Monster Hunter World with its graphics maxed in 4K at 60fps-plus framerates.Finally a  avaiable on PC - 9/10They fixed many connections error issues like some of the most commons like ""E_FAIL : hr"" and various matchmaking error, BUT they didn't completely resolve them, as they said:- Fixed an issue where error messages would display and kick players offline while playing multiplayer.They completely fixed every single connection error issue."

Just saying though, the game is in a far better shape than it was at the time of writing this review, so crank the score up a notch!As an absolute MH fan this game is a blast, finally seeing some quality visuals. As someone who is discovering the series ? It's probably a good starting point, definitely the most accessible title of the MH franchise so far. Objectively speaking though, it suffers from quite a few issues. I'll list both pros and cons below in no particular order :Pros :+ Gorgeous graphics, the most obvious one (just compare to older titles and the upcoming MHGU which was the latest entry in Japan before MHW)+ Easy to pick up and play, the convulated systems of the previous games are much more simple now, and everything is explained.+ Training grounds to try your weapons on a static dummy.+ Ability to revert some weapon upgrades (as well as getting the materials refunded)+ This one is subjective, but I love the verticality and complexity of the maps in this game.+ Slinger and specialized tools are nice additions and don't feel gimmicky in that they have actual, consistent uses.+ Very short loading times (in comparison to stock consoles). My game is installed on a SSD and I have 4 ~ 5s loading screens.+ Ability to see the entire upgrade tree of any weapon instead of resorting to 3rd party resources such as Kiranico or the MH Wiki+ Quick access items / Inventory wheel. Beats having to scroll through your entire list of consumables before finding the right item any day mid-quest.+ In the same vein, a lot of information was made readily available in-game, although a lot of it is still vague (but at least it's there). It's more than enough information for the casual player to soak in and make educated decisions.+ Most weapons have revamped, more practical and streamlined movesets.+ More tasks to do in-between quests, more rewarding systems, etc...+ Expeditions (free play in the maps of your choice, no time and death limits)+ No more needs for consumable tools to collect stuff, and collecting and carving in general is much smoother (also hooray for invincibility + super armor carving at the end of a quest)+ Some more details that'll speak more to veteran players than newcomersCons :- Connectivity issues, the most obvious one. Despite having (at the time of writing) 62 hours logged into the game and greatly enjoying it so far, I have without exaggerating spent 7 to 8 hours trying to join friends' sessions (or them join mine) and abandonning quests midway because someone disconnected.- Menus. I find they're a massive cluster**** for a reason I can't fathom. This however might be because I'm very used to the old games' menus, which were very similar to each other and have changed very little over time.- Performance issues. Although my PC can run the game just fine thanks to my specs (above recommended), there were niche instances where everything would stutter or the frames drop. This has only happened during the last Kushala phase with its tornadoes and tempest weather. Might have happened a couple times during VFX-heavy moments where 4 players and the monster would use their flashy moves at the same time.- No one uses the gathering hub (multiplayer hub where you see other players before questing). You can do everything from Astera's lower levels directly and don't need to access the hub to host and start multiplayer quests.- I'm nitpicking on this one but I find it annoying to spawn at the front Astera gate after a quest. I'd rather spawn at the 1F elevator so that I can skip running through the first floor to get to the canteen, or otherwise still have the same distance to run to the 1F NPCs if I have business with them.- Why is the Handler so derpy...- Multiplayers slots remain filled when someone leaves mid-quest or get disconnected so you can't ever have a full party anymore during the remainder of the quest if that happens. Super annoying with the recurrent connectivity issues.- Game is easy in comparison to older games. Also indirectly related to the fact that there is currently no G Rank.All in all, I'd say the game is great. A lot of the needlessly complex systems are much simpler now or have been straight up removed, The game simply suffers from a few - but glaring - issues that must not be overlooked by Capcom. The thing is, as it stands, a unpolished gem and I sincerely hope the game gets fixed sooner rather than later, both to save face towards the new players and making the experience as close to flawless as possible.As for whether I recommend it, I think I've successfully made 20+ people that were on the fence about getting it, buy it, and so far no regrets.Arbitrary score : 7/10"

Fun game, little to no grind.

First off this is a time consuming game, and expect to spend at least a hundred hours into for endgame / true ending. If you play games mostly for the stories and not its gameplay, than this game isn't for you. The game is graphically incredible; the armour, weapons, monsters, characters are all beautiful. MonsterHunterWorld has addicting game-play with a well implemented crafting system. Your character progression is achieved through your own ability getting better, learning the monsters, and upgrading your gear. This all makes for a very rewarding experience. The endless number of collectibles, and the complexity and strategy around how to attack the monsters , and presents an engaging challenge. The game is content packed and also has frequent updates and free DLC.I was hesitant to buy the game at first, there is quite a bit of negative press for it. A lot of issues with connectivity and fps. And now the connectivity issues are largely fixed. The gameworld is rich, with a intense level of detail right down to ants sometimes walking around - there are many item sets to collect, many weapons to master and enough content to keep everyone happy, whether you prefer playing solo and co-op, there is something for you here. The game is absolutely worth every penny. I recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure game, play with friends, build a guild or join one, and share your adventure to the world, these will double the fun and increased the value of the game by ten folds. There's a reason it's sold as many units as it has, and that's because it deserves it. It's not a perfect game, but it's the best in it's series in almost every way, that's exciting. I've never played a Monster Hunter game before, but I'm glad I picked this up. If you are on the fence about this one - buy it! You will not regret it. See you on the hunting grounds!"

782,Immunonicotinic scientist,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DOMAINOFTHEBADGERS/,5,,1,99.0,May,"25,",211,1,1,"Amazing debut for this great franchise on steam, no issues at all with the port. A great single player and coop game. The DLC is kind of expensive but without it I would probably give this game 6/10 just because it would be missing the core of a true Monster Hunter game (Even with it it's kind of debatable).Gameplay   Deep, satisfying, responsive combat, but some parts like traversing for 10 minutes through vines like Tarzan get pretty tedious and annoying.Graphics    Cool monster hunter art style, lighting, effects all good. Textures are a bit funny in places though.Sound and Atmosphere   Amazing emotional soundtrack, great and diverse monster soundtracks, good hit sounds.Content with DLC , without DLC . A lot to do but no huge variation in difficulty and without personal motivation to slaughter an annoying monster like the old games makes it feel a lot less rewarding. For casuals and newcomers it'll be more than enough though.Overall, a great game for beginners but to me this is missing several parts of what made the old Monster Hunter games so great. Much less challenge, worse progression, much less satisfaction as a result. Crafting is pointless in a lot of places and there is no anticipation for getting a great new piece of gear because it's just marginally better and the same in almost every way. Enjoy all your fully upgraded armour being completely worthless compared to the worst armour from the next tier in difficulty too lol. However I am jaded from old games, new players at all interested should really enjoy this game, the combat alone makes it worth it. I think a fair rating is:Without DLC , with DLC .My subjective opinion is probably: No DLC 6/10 and with DLC 8/10."
783,Roseipika,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roseipika/,5,,1,486.7,November,"28,",69,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a must play if your PC can run it because it is one of a kind. If you are new to the series then expect to be turned inside out from your own poopoo hole, but this is ultimately what allows this game to give you one of the most satisfying and rewarding feelings once you have mastered a fight after what feels like hours or even days of suffering and rage. This game also has some great soundtracks that'll motivate you on your journey to turn every monster that has ever bullied you into your ♥♥♥♥♥. Another thing I should bring up is that there are 14 different weapon types that you can choose from and a good majority of them will feel awkward or slow at first, but over time you'll grow an attachment to your weapon or weapons that'll make even the slowest of weapons fun and addicting to use.As someone who loves attention to details in video games in both mechanics and visuals I can say without a doubt that this game has a large amount of detail in it's world, visuals, and mechanics. When I first played this game I had a joy spending hours just walking around the beautifully designed maps that aren't as big as in an open world game, but are filled to the brim with details like tight paths filled with vines that you'll be pushing through, little animals all over the maps that can be captured and kept as pets, hidden paths that'll lead you to another breathtaking area, and breakable environments such as giant boulders that can be dropped on a monster. Before this game was released Monster Hunter wasn't known for having stunning visual details, but now the developers have pushed themselves with the visuals this time and it shows. If you want to appreciate the detail in the world and monsters I highly recommend taking long walks around the maps. Now when it comes to the mechanics in this game I can confidently say that it puts every other game out there to shame because there is sooo much stuff in the mechanics that the game will never tell you and you'll have to figure it out through testing and a lot of math(Or you can just watch videos where big brain individuals break this stuff down). An example of this is that if the middle part of your blade hits the monster it'll multiply the damage dealt by a tiny percentage.Even though I play solo a majority of the time, I still have enough experience playing with others to say that if you want to play this with others then you'll still have a blast, but you'll probably deal with some irritating things like the story quests which require you to view the cutscene before anyone can even join your quest. Despite this it is still great since playing with others and it will lead to some fun experiences even if your team isn't the best. I recommend playing with friends over randoms any day because some will just bother you or try to force you to play how they want. Lastly I suggest you bring a brace jewel so your pals don't keep flinching you by accident with their big weapons when they all decide to go bonk on the monster's head.If this review has not expressed how much I love this game then certainly the +3000 hours of playing this game from a combination of both my characters from PS4 and PC will. Buy it loser."

The game is exactly the same of course, with a few differences that are good and bad. I quickly plugged in my controller because I was just used to that, but go with whatever style suits you. With fourteen different weapon types to choose from and a ton of armor and ability options, it's hard to say not to go with what suits a person personally. Enjoy the hunts, and don't worry if you can't take down a more difficult monster. A few failed missions, and you will learn a lot more than taking one down in a sinlge go. Have fun, don't stagger your friends, and good luck hunters. TLDR: An amazing game with a thriving community, active devs, and beautiful scenery/gameplay."
785,Michael {United Critics},https://steamcommunity.com/id/Michael-UC/,15,2,1,46.2,December,"27,","1,881",0,1,"In case that you are wondering, you are not required to play or have any knowledge of any of the previous games to enjoy MHW. The story is pretty much their own thing and (at least in the base game) pretty much all the monsters are brand new.MHW tells the story of a nameless hunter (the main character) on an expedition to the “New World”, an unexplored new continent of the MH universe and their adventures and struggles in the new world. Be aware that even when this is the Monster Hunter game with the biggest and most compelling story of the franchise. The story is the weakest point of the experience and can be easily ignored. I will go more in-depth about it later on in this review.At the moment of writing the review, MHW has been out on PC for around 6 years and chances are that if you are an “old school Monster Hunter” fan, you already own it and you already have your own opinion about it. This review is going to be oriented towards those players that are brand new to the franchise or started on Monster Hunter Rise (MHR) and want to check out the previous title.One final warning for players that have never played any Monster Hunter game and are interested in picking up this game: these games are full of weird and complex mechanics that require a lot of time and practice to understand and be competent at them. If you don’t like how that sounds, don’t bother with this game.For me this is the best Monster Hunter game that you can buy on PC. Sure it’s slower paced than MHR, but this game is actually challenging and immersive. I really like MHR but I love MHW. From the more methodical combat, to how the maps feel like a real place.Just be aware of how annoying some parts of this game are. Try to find a group of people that can give you tips and help with the more challenging monsters.Rating: 9/10"
786,TrulyAce,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TrulyAce/,15,1,1,60.4,December,"10,",229,6,1,"Monster Hunter world is a grindy game that takes around 50 hours (give or take) to complete, yet at no point does it feel like its dragging on or getting stale. This game is perfect for anyone who likes to sink hours into a game. even once you're done with the main story, you have the freedom to just complete any quest you feel like and it remains fun since the game is rewarding, and it even gives you small epilogue quests. While i'm planning to take a break from the game for the moment, I look forward to returning to the game at some point to complete the Iceborne DLC. My main complaint about the game is that it can be a little overwhelming with the amount of little extras that i found hard to figure out such as the decorations. but this is only minor and i sure this wasn't too bad for other.easy 10/10 thoroughly enjoyed my time"

789,Index154,https://steamcommunity.com/id/index154/,5,,1,789.1,December,"31,",112,0,1,"8/10 (A-tier)This game offers satisfying combat against cool monsters with modern graphics and fitting atmosphere. The issues it has don't have an extreme effect on the enjoyability.It looks really good if your rig is good enough to back it up. Some of the armor sets look cool but sadly the most efficient way of playing usually clashes with the most fashionable.I'm a big fan of the music, it can make a fight feel really intense. The sound design is also cool.On mouse and keyboard the controls are alright. My main complaint here is about the radial menu that can be a bit of a pain to navigate. I've heard that it's unintuitive on controller as well. But the most important thing, the movement controls and weapon combos, feel good in my opinion. They just take some time to learn.It's acceptable. Not a game you're gonna want to play for the story though. I have to say that the Handler really grinds my gears, she's incredibly annoying. Luckily, once you're done with the story she doesn't do much anymore. There's not much to say about the remaining characters.Just a quick overview of the gameplay loop first off: You hunt a monster, gather materials, occasionally explore a new map, farm some materials and so on.The start of the game may feel a bit overwhelming because it throws a lot of tutorials at your face and it's a lot to take in at once. It'll take a bit for you to get used to everything but there's nothing that's exceptionally difficult to understand or anything so there's no need to worry.The best part of the game is the combat. Fights can take a while but they don't get boring unless you have to farm a single monster's materials for a very long time, which is rare. It almost feels like every fight in this game is a bossfight, except that it's generally not super difficult. The final boss in particular isn't very challenging but some of the monsters can give you trouble if you're not used to them. The game also picks up in difficulty once you're done with the story, though some of the difficulty just comes from the enemies having more HP and doing more damage.Speaking of the monsters, there's a lot of variety, excluding the few subspecies, and there is a good amount of monsters. Though they're not that many compared to other monster hunter games I personally still feel that there are enough in MHW.What's cool about the monsters is that they feel like they actually belong in the game's world. They have territories, they get tired, get hungry, they sleep and they interact with each other. Most of the realism is lost in favor of better gameplay however, so don't expect the monster AI to be *too* complex.Often times, while you're fighting, another monster might show up and also get into the fray, spicing things up a bit. The environment also plays a role in combat because of height advantages and hazards you can use to help you in your hunt or get caught up in yourself. The world feels rather ""purposeful"".The large selection of weapon types provides a lot of variety because they make for totally new ways of playing. Some of them are easier to learn than others, but they all have a use and there's something for everybody.There are also tons of different individual weapons and armors you can craft. Unfortunately, few of them are unique enough or strong enough to be relevant in the meta once you reach the endgame. The same goes for all the skills in the game. There are so many of them but 90% of them are totally useless and the rest are extremely strong in comparison.Some items have ridiculously low drop rates which means that you'll have to spend a looong time farming if you're a completionist. This is one of my biggest issues with the game.The best examples of this are Kulve Taroth weapons and decorations.Kulve is a raid monster that can drop many otherwise unobtainable unique weapons (literally hundreds of them) and for a lot of weapon types the best one in the game is dropped by this monster which makes farming it very important if you want to make fully optimized sets. This is just terrible. It's like the devs wanted to make getting the best weapons as monotonous as possible to keep people playing for longer. Keep repeating this one single quest and then hope you get the weapon you're looking for. Oh you didn't get it? That's too bad, time to go again...Kulve is probably my least favorite part of the whole game because of this, even though the fight itself is actually pretty good (the first dozen times you do it).Decorations are just as bad, maybe even worse than that. You can get them from many different quests which is good but the problem is that the drop rates of the most powerful jewels can be abysmal. I've seen people who, after playing for more than a thousand hours, still don't have all of them that they need.Fortunately there are mods out there that let you avoid the heavy grind, if that's something you're willing to get into.The multiplayer is mostly fun, especially with friends, but playing with random people can sometimes end in frustration since the limited lives in a quest are shared between players. And it's a bit depressing to have one person mess up and cause everyone else to lose, whether that's you or someone else. So I advise on only playing with random people if you're not super-serious about a quest. Only use the SOS system for fun. There is some beauty in playing with randoms too. Sometimes when I meet someone who uses the same weapon as me and I see them pull off a nice combo or have it interrupted I feel some kind of special bond between us because I understand exactly what it feels like when that happens. Or when you meet someone who makes room for you when the monster is knocked out so you don't interrupt each other. Very nice moments to be had every now and then.I personally haven't noticed any noteable bugs at all yet, I think the game is pretty polished. It also runs well enough.Overall, you can get a ton of playtime out of this game and even if it does get repetitive at some point, you can switch to a new weapon to change things up again."

Another issue with the game is compatibility with Nvidia gpu drivers which causes game crashes. This issue can be fixed by playing in borderless window mode or rolling back to a previous driver, and I believe Nvidia is working on a solution for this as well. I understand these issues can be game breaking for many users. This is the first time any of the Monster Hunter franchise games have been released on PC, so I have chosen to be patient with everything.and WOW. I am so glad I have been patient.This game is phenomenal.I don't often leave reviews, but this game. This game. THIS FREAKING GAME. All the yes.Monster hunter world is a beautifully done RPG for those who love exploration, beautiful monsters with stunning attack animations, unique weapon and armor customizations, and for those who absolutely adore dragons. You can use your environment to your advantage during monster fights such as hiding in tall grass so monsters don't see you, leading monsters to one another to cause turf wars that inflict massive damage to both monsters, leading monsters to paratoads to stun them, and natural disasters such as a massive avalanche of water that will cause crazy amounts of damage to whatever you are fighting. You can craft bombs to sit on monsters faces and set them off for large amounts of damage, you can daze monsters with flash bombs, you have to sharpen your weapon during fights to make sure you maintain optimal damage, and the amount of detail brought to each fight goes on and on. You also get an adorable little Palico to fight alongside you. You can gear up your palico buddy with buffs to help other players, or status effects to help poison or stun your enemy more frequently. You gear up according to monster's weaknesses and you can cause status effects to other monsters according to your weapon like stun, poision, etc. There's pages and pages of items you can craft to help you during your fights. You can also take on monsters with friends via multiplayer.To those who complain about this game being too repetitive and grindy the whole purpose of the game is fighting monsters. What did you expect? If you're not into fighting monsters to make gear and advance then don't play the game. Simple.This game was also released on console and the company continues to release free content like adding more monsters to the game and adding events like summer and halloween. These events have happened on console but I expect them to be coming to the PC version soon. Releasing free to play content along the way is rare in this day and age for gaming. Most games release DLC content which must be payed for, so I am super excited that Monster Hunter World will be releasing additional free to play content.I give this game a 10/10. Beautifully done. Definitely worth the price of $59.99"

Local area man wanders into an island with his bi-pedal cat pal and smacks down monsters to wear them and use their skin and bones to defeat even bigger tougher monsters. And so the cycle continues until eventually monsters that used to take you 30 minutes to kill now take a mere 5 minutes. It's a journey of growth and self improvement and there is no greater satisfaction than when everything clicks and you're able to conquer old foes. It's pretty much a game of nonstop boss fights with some farming and gathering on the side (note there are literal farms you can utilize to reduce the gathering needed) as well as a dress up sim with your cat and character which you use the parts of the monsters you've hunted to craft youself new gear.I love this game so much that I previously owned it on PS4 and decided to buy it again for PC to play with friends and experience better load times, etc. At launch there were definitely issues with connection but I have not experienced disconnects in a long while now. Maybe it is different for other players.Load times are nearly non-existant. I have already surpassed my PS4 save (I stopped before Devil Jho came out in anticipation of replaying on PC) with less hours played! It's amazing. The world is so beautiful and this is truly Monster Hunter at its prime. I went to play Generations Ultimate for the classic MH expereince again (I played MH3U and MH4U in the past) after World and the quality of life (QoL) differences were astounding. I missed World immediately. Faster gathering, infinite whetstone and gathering tools, one giant field map instead of zones with loading screens, etc.  I'd say the only real downgrades are less monsters and not being able to play as your Palico - boo! The new monsters are pretty awesome but I do miss the likes of Zinogre, Brachydios, Tigrex and more.Oh, also being forced to play the story again is kind of annoying. Cutscenes really should be skippable in 2018, come on Capcom. The way online is handled for story mode is also rather stupid. If you want to play with a friend you have to each start the mission separately, watch the cutscene, then one leaves and joins the other. However this was a design decision on the Ps4 version as well, equally dumb then. Once you complete the story its not really an issue anymore and MH Vets like to say the story is the tutorial and the real game starts after. Not wrong, really!After the story is completed the world is your oyster really in how you choose to spend your time. Grind for those decorations and augment stones to spoof up your builds and imrpove your kill times, help out others in any ranks, take on tempered monsters,  raise your rank, play with friends, take on the arenas and challenges, and my personal favorite -- experiment with new weapons and builds with all the excess materials gathered!Most people associate PC with hackers; I have only seen one hacker so far and he was harmless - a HR198 yet clearly had not yet beaten the story (only had one tool) and he just hung around the session. The hacker problem isn't really as rampant as one might think and a majority of people want to play the game legit.Overall, if you never played a Monster Hunter game before but have been interested this is the best one to get into thanks to all the QoL changes introduced. And if you played already on console or classic titles I'd still recommend this if have a friend group to play with or would like to meet a new community of hunters.10 outta 10 Palicoes recommend the game."

I could list the many problems or if you cared and wanted to know just google it and look at some of the problems yourself. Just the fact that you can alt tab and open a window to completely bypass the unnecessary anti-cheat they implemented which takes as much or more CPU than the actual game itself is comical.I expected more than a rushed port after the stunted launch of the base game, But I guess the lessons learned were cast away as soon as it was finished because knowledge of PC ports is forbidden black magic in Japan.The base game was great though, I would wait until the bugs are ironed out for the expansion and then it will probably be great, I'll update the review when the port is actually finished and we are done beta testing it."

829,webmetalreese,https://steamcommunity.com/id/webmetalreese/,6,,1,291.1,August,"13,","1,338",0,1,"So Monster Hunter? Yeah...About 10-15 years back I remember playing it for PS2 (or PSP?) Can't recall. It was an endless kill the same monster over and over until you got enough feathers or bones to make a new weapon, then farm the same map for stone. I played it plenty though, something about those repetitive actions kept me coming back for more. I figured I'd give it another go thinking they HAD to have improved upon the previous versions. They have - though not in a way you would think, but a weird Japanese port from consoles into a heaving mass of keyboard shortcuts, menus inside menus inside menus, customizing like 20 different loadouts. NPC's yelling HEY at you but looking at the map you see hundreds of little icons of where you picked that plant up last time or that rock. Sure, you can turn all of it off but good luck trying to figure out how. It's all there, but using traditional Japanese gaming style is literally buried somewhere in a place you'd never think to look.  Very simiilar to trading guild cards, or joining an online session with some friends or helping a person in need with an SOS signal. everything is overly complicated and complex. It took me twenty minutes just to figure out how to get my grill out and BBQ some fresh meat. If you've played ANY previous MH games, then this will be alright for you - just get yourself a controller otherwise it will take a couple of hours to figure out just where everything is. All of the things that make MH a decent game is there. You get to kill big ass dinosaurs with over the top weapons all while gearing your kitty cat up and making armor from the skin, scales, and teeth of your fallen prey. The graphics are decent though everything has a washed out look to it (Could be my TV I'm color blind) I'm getting no lag and framerate is smooth. I've not had many connection issues with random groups, just people I want to join. Therein lies another issue - I finally got into the game but he played two hours more than me so we couldn't do any quests together, but went on an expedition instead. Overall if you're chomping at the bit to smash in dino heads with a gigantic hammer made of bone, then go ahead. For the lot of you and new players, I'd give it a month or three to see if they're going to iron out any of the connection issues. I highly doubt they'll do anything regarding the interface or the literally five story town with one guy on each floor that you have to talk to everytime you come back from a quest but never tell you who. (or it will say talk to provisions manager but you have no idea where he is located)I do recommend it though because once you get going - its definitely Monster Hunter. EDIT 9.14.18Ok so the connection problems are virtually gone, though you might encounter one or two in the course of a ten hour stretch, nothing that joining a new room or restarting your game won't fix. Also, the menu system is easily solved with a controller. Trying to play this with a keyboard and mouse is beast mode. It can be done, but it's busy. I usually hunt until my controller dies then use keyboard in town to do nonsense stuff like craft or make armor. PLAY WITH FRIENDS! I cannot emphasize this enough. If you are getting this game thinking you can just join MP and have fun you are wrong. The player base in this game is toxic to the touch. People will abandon you if you die 2/3 times or berate you in voice chat for not being elite enough. I shut my voice chat off because I couldn't stand the 15 year old screaming because I didn't roll out of the way fast enough. It's ridiculous. When I play with my core group of friends though - it's hella fun. We die, a lot. We fail, a lot. Our runs take 30 - 45 minutes and none of us care. Learning as you go is half the fun, but there are a lot of hardcore ""rushers"" who will down a monster in 3 minutes and scoff because you couldn't. Playing with SOS (You can call for help and randoms will join your group) groups you will have the one guy who didn't buff or has no clue what he/she is doing and they will waste your time, or they will scream at you and demean you to no end. My favorite is the high HR who comes in just to up the HP of the monster and then stand at base or run away leaving you high and dry. Head over to the steam forums and take a look for yourself at the viciousness if you don't believe me. GET THIS GAME WITH FRIENDS or PLAY SOLO. Still recommend because it's Monster Hunter.Edit: 9.30.18Almost 300 hours inAlmost HR 100 (91)Playing the PC version of the game, you will hit a wall and then you will hit a plateu. I don't think they thought of endgame content. Let me explain:I play with a bow, and there are crucial decorations needed in order for your ""Build"" to be suitable for dmg/def in a group setting. You have to ""farm"" the endgame content for these decos - bu the drop % and RNG system in place make it vittually impossible to attain certain decos. Unless you are super lucky - you will put in 300 hours and maybe have half of what you need - but you will have killed the same monster at least 100 times. Which gets old...like, really quick. There are no shortcuts other than modding the game itself, so if you want to have the best possible build, you're going to have to put the man hours in farming these ""elders"" in order to attain it or be labeled as a cheater because you don't want to endlessly grind for something that will increase your attack by 2%. That's their endgame. LIterally. They did give an another monster in an update, so that was nice...for 50 times, and this new monster has a higher % to drop ""augment stones"" for your weapon which allows you to improve your weapon beyond what it's capable of. Cool.The only problem is you have a 1/14 chance of getting the stone for your weapon and you need multiple stones in order to augment your weapon, and if you make a mistake augmenting your weapon, well, now you're back to square one. So that means more grinding. But then take two minutes to put in some actual thought. Say you farm everything you put in the 100's of hours and RNG has been kind to you and you have all the decos and augments that you need for your build to be it's best. Then what? Everything the game throws at you is literally no challenge. The goals are gone. The game is basically over. Until they release new content - and then you will do it all over again. To me this isn't a game. It's a job that serves no purpose. It's the single reason I left MH on PS2 way back when. Sad that it took me again for a ride. I will see it through - to HR 100 because that's my personal goal. After that, I'm gone regardless of whether or not I have the decorations to fit my build. They announced that they will release another update this coming week, and with it is a promise of new assignments, items, and a free change your character look ticket. That's great, sure. But to me this isn't how an endgame should be. But that's just my opinion. Some people literally worship this game like it's god. I prefer to win and feel satisfied when I play video games. You will never be satisfied in this game as the whole premise is to keep you playing, endlessly in a virtual loop.Hit HR 100 Last night. I'm officially done with the game. Final edits on this lengthy review:After 283 hours logged, I can truthfully say this game is super frustrating. Even getting to 100 literally felt like a job. I managed to get the decos I needed for my build only by modding the % of drops. Then, when I finally completed my awesome build...there was nothing to fight while using it. I spent a good 20 hours just in the training room shooting a post. So bear in mind that this game is FOCUSED on you spending countless hours trying to raise your attack by 5 and then not giving you anything to use it on. They dropped two updates - one with Deviljho and the Harvest Event. Both of which are about 2-5 extra hours of new gameplay.Good Luck."

On one hand the game itself is absolutely amazing, but on the other hand the port is mediocre and the online connectivity is just awful. You'll get disconnections midgame fairly frequently, leaving you with monsters that are adjusted for multiplayer difficulty (that is if you are lucky enough to find an online session without getting an error message to begin with).As of now Capcom is working on a patch, but for now Latest nvidia drivers give me FPS drops in one of the game's areas, as well as overall lower FPS. I had to rollback to 398.36 to fix this issue. Apart from that the game runs good for me, but it definitely should run better than it currently does.Furthermore there's currently a bug that makes textures appear at a low resolution from time to time (especially noticeable in cutscenes).I couldn't bring it over myself to give this game a thumbs down due to the core game being so good, but wait until the first patch arrives and online works properly before you buy this game."

That being said I adore this game and all the new features that it brings to the table. A whole lot of the features from past Monster Hunter games are returning as well in new flavors such as Palico Quests coming back as the Tailrider Safaris or Moga Farms reappearing as cultivatable items. This is the perfect jumping on point for new players, with easy to learn controls (Even on the PC!) and a slew of new beginner friendly features that only serve to enhance gameplay for veterans, like the scoutflies and the SOS beacons. Tracking a monster and battling it through each distinct environment as both the world and monster accrue battle damage and you gives you a true feeling of accomplishment that few games can pull off and with that I wholeheartedly recommend this game.Graphically the game can get a little intense, your PC might chug a little bit on higher settings but the game will look beautiful if you can manage it. Aesthetically I love the game, each new environment and monster is very unique. The servers have been having a little bit of an issue, if I were to give this game one bump and it would be a huge bump it would be the server stability. I rarely get disconnected from games but I have ungodly amounts of trouble connecting to them."

Monster Hunter World is the first AAA non-mobile Monster Hunter to release on PC.Pros- AAA Monster Hunter experience like we've never seen before.- Fighting gigantic monsters makes you feel like a badass especially due to the modern AAA graphics and great art direction.- Fourteen different weapons offer widely different playstyles and keep the gameplay when fresh.- Lengthy (60h to beat the main quest for me) but rarely feels like a chore.- Challenging end game content for hardcore fans that will keep you playing for hundreds of hours and will be extended through updates.Cons- Main quests cannot be easily played in coop otherwise coop works great.- Some online connectivity issues, although I personally haven't experienced anything game breaking, only slight annoyances.If you're a fan of the Monster Hunter series or if the game's premise seems interesting then you can't go wrong with Monster Hunter World."

The Defender Weapons is meant for one thing... kill monsters quickly in the base game for you to get to the Iceborne Expansion quicker and I highly disagree with that.  I got through the base game with the defender guardian armor and hardly took any damage till I got to harder monsters like Bazelgeuse and Deviljho, you dont really get to...fully experience the base game because you can grind alot less and thats kinda the core of Monster Hunter,  you kill monsters to get a certain weapon or armor piece that you want, but with the Defender Armor and Defender Weapons you can just run through the game with not much trouble....till you get to iceborne.

Its value lies also in the scalability of the experience that - it is true - is not yet perfect, but certainly has taken a questionable path.Let me talk about the stuff that pisses me off and the type of problems should not exist in a type of game like Monster Hunter1- [Animations]2-[Co-op Problems]3-[Story]1-The amount of times I have died just because of a stupid [A S S] animation that doesn't make any sense because my character takes 3 billion years to finish a small animation like lifting back up his sword 2 inches, it still baffles me how this exists. The amount of time its takes to drink a potion is stupid, I can go take a [S H I T] and come back and my character would still be drinking his [K A K] potion.2-The co-op gameplay is amazing and should get all the praise it deserves but the cutscene stuff is whack and spoils the fun. I recommend getting a buddy to play with, the sheer fun I had when we saw this big[A S S] Monster, and just staring in wonder and thinking what did we just see.I really wanted to love the end game , I am a big end game fan and I love min-maxing my characters in games like this, especially like in Borderlands, and no I am not comparing Borderlands to Monster Hunter , each game has its own identity and I respect that, I am just talking about the end game element.3-If you enjoy story-driven games or story-heavy RPGs, you may not be interested in this game. Again, that doesn't mean it's a bad game or that it doesn't have a worthwhile story to tell, it's just not anything to write home about either.Monster Hunter: World is a very good game that deserves the praise it's gotten. It's just not for everybody, and it's important to realize. I also enjoy climbing on top of a monster and riding it while attacking, or enlisting other monsters in the hunt. But enough said.Final Verdict : 7.5/10"

The gameplay is by far the biggest hook to this franchise as each entry has built up improving graphically and mechanically from the last and WorldBorne coming to PC an consoles opened up a bigger window for players to experience. The games combat has so much depth to it, i would say it has the best combat In a 3rd person action RPG ever which may be a bold claim to some. You can choose up to 14 different weapon types and they all have insane amounts of depth  and combo potential with every weapon having their on unique movesets and playstyles, some weapons are ranged with a ton of ammo options, some are fast and are able to build up statuses really well and some just deliver a massive amount of damage in just a few swings. Each weapon type is viable and accessible which leaves a large amount of weapon variety and build opportunities open to any type of player. The Monsters of Monster Hunter are what make the game what it is, Epic fights with large Monsters ranging from Dragons, Wyverns, Beasts, fish monsters, Dinosaur like monsters and giant bird Monsters all with their own unique and interesting movesets as if they were fighting game characters. Monsters when kill or captured give the parts as carves or rewards which the player can use to make armour sets which provide skills and resistances.There is so much to this game from the Monsters, weapons, armour, gathering resources, locales, and the general aesthetic to the game that shows how much love and care the Monster Hunter team at Capcom put into the series that it really does put to shame other publishers in the gaming industry that it goes to show you can keep a game growing strong for years with free tittle updates, bug fixes and a beefy and affordable expansion without having to bleed your players dry of their money for a multitude of In-game cosmetics and terrible underbaked DLC's / Expansions that offer little to no content.sorry if the grammar is bad or it looks rushed i just really love this game and it has made me a fan of the series.

Ive never played a single one before now, and I was unsure about it when I first got it. When I started playing, I was instantly struck by how GORGEOUS the game is. The looks and sounds are so on point, and certainly memorable. I enjoyed everything from the first cutscene, and on. The story is somewhat shallow, unless you have followed the series beforehand - but as someone who loves deep stories, this didnt bother me at all.I know this is SO overused, but I have to say it - the combat in terms of limitations and movesets is very DarkSouls. You have to time your moves properly otherwise you can wind up leaving yourself wide open for attacks. Every encounter feels badass, and full of excitement. The mounting system is absolutely awesome, and the dynamics with crafting are pretty sweet.My only real complaints with the game is more so [] to be on Steams behalf - disconnection. I disconnect so much from other players in multiplayer so often... I know it will be fixed, so I dont let it bother me, but it can get really overwhelming when you face a Monster buffed for CooP by yourself.All in all, I seriously reccomend this game if you enjoy adventure, crafting, varied battles, replayability, and general mayhem. I am stoked about this title, and honestly can say I really hope for more."

It's a good-enough first step into the PC platform, and content, even if it's catching up to the console, is rapid and consistant.It may not be the flurry of new monsters people are used toIt may not have the wide and wacky variety of weapons and armour (Though we do have some!)It may not even have the same lovable cast that many of us grew up with (Though I'm sure in a few years people will talk the same of handler as we do of our own)But it is solid gameplay. More fluid, Gorgeous-looking, and has it's own premises it lays out and accoplishes. For the first PC entry, the Multiplayer is one of the best so far. While in previous games, you found a lobby, (of max, 4 people) and entered on a mission, now you can find a lobby, (of upto 16 people!) And find either people doing what you want, OR, and this is the huge improvement now, you can head into your mission and fire off an SOS flare, allowing anyone, anywhere, to hop on in and help you out. No need to finagle with lobbies. You still can't replace people who drop out mid-match, but hey. It's progress, and very welcome progress indeed.The major complaints people have about the game tend to be about the things it doesn't have. The variety of monsters, the lack of a larger variety of equiptment (Partly in cause due to the limited number of monsters) the 'few' locals (I do wish there was an ice biome) and the, ah... 'Simplicity' of the weapon designs we currently have. Some also balk at the combining of gunner and blademaster sets into armour everyone can wear, but no-one really complaines. We all know it was needed to survive in the new world.I don't see these as a problem. I see World as a solution. While I whole-heartedly agree, it sucks to not have my favourite monsters in World, and in all likelyhood, will never seen them in World. MH:W provides it's own stomping grounds which prove perfect for the PC-only crowd to get their first taste of the game without being buried by features they can't understand, and have long-since been accepted as 'the norm' by the console crowd. The weapons take on their own style, of small, modular upgrades, and because of that, World also allows you the freedom to rescind said upgrades, to focus your efforts elsewhere.This game is a solid 8.5/10. The game has it's flaws, but it's actively supported, and most the things I find wrong with it, that I so dearly wish to see, are only problems because I've loved and followed the series for most my life. I will never get to swim in the new world, and I've come to accept that. But there's still a chance to see my favourite beasts in the glorious World HD."
879,Roz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roz-/,11,2,0,152.7,September,"21,",132,0,1,"Where to start.. Let's start with the good things about this game. The monsters look kinda cool!Now to the real review. I dislike this game, a lot. Why?Well, for one, it's a bad port of a console game that cost me 55 euros, and I regret this decision every second that I spend inside of this laggy mess with sub-par graphics. The aesthetics, and the really weird atmosphere aside, this game is extremely flawed. From connectivity issues, that ruin any chance of you actually having fun with your friends, to unexpected errors popping up seemingly at random. Ignoring those, you start the game and the first thing you have to do is the tutorial, which in and of itself takes about an hour, because you can't skip the idiotic cutscenes, ever. Why is that, exactly? I don't want to look at this ♥♥♥♥, I bought this game to kill/capture monsters, not to listen to some stuck up peppy bit*h called the Handler, as if she ever handles anything other than sitting on her a*s all the time inside the canteen and telling you sh*t to do. But fine, you endure this hour of doing nothing but holding W and skipping whatever crappy dialogue the game throws at you (not fully voiced btw despite the price), and then you're finally able to do missions with your friends. RIGHT? OF COURSE ♥♥♥*ING NOT. They cannot even join you, until you watch another cutscene, every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ new mission. So, if you're playing with a group of friends, and you both start from the same time, you have to start the same mission, each and every one of you, separately, and then quit when all of the cutscenes are watched. Such great game design, holy sh*t. The game is an absolute grindfest for anything, and not in a good way. It's highly RNG based like some free MMORPG you find online, if you're unlucky, well - tough luck! Repeat the same mission over and over, because apparently that's fun and acceptable in a AAA game. Kulve Taroth was also a nice event, if you like getting f*cked over by this crappy design. You want one weapon? Well, either you get lucky, or spend around 50 hours getting it. (Or don't get it at all)The combat itself feels kinda clunky, and the controls are obviously not suited for a PC. Again, this is just a mediocre port that runs terribly on most systems. The story itself (if you can even call it that), boils down to every character being mentally handicapped, and spending their time sitting on their as*es while you complete the most boring fetch quests you can imagine. But hey, in the end you get to kill what's essentially a newborn creature, what a heroic feat. Oh, and I'd like to mention that the credits (which seem to last at least 20 minutes) are also unskippable. Funtimes for all. TL;DR: The story doesn't make sense, and Handler is an absolute b*tch. Don't buy this ♥♥♥♥, seriously."

But still.. MHW feels like they Nailed it this time!In older games there used to be loading Screens Between each area, Which is understandable with the use of older Consoles with there PowerStorage n all that stuff.. it would take me out of the moment of Hunting the Monster. now Running on more bigger & powerful Mainstream Consoles Its able to do with out loading screens between every individual area!!I find it Simply Beautiful not having to run through loading screens during your Hunts!Don't even get me started on the new ! It's a  Improvement!! (That's an understatement)Yea I know! There's not that much Content in MHW just as yet..

It still follows the style of the series, being a 1-on-1 style fight to the death with giant monsters with comically oversize weapons. However World is better as an ""introductory"" game for those new to the series, although veterans like myself would prefer the older gen style of games like 4 Ultimate and Generations Ultimate."

One thing is for certain, and that is Monster Hunter World introduces you to a whole new world you have never stepped in before. Clocking in at almost 500 hours, I can say for certain that there will always be things for you to do in this game (assuming you have the DLC). The many weapons you can use, the various monsters you fight, the different loadouts for you to create, there is a lot to learn. Completing a hunt by yourself with many minutes to spare or barely cutting it close by just a few seconds, you feel this different kind of satisfaction you don't get playing another game, no matter who you're fighting. Be it solo or co-op with randoms or friends the fun never stops. Not to mention the awesome community that you instantly become a part of once you start playing the game!

I have hundreds of hours between platforms and I still see new interactions between monsters or find new ways to interact with the environment.The combat is incredibly well thought out and complex without being unbalanced. There is no optimum meta build that everyone uses because each and every weapon is capable. It's just about what playstyle you find fun and mastering it. It's your choice to be a slow hard hitting turtle or a quick dashing archer. Your choice to focus heavy combos or to unleash constant slashing damage. It's your choice to fly through the air on  a pogo stick with  a beetle as companion or to lay sick doots to cheer on your fellow hunters.

They went out with a bang by giving us the last boss fight that exceeded our expectation. The moment you pull that lever for the Dragonator will make you feel like your hundreds of hundreds of hours that leads up to this very moment is all worth it.

My buddies brought me to this game in the beginning and let's hunt together they said, lately they rapidly inactive to stop playing due to their working careers, except me the only one left who wish to continue the hunts. Joined many hunts to meet many kinds of hunters from different regions or countries. We met and became friends as regular teammates since the first released of Kulve Taroth I remembered. From a squad of 4 players slowly build to bigger group and created a family session at last after many recruited through long journeys, although some hunters joined in and left out.  We shared our thoughts, our fights, our knowledge, our success, our completion, our celebration, our suffered, our failed, our joy, our depression, our conflicts and surely including our carted(fainted). The more we carted, the more we stronger. Learnt from mistakes to improve ourselves, but importantly help yourself equals to help your teammates. Even though we added each other personal info in social media for further still able to contact together what if we might be retired or quit this game one day. No matter what, this is one of best memories from the game in my life. I had no regrets and I loved this game!

The amount of work that have been done for this one is beyond our expectation, and deserve to be Capcom best selling game by far. Keeping a franchise relevant is hard enough, keeping it great for years is another level of dedication. They keep experimenting, keeping everything fresh every single time, and never overstay their welcome in one success game by milking it. If you looking for a fun grind or even fun time with friends, you should keep this one in the cart. Overall, this new generation does kick the door open for the others to grow, and show the fans are eager for more. Good job Capcom."

Fashion hunter dreams come true!I recommend buying Iceborne for (more) multiplayer chances as this game is older now.Take your time :)-A gorgeous world, various weapons with different playstyles and a ton of costumisation options for your armor(-which can look good if you are a lucky fella-) await! And let's not forget about the monsters even a noob like me can overthrow (most of the times at least).Since I never seriously picked up an older game of this franchise I can not compare but I heard, that this game is rather easy. There are a few monsters I'd consider a challenge but I am not the person that should judge their strength for you. There are way more fit people for this task out there.I spend a decent amount of time in the New World and do not regret the joy I felt while exploring it. But remember: If you are not into grinding, that sometimes feels like a ridiculous gamble, the endgame will be a real pain for you (at least now without too many updates/additions).Edit1 about the game:With Iceborne (or some update?), you can now be the greatest fashion hunter of all time! No luck (except for the ingredients) needed!I am in love!The endgame grind I am talking about above is min-maxing.It's the hardcore endgame, to clarify. It has gotten better (Deco Quests always available) but also worse (more Decos in the pool) to obtain the exact things you are looking for. It's still a rough road until you can have a 100% optimized meta set (if that is your preferred playstyle. Otherwise: Do not be afraid to deviate from the meta path and mix and match along the way).Should this be your only reason to not buy this game, still buy it!Edit2 for new buyers:It has been some years and I am currently revisiting this game. It's still a strong recommendation, however I would advocate you to buy Iceborne as well if you are looking for the multiplayer experience (with random friends), as many people try to get to the (Iceborne) endgame as fast as possible.This game is somewhat ""old"" now (but still really pretty and fantastic), hence there are less people playing( - it is not a dead game, just not comparable to release). To increase the chance of meeting someone (of your level), you would need the World lategame or the Iceborne experience.Capcom provides you with a ""cheating"" armor (incredibly high stats) in World, to rush through the base game.NEVERTHELESS, I do not endorse to rush through the basegame with said armor, as you discover the New World which is big part of what makes this game so fascinating. It's a journey you can sink many hours into, but I guess that depends on your goals. If you have a mate to play with or do not mind some more solo action, definitely take your time to discover this masterpiece!"

The new mechanics are crazy fun and you can do some crazy things that are actually really fun! You can be flashy with literally any weapon and you'll feel like a badass slaying monsters with everything and anything...But that's also the issue I have with the game. You can do anything with anything! It's definitely easier when compared to the other games in the franchise, probably because of the fact that ""singleplayer"" and multiplayer are mixed into one in this game. The quests that you can do are the exact same whether you play solo or with friends- Therefore, farming a hard monster in solo is considerably easier than doing it in a party, or at least that's my experience!To give a practical example : in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite , if I wanted to fight a White Fatalis solo, I HAD to fight it in its fixed difficulty, because you can only accept his quest from a MULTIPLAYER Gathering Hub! So the quests were already in ""multiplayer difficulty"" making the game hard for solo players and enforcing co-op.In Monster Hunter World, you can do the hardest quest in the game either solo or with a party, but the difficulty when in a party increases ABNORMALLY to the point where monsters can one-shot you, whilst if you went solo they would not and you'd have a way easier time... so this is basically going against the ""hey let's team up to beat that hard quest!"" and actually pushing you towards a ""I'd better do this hard quest solo as the monsters are just too strong in multiplayer"".And I'm not even considering the skill of the players, because it's unbalancedly harder even if they're all good hunters!Tl;dr This game is Monster Hunter, it's great. Solo play and multiplayer are fun as heck and it's just gonna get better and better with the free updates that it's gonna get over time. My only complaint is that playing solo is way easier and you can complete all of the game without ever needing to party up.P.S. CAPCOM PLEASE HURRY UP, I WANT THE DANTE GEAR"

Many people feel abandoned and partly cash grabbed. Content is just running out, making the game boring after a while. Farming gems for the same monsters you got them from is not fun at all.Due to the success of the PC sales I expect a lot for the future. Addition of the G-rank, ice map and bug type monsters would be epic.The later stages of the game get boring. Just too easy and too few monsters. The G-rank would be a huge help.It just feels that there is no point to fight the non-Elder Dragons. The normal big monsters need something.The raw mouse input should have been at the start... No going around it. Fix way too late.The game could be near perfect by fixing a couple of annoying features. (MHW has it easy to be honest unlike some other games that have had to do stupid amounts of work) That is why I think it is arrogant to say that fixes require too much work or *not worth*.Statements like that devalue customers who have actually bought the game by not seeing them worth working for.Some key points:-The hit boxes are awful at times, usually mediocre or semi-frustrating. Always room to improve :) (Tail hit boxes while monster charging etc.)-Let people advance through story together. Really mean it..-Some minor UI tweaks (i.e. Decoration reroll ritual sell button should not be green and big. Needs 'take all' button)-Use keybindings separately and not in a form of action groups as in (carve/special attack/talk) opens a possibility of utilising keyboard better-Let KB use the quick menu instantly by pressing a hot key (quick-crafting, emotes, items, etc) ""F1 to instantly craft item x""A decent game but it could be SO MUCH MORE. The periodic radio silence from Capcom is absolutely terrible."

916,minh-le,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spacy1993/,4,1,1,756.6,August,"14,",176,0,1,"Summary: A wonderful, good grinding gameplay loop with slight performance.Keyword: Semi open world, friendly coop, PvE, huge content, easy to enjoy hard to master.Having hate grindy online MMO for most of my life, Monster Hunter Worlds actually did it amazingly well. A wonderful gameplay loop that you can enjoy with friends and strangers alike.First off, the game has 14 different types of weapon, each would requires hours to master and gameplay are somewhat different from each other. Some weapon types are divided down into further sub set of smaller customizations, which will make the gameplay more complex, more contents. And much like hero shooter arena, there is weapon for different type of person. You can be a range weapon user that prioritize safe, slow approach. Risk and reward with heavy hitter that make you scream the for the whole sword swing animation, hoping the monster dont interrupt your glorious big sword. Or simply madness rushing enemies to land as much damamge as possible in short time. The game has complexity, grindy, yet only if you wish to do so. For example: You can eat food to buff yourself before a hunt start. You can simply choose any pre-set available dish. Or you can dive down into the whole picking the correct food combination, fresh ingredient, doing optional quest to unlock best ingredient to further powerup you character. Yet, the differences between those are mininal, like getting killed by monster in 2,5 vs 3 hit. - Grinding for optimal gear is a choice, luck base, yet you dont have to get the best stuff to mounting down monster. You can becomes a badass with single set of armor, an optimal hunter with mix set to hunt down specific kind of monster. Or just forget all those ♥♥♥♥♥ and state your own fashion with either cosmetic item (to be released in future) or pick any thing you feel pretty and at the same times making the game incredible difficult. And while you would hunt a specific monster for its loot to gain specific stuff, every hunt has slight variation: You can see your target fighting turf war with other monster, you can kill non-target monster for more loot per run, you can lure target into bait or environment trap. Each hunt also allow you to gain ""track experience"" through finding other monster, which then create optional quest for that specific one. The more you hunt, the easier it becomes to track down, understanding the weakness. The variety is even more engaging with multiplayers and combination of other 14 weapons. And by the time you hunt every monster there is to be, you still have 13 more weapons to try out and master.The fun greatly outweight the problem this game current have.---PC version issue: as correct as August 2018- (FIXED) Game getting slow down the more you play: It is specific by save game. Reset PC might help but issues still persist- Inconsistent performance across different kind of hardware- (STABLE NOW) Server down time randomly: When it works, it is perfect. When it has problem, you cant even create or join an online session.- No option to turn off depth of field, increase field of view.- Forced lower texture resolution bug, not happen to me personally but many other people have.- (FIXED) Prone to crash or disconnetion when alt+tab- No widescreen support- Some graphic option does not work- Low level of sound quality (Unless you use headphone)PC version highlight:+ Rebindable for mouse and keyboard control, especially item wheel (radial menu)+ Smooth transition between mouse and keyboard to insta controller. + Raw mouse input is available (Oct 2018)"

Yes.Will I also keep complaining about the current issues? Yes.MH:W is a decent port with really distasteful cons.1. If you're playing with a keyboard and mouse you're going to notice the notorious 'input lag' & 'smoothing' issues with the mouse. Have fun dodging fast attacks when your mouse input feels like you're 0.5 seconds behind.2. Connectivity issues. I've spent more time trying to get into my friends sessions or the quests than actually playing the game. I've had to do some tweaks here and there like opening up ports to get it to work properly.3. Multiplayer is hardly enjoyable. The game forces you to go through the story line solo, and you have to get past the cut-scenes to be able to invite a friend. Even then it just ♥♥♥♥♥ up and you usually can't join anyone unless your friend has completed the quest first. Which means they have to play the same quests twice to be able to play with you.Hopefully they will push out patches to fix the issues listed above soon. Only then will this review change to a positive one.Apart from all the cons, the Deluxe Edition is not worth the money unless you like to be pretty in-game, so save yourself some bucks and get the standard edition.This review will be updated as I keep playing.Also for the people experiencing disconnecting issues with Steam/MH:W, I wrote a little guide which I followed to fix the problem. It may or may not work for you.Fixing steam disconnecting issue:(If deemed necessary, turn back to factory settings on your modem/router before starting this process.)1. Open up all ports that are currently in use by Steam (can be found here: 2. Restart your modem/router after opening up the ports.3. If you're using Steam Beta, roll back to the non-beta version.4. If the connection issues started after playing MH:W, open up the ports for MH:W as well (can be found here: 5. Try disabling the steam overlay if all else fails."

The graphics and sound are amazing, and if the issues above didn’t exist, it would also be particularly immersive.The most recent monster hunter game I’ve played (aside from the spin-off MH Stories) is MH Generations for the 3DS. General notes and comparison of MHW to Generations:"

930,xenocraft1212,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xenocraft1212/,6,,1,"2,849.5",June,"30,",74,1,1,"This is a review of Monster Hunter World with Iceborne, as Iceborne is basically a requirementMy first Monster Hunter game was Freedom Unite, and have been playing and loving the series ever since. I pre ordered Monster Hunter World and was not disappointed, it has everything the old games have, and have many quality of life improvements, the fact that you can join people mid hunt being the biggest one. If you've never played a Monster Hunter game before, imagine world building and biology on or surpassing the Witcher 3. The thought and logic behind the biology and ecology of all the different monsters and how they interact with each other is the best i’ve seen in any video game. The zoology in these games is what made me interested in them in the first place. In the old games you had cutscenes to see how they interacted with their environment, nothing in game besides leaving the fight for a snack, in World you can see the interactions in the game, during and out of combat. The story of MHW is nowhere near the Witcher but the game play is some of the most rewarding, repeatable, and fun combat of any action game. There is no character leveling at all instead everything is based on your equipment. There are 14 different weapons that have been added and improved on in all of the previous MH games so in World each weapon type is deeper and more finely tuned than most combat systems of other games, and there's 14 different one all of the same quality. You can switch between any weapon at any time. Many of the monsters have been iterated on for 5 generations so like the weapons they are constantly being improved, and the new monsters are made with the experience of a 15 year old franchise yet still brings new creative ideas forward. The equipment and sets have extremely deep and complex systems working behind what you can actually see. The variety and fun wacky things you can do with your armor and sert bonuses almost has no end. Sure the current meta of Fatalis equipment for raw and 5 set safi for element with kjaar weapons. However this stage of the game is at the end and there's nothing stopping you from using anything else you want.This is my personal favorite game that I have ever played and you could argue that there are disappointing things in the equipment meta like how weakness exploit got crapped on if you don’t have Iceborne, but the game as a whole is so good that minor things like that are just insignificant in comparison to all of the great parts of this game. Infact Weakness exploit being nerfed so hard encourages people without iceborne to play with people who have it. Giving people an ingame reason to play multiplayer and make friends with real people. I highly recommend anyone and everyone should try Monster Hunter World and Iceborne."

You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big-ass monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).The servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo. I mean, unless you're a light bowgun user lmao.If you want a challenging game and you don't have the phrase ""I quit."" in your vocabulary, hop right in! This is fun!"
935,TattoozNbooZ,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198441242185/,51,5,0,162.5,December,"4,",26,0,1,"The reason I do not recommend this game is, in my opinion, not as co-op friendly as I had hoped. My boyfriend and I are trying to do the main quests together. One of us can join in, only after cut scenes. Then, there are expedition main quests between regular main quests, and it splits us up again. You can only do a few things together, and it is a huge bummer. You also can't see each other unless you are in the gathering hub or join their quest, vice versa. It is a very strange, backwards way to do groups of 4, or 3 or 2. I would say, either make a game co-op, or don't. But don't make it so you can play together sometimes but not always. It is frustrating."
936,Juniper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tjjuniper/,214,51,0,343.1,December,"23,",124,26,1,"So, I've been playing Monster Hunter games since 2009. I can for sure tell you that Capcom has definitely fixed a lot of quality of life issues with World for the better. That being said, and especially with Iceborne around the corner, there are some glaring issues that are massively holding World back from feeling like an authentic Monster Hunter experience. The largest issue World has right now, in my opinion, is the slap on, sorry excuse for half the weapons in the game.In previous titles, if a monster had a weapon in every weapon category, EVERY single one of those weapons would be a unique model that felt like it was actually crafted from the materials used to create it. Unlike in World, where we see scraps of the monster that you hunt poorly glued on to the hilt of any old boring bone or iron starter weapon. This is especially criminal when you've hunted an elder dragon, only to discover its weapons are pieces of the monster in question glued on to a bone greatsword. Not to even mention the existing designs for older monsters such as Barroth that have no excuse to not retain their old weapon designs, I'm looking at you Glavenous Greatsword...Considering Capcom has sold more than 7 million copies, this is completely inexcusable. Being able to hunt monsters and make sweet equipment out of them is a fundamental element and source of rewarding progression in the entire franchise. My only other gripe is that the game still does not provide a single-player option when trying to just solo. It feels very awkward, especially if you mostly play solo like myself. This is a feature that would be extremely easy to implement and it's just a shame that this has not happened yet.I know this post may seem nit-picky, but for someone who is very passionate about this franchise I've been playing for a decade, it's just extremely frustrating knowing that one of the main motivations and rewards for hunting a monster in the first place is lost. If this is your first Monster Hunter game, I would urge you to look at the old weapon designs for even something like Barroth, and come back when you see how well implemented and original the designs used to be.I understand that this is a process that takes time and effort, but I feel Capcom has more than enough recourses to fix this easily. Its something that has been done in every single MH game before World. Don't settle for less, fight for more.edit: what i meant by the offline, is that there is no existing option when your selecting your character to go into an offline mode. and the only reason i thumbed down this game is because i am disappointed with Capcoms lack of focus on what i feel is a core reward for MH games. When i was messing around with the end game of non icebourne content, i felt like i didnt have that grocery list of things i wanted to do like i had in other games from the series."
937,RetroKaiju,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RetroKaijuArcade/,6,,1,108.2,September,"20,",761,0,1,"So it's finally here,  the very first Monster Hunter game to make its way to the PC. Funny enough, it's the first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. so you can count on me being unbiased and judging the game based on its own merits, instead of other games in the series. as with all of my reviews, I will be reviewing the game based on sound, graphics, and gameplay in its own category. This game has been played and reviewed using a Xbox One wired controller. Unfortunate to say I have not tried the keyboard and mouse.SOUND:  The Games soundtrack consists of various themes based on the location you happen to be in, as well as personal themes for each monster you fight. Each one does its best to make it memorable, but I feel sometimes it just doesn't hit the right kind of vibe with me. just do what I do, when you happen to get tired of listening to the music. turn on some personal music of yours, and fight the monster with your own interpretation. as for the sounds of everything else, the monsters sound absolutely frightening, as they should. The Ambiance does just what it needs to do to put you in the mood to go around and look for footprints and other such things as you Traverse around.GRAPHICS: many of the environments that you will be exploring are vibrant and wonderful to look at. from the beach to the crystals of Elders recess, to the graveyard of the rotten Vale, every place you visit will Often be a spectacle. You will definitely be happy to explore as Not one place is similar to the other. Not only this, but the monsters themselves are detailed very well, having fluid animations when they ready up to attack you with all sorts of different Elemental attacks. you will even be happy to take note of your armor, each one varying with a theme of the monster that you find In each tree. Expect to be dazzled with each encounter, as each one is more structurally complex than the next. of course not every monster is going to be easy for you to see from the backdrop, one in particular, which is a dragon made entirely of metal, can be hard to see Pieces of it falling off for you to collect. Luckily, they do have options for those color blind so do not worry. They thought of us.GAMEPLAY: the most important element, next to the video element in any game, is the game play. And I can honestly say that it's probably one of my favorite types of gameplay. one might think that monster hunter would be similar to Dark Souls in that you take turns Circling each other and striking when the time is right, dodging enemy fire with the Press of a button. I can tell you right here that it's probably even more complex then what Dark Souls had in mind. there are a variety of weapons from the sword and shield, to a heavy bowgun that will take some time to get used to, but is often rewarding with How heavy the combat feels. long-range weapons often have a special ability that you can activate by pressing a button, from turning your gun to essentially a sniper rifle, or a Mini gun that can produce a great amount of damage. melee weapons, like swords and axes are based on different types of combos you can Use to produce a great amount of damage. with these kind of weapons if you're doing good enough, you can essentially break off pieces of the monster, resulting in them greatly losing the effectiveness of a certain attack, or opening themselves up to even more damage of a particular type. my personal favorite so far happens to be a mix between the heavy bowgun, And the sword and shield. while it is generally a good idea to be familiar with a  specific weapon in mind, it's even more beneficial to familiarize yourself with Two or more different weapons. Not only does it spice up the gameplay a bit for you, but it is also a necessity as certain monsters are more vulnerable to certain Styles.You start the Monster hunting by eating food, which can be done by visiting the canteen either in town, or at the table When you first arrive in an area. Eating food will boost your health, stamina, and will often benefit you with various timed abilities that will help you depending on the play style that you choose. upon reaching an area, your goal  is to track the monster described in your mission, find it, and often hunt it down or capture it with a variety of different Traps at your disposal. This often means finding Footprints, scrapes on the ground, bits and pieces of the monster, or even animal corpses left from there snacking for you to find where they are on the map. Upon finding said monster, you must do as much damage as possible, and while it is much more rewarding money wise to take a monster out yourself, the game really shines when you have friends or random invites join your game to take down a monster with you. often times I find myself with a variety of different people, with a different weapon that they often use to make difficult encounters just slightly easier. upon killing a monster, you can carve them to get a little extra pieces for that special helmet you wanted, upon completing a mission, you will be rewarded not only money, but points that you can add to your total depending on how many items you have found and collected, as well as how many tracks you discovered, and they will be necessary for you to have as they can also be used as money in certain areas around the Hub world, but also they might be the only thing that the NPC you're talking to will accept. For such an example, botany Will be a major role in your Hub world as you can grow things that you find yourself not collecting as often as you need. such items are usually mixed to create new items like potions and damage Buffs that you will absolutely need in order to take down a particularly hard monster. Monster hunting is the name of the game, and while other people that are spoiled rotten in other games such as Skyrim might not look at this game as rewarding just by slaughtering monsters But they are doing themselves a huge disservice. and while most people would consider this game a real-time RPG, it's definitely Much more complex than that.OVERALL:  if you're looking for a game that rewards you for learning your weapon, and a fun multiplayer game with your friends that are into role-playing games, This is the game for you. While the price tag for this game being $60 is steep too many people, this game will have you coming back Over and over. With just one concept, it's surprising just how addictive Monster hunting can be. See you on the field!TL;DR:  As a person who's never played a monster hunter game until now, this is perfect to spend hours with your friends on."

940,Street Pharmaceutical Sales Rep.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Axanael/,No,,1,345.0,August,"12,",220,0,1,"Update to pre-Iceborne release:Connection issues fixed for the most part. Some people I know still experience connection issues occasionally, but very rarely, and I haven't experienced any.More graphics settings have been added since release, while the mouse movement issue is likely due to porting from consoles where controller is normal, things like bloom and motion blur can now be addressed.Gameplay still exhibits the same design flaws, especially compared to MH4U/GU, though this is likely because the game is balanced around Temporal Mantle, which is another balance problem in its own right. However, due to connection issues, the primary reason for the negative review, have been mostly fixed, I can recommend this game.-----------------------------Cannot recommend game in current state due to listed reasons. The game itself is good but the port has major flaws.1. Constant connection issues - Very common to randomly disconnect from online sessions/quests with no option to reconnect to the latter. Internet on my end is fine for all other applications running.When attempting to join via SOS, will also randomly return a failed to join error. In the main storyline, you are not allowed to join your friends unless you go in yourself and get through every cut-scene first, some of which are not necessarily in the beginning of the quest and may appear mid-quest. This is not very multiplayer friendly as well as their attempt to shove the storyline down your throat, both with unskippable and mandatory cutscenes even if you are playing on second or third character.2. Keybind options copied over from console - This leads to very counter-intuitive options that make sense on console but not on Mouse and Keyboard where you have access to more keys. You are not allowed to leave anything unbound, and certain actions are still forcibly tied to the same key, such as sheathing/unsheathing and sprinting, for example. A more personal issue is that I still cannot figure out how to use the radial menu when set to Keyboard after almost 20 hours of gameplay.As a bonus, you also cannot rebind the controls if you opt to use a controller. Controller prompts also used XBox control keys even when I was using a PS4 controller to test it out in the training area.3. Lack of very basic graphic options aside from the bare necessities - game does not allow you to toggle:-Field of View-Mouse Acceleration-Motion Blur-Bloomalongside other issues such as popping due to viewdistance and graphic options being very vague and possibly bugged.4. Gameplay Issues - Most attacks are telegraphed which is done well, but when you are not in a wide open battle arena, monsters will basically ignore their own telegraphs and break the laws of physics, such as rolling in one direction but actually sliding sideways, clipping through rock formations to hit you instead of colliding with the terrain, and more. A more personal issues is the constant yelling that force-stuns all players within vicinity that are not guarding and forcefully disrupts combat flow. I have had multiple occasions where I would enter a phase that lasted less than one minute, with about 10-15 of the 60 seconds being a barely telegraphed yell to force a halt to combat. A very frustrating and poorly designed mechanic, as this usually occurs during the beginning and end of a combat phase, as well as multiple times in between. Another personal issue is how certain monsters that kill you in two blows when the first hit leaves you stunned for slowed with how armor works in the game. To have access to any decent high rank armor, you will have to suffer through getting essentially one-comboed. This won't be a problem for veteran players but for players like me where this is their first Monster Hunter, it is frustrating. This becomes particuarly troublesome due to cinematic camera pans, as I actually fainted this way when I could not see or pan my camera due to forced cinematic camera when a new monster appeared, and I died in two hits after taking the first and getting knocked down. The game is fine but the port ruins the PC experience, especially the constant connection issues."

It feels a lot like they sacrificed gameplay in favor of graphics; none of the fights have been particularly challenging and a lot of the times it feels like monsters are just attacking the air around you. Environments feel a bit busy as there are often multiple large monsters on the same map which is cool, but it feels like they don't really matter because they don't do much. For me it just feels more mindless than other mh games. Granted all my friends enjoy it, and most of the reviews are positive, so it's obviously a good game. I personally don't enjoy it and wouldn't recommend it, but I'd definitely recommend giving it a chance if you're on the fence."

And now there's random stuttering in some places.Everything else wrong with the game?  Still untouched.2 weeks for nothing; thanks Capcom!: 2 weeks without a patch.Playerbase has halved and the connection issues are still completely rampant.Game is down to 38% positive reviews CAPCOM ruin yet another title with their incompetence.---EDIT: , can lose your save files instantly.EDIT2: Apparently it's a codec issue. ----The game has numerous CPU related issues (notable one is spawning 32 threads and crippling CPUs).  Use SpecialK to fix these issues and significantly lower CPU usage and increase performance on lower spec machines: ---.  (locked to 16:9)- This includes 4:3, 5:4, 16:10, 21:9, 32:9, and all multi-monitor configurations. -- : --- You have to restart the game to change window mode or resolution.---- You can't change a number of graphics options while in-game..  (default controls are very strange)- To further elaborate, the controls are nothing like any game I've ever seen before.  The most you can do is swap the L/R buttons so ex. R1 fires and R2 runs.  Additionally, practically , some which seems random at times, especially in menus and with certain weapon types.  It's  hard to keep track of.It is utterly asinine if you've played most action RPGs that exist. The controls are uncomfortable, confusing, and we have to deal with it because for some godforsaken reason they couldn't add gamepad remapping, be it ingame or via Steam.--  Dualshock users are shafted.Edit:  It was already in the game files and the Steam API presented the controller to the game. Capcom failed miserably at porting.--- Controller may not even work at all if Steam's native support for it is disabled.  It's borderline unusable.- See this video for example/explanation: -- Strangely the mouse operates just fine in the menus, with some slight input lag. Way better map control than gamepad.Keyboard control is sub-par, notably in menus, but otherwise usable. Expect to rebind stuff though.- There's no way to slowly walk with keyboard.-- Certain keys cannot be bound.Camera control keys hardcoded to OKL; and cannot be changed.Overall, it feels like a console game in design through and through.  Repeated ""saving don't turn off the game"" messages, menus are clunky with KB/M and take far too long to do anything, etc. You can't even exit the options menu without it prompting you to save, even if nothing changed, and if you decline it's just an endless loop.  It takes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minute to get to the main menu..  Some textures are LOWER QUALITY than the console version, presumably due to a bug. ,  This was discovered a month before launch and still isn't fixed..   It's  aggressive and 70% of the screen is regularly blurred in cutscenes.  Even opening your map the entire screen is blurred: - Denuvo is blocking attempts to disable DoF and Motion Blur.  #DRMFXAA and TAA only.  Both blur the screen to ludicrous levels and barely help the aliasing.  (Yet again another game that lacks the superior SMAA)Ambient Occlusion is low quality and produces a grid-like pattern on character models.  This is ugly and nothing can be done to remedy it besides turning off AO, ruining the shadowing.Performance is very poor for the 1:1 port this is. Volumetric fog chunks framerate by 20%, ontop of making everything look washed out.  Best to disable it both for performance and image quality (in most areas).  On a weaker system?  You're gonna struggle.- Water reflections only change the color of water in certain lighting and cause immense draw call increases, disable them too.- Screen Space Reflections are broken and do nothing but lower framerate, again disable them too.- Anisotropic filtering is broken and does nothing, must force from GPU drivers.- Load times are based on framerate.  Running at a high framerate significantly lowers load times.  RIP Vsync users (which should be everyone, because tearing is terrible).- Elemental effects on attacks cause stuttering and massive frame drops.  Someone could be on the complete opposite side of the map as you but your game is constantly stuttering every time they hit something.  There is no way to fix this.Voice acting is only used in certain parts of the game. Cannot go through cutscenes with other people. You have to be solo to watch them.- Gonna co-op with a friend? One of you needs to complete the campaign first! ..or start the quest, play up until you see the cutscene, exit quest, re-group; .  Just wtf?-- Lobby system is also terrible. Squads use Steam Groups, not anything ingame.  You can only see other players in the 'gathering hub', an area almost no one goes to.  There's a max of 16 people in one 'lobby' at a time, and most only have 1-3 people with only ~15 lobbies displayed in the lobby finder at a time.--- There are endless connection issues from the game servers being overloaded.  It's been over a week and all Capcom has said was ""we're working on it"".  Multiplayer is effectively broken. Edit: Patch 2 weeks later only fixed people disconnecting mid mission; still numerous issues.Item saving system is convoluted as hell and your item bar/wheels are saved to specific loadouts. The game never tells you this.Monster parts are listed as being separate for 'carve' and 'reward' options.  The 'carve' parts can all be obtained from rewards, misleading players into thinking they have to kill/carve the monster to obtain them (vs capturing).7 months to port the game and they couldn't do it properly, despite saying they were taking the time to do it properly.Now to wait and see how quickly modders fix it.Good thing there's $51 worth of DLC already."

I know getting messages from players can be overwhelming but some of the best games ever made had a way for players to communicate issues and give valuable input. MHW would greatly benefit from that and it would help players feel that in-game issues are being addressed."
957,sophistry,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sophista/,4,,1,785.0,August,"11,","1,040",0,1,"I played this game for endless hours on PS4, so I have a whole lot of experience with the game, in addition to the port. I figure people want to know what the game is like, but also about how it compares. I'll try to do that concisely.The Game:Monster Hunter is a challenging game that rewards teamwork, creative thinking re: item and environment use, caution, timing, and positioning. It has a vast amount of equipment you can make in armor and weapons of varying damage and element types, and a wide range of weapons with (IMO) some pretty cool, unusual mechanics. Most of those require parts from the monsters you'll be hunting, so if you're planning to acquire a range of stuff, you'll be killing a lot of monsters. This is why people will tell you that it's a grind: the crafting.Ideally you're playing the game because you want to hunt monsters, so for me it doesn't feel like much of a grind unless I'm getting screwed by RNG - sometimes the rare-drop gems are frustrating to acquire - but in most cases the game gives you alternate ways to acquire things you need (cultivating plant/insect products, using the Melder to buy gems or other parts with tickets or items you're not using).There are a TON of quality of life improvements in MH:W versus prior MH games. Being able to move (even sprint!) while using consumables, not having to forage for your whetstones or paintballs, being able to access your storage and all of your gear at camp on a mission, no loading screens between zones - sometimes it's the little things that bring the most joy. :)Visuals are somewhat subjective. I think MH:W is a very pretty game, but YMMV.The Port:EDIT: As of this review, the multiplayer connection problems seem to have been solved. Yay!EDIT2: You can now set private online sessions for Friends Only and actually have it work properly, and there's 21:9 support, double hooray! I prefer using the controller even for the port. I have friends who have made the switch to KB+M. This is probably just down to personal preference. AFAIK there's no raw mouse setting, but they did add additional control options for mouse that are supposed to come pretty close to more traditional mouse control for PC. YMMV.Conclusion: This is a competent port if what you want from the game is for the game to play in a manner equivalent to the PS4, with RADICALLY better load times (10, 15 seconds for me, not over a minute, like PS4!) and 60FPS, on a PC, on steam, with your friends.If what you want is for the game to play like most FPS games on PC, with character movement that doesn't feel like it does on console, then you may be disappointed. It's very Souls-esque in that way -- it still has that weighty, Monster Hunter feel, even on PC. It is not going to feel like it's built on the Source engine."

As the pc version just released yesterday I played for like 2.5 hours though spent most of the time creating the character. So here's a short review of the game (PC VER.).ρՐԾՏ:• Pc port performance is quite good.• Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay.• Beautiful and varied world with so much varieties.• Each monster is different and requires knowledge about the monster to actually beat it in the proper way this gives a feel of a boss fight every time.• Story is moderately good and engaging. • The dense wildlife sounds are so good and many monsters can be identified through their cries, footsteps, and other audio intels.• Combat is great controls might need some tweaking but it's great and weapon types and list is massive and diverse.• Tons of customization also character creation is quite good. • Environmental hazards are something you always have to be careful about as nature can ruin your day beside monsters.• Food cooked by cat chefs what more do you want man :pς๏ภร::• Troublesome design with forced online interactivity.• lip sync is totally crap.• Multiplayer matches can be fiddly to set up.• The new verticality of levels occasionally leads to frustrating AI pathing glitches.• Denuvo DRM I simply can never make myself to like it.• Some notable problems [Motion Blur Depth of Field Bloom/Glow Effects Mouse Acceleration] no way to turn them off needs fixing.• Might face problem with controllers.In the End this game is a must buy for playing coops because coop is the heart of this game. If you love jrpg just buy it. A tip **Try turning off volumetric rendering for a significant fps boost**.  Getting 60fps@Gtx 970 1080p  !!Totally RECOMMENDED!!"

It adds a lot of quality of life improvements, without changing or ruining the core mechanics of the monster hunter franchise.If you buy this just to play the main story, and then never play it again, I have to say it's not worth your 60 bucks.This thrill of the franchise is to learn monster patterns, and improve your play against every monster, while collecting armor and weapon sets. This can't be done without grinding and replaying."

Although the gameplay is 10/10, sadly the PC-port got some flaws that doesn't exist in the console version. The game looks great, even though it's always in low resolution textures. There's a few disconnection issues and we haven't gotten the new content that the console version already has (I'd think it's because they have to fix the framerate issues with the particle effects before they release Deviljho, Lunastra, Kulve Taroth and Behemoth). Gameplay is amazing and animations looks so satisfying with amazing monsters and a huge amount of puns! This game would've been 10/10 easily if not for the disconnection issues, framerate drops and slow dripping of content already released on other platforms. It's a must-buy and will continue to be the game of the year despite it's small flaws. 8/10 until they fix the PC-port."

Not to mention you start with the hardest but the strongest weapon there is, which is the great sword. It's super strong but super slow and hard to master, and there for not the best for new players in my opinion. I started to play A LOT better when i switched to switch axe, which is my favorite weapon to use even to this day.There is a lot to learn in this game, what weapon fits you the best and how to master it, how each and every monster moves, what items are good to keep and to use in the future because the game doesn't really tell you that, and then what armor pieces you wear because they all have their own unique ""skill"" that makes you faster in certain things etc. (GET ARMOR THAT HAS EARPLUGS! Monster roars wont stun you and you get free hits on them while they are at it ;) Literally my favorite thing in the whole game.I love the game, i love the monsters and they are all adorable, but i still complain about the hitboxes sometimes. You get stunned or hit even when it shouldn't.I do recommend this game but... it takes some time to learn ok. Don't get frustrated or give up!"

The game is pretty solid, it has a good player base and quite friendly to new comers. Its a very grindy game, you Hunt, gather, craft gear, hunt new monsters, craft better gear and weapons to fight the next. Initially I thought repeating a cycle like that would get old pretty quickly, however the 14 weapon types choices allowed me to change things up every now and then. You can play can through this entire game solo should you wish, but I found that for a grindy game like this..playing coop with people was way more enjoyable. It doesn't matter if your don't have anyone to play with, since 90% of the time people are more than happy to lend a hand, especially those who are pass Hunter rank 100.

While I do not have great knowledge of the previous MH games, I believe MHW has streamlined a lot of realtively tedious systems while reserving the main draw and spirit of the series. The loop of hunting>crafting>improving kept me entertained for 300 hours so far. There are 14 different weapons providing a wild variation of combat style for the player to master. The monsters themselves have a lot of character and each fight with them is like a date to get to know them better. You would get a great sense of complishment when you have finally handling a previously tough monster with grace and efficiency. New to the series is the seamless maps where there is no longer loadings between zones, so the exploration feels smoother and more absorbing.The UI and control will need to get into and they are far from perfect. I do suggest checking out some beginner's guide and video to help, but slowly adapting and improving is part of the journey and really not that difficult in the end. The port had problems when it first launched but improvements have been made constantly in the following months. Connection problems have also been vastly improved. And these had been reasons to the majority of the early negative reviews.I've only started playing with other players online after like 250 hours of solo play, and I do agree that multiplayer does add another layer of fun to it. But it is definitely not an ""only fun with friends"" game.Bottom line, it is a modern iteration of a beloved series packed full of content well worth the price, can be enjoyed by fans of the series or newcomers alike. Norminating it for Steam GOTY 2018."

ALOT.Well i waited like 3 months to see if a promo would come and it did so i get the game and tought to myself, well it was cheap if i can put something like 10hours and enjoy it would be worth it.Ok first impression with actually playing was ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this combat is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome"" (Bow)I got instantly hooked, and discovered the game is way more deeper than i tought, every monster is a differente battle and the story is cool too.The looks of the game are REALLY good, almost every weapon as a unique look and a unique feel to it.Better yet you can play as you want even in the endgame, you dont NEED to follow the meta, you can just enjoy the wep that suits you.Now the grinding, ofc it has the grinding its almost impossible to not have, but it is worth it? I would say yes, cause everytime you capture/slay a monster you DO get better, you DO know more about the monster and the feel of accomplishment grows as you progress your character.Anyway, the grapichs are kinda blocky sometimes and the game still not fully polished (I have a high end spec and sometimes it drops to 40fps)It has some little bugs (nothing game breaking atleast for me)My final review isStory - 7/10Graphics - 8/10 (at everything at MAX)Gameplay - 10/10Sound(Music) - 10/10Fun - 11/10I would say the price is okay, isnt that expensive, but it does get cheaper so if you still dont know wait up and buy on sale."
989,Caitlyssa. ♥,https://steamcommunity.com/id/caitlyssa/,5,,1,"1,932.4",June,"19,",99,0,1,"To clarify, I have enjoyed every title I played in the Monster Hunter series, and World is no exception, I would like to discuss why more people should experience these series. Also... this is my first ever review, so please don't judge too harshly.Despite acquiring over 1300 hours in the game at the point of me writing this review, I must admit I was a late comer. I did not start playing Monster Hunter: World until Summer of 2019 therefore I cannot speak about anything that happened before then. I have been playing the game on and off for the past year and there are things I would like to see in game going forward which I am eager to share with you here; however in my humble opinion majority of the experience this game has to offer is indeed good.So... Monster Hunter: World. In this game you take the role of a hunter, your main objective is to kill or trap monsters that inhabit the various areas of the world. You can then use the materials to craft equipment and upgrade it. The story revolves around The Research Commission's Fifth Fleet and the challenges they must brave in the New World.So what are some of the things that I like about this game? Right of the bat as you enter the game for the first time, you are greeted with a delightfully detailed yet easy to use character creator. The face, skin tones, make up, all of the menus were easy to navigate through. I was in fact able to create a character that actually bares a striking resemblance to myself in real life despite having less customisation options than we have now. I am sure that most would agree that it is much easier to immerse yourself in a world when you are pleased with how your character turned out. Mentioning the world above brings me onto my next point. Despite being someone who enjoys large, continuous worlds to explore; I still had no issues with area sizes in this game. In fact; I think the areas on the map (though not joined together) have enough variety to keep you engaged all the time. With the addition of Guiding Lands in Iceborne DLC it has only got better. You discover a whole variety of things from monster tracks and endemic life, to conversing with natives of the land such as Grimalkynes and Gajalaka. Aside from quests, you can hunt monsters in expeditions too, each area spawns different monsters which live in that particular habitat. Other things you are able to do in any of those areas include but aren't limited to: Fishing, gathering, collecting rare materials and conducting general studies of flora and fauna via researchers that spawn within the area. You are a part of the Research Commission after all. All materials that you acquire can be used to craft and improve equipment, making you more efficient on hunts. The next point is of course: Equipment! There are fourteen weapon types you can use. Melee weapons such as Sword and Shield, Greatsword, Lance and others, as well as ranged weapons such as Light and Heavy Bowguns and Bows. Weapons of increased rarity that you craft have higher amounts of customisation options that impact their stats and usability. As well as having basic weapons, you also have elemental weapons; all of which now after release of Iceborne DLC have a huge abundance of customisation options to choose from. Prior to the DLC I must admit the choice was rather average for weapons. Armours in this game also have a large variety and are also highly customisable. The addition of layered armours that can be equipped over existing armours without removing your desired skills granted by your current set can not only make your hunter deadly in combat but stylish too, because no matter what you do, you must look good doing it! There are more then plenty customisation options here to make your hunter stand out from the crowd! So go wild! So what about quests? Questing in this game can be done solo or with 1, 2 or 3 other hunters online. Quests are divided into assigned (or story) quests, optional quests, investigations, event quests and special assignments. Investigations are great for gathering materials and going for achievements. Event quests allow you to get your hands on certain unique items that are only available during certain events. Special assignments are used for collaboration quests and assignments with unique rewards. In my opinion questing in this game is extremely fun as well as rewarding! The reward system is based on RNG. Higher reward level quests have increased chances of dropping unique and valuable items. The other types of quests available are siege quests. Such as Kulve Taroth and Iceborne DLC Safi'jiiva. Siege quests are extremely fun and rewarding also; however the one issue I have ran into with the siege quests is it can take a very long time to get the items you desire. Siege quests take a much longer time to complete than normal quests; and with RNG loot system you might need to do a lot of runs before getting what you want causing the whole experience to feel like a bit of a chore. Even though this issue has been more or less resolved in Iceborne with Safi'jiiva... memories still remain with me, and possibly others. Let's talk a little bit about what I would like to see in future patches. Again this is my personal opinion. The one huge issue for me personally: I don't feel enough monsters from previous titles have made a return in the New World sadly. Don't get me wrong, it was amazing for me to see Zinogre, Brachydios and Rajang! However I was really hoping to see all members of The Fated Four in the New World. I am praying for the day we could see Gammoth, Astalos and Mizutsune grace us with their presence. We already have Glavenus from The Fated Four, please let us have the others too. I understand there were issues with some skeletons, and I pray that they will be resolved. Besides that, I feel they should put in more monsters from the Frontier series as majority of people were unable to experience them due to Frontier being Japan exclusive. Personally I would have loved to experience monsters like Orugaron, Shantien, Hyujikiki, Anorupatisu and many others.Overall Monster Hunter: World is a great game that I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun and unique experience be it solo or with friends. Addition of Iceborne DLC has made the game nothing shy of amazing and I hope they continue to surprise and impress. Kind regards, ♥"

The player hosting the hunt has to finish all the cut scenes in that hunt,after that you can join them through a SOS flare. And that's if the steamonline server decides not to kick you offline. Should you manage to join a online session, pray to the networking gods that steam does not decide to kick you. From testing it's not from lack of bandwidth.It also seems like the password protection you can enable for sessions is broken,as I've had players other than my friends (who had the password) join my session.The multiplayer interaction is also very limited, other players are not allowed in your""town session"" and multiplayer interaction is strictly limited to the common area orto the hunts. The PC-control scheme is awful, It's pretty much unplayable unless you rebind half the keys.For example, if you want to un-sheathe your weapon you just attack (or press CTRL). IF you want to sheathe the weapon you press SHIFT, which also happens to be the run button. No, you can't run with your weapon out, you can still dodge. If you need to heal, hold Q and then press either the left or right button on you mouse (which are your attack buttons). You can of course scroll as well, as long as you are not using a ranged weapon, then you're stuck with the left or right button. Or you could put stuff on your quick access menu buttons F1-F4 and then use an item with button 1-5. Also pretty much every item you use has a casting time with a animation lock that can not be interrupted (we will cover this later).The menu system is bad even for a console port. If you want to use the menu, you can't do anything else at all while using it. The key binds for menues and the game overall are very questionable. Everything feels very clunky and slow. Being a fast paced game, this is not how it should be.That was most the technical stuff, let's cover the actual gameplay elements. I don't know where to start really.. Let's begin with the weapon choices. MH:W has a lot of weapons to offer, but don't worry.You will probably only be using about 4 or 5 of them. All the weapons have different combosthat will be displayed when visiting the training area, memorize them, because this is the only time they are shown. Many of the weapons are slow and unwieldy and each animation HAS to finished (aka animation lock). If you are mid swing and a monster charges you, you will get hit and possibly oneshotted. After a while, battling horrible animation locks and Son of a monkey mechanics you switch to a faster weapon.The problem being then that the overall weapon balance in this game is non existing. Sure, your shiny new weapon might be faster but it does Poo on a stick damage to the mobs you are fighting. Sure, each weapon can be upgraded via killing monsters and harvesting their parts, once you have found all the bodyparts required you can create either a higher tier weapon or something completely different that uses the previous weapon as a base. But even then, the balance is abysmal.Sure, you can craft a water aspected light bowgun to fight that fire aspected monster. But you will probably have a horrible time killing it compared to using a bow or a sword and shield. Imo light bowgun is one of the weakest weapons in the game unless you can fasttrack it to higher tiers after having farmed bodyparts from monsters using other weapons first. Which brings us into the combat section.Combat in this game is CLUNKY, and not in a good way. It's un-intuitive, riddled with bugs, poor design choices and really really bad animation locks. For example, you run into combat, heave your buster sword off your back and swing at the... oh the monster moved? No problem, I'll just wait for the animation lock and... tail to the face. No problem, I'll just get back up and... the monster is devouring me.The animation locks in this game are ridiculous, when you attack, you commit yourself up to 2 seconds, during which you have no control over your character. If you happen to get hit during this animation you might take ""reduced damage"". This is the way the game compensates for you not being able to dodge something that should be completely dodgeable. Another problem that arises when you employ this heavy of a animation block is that combo attacks with faster weapons pretty much locks you out of combat at times. You will continue in a straight line no matter where you point the camera. The direction of your character dictates which way you will attack. At times it feels like I'm driving a freight train instead of controlling a supposedly very agile badass monsterhunter. But surely the enemies must have to follow the same rules? Nope, they do what ever they like, when ever they like to. For example, they can stop mid attack and just swing at you. Or they can charge you, run you over and stun you. Turn around and do the same thing over and over until you are dead without you being able to do anything about it. Some enemies have attacks with hitboxes larger than they themselves are, attacks that should not have hit you most of the time to. This results in you getting punted all over for about 2-6 seconds and loosing a lot of HP in the process. Trying to dodge anything in this game is more luck than it is skill, sure, there are some hardcore players out there (mostly former MH players) who will strongly disagree with my review. You are welcome to do so. But I find the combat in this game below all criticism, this should be where the game shines but instead it out right kills the game for me personally. It seems to me they focused more on making this game look pretty and making the food look delicious.There are a lot of questionable design choices in this game, enough to make me not want to play this game any more.It saddens me, but this game could have been epic, as it is now (half a year after first release) it's riddled with bugs, the menu system is equal to a console port back in 2002 and the overall gameplay is cabbage. (if you made it this far, please keep reading)As Qeenie would have said ""But Jack, don't you have anything nice to say about this game?""Sure, I do.The game is extremely pretty. The character customization is fantastic, the fact that you get to design your Palico (cat) is wonderful. The animation quality is extremely good. The cut scenes have been crafted with love. But unfortunately these things do not out-weigh the fact that the rest of the game is bad. I tried, I really did. But after having tried and putting up with all the tartar sauce this game throws at you, I decided to uninstall it and leave it in my steam collection to gather virtual dust for now.Please do keep in mind that these are my personal thoughts and opinions about the game and should be viewed as  such. If you feel like picking up the game and trying it out, please do so. You might have a blast, you might have a Jumpin’ Jehoshaphat time. Who knows?"

1013,Mors,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SerLog/,4,,1,859.3,September,"14,",581,0,1,"This game has surprisingly become a GOTY for me. I have played MH 3 in the past and didn't quite get it, but MHW completely swallowed me and left no chance for other games at the time.Yes, it has some minor bugs related to the connectivity in multiplayer, such as people not connecting to my SOS signals, but I still can join online quests myself and respond to any SOS that has been posted by others. Steam friends can easily join my session or quests aswell. That is why I don't think that is so much of a deal.The hunts seem repetitive at start, but completely change from the mid-game on with the bosses possesing a new set of moves and phases, making almost every fight an interesting challange.With the diversity of crafting recipes and ways to go around many mehcanics it's hard to get bored of exploring and collecting stuff ingame. (That feel, when you go to the scariest location to get soem honey)And last but not least - multiplayer. Coop hunts and investigations with my friends were something that in my list became better than the summons in Dark Souls universe. The thrill of fighting a strong enemy together, awesome teamwork and the excitement after you finally get your reward is beyond all limits. TL:DRI highly recommend this game to anyone familiar with slashers or (cough) dark-souls-style games. I'll be sorry for that, but to people not knowing the MH series I'd call MHW a child of Warframe and DS. Vote MH!"

CAPCOM has decided the content release schedule for PC will be several months behind consoles and some content will never come to PC. Given the initial release problems with the PC port, this made sense, but continuing this pattern into the Iceborne expansion does not. This was a great time to synchronize the release schedules and CAPCOM chose not to. Thus, I cannot recommend this product, despite it being a great game."
1017,10shi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dkantzler/,4,,1,443.1,March,"23,",247,0,1,"It's hard to praise Monster Hunter: World in a way that doesn't simply praise the Monster Hunter franchise as a whole. The core concept remains untouched and that contributes heavily to Monster Hunter: World's success as a game. Gorgeous art direction combined with fun and flashy combat alone will have you sinking hours into this game. What separates World from its predecessors is how polished it is. The single-map areas, the fluid movement, the streamlined user interface, all of these improvements minimize the previous games' constant reminders that you're playing a game. The immersion factor in this game is second to few (I recommend turning off certain GUI elements such as damage indicators to improve this effect further). However, streamlining inevitably shaves off layers of depth to the game, and this is the most damning criticism of Monster Hunter: World. Longtime fans of the franchise might be turned off from playing the game entirely, but I personally find that it's easy to go back and forth between World and older games without feeling like one experience is a downgrade of the other. Some changes are welcome, such as the improved armor skill system, which makes a lot more sense and allows for greater flexibility with how armor is used. Others feel unnecessary simplifications, such as simplified crafting recipes, as keeping the old recipes would have put an even greater focus on using your environment, which is one of the main points of the game; I feel like that was a missed opportunity more than anything.All in all, I think Monster Hunter: World is well worth putting time into despite how different it might feel from the earlier games. What World proves is that Monster Hunter belongs in a large-scale format. The games deserve a massive scale to highlight what makes them so good."

1020,Colapops,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Colapops/,4,,1,362.4,November,"22,",323,0,1,"After a shaky start thanks to server weirdness, the game is finally in its stable and steady state. Some people still have problems with connecting and staying connected to friends for multiplayer (arguably the focus of the series), but I haven't experienced anything of the sort.Monster Hunter as a series has always been a little tedious and this game cuts out a great deal of that. This whole game, while still Monster Hunter at its core, greatly streamlines the experience without losing any of the appeal. It axes a lot of the grind for materials through various ways without removing the fun of tackling monsters to get the equipment you need to fight more monsters.Probably the biggest drawback to the game is the... let's call it the Japanese UI. For whatever reason, user-friendly and workable UIs don't seem to be the strongpoint of most Japanese developers. While I am totally used to this thanks to old Monster Hunter titles, Souls titles, etc. friends new to the series have expressed very valid criticsm of the way the game handles menus, information presentation, and controls. This also affects multiplayer connectivity in an obtuse way since it can be a hassle to get through the menus.Probably the biggest crime the game suffers from is first-title syndrome. Monster Hunter games have fallen into a pattern where the first game in a new generation is essentially a barebones version of what will come next. If the pattern follows, we will get something like Monster Hunter World: Ultimate which will include much more content in the form of monsters, equipment, locales, and maybe even new mechanics (bring back playing as a palico!!!). It isn't even necessarily the case that Monster Hunter World in its current form lacks content, but that people experienced with the series and familiar with the gameplay will be able to blaze through all of the hunts without much issue. Almost nothing has changed with old monster behavior while the new monsters--though cool--are not exactly breaking the mold.This is a wonderful game that will give you a ton of fun despite its relatively minor flaws, but hopefully this title is greatly expanded upon in its current form, rather than re-released with new things packaged in as older titles in the Monster Hunter franchise have been.buy it or you're as dumb as a gargwa"

While I am being one of those people who does not enjoy grinding, I still enjoyed this game most of the time, just don't expect that this game will change your view about the grinding, that's what I thought as well. While saying all that, this games' grind is not a necessity it is just a tool to feel better. For the people who don't want to do the same thing over and over again, I rate this game 6/10. Now for the ones that know the drill, this game is pretty good. It is still not perfect but it is a good game to spend your time on, at least when you compare it with most of the MMOs out there. It is still far from perfect the hitboxes are a bit off, the story is dull, the monster you're trying to catch is running away every 4 minutes is frustrating and spamming the same attacks is real. The way I complain feels like this game is hard and unbalanced right? Sadly it is but not cuz of those reasons, it is cuz the difficulty doesn't change whatever you do. I have a friend that has double game time compared to mine and if we die we both die whatever he is prepared for this specific fight or not, cuz it is not balanced good enough to respond your preparation. For me personally, this is not the worst thing but the grind in this game is not necessary it is just there. At the start game challenges you and you feel like you should grind to get better gear so you don't die as much but that challenge is only there for the first few quests after that game creates an illusion that you should grind but you don't have to. In my 50+ game hour, I changed my armor only 3 times and when you understand that the game is not challenging you enough to get better gear, it starts to feel a bit dull, you just kill the new monster and move on to the next one without hype or excitement just to reach end game.It is very good for its genre, but it is just good at best for general consumers/10"

Clutch claw is honestly the worst mechanic they've added to the franchise, the monsters still run on MHW AI which is honestly a joke. however a lot of the fights are still enjoyable, Alatreon is straight up the best fight in the game (maybe even the franchise) and the game will guarantee you atleast 300-1000 hours of playtime, so I changed my score.First things first, I absolutely love this game. Fun gameplay but I love the franchise so that's a given, nice gameplay, beautiful locales and the monsters look amazing and alive.Now for the reason why I don't recommend this game. it is due to one very small detail they put into how they deal with event quests.They're timegated on real dates. It is just really demotivating to be unable to access parts of the content just because you aren't able to play when capcom wants you to play their game. I don't hate it when you force me to play online. I just really hate it when I feel like I miss stuff just because I either didn't feel like playing or was too busy to play."
1027,Gabe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gabrielplg/,12,,1,99.1,August,"10,",740,19,1,"There's no way I'm not recommending MHW on PC, with that said, the port is far from perfect. Here's a few reasons why:- Doesn't run great, despite running on a 10 year old engine and not offering a significant enough improvement over the (far less powerful) console versions. - Poor scalability. Other than the volume rendering setting, you're lucky if you're able to squeeze 15fps going from Highest to Low. On the plus side, this means the game will look relatively similar across the board, but seeing as how PC is all about offering as many options as possible, I think the bad outweighs the good in this case. - Low resolution textures and character shadows across the board. The game looks washed out, same as the console versions, you can fix that by disabling the volumetric fog but I'm not sure it's worth the compromise. - No Dualshock 4 support or button prompts. I've seen far more modest games supporting this feature, so it's a mystery to me why Capcom chose to not include it here. - Mouse and Keyboard controls are serviceable, but not great. Same as Yakuza 0, a controller is pretty much required if you want to get the most out of this game. It's better than the console versions, but not by much. Pound for pound, I feel like the console version is able to achieve more with considerably less, so good luck running this at console quality visuals on a 400$ (price of a PS4 Pro) PC. I feel like they could've done a lot more with this port, but I'm still gonna recommend it simply because you can technically push the visuals/performance further if you have the hardware for it. Just don't expect to do so on anything under 800$.Edit: It does support my Dualshock 4, it just doesn't recognize it as a Dualshock 4. It thinks it's an Xbox One controller, so no touch pad support or DS4 button prompts. But it does work."

The Xbox One controller isn't fully supported.4. The performance on this game is a joke (Overclocked GTX 1080ti just hits a stable 60fps on 1440p)5. The aggravating way you CANNOT skip cutscenes.6. In my opinion this game looks way worse than I expected. There are a lot of reasons for this game though such as:1. It's completely unique to anything on the market right now or even in development. 2. The thrill of defeating a large mosnter. You cannot defeat a boss in just 1 minute by glitching it, you have to stick to a 10 minute + fight hitting weakspots.3. Diverse range of weapons for every play style.4. Vast upgrading system for weapons and armour development throughout the game.There are many more reasons, if you have a decent PC and a fat wallet then try this game. There is a certain constant GRIND for pretty much every second in the game but if you don't like it then just refund it :)I highly recommend this game!"
1037,Rai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ketsurou/,4,,1,143.0,August,"14,",854,0,1,"Monster Hunter, a series that I grew up with, that I've sunk thousands (plural) of hours into, and a series that I'll always love and respect, on PC. A dream come true at last. Add on to that the fact that this is the most welcoming Monster Hunter game of the series, and you've got this whole package.Now, let's get to the bad first, which is probably the main reason you're looking at reviews.As of today, 8/13, this port has a multitude of issues, mostly in Multiplayer. Fortunately, this game has a wonderful community with temporary fixes galore. The first being adding the following into your STEAM launcher options:-nofriendsui -udpYour ""Target"" should look similar to this:""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe"" -nofriendsui -udpThis has fixed 99.9% of the multiplayer issues for me. However, that's not all the issues:-FPS issues, genrally fixed by turning Volumetric Rendering to OFF.-Heavy dips in certain fights and with lightning weapons, I believe caused by particle effects rendering separately instead of one entity.-Save corruption (as reported by a miniscule amount of people), caused by crashing during a save sequence.-The default keyboard controls are absolutely atrocious. You will NEED to rebind these if you plan on using KBM.-There are some issues with latest nVidia drivers (again, as of this writing), and you'll need to use old drivers.-This game features LESS monsters overall than other titles in the series.However, the game has plenty of pros as well:+This game is the most welcoming and smallest learning curve of ANY Monster Hunter game in the series.+The game is gorgeous. Hands down, the game is beautiful.+The game is a blast with friends!+The game has Poogie!+The weapons are diverse with deep skill ceilings for each of them.+The combat is engaging and fun.+Literally infinite playability!Monster Hunter is a series known to receive a plethorea of free updates over each title's lifetime. That speaks for itself!Overall, I'm thrilled Monster Hunter is finally on PC. If this is your first time treading the waters, expect to face off against some Monsters that will challenge your patience. Some of the fights are fierce and unforgiving. Others are far more easy on you, letting you ease your way up. The community is immaculate, and one of the best communities I've ever experienced in any game series.If you have any interest at all, even a small amount, I strongly recommend picking it up for at least the first major hunt. That'll leave your playtime under 2 hours. If you decide this isn't the right game for you, you can return it at that point.Overall, I'd give the game a solid 8/10. Minus two points for some admittedly severe port issues. Capcom has acknowledged these issues and is already working on a fix.Bottom line, this game is phenomenal. I'll be sinking several hundreds of hours into this game as I have the prior titles. Now if you'll excuse me, I need more jewels!"

But the reward of learning this game is like nothing else: satisfying, highly coordinated and refreshing combats especially with one or three other friends while having countless play style and build options in end game. It's really fun to learn to recognise the signs the monsters give before attacking. Once you know all attacks before they happen, you can easily dodge and hit the monster between the attacks.Also, LS is the best weapon."

1048,Neo_Bahamut_19,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zerocomplex/,6,1,0,302.2,August,"12,",635,0,1,"People waited MONTHS for this game to release on PC. The network issues occurred on console during its launch. The fact that you didn't plan for this and it's going on during the PC launch months later is abysmal.Update 2020: This is still happening, be ready to experience random disconnects at any time. Not everyone has a mother paying for their rig, so not everyone can afford to replace their CPU because some company decided to put a crap-tier DRM in their game. This isn't affecting my i7-5820k, but it is affecting people with decent enough CPUs they shouldn't be having issues. Browsing the forums will reveal multiple threads of people with mid-tier CPUs (i5s) having issues.Update 2020: Game performance is a lot better on at least my rig, so if you quit out for performance reasons alone, maybe now you can give it a try. The controls for keyboard/mouse are so ""consolized"" that they ruin the flow if you want to use the native input for PC. Simple things that could have been addressed regarding this were not. I've spent the last hour ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with them only to get them to the point of being ""servicable"". There are so many double-bound controls in here it's unreal, not allowing people to split off or overlap controls on keyboard/mouse is moronic at best and ignorant to the platform at worst. Why can't I have Sneak on Ctrl and Dodge on Space Bar, why do I have to have both on both to accomplish a facsimile of this?Update 2020: They've tried to address some of the issues, but most of the issues (double-bound controls) still remain. Some common multi-input commands have been changed to allow you to bind a single key for them. In addition to the controls being abysmal, the entire UI was ported over as-is. What this means is tedious processes for inventory management and the like if you're using a keyboard/mouse. Most ported games attempt to at least address this in some manner. You might as well have a controller sitting by on-hand ready to go if you want to sort through your inventory, it'll be faster. Proper PC settings such as FOV sliders were left out for unknown reasons. Lacking a FOV slider has genuinely made me motion-sick. Setting the camera to the ""far"" distance helps some, but that gained a, what, in-game 2 feet follow distance or something? It's broken. End point. If two people are on the same assigned quest, both have to finish the cutscene separately, and then one has to leave their game to join the other. Given some missions have multiple cutscenes and leave only a fraction of the mission at the end for co-op, it's embarrasing. This is crap that was handled better 10 years ago, literally, other people have cited Borderlands as a perfect example. Not to mention how many loops you have to go through just to play with your friends without having randoms join your session. I can set it to private, but then I HAVE to copy a code and send it to a friend so they can join, and simply inviting friends through Steam doesn't work either if it's set to Private. This is ludacrous, this is stuff that has been resolved in damn near every other PC game since the late 2000's. This is what I'd call a ""wiki game"". Why? Because only about half of the mechanics, at best, are described in game. The rest you have to find out by either reading a fan-created Wiki page, watching a YouTube video, or reading the forums. The game will not guide you to certain key mechanics or explain fully what certain things do. This goes from weapons, to gadgets, to quest mechanics. Be prepared to constantly be alt-tabbing out of the game to figure stuff out, which is why so much of the playerbase doesn't know what they're doing or quit on the game. This is largely a byproduct of Japanese game design, as many of the studios over there (From Soft, Square Enix, Konami, etc.) are known to leave massive amounts of information out of their game, information about core mechanics.Lastly, stop trolling your fans and people who are new to the franchise and experiencing it for the first time ever on PC. For ♥♥♥♥s sakes, you have a ""trololo"" sub-forum and have been downright dismissive of legitimate complaints, bug reports, and serious glaring issues that have been brought to your attention.The sad part is that a good few of the issues were prevalent during the console release and were never addressed. Typically when a game waits for months after console release to come to PC, such as FFXV, it'll arrive with a slew of fixes and tweaks that weren't implemented at the launch of the console version as well as additional adjustments to fit the platform, justfying the full launch price. Sadly, not only does this PC port suffer from ALL of the console issues, but it actually (somehow, magically), managed to suffer from even more issues.I will still continue to play the game, but to anyone else who asks if they should buy, I'll say ""not now, maybe in the future if Capcom gets their act together."""
1049,spineduke,https://steamcommunity.com/id/spineduke/,5,,1,326.4,August,"11,",991,0,1,"After a 10 year + hiatus of MH, I'm finally back.It's hard to explain how excited I am for this game - my last encounter was on the PSP and I remember distinctly how we dreamed for a MH game with a bigger scope and budget. Ten years later, and World is Capcom's first serious foray into ""HD"" territory and with it come new challenges and new promise.For a newcomer, World is both welcoming and intimidating - the variety and depth of systems are relentless, but thankfully, the game is ready and willing to break it all down and teach to those who are willing to learn. The game is centered around hunting beasts and crafting armor and weapons, a never-ending cycle of hunts and accumulating power.The game takes place across several hunting grounds, all richly diverse and beautiful - each locale feels alive and rife with history and experience. Ancient trees reach to the very tops of the forest and you find yourself crossing through tree canopies, streams and twisting caverns. The game's features a believable and logical ecosystem, with predator and prey. Mosquitoes swarm the rivers at night, mushrooms grow in cool humid places, raptors lurk around where omnivores come to feed. The game is wonderfully vertical and you'll eventually realize how many things you missed the first time round because you simply didn't look above you. Grappling hook opportunities are plenty abound and you'll find yourself swinging and launching yourself from vantage point to the next like a ninja. Shortcuts and secret areas will eventually present themselves to you, perhaps through your own discovery. Reward is there to those who seek it.Hunts are executed with planning and on the fly thinking - as you battle your prey across the map, you'll find vantage points to leap upon them, trees they can be lured into, even paralyzing frogs that can be tricked into running into. The fluidity and variety of scenarios that the same hunt can be present is something that MHW can be proud of. The weapon roster is incredible - with over 15 years of refining and experience, Capcom have mastered the variety of playstyles to offer - each weapon comes with its own ebb and flow. Many are easy to learn but have a mastery that only comes from ones own experience - there are no level-up tricks here. A better sword does not make for a better technique. With time, you find yourself maximizing every window of opportunity, dodging every attack and creating a battle flow that shuts down the prey before they can do anything about it. There's a world of difference between the first hunt and the 300th you do with a weapon. The game knows this, and encourages it - arenas exist where speedruns are tested and hunters are expected to use every hunting trick they know.The quality of life changes are very welcome as well - load times are almost non-existent, menu interactions are streamlined, gathering and many small interactions have been sped up, in order to make sure you spend less time prepping and more time hunting. The hub area has a variety of systems that you can level up and research, allowing you access to a garden where you can grow your own supplies, and an expedition hub where you can foster and train palico cats to go on their own hunts.There's so much more to talk about, but MHW is one of general excitement - on the technical side, there are shortcomings (CPU/GPU performance needs optimizing, networking is unstable) but this will most likely change with time. This is Capcoms baby, and they know if they give the PC version the love it deserves, the community will give back ten times over.See you on the hunting grounds!"
1050,Walrus-Sama,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WalrusSama/,5,1,1,"1,465.9",November,"11,",85,0,1,"Okay, so I would like to first point out that this is the first Monster Hunter game I've played. I did know about the series and had interest but never got around to playing it until now. So if you haven't guessed Monster Hunter revolves around hunting Monsters (well, yeah). The gameplay loop is; track monster > find monster > fight monster > defeat monster (slay or capture) > use parts dropped by monster to create better gear > repeat. That's the core of the game pretty much. May seem repetative on paper but the game has enough depth and variety to feel fresh throughout.   Combat is very 'weighty' and at first may feel a bit clunky, but it's not really once you get used too it. So it kinda like Dark Souls in that regard. There are 14 weapon classes to choose from, depending on what type of playstyle you want, all are viable. So the game is decently balanced as far as gear goes, can use what you want. The game's power/progression is tied to your gear, not your characters stats or whatever, so you can easily switch to a different weapon type/armor if you want (though you will need the resources to make/upgrade them).The Monsters are pretty well designed and every one of them feels like a boss fight. Some monsters may look like others but they all have unique traits so they do feel different enough. They all have their own personalities and quirks. Monsters do have varying tiers of difficulty which is usually represented by the mission rank.The game does have multiplayer and co-op is very fun. Having a team usually helps in dealing with difficult monsters and playing with others just feels overall better than playing alone. Everyone also gets their own rewards (except from mission reward money, which is split between players). The game is also balanced enough that a lvl 100 Veteran joining a lvl 1's game to help doesn't feel too overpowered, it's less about gear and more about experience and game knowledge. More experienced players generally being more helpful but even a lvl 1 dude still plays their part in a fight. So co-op's good.As for the ports performance, it's pretty good. 60 fps everywhere (there is a mild fps dip when manually saving and loading screens but that's to be expected I guess).  Only real negatives I can think of is their are a few very noticable low res textures here and there, though the game does look pretty good overall. There is a free HD texture pack dlc thing but the spec requirements seem awfully high for such a minor improvement, so I don't think the HD dlc is worth it (I could be wrong). Though it's free so whatever. The other negative would be NPC voices, lip syncing is very noticable not synced to the English voices (And I'm guessing most other langauges), and not all lines are actually voiced (speaking to NPC's in the hub world area usually has them just mutter a short generic voiced line while most of the info is just in written text that you scroll through).I can personally overlook these flaws as gameplay is solid, but some people may be bothered by these.Overall, the game is pretty solid, good gameplay, good progression, fun and balanced co-op, Monsters are cool. Game has a few flaws, but nothing is perfect.Very good game, would recommend."

This is my first Monster Hunter game but I've become quickly addicted to it.  For a newcomer like me, I'd essentially describe it as a souls game but with more giant dragons and complex weapon move sets.  Also, just like a souls game, there can be some extremely frusterating moments where I felt cheated by mechanic, hitbox, stun, etc., but ultimately I've found that practicing and learning about each monster has made things much easier.  My biggest gripe, since I like to play Fashion Souls, is the lack of customization when combing various sets of armor for a build, but other than a few hideous frankenarmor sets I've made, it hasn't been too bad.  Multiplayer is where I have the most fun by far, especially when finding a team of competent players to hunt with.  This is why I initially gave a negative review because I had such a hard time playing online due to sever issues.  I think the graphics are fine, although I had to do some adjusting to achieve stable FPS.  There are moments when everything seems a bit washed out, but I think it has to do with specific lighting in certain environments, and it isn't a major issue.Finally, as a cat lover, Palicos are pretty much the greatest thing ever!  =^.^="

1067,Applicant,https://steamcommunity.com/id/breakthecurrent/,7,,1,100.8,April,"29,",371,0,1,"I'm not sure if this is the correct time in my play through to write a review, but at 93 hours in and having had the end credits roll I think it's about time I put my thoughts to speech bubble.I have no problem recommending this game, particularly when on sale. Why I played:I was interested in an action game that was challenging, revolved around beautiful locations with interesting and varied hunts that required preparation to succeed in. I was ready to do some grinding as long as the rewards were worthwhile and I continued to enjoy the game.What I was pleasantly surprised about:The locations feel very real to life. It's not quite the open world you're used to. The locations are big but they are more maze-like than they are open plains like. And it works for me. The verticality of these locations particularly is something that I love about this game and something not many games do or do well. I found a weapon (insect glaive) that also let me play a vertical play style, with multiple jumps and dashes in the air that required good positional awareness and quick thinking. (I feel like my rocket league skills transferred over a bit into playing that weapon). I was also surprised how good the online portion of the game is. Not only are there a lot of players still playing, it really livens the world knowing that you can invite others, friends or strangers, to join in on the fun. This does often cause fights to be trivial unless you set a specific level limit to who can join. Even with limits, monsters appear to be a lot easier to take down in tandem rather than solo. This is why I chose to fight each new monster solo first before inviting or joining others to fight them. I was also surprised at the difficulty of the game. It was actually a lot easier, at least in terms of the fighting, than I expected. Very few monsters posed a challenge to me in my initial 93 hour playtime. That said, the difficulty does seem to ramp up the further you progress into the game. This is good because of lot of other games get this wrong. They become easier the more you progress. That said, I beat the final boss solo on my own on my first try and it wasn't even that tough. It could be that the insect glaive counters it or not but outside of three monsters, I beat all of them solo on my first try.  And because the game was a bit easy, the preparation didn't feel all that important. I would normally just choose one of two meals each time. I still don't know what mixing items does not do I care to find out. I never sold an item. I would use armor with elemental resistances against certain challenging monsters but that was about it. I only used the basic heal and antidote potions for restoration and only on occasion did I bother with the attack power potion and the full restore food thing. Why I continued/continue to play:The grind is real, and you grind to get gear as most people will have gathered by now. The gear is all mostly unique, with a specific set/s gained from materials harvested from their respective monsters. Each set is lovingly designed and absolutely beautiful. I grinded because I wanted to collect all the sets, even if having each set did not necessarily provide functional value within the game. I just like how they look. And you can also customize them too, at least, you can the advanced armor sets that you get access to later in the game. Once that hits, it's another ball park for me. In a way, I kind of wish I had to work harder to unlock colors or had to find rare materials in each environment that allowed me to paint parts of my armor. Basically once the color function is unlocked, it's unlocked and all  your advanced sets can be customized. I also continue to play because I still haven't defeated all the monsters. There are still many to defeat, both new (partly because I also purchased the expansion in a bundle) and buffed up versions of old ones too. I look forward to the challenge of defeating them and reaping the rewards. Final Verdict:Definitely a fun game, fairly priced in my region compared to what Square Enix does (terrible prices in my region). I've gotten into it and look forward to playing it some more."

Monster Hunter : World would be my End-Game for the entire series since I've been waiting for years for HUGE improvement from their development. Multiplayer issues for this game since the launch was almost Un-Playable. 200k Players were playing this game since the launch too. Now its gone to 160k Players state by today's date 8/14/2018. For all Players...Give it a try...Its not a DarkSoul game but the Multiplayer much better than DarkSoul Series since we all need the SoapStone to summon nearby players to make coop game available....Monster Hunter : World allowed Drop-In and Drop-Out. ENJOY!.."""

I can literally say that Monster Hunter accompanied my entire childhood. I have put almost 500hours into MHW on PS4 already and here comes the Steam version! This is a great step for MH series to actually land on PC platform. HUGE thanks to Capcom for making this decision. I gotta say that I enjoy every second of the game. The juicy parts of MH from its previous versions have been well executed and carried on into this current version. Let the hunt begin!

Despite how simple the weapons seem at first, every weapon has a surprising amount of depth to them both in combos and positioning when fighting monsters. It's addicting as all hell too, and can be really challenging even if sometimes that challenge feels cheap, most of the time it's fair and there's ways to avoid some of the more annoying attacks. Soundtrack is amazing too and it helps make hunts versus harder monsters feel that much more badass. The connection problems are pretty much entirely fixed at this time and it's not that hard to find SOS's . That is a bit annoying, but it wasn't annoying enough to really annoy me once I figured that out. I highly recommend this game."

You fight these large or small monsters with your own skill and intelligence of your items, environments and monster's info. You can go with a squad of 4-player, or alone. You can even SOS if you can't hunt the monster on your own. The game is best played multiplayer.  The game is great for single-player as well. Graphics is amazing even in low quality. Good gameplay every single time you went out to hunt. On the downside, the game is grindy for the certain materials you need. You will need to depend on the drops on the materials only, not the weapons themselves except for a certain event item which there are only 2. Those are sieges. Everything else is obtainable. No microtransactions ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and no lootboxes. ☐ Bad☒ Below-Average☐ Average☐ Above-Average☐ MasterpieceThere isn't much of a story. Most of the time you follow what the Handler does. In my opinion and experiences, I can say, the story sucks. However, the story isn't the selling point of the game. If you're looking for a story-driven game, this is not it. This is a heavy-gameplay-driven game. Involving real-time reflex and strategy. There isn't much of the story and mostly the story only serves to progress through the next monsters that you will be encountering as well as hunting or slaying. ☐ Journalist☐ Below-Average☐ Gamer☒ Above-Average☐ Dark SoulsEvery hunter will pick one of the weapons. Every weapon is also unique to their own with their own set of moves and special abilities. Mastering a weapon is not as easy, but every weapon will reveal itself, the way of the blades, to you. The map is an immersive layered floor with each map is different. There's no single map like each other. You, as the hunter, will have to adapt and learn the environment and use it to fight. Either in your favor, or against you. You'll have to think things through to fight and take down the beasts. Use the elements to your advantage and victory is within your grasp. Knowledge will help you. Every little hard work that you put in, into hunting a monster, either research or build-testing or item hunting. Does not matter. Victory is not far from your hands.☐ Confusing☐ Below-Average☐ Average☒ Above-Average☐ CinematicSound designs are a bit clunky as they use the same style as their previous installments or series but with some improvements to fit in with PC/PS4.

With that said, I think you'll enjoy the experiences the game provides you with as you hear the monsters shook you with rumble and roar.☐ One-Time☐ Below-Average☐ Normal Loop☐ Above-Average☒ Infinite-PossibilitiesEvery hunt will not be the same. You will spend time hunting the monsters again and again. However, every hunt will never be the same as you have different weapons with different playstyles as well as different builds suited for different occasion, playstyle of each of playstyles of the weapons and mechanics as well as the environments. Safe to say, the gameplay's replayability is nothing short but always excitement once you get into the hunt. Prepare yourselves as you fight through the challenges ahead. Happy hunting.☐ DO NOT GET☐ Below-Average☐ Up-to-you.☐ Above-Average☒ MUST HAVEI love Monster Hunter Games. I will be biased. However, I will say, the price for the BASE game itself is quite expensive so it is better to wait for a discount. The Expansion DLC which is Iceborne, is definitely worth the price as the Expansion DLC provides better coverage, bugfixes and gameplay fixes as well as improvements upon the base game. If you plan to buy the base game only, wait for the sale. The Expansion DLC, is definitely worth the price but it is still very expensive. Do I recommend the game? ONLY if you can sink in at least 100 hours. The tutorial alone is 1-3 hours depending on how fast you read or not at all as well as how well you understand the game. So money, will go down the drain if you choose to spend it on this game. It's worth it though. 500 hours of gameplay is average for most players for this game. Be prepared."
1077,Occams Raven,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198124691642/,No,,1,468.7,August,"18,",148,0,1,"tl;dr This game leaves me with seriously conflicted feelings.On one hand, you have - beautiful set pieces- engaging, vibrant environments - tons of content and mechanics to master - awesome artwork and character/monster/weapon designs- online multiplayer- an awesome, arching single player experience- fantastic sound design- Pallicos- weighty, complex and demanding combatAnd on paper this all seems like what a AAA title needs to be.  It hits all the right marks in very satisfying (albeit sometimes frustrating) ways.But often times, it's the moments between the action that really kill this game and make it unplayable.  Ignoring the fact that the option to disable mouse acceleration/joystick emulation isn't available (since I don't really mind playing with controller) there are a whole host of bugs and design flaws that break immersion and sometimes, break the game.1.  Online multiplayer network issues where fixed.2. Online multiplayer is great (part 2)...when it doesn't pull you out of the story.  I'm not really clear on why Capcom decided to run with this mechanic, but party members aren't allowed to join each other on main story quests until the monster of the hour shows its face in an elaborate cut-scene.  On the surface, I get it, this stops people from being boosted to higher tier monsters right from the start.  However the complete downside to this is that people who want to quest together have to all slog through the quest, hit the designated cut-scene and then back out of the mission either all together to start it again or have one person stay and chance that the other members can leave their quest and hop into the one that's continued beyond the cut-scene (remember: network issues).  This mechanic kills gameplay immersion like a brick to the face and doesn't even stop people from being boosted since a veteran can join a newbie player's quest with relative ease.3. Bugs, for the most part, have been addressed.4. Targeting.  Monsters jump and frolic across your screen like they're made of feather and tissue paper which makes keeping track of them challenging at times.  What's worse though, is that the targeting system does little to make sure you're hitting in the right direction or even looking at the right monster.  Sometimes I would have the cursor lock on to a monster that was right next to me, only to have my character swinging fruitlessly at an empty space, position unchanged.  Also, with the amount of monsters and wildlife at play in any given area, one bad swipe or even touch to RS and you've found yourself looking at a monster in a tree 200 yards away.  tl;dr our hunters' attacks feel solid and deliberate but the targeting system feels like it's from the perspective of the monsters flailing around on our screen - chaotically unfocused.After some fine tuning I can finally recommend this game, it's just sad that it took so long for an already ""polished"" port to be brought up to standard for release."
1078,Keef,https://steamcommunity.com/id/keefthedeepdelver/,5,,1,798.0,March,"17,",141,0,1,This game is pretty dang fun. There's not a very good party system you can lock into with your friends but you can pretty easily join their hunts by other means. This only really gets in the way during the initial story line quests. There is a lot of RNG to the end game because in order to get some of the jewels you need to complete your builds you will need to kill a ton of monsters. In the end though I think killing a ton of monsters is really what it's all about anyway. The joy you can find in this game will be of your own design. None of the fights ever feel easy. There are several different weapon types you can try out and many different types within those weapons to use. The combat is thrilling and the monsters are dangerous. They will surprise you when you underestimate them. All in all I give monster hunter world the thumbs up. Do like I did and wait for a sale as always though!

First off, every single cut scene and story mission is required, and unskippable. You have to watch them all, you have to do 1-2 hours of tutorials, and most importantly you cannot play 90% of the story missions with friends. they can join you for the 4 mins of each hunt portion of a story mission, but they also have to have done that story mission before. That means to play cooperatively without having already beat the game, you both have to play the missions SEPARATELY AND AT THE SAME TIME. One person has to quit the mission, then join their friend for the hunt, then quit again and each separately play through the next story mission. It's a completely broken ""coop"" system, that makes playing through 40 hours of story the biggest chore I've ever experienced in a game. After 14 hours, myself and 4 friends all gave up because we were so sick of playing so little of the game together. On top of that, you cannot buy the DLC separately from the main game. 2 of us bought the base game, thinking we could just buy the DLC later. NOPE. So we tried to refund the base game after buying the DLC version, and steam told us we couldn't because it counts hours as played on BOTH GAMES. I've never seen either of these issues in 20 years of gaming. The optional hunts are the only way to play together consistently. But to progress your character, you have to play the story. There's no other way to get everything you need. And optional hunts are just re-playable story mode hunts of the same monsters, so you're just doing the same thing you just did in the story with friends.Please just don't buy this game unless you want to play (a game literally made for playing with 4+ people) solo."

1096,Angelic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dr_Angelic/,No,,1,256.7,August,"12,",777,0,1,"I absolutely adored Monster Hunter World when it came out for the PS4, and proceeded to sink over 200 hours into the game (rookie numbers, I know, gotta' pump 'em up) but opted to take a break to play other games while I waited for the PC port to come out.  This was mainly so I could play with my friends.  Monster Hunter:  World has absolutely AMAZING gameplay, and is perfect for people who want a good-looking grind-based game.  However, I can't honestly recommend Monster Hunter: World in this state on PC, however, for a number of reasons.I could deal with the lack of options for motion blur or more granular options for video settings.  I could deal with the multiplayer connection issues despite the fact that the primary reason that I bought the game for both myself and a friend was to play together on launch and help people in low rank while we geared up.  I could deal with the weird texture bugs and other visual side-grades that make the game either washed out or the water reflections not working as well as they do in the console variants.I could deal with them if all of these things came together for a game that ran at a consistent 60 FPS above the recommended settings at 1080p.  As it stands, many people are having extreme issues running the game at anything above 45 fps with some settings on, and in a lot of cases, even if people can end up tweaking their games to reach 60 fps and slap on that wonderful vsync (because screen tearing is rampant), there are a metric BOATLOAD of performance issues, not limited to: stuttering, incredible framerate drops and frame-time issues during end-game monster hunts (Teostra, Lunestra, anything with a fair amount of particles), a certain area in the game running around 20-30% worse than other areas, among other things.But on top of that, there is absolutely no implementation of VAC or other anti-cheat software alongside the game... while a significant implementation of Denuvo was put into place.  The time and effort that was expended to do this could have been spent shoring up the game's performance on launch, or at the very least a bit more QA when it comes to it.  It's unfortunate that Capcom decided to launch this game in such a sorry state, because from a gameplay perspective, this has to be the best Monster Hunter yet, especially with the quality-of-life improvements made for new players.I'd say that if you don't already own it on another platform, you have an extremely high-end / beefy rig, still make use of that refund feature, and come back in a couple more months after Capcom decides to fix their game to the point it should have been at at launch of PC."
1097,Pzyke,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Real_Pzyke/,4,,1,309.4,January,"28,",211,1,1,"This game has amazing gameplay, superb looking armor, lots of grinding and most importantly a bunch of challenging monsters to dominate. In the begining there is alot of new information to take in and new mechainics to learn since the game is originaly a Japanese IP. But that's not a negative, no indeed it is one of the strongest features of this game, the part where you have to think and craft your own path to being a badass hunter.There are so many armor sets and consumables to collect and learn to use effectively that after the first 100 hours you realise something gamebreaking, like for example: what the ""Max Potions"" do in the game. (they max your hp out at the 150 mark.) And talking about items to learn about, you also have to keep track of what the 30 other consumables do and when to use them. And yet there's more to learn about.Moving on to the armor system where you have to manage skills that comes along with said armor and puting together a nice build for yourself with different skills, defense and attack for the respective monster and element. Also you will have to either look stylish and feel fabolous or look like absolute garbage but kick ass (until you unlock the transmog system that is.)Now you have crafted some nice looking armor with some good skills and a weapon with the appropriate element for whatever elegant beast you aim for, now comes the combat system.The combat system feels fluent and rewarding once you have learned how the animations (they feel like they take hours when just starting a new weapon) and monsters attack patterns work. Most weapons are balanced so whatever weapon you choose is viable and really fun to use. It all depens on what your playstyle is and some skills ofcourse. Some weapons have a higher skill-ceiling making them extremely rewarding to master. But most of the weapons are easy to learn and hard to master.The monsters not only look nice but feels nice to fight against. And their attacks and enviroment makes sense, so you feel like you can apply logic to most hunts which makes learning about a monster and following it studing its habits a real thing which not only makes sense but gives the exact feeling of being a hunter. However there's no need to go that far if you just want to get a nice impresive low kill time. The scoutflies automaticly gives out the monsters position (if you have researched the monster before.)As is already stated applying the correct elemental damage and defense is critical for a successful hunt or capture, but learning the monsters weak points and what limbs are severable (There's no blood) is also very important.The other thing to know about combat is that 97% of the monsters you will face are very soloable (Thank God) that means:  no friends required, you don't even need to interact with other players if that's your playstyle. I myself enjoyed the full game completely solo. Atleast until the endgame content where it just got more effective to have a group of skilled players.But don't worry, you are not alone in fighting the monsters. You always have your Palico (Pet Cat) at your side, and you can give him some cool weapons that benefit you or just build him into a devestation agent and make yourself your sidekicks sidekick. Normaly your felyne friend brings you health in form of vigorwasp spray and stations but he/she can be customised with different gadets depending on your needs and playstyle.Ofcourse the multiplayer is always avalibe. But I recommend trying some monsters solo, It's a completely different game solo.This game offers a fun story and stays fun (But kinda grindy endgame.) I have yet to tire of anything in the game with a current 200 hours on record. I'm positive I can devote another 100-150 hours and still have fun.9.6/ 10 Game. Recommended to play if you like epic fights."

The overall review rating became ""mixed"" (12th August 2018), after more and more players joined the hunt. But why does this game get so many bad reviews? Honestly...I don't really now. I saw 300k people playing this game today so the game has to do something right, not wrong.Here are some of the main issues that other players seem to have with this game. A lot of people are complaining about really bad keyboard controls. I don't know why but I don't have any problems at all with the keyboard controls. Maybe I can adapt to new things really fast...I don't know.  Even more people are complaining about really bad performance. I am playing this game in 4k and can't complain about that. I had to lower some setting tho, that's true. If you want to know what hardware I got in my rig, simply check out my profile. Everything is listed there. I can't speak for people with old or cheap hardware, but if someone can't match the recommended specifications, then this person is not in the position to complain about performance.  Alright, I have to do some real talk here. This game doesn't have bad graphics at all. As I said, I am playing this game in 4k and it looks sooooo freaking beautiful. The whole art design is 100% monster hunter. The lighting is beautiful and the landscape is far more than decent. There are some low resolution textures but overall it's really good. The game doesn't have the newest high-end graphics, and it's eating more performance as it should for what is given, but it's still more than I can wish for. I played games like witcher 3, crysis 3 and DOOM in 4k and they all look better. But people have to understand that games don't have to be the best looking games ever made. More and more games are coming with awsome graphics, but these games are losing more and more of their cool gameplay, content and story. Graphics aren't everything as long as the other aspects of the game are working. Well, I am with the 21:9 people here. It's sad that this game doesn't support it (yet). And to those who complain about the 21:9 players being mad. Shame on you, they have every right to be mad. Guys we are living in 2018. Even if only 0,3% of the playerbase got 21:9...they have to be treated equal. Everybody should be treated equal! Well, this topic is very clear for me. No problems at all. I played this game for 21 hours now and I was playing 50% of the time in coop mode. I NEVER had any connection problems etc. . I played the old Monster Hunter games on multiple consoles for hundrets of hours and I can say that this game is everything I was hoping for. It's prettier, deeper and more fun than the old games. It's everything I was hoping for."
1109,Silver,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066943283/,4,,1,174.4,January,"1,",138,0,1,"It's a game that's definitely not for everyone, and as a lot of the negative reviews say, it is indeed very grindy-feeling, and there are hunts that can take upwards of the entirety of your 50-minute allocated limit, a fair portion of the time spent simply chasing the monster. However, the gameplay is very well-done, and each and every weapon type has a lot of nuances and variety to them, with each weapon having a different learning curve, and a lot of room for mastery over the combat style. Even choice of weapon aside, that's only half the battle since the other half consists of also learning the patterns and ""tells"" of the monsters you fight. All in all, it's a game that requires quite a bit of skill to appropriately master, while having a forgiving enough learning curve early on to allow a new player to adapt to the different style of gameplay.If you're on the fence about getting any Monster Hunter title for the matter, do the appropriate research to see if it's something you would like, since there's a significant amount of negative reviews that do nothing but demonstrate that the person didn't actually bother learning how the game is on a level beyond ""Online action RPG"". For the style of game it sets out to be, it does an excellent job (though obviously not without faults and a few bugs) and as a person who has played many hunter-style games, World definitely feels best in franchise thus far, and among the top in the genre, period. The bottom line I want everyone to understand about these ""Hunting"" games is what you're actually getting into."

1130,LordBlade,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LordBlade/,4,,1,348.3,August,"11,","2,815",0,1,"Absolutely amazing.I've been playing the Monster Hunter games since the beginning, and I have to say that World is definitely a shining example of the series. There were fears of the game being ""dumbed down"" or oversimplified to reach a larger audience, but that's clearly not the case. The core gameplay is the same classic style. Pick a weapon, learn it's moves and timing, study the monsters and learn when to attack and when to evade. This isn't some button mashing game like God of War, this is a skillful, methodical hunting game where the monsters are lethal and you need to fight smart.Of course the game's been out on consoles for some time, and everyone already knows how amazing it is. The real focus here is how good is the PC version. Simply put, it's mindblowing. People again had fears of some bad port, poorly optimized and all that nonsense. Happily, none of that's an issue.Firstly the performance of the game is vastly superior to the consoles. Not only does PC get better graphical quality, but it gets a much better framerate, with the ability to play at 30, 60 or uncapped FPS. My system's a couple of years old now, but I'm easily able to play at max settings with uncapped FPS and generally seems to float around 90 FPS for most of the time. My wife's system is actually quite a bit older, but she is able to play on max settings at a steady 60 FPS. The main thing is that the game is far more CPU dependant than GPU. So having a top of the line graphics card won't help much if your CPU is garbage.One tip is to turn off Volumetric Rendering. It barely does anything graphically, but with it off you'll notice a huge jump in performance it the feature itself is a massive drain on resources for some reason.As far as controls go, mouse and keyboard works wonderfully. Not only are the controls smooth and responsive, but using mouse and keyboard lets use use hotkeys for inventory (instead of an inventory wheel or cycling like with a controller). You can set up 4 batches of hotkeys no less (hitting F1-F4 for a list and the 1-8 for an option). This lets you use what you want, when you want, without having to worry about cycling through your inventory or finding the option on a radial menu. Need a heal? Need antidotes? Need to grab your fishing rod? All super quick and easy. I can't imagine ever going back to console after having this benefit.Monster Hunter World is definitely a perfect example of the series. It's fun, it's challenging and the multiplayer is awesome and easy to do. Definitely a must have for any fan of the series (many people have switched from console to PC, even after owning the console version) and an amazing game for those who love epic boss battles in a Dark Souls style combat system."

Hell yes it is.Monster hunter world may not have the 100 or so monsters the previous main line monster hunter has but people have to understand, they have been reusing the same models since the psp/ps2 time with little improvment on hit boxes/gathering/wep movement.Monster hunter world finally takes a huge step in the right direction (even if you say its more casual) to where movement feels so much more in the players control and making gathering items/harevting not a pain in the ass as previous titles. The  addition on how monsters look and act now with turf wars is also all new to the series. No re used assets speaks to why theres not as many monsters.The only down side to World to me is the unique desigins of weapons has been lost, many looking damn near similar to eachother, Im talking about you hunting horn.The Armour skills in this game can be a little overwhelming also as min/maxing  is alot more common with every piece of armour now having a set skill rather than the full set.All I can say after 300 hours hours is, when the hell is G rank/World 2 coming out?

You need to jump through several hoops just to play with friends. Why can't you join some quests at all? Why some only after playing the first minutes of a mission? Why can't you declare a party and do everything together like in every game since 2003?- Graphic settings are extremely limited.

Easily the best in the franchise for new players to get into.Gameplay is smooth, there are hitbox issues with certain monsters but it's a minor annoying detail more than it is a game-breaking rule.  There are performance issues for some PCs, but I cannot speak for this myself as I've had no issues.  The endgame RNG farming is annoying, but aslong truthfully the gameplay itself is enjoyable enough that I don't see myself minding too badly.

This is my first Monster Hunter game and truly I have had a blast throughout. The game format may be repetative for some, but not any more repetative than any other game. You are always climbing a ladder to a new challenge, crafting new equipment and weapons. The general craft, eat, explore, quest, craft loop is mostly never-ending, but you will get different opportunities, as the challenges increase, to practice your rock-paper-scissors setups versus different monsters. Change up your gear for an elemental resist or craft up a weapon that will give more blast damage to break parts. Is fighting up-close on one monster not working? Switch to a more mobile or even a ranged weapon. Getting smacked around? Maybe a shield is your friend. Consider the weapon types as character classes: With 14 different weapon types there is always something new to try and each plays dramatically different from each other. Don't come here for the story (unless maybe you are a Monster Hunter veteran, but then you wouldn't be reading this review). It's a neat world that is created for sure, but it's more fun exploring and bumping into monsters than reading what the NPCs have to say. The only real negative for me is that the world, while dynamic, shows its cards on occasion as monsters do follow the occasional script. It's not too bad as they do bump into each other at odd times and things can get quite exciting, but overall it would have been cooler if the monsters weren't quite as scheduled and had more freedom. Performance-wise I have had zero issues on an older PC. At the time of review, I'm sporting an i7 4770k and a 980 Ti and getting 60FPS in most areas at 1080p. Played all my hours with a Steam Controller, which works quite well. If any of this sounds good to you, give this game a try. If the fear of doing the same thing over and over has you down, maybe try something else, or pick this up on a sale where you think you can get enough play to make it wortwhile.Edit: Took a long break from this but picked it up again at HR 47. Still so much more game I haven't experienced and Capcom keeps updating and adding new quests and monsters."

Sometimes you will face a monster that only runs, other times the same type but cheeses one damn move and KO's you in two hits, other times another creature will show up and have a ""Turf War"" Everyone else who has downvoted this game is only due to hardware issues, I have had no problems running this game at 1080p with nothing but 50-60fps(Specs for people who care)EVGA 1060 FTW 3GBAMD 6350 6-Core Overclocked to 4.5ghz (Stock CPU Cooler)16GB RAMMSI 970 motherboard EVGA Bronze 700 power supplyI cannot compare with complaints about servers as well, My friend and I who I have played with has had no problems except the few DC's on launch day, the only other time we have ran into issues is during the attempt of trying to make a public session insteado of a private, and running into 50382-MW1, which was easily solved by my friend providing an invite code to his public lobby.Overall the complaints towards this game seem to only be for low end computers (this is a 2017-18 game afterall) Expect it to run into problems with outdated drivers and CPU's. As Far as it being ""CPU intensive"" is a stretch, Ive have it run only to reach a max of 50% (this was with Youtube, and Discord running) If you are looking for a fun game to sink time into with friends, with a grind that doesnt get boring, fights that are different and fun with each encounter (for the first 100 hours) and a decent soundtrack to compliment those encounters, MH:W is for you."

No more ""I'm good now"" animation when chugging potions (You can actually run while drinking them)- SlingerI got to love to have a ranged option that doesn't render you imobile, then again everything in this game is made to feel dynamic.- WeaponsNew moves and the graphics also helps to flesh them out.- MantlesThese are new lifesavers in the game, other than the palicoes sometimes.And now we go to the...Cons:- Feels ""Incomplete""While yes there are new monsters in this game there's only so much you can hunt, Monster Hunter: World bring us 31 large monsters to hunt while Freedom Unite had 58, doesn't seem like a large difference, but hunting the same monster over and over again gets boring really fast.- It's not as rewardingIn Freedom Unite I remember fighting Kirin for the first time, the damn thing kept jumping around while I ran after it with a greatsword only to be struck by lighting and get sent back to the camp, here in world it's most like the same, but some aspects of the game like fast travel and higher mobility makes the game easier in a way. Therefore when you finally slay that annoying elder dragon, it doesn't feel as rewarding as the other ones.- PalicoesI honestly preferred the old ones, when you build their trust and companionship towards you, they even sacrifice themselves to save you, in World, sure it happens sometimes but unless you ping like a madman, they often forget that you exist and instead start to chug a potion while you're stunned.- No Akantor nor Nargacuga (yet)It's more of a personal con but still a con nonetheless, Akantor is my favorite elder dragon (his armor is awesome) and Nargacuga (the upcoming DLC Iceborne will bring him back) being a great and enjoyable fight.Honestly I'm quite biased since I love Monster Hunter, being a fan since wii release with Tri, I'm not quite fit to say how good is the game by itself, but-Compared to other games World lacks in replayability and content (I'm looking at you transmog) but as a starting point is a really good game to go with, it's rather easier than other games and also got a ton of new stuff to try out.To me, it can be enjoyable to hangout with friends or challenge yourself to a solo match against its monsters.Personal Grade: 9/10Unbiased Grade: 7/10Thank you Capcom for making this awesome game."

Well worth the full purchase price.Needs more monsters which are already on their way for free.Needs a bit more variety in the armor and weapon looks. Talk of this already in the works and part of more monsters.What can I say. I love Monster Hunter and World has done nothing but reinforce that. At minimum spec my machine will happily do 60fps at Mostly medium settings. Some tweaking was required but which game doesn't on PC these days. Also you don't need 60 FPS but I will admit this time I doesn't hurt.The game play is great and everything I love about Monster Hunter. You have to learn your Monsters tells. Deliberate inputs on you attacks. Its not just button mash and hope for the best. Attacks feel deliberate and meaty. Its absolutly satisfying getting the big hits off or to get thumped by some of the Monsters.And the quality of life additions are absolutly fantastic. No more mindless grinding and menu navigation to craft simple staple items. It does it on the fly as you have items in your inventory to do it.Multiplayer has been great fun with a planned group.ConsYes there are connection issues but I've had the same issues with other games through steam previously and they did eventually got fixed. Sadly the new UI update was badly times to conincide with the release so that hasn't helped. But its only been a week and already parts of it has been resolved. The rest will come.Playing with randoms on the fly is a great idea but can at times be really tedious when people can fail missions or mess up captures due to the next issue.The communication system is actually pretty poor and this is where it being a console port really shows. It just doesn't have the vesititlity of what you expect a Multiplayer PC game to have. ITs not terrible and does the job but it could be better.Tobi-Kadashi is just too much Zinogre to not be Zinogre.--Overall I highly recommend this for anyone interested or veterans of  Monster Hunter.

I can not believe how many people seem to base their reviews purely on some mostly minor PC-Port related issues. It often comes to the point were not the game itself gets reviewed, but it gets compared only to the PS4 Version.Sure... especially in the two weeks after its release PC players encountered alot of connection problems (of cause me too). I can understand how that can lead to frustration in the playerbase.BUT... even with those and other problems taken into consideration that occured, I never thought of giving WORLD a bad review, because the game is a masterpiece. Being someone who has played alot of Monster Hunter Games before WORLD, I can say without hesitation, that this is in my opinion the best game in the franchise so far. It is DEFINITLY the Monster Hunter with the most fluent and satisfying gameplay ever and I am so glad that this game can get more people into the franchise. I really hope that noone who is thinking about buying this game (especially as a MH newcomer) gets discouraged by alot of these outrageous reviews. The connection issues as well as other problems coming from the early time of the PC release are long gone and Capcom is releasing DLC quite fast now.So... i really hope that this review contributed at least a little to you buying the best game in the MH franchise.And if so: Good Hunt!"
1186,Taiga,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tigerwaw/,3,,1,498.9,September,"22,",447,0,1,"I have never played a Monster Hunter game before, so World was my first experience with the series. I wasn't even planning on buying it until a few days before release, and it turned out to be one of the most enjoyable games that I've played in a long time.The environments in the game are Large, Rich, and Visually interesting; Every one of them being highly different from the last.Each landscape hosts a plethora of creatures, ranging from the many different kinds of fish that inhabit the new worlds lakes and rivers, to the large monsters that the game mainly revolves around.Co-op is a major part of Monster Hunter, and it works exceptionally well. Every weapon-type can be built in different ways, so you and your squad can compliment each other by optimizing your build to control the monster, heal your teammates, or just do as much damage as possible.A minor complaint is the inability to progress through the main storyline together without jumping through the hoops of individually entering the quest to watch the cutscene, before leaving and joining your friends quest so you can play together. It befuddles me a bit, considering that later on in the game certain quests use shared cutscenes where you can even see all the player characters simultaneously.The main story/questline however is, atleast to me, a rather small part of the game as a whole as once you finish it you unlock the levelling system, which allows you to unlock new quests, items and armor pieces.If I could say one negative thing about the game it would be that a few of the monsters are very similar to eachother, not just in terms of gameplay, but also physical likeness, which is a shame, but the game makes up for it with the fourteen highly different weapon-types that all have unique attacks and combos which keeps the game interesting for me even after clocking nearly 400 hours into it.Monster Hunter World is the best game I've had the privilege of playing this year, and I would like to thank the devs and community for giving me such a good experience!"

At first I wasn't too impressed. There was a lot of connectivity issues and overall I do still think that the online multiplayer is needlessly tedious and annoying at times due to cutscenes that are required to be seen before you can join someone else's quest or someone else joins yours. (This is only for new quests not done yet, story mode stuff.) I just wish that it was a lot easier to party up with people and be together all of the time instead of having to party up, disband, party up again, disband, over and over and over again. Also, randoms can be very good or very stupid. It's definitely best to play in a party of four with your friends rather than relying on randoms. Pros:- the graphics are awesome- the sound is very good as well- pretty 'epic' fights- large variety of weapons to use for lots of different play styles- game runs quite smooth if you have the hardware to run it properly- Palicos are super cute- it's cool to see two or more monsters fighting each other- the game seems pretty well optimized for PC, but then again I use a controller- no mandatory day one DLC crap necessary to enjoy the gameCons:- the game is very grindy, so if grinding out materials isn't your thing, this game isn't for you because you WILL spend a lot of time doing the same things over and over and over again- many things in the game are not explained very well- while the combat isn't terrible, it's not good either... you basically just do the same things over and over while rolling / dodging - huge leap in difficulty after you hit high rank- playing solo feels really boring, at least for me... although it seems far easier than playing multiplayer -monster AI sometimes doesn't make any sense-normal ""aggro"" systems in most games is totally different in this game-having to sharpen weapons in battle (even hammers!) is annoying and stupid-the amount of time it takes to use items in battle - like potions, etc - is ridiculous and often leads to deaths-some game mechanics feel way more random than they should be, like mounting monsters-unless you grind a lot, you're never going to have enough money or materials to craft what you need- the storyline is stupid, but who really cares?- while ""friendly fire"" isn't on in the sense that you can damage each other, friendly hits do often cancel your own attacks and bring you out of a charged attack, which is super annoying, especially with 4 players- damage seems inconsistent. sometimes you take very little damage and other times you can get hit with something that kills you in one shot if you're not at max HP. - many weapons feel very slow and it is quite easy to miss a LOT of attacks- getting stunned/dazed lasts a long time and can easily result in you getting killed- always running out of stamina gets really annoying- enemy monsters are damage sponges that have what seems to be a billion HP - without resorting to the internet for information, it can be very hard to find certain items or to unlock certain quests because you get little to no info in the game- lots of ""Leeroy Jenkins"" type people in multiplayer- monsters always running away in battle and having to chase after them several times gets annoying AF- you can't cancel certain attacks in the middle of attacking and instead of have to watch and wait as your character swings their weapon around like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the animation is finished- not being able to do certain things multiplayer, like go on Grimalkyne quests and whatnot (the stuff only shows up for the party leader)- can't quickly and easily join hosted quests/optionals/events with a friend... you basically HAVE TO chat and both join the same thing at the same time, hopefully before the player list fills up- always being low on money (crafting higher rank gear and weapons costs a ton of money)- the Melder makes no sense at allOverall I'd say that there's a bunch of annoying aspects of the game (IMHO) but overall the game isn't bad, but the bad/annoying aspects of it outweigh the good. If you're into grindy cooperative stuff and have 3 friends to play with and don't mind using the internet for info so you can powerlevel your way through the game and grind out all your materials, it's not so bad."

For I absolutely love it.I purchased it back on PS, and have been a fan since.Why a negative rating then?Well, for one clear reason. The game crashes randomly, a lot. I get the crash known as ERR12, which tells me that my graphics drivers have crashed. This is the same crash that reviewers got prior to launch, and the same crash that Capcom said they had fixed.However, it has not been fixed. I have done absolutely everything on my part to make sure that I wasn't the cause, but I am not. Everything is pristinely updated, every rumored fix and analysis has been made. And the graphics driver itself doesn't even crash - add that my rig is more than capable of handling the game (and it does run beautifully when it does).No; this is simply the game shutting down. And I can turn it right back up. Which, of course wouldn't be a problem except for the progress lost. Now I have completed the game, albeit an uphill battle against the ERR12 - but I have grown so jaded by it that I have to say; it is borderline unplayable. Every single hunt is done in fear of losing all progress. The game is not fun, when all you think about is ""Ah I just got this rare material, I hope I don't crash"". And all joy is absolutely sucked out of you when it then does crash, just as you're about to kill a monster or have collected particularly good materials.And when you're playing with friends, neither is it particularly a happy occassion to have to say ""all right guys, I crashed, we have to restart"" over and over.I also happen to know I am not the only one getting this recurring, random crash.So developers, please. I beg of you, fix this problem with your game. I have heard absolutely nothing from you. Be transparent. I love this game, and I want to play so many thousand hours if possible. But not in this state.And this is why, I have to rate the game negatively. I love it, but it is borderline unplayable."

This is the biggest reason for the thumbs up.Con: Why they changed this is beyond me. If you're getting this game so you can co-op with someone be aware. You cannot co-op the main storyline together. It will tell you that you haven't progressed far enough in the storyline as to be able to play together. It is based off which cutscenes you have watched. This was a huge let down for me and my player 2.Personal con: It's nothing like MH portable 3rd HD which is my personal favourite. It for sure has the stronger online/co-op experience.Edit: there is a semi work around for co-op through the storyline. You both have to watch all the cutscenes leading up to the fight with a monster. When you can shoot an SOS flare, one player has to back out and join the other. May not always work."

So off rip the game gets a recommend from me. There is some issues with disconnects from time to time, but 95% of the time I dont have any major issues at all. Monsters are challenging, and continue to be so even in the late stages of the game. There's a few things that could really use some PC optimizations like the menus, you cant click back from the menus you have to manually hit the back button every time. The item process is a little choppy as well because of this. All in all these are minor issues and once you get used to them dont hinder play at all. The dev team seems to be very responsive as well, so if there are any major issues with the game I'm sure they will be patched.

Coming from the perspective of a veteran player that used to clock well over 500+ hours in Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and reached 2G/G2, I feel like there's a lot of things this game does right and better than the predecessors, but it still has some minor flaws. I am not going to be covering what the game is about and such, you are better off reading other reviews. I will be covering the differences between World and its predecessors. Could it use some improvements? Yes!!! The game will definitely bore some players like myself after a while because while updates are happening, the small pool of monsters will bore a lot of people, leaving them to move onto MHGU until World either updates itself and add a major expansion or players will casually hop on to check on new updates. I currently play both MHGU and World right now, and I love both equally, but there are some things World does that simply frustrates me with it’s lazy weapon designs and horribly implemented concepts such as Slingers, which you all know I hate by this point. I would rate World as a 8/10, while not a perfect game, it does a lot of things right that the series needed to advance itself and cater to newer audiences. I hope you find my review helpful."

I'm hooked.The quality of gameplay is top-notch, rivaling any action-rpg past or present to my knowledge. The story is pretty threadbare, but it's neat that it is actually about the monsters, and does what it ought to. It runs brilliantly if you have the hardware to support it, though my own hardware's showing signs of aging, with my CPU being a 4790k. I do have a RTX 2070 though, and it runs very smoothly for me.I just can not recommend this game enough. Learn the quirks of combat, take in your surroundings, learn the monsters abilities, and find those one or two weapon types that speak to you... I don't think you'll regret it.If Capcom can continue to keep up the steady stream of new and engaging content, with a community tilt that keeps players active and participating, I think they have something truly special on their hands that will serve as a big breakthrough for the series.... garnering new and committed fans to this long-going, and well-beloved franchise.5/5"

The DC issues have been widely noted/affected by the STEAM CLIENT CHAT, as opposed to the game server's itself. I highly doubt that people have bothered updating/attempting to fix the issues after posting up their negative comments, and the vast majority of the ""complaints"" were based around DC'ing and such. Fix (of sorts) for the Multiplayer DC: Secondary notion/option: > Personally, the -tcp one is the one that worked for me. Kicked off the new Steam chat client in lieu of the older version, and I've had a DC once in a blue moon since then. Works far better than not doing so.My thoughts on the game:This was my first Monster Hunter game I've ever played. I was super excited to try it out on the PC port, and, despite my pc being extremely behind on specs (CanIRunIt actually noted my computer as being unable to play the game at all), I have found this game to be amazing.Yes, I have to run it on lower graphics/specs, but it makes the combat basically 100% smooth (or as smooth as you could hope from an underspec'd computer), which will honestly make or break the game entirely. I should know- the frustration of the intial fighting fps drops almost actually caused me to put the game down and walk away from it. So I fine-tuned down the settings until I had a smooth combat/frames while playing, and that made ALL of the difference between having a frustrating time while playing the game and having a blast. I also run the game on mouse/keyboard, and once you change a few keybinds, it doesn't feel nearly as clunky as the default settings and actually makes for decent gameplay experience. Solo is fun. Multiplayer even moreso, assuming people are working as a TEAM and not purposefully hindering each other (IE. constantly smacking another teammate out of their combos, as teammates's attacks CAN hit (though doesn't really do much damage as far as I can tell) and can cause interrupts), but I've not really had much issue since I rarely do any pugging/public partying personally. Monster hunts are dynamic, and the amount of craziness that can ensue when multiple large monsters come into conflict during a hunt can instantly turn an ""easy hunt"" into a fiesta. Status effects, elements, weaponry, and even the sheer terrain can also play huge factors during the fights, which pulls you into the fight and beckons you to be constantly aware of your surroundings and how you approach each situation. Storyline is not necessarily the shining point of this game, but I wouldn't expect it to be so in this sort of game. You're here for the HUNTS, the CAPTURING/KILLING, and TRACKING of monsters. Storyline is something that can be expected to be on the backburners when the combat system, item gathering/looting, and crafting systems/trees are to be held in higher regards and importance in a game like this. TL;DR: Its combat system and the entire hunting of monsters is executed very well. Story isn't great, but not really the reason in picking up this game to begin with IMO. Multiplayer is great, and the fix has worked fantastically well. If you want to play the game to play it because you want to hunt monsters, then get the game. It is amazing.9/10 (Good storyline would have bumped it up to a 10 for me.)"

The world feels like a living eco system, and has beautfiul areas at max settings. The combat is varied, as not only do the 14 different weapon types have seperate animations, they have their own set of combos as well. This makes each type of weapon play in unqiue ways, which makes the system always feel fresh. The premise is simple, but their are many intricacies in the gameplay that give it depth."

Fighting is a lot smoother, especially with ranged weapons, map design is awesome and graphics are of course top notch, with 70 fps on a gtx 1060 (high). Unfortunately a few things have been dumbed down(easier, less time consuming/grindy), like gathering and quest preparation. But that's not a big deal, since it has the same charm as the previous installations.A big minus point is the multiplayer system. They should've stuck wholly with the old system of SP and MP separated or to make a new system from scratch and not mix things up like they did.4 player per quest in a session of up to 16 people who can only see themselves in the ""Gathering hall"".. Where nobody goes. It's still like singleplayer, but with invisible coop friends in the lobby who can't join you on every quest.Quite a few quests have cutscenes, which disables coop for until the cutscene has been completed.Denuvo is also a bummer... But what can you do? (yeah yeah boycott.. But I made an exception on this game) Probably some people of the higher management have decided on this.There are also some minor bugs with server connectivity/stability. But otherwise, very solid game.Definitely recommended for fans of the previous games.Quite a few friends of mine who are new to the series love it! But it's not for everyone of course."

It was on sale, so i had to buy it, and lemme tell you, i have never been so happy before about buying a game for 47 euros. It might be a bit salty for my wallet, but it was worth it.First things first, Customization - I took me an hour to customize my character. The variety of hair styles, appearance, emotions, voice is just huge. For example if you try to make yourself, it will take some time to decide between which lip shape to choose.Second, Landscapes - I just love, LOVE games with some beautiful sceneries. When i play open world games like this i really love to take alot of screenshots, so this is just perfect for me.Third, Story - Story is like one of the important things for me, when i pick up a new game. Since i have played this only for an hour, i can't really tell anything about it yet. So far i have seen some characters, and some action going on at the beginning of the game.Forth, Multiplayer - As much as i have seen other streamers play this game, the monster fights are HARD, so its SUPER handy if you have a friend to play this game with, because its much easier like that. So this is a really good game to pick up, if you are looking for a game to play with your friends as well.Overal - The game is beautiful and full of adventure. The game might have costed 47 euros, but i am so damn positive, that i won't regret the decision of buying it.P.S. Since the game is about fighting monsters, this will be one damn good game to grind, with endless monster fights. Gotta get my game face on ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)"

It still keeps the fun and engaging battle mechanics of the old games, while also adding a plethora of new features & quality of life changes. Anybody who is a long time MH player will immediately notice how everything is more convenient. Whetstone's, Pickaxes, and Bug nets are all now an infinite use items that are always within your inventory, so no need to buy or collect them.  No more having to paintball monsters to track them; now, they have added a new ""scoutfly"" system which helps with material/monster tracking through interacting with footprints/markings. Cool drinks are only needed in specific situations, and no longer needed for the entire zone. (It appears that Hot drinks may have been removed from the game). Every weapon has a new ability or functionality introduced. This is also the most beginner friendly/forgiving of all the other games in the series; But that's not neccessarily a bad thing. But, I do hope they would bring back the Leviathan hunts, G-Rank missions, Armor transmogs, and underwater battles with the next game.All in all 10/10 Capcom. This one of the few IP's you haven't tarnished yet. And THANK YOU for not adding loot boxes & ""cancerous"" microtransactions."

I'm going to naturally vote yes for this game because I love both Monster Hunter World: Iceborne and the series of Monster Hunter as a whole but let's mention the elephant in the room first before I go into the review.The Iceborne update caused a lot of problems for PC users. Frequent crashes, lowered performance, increased GPU power being taken, many players rendered unable to even be able to run the game. I actually didn't experience this issue until the second update into Iceborne where they changed their anti-cheat, where I started seeing very noticeable performance plummeting. With that said, I could almost not recommend this game.But, these are things you can get past or fix if you're interested in Monster Hunter. As a series veteran (Playing since Monster Hunter Tri on the Wii) this game goes above and beyond what is expected of a future title of a franchise whilst adding new improvements to the game and numerous quality of life changes to make the game more accessible to new fans while keeping it fresh and interesting for fans of old.If you don't know the gameplay of Monster Hunter, why are you here? Of all the places to learn about what a game is, a buried Steam Review probably isn't the best place. But I'll run through it anyway. Monster Hunter is a game series where you hunt monsters and slay them (or capture them) and use materials you've acquired from their body to craft new armor and weapons for you to use. Gradually you grow stronger and stronger and tackle more difficult monsters as you rise to the top, perfecting your skills as a hunter and making your ideal armor set. The gameplay loop can be difficult and slow for new players, as hunting time varies depending on how familiar you are with the game.Hunts can range anywhere from 10-30 minutes or even a full 50 minutes if you're really struggling. The true appeal of the game for me personally is gradually learning a monsters behaviors and patterns and punishing each attack you're familiar with using one of your own devastating attacks from a large repertoire of moves each of the 13 weapons has. The thrill of the hunt comes from mastering your opponent and being duly rewarded for your effort, or challenging yourself in the Arena to try and slay a monster in record times.The levels in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne are huge, vast and expansive ecosystems full of thriving life. Your first time in any of the gigantic areas of the game may leave you lost for long periods of time until you adjust yourself to your surroundings. But once you do, even when you grow accustomed to what each level has to offer, you appreciate how beautifully developed they all are.With all that said, it's all within stark contrast of MonHun's older games, where each level had quadrant-like areas that had to be loaded separately and weren't all that appealing to the eyes. I can still go back to such hunting grounds and love them for what they are, but if you were to ask me which I prefer: the Ancient Steppe in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate or the Ancient Forest in Monster Hunter World: Iceborne,  I'm going to say the Ancient Forest.There's honestly so much more I could say about the game but I have a feeling anyone whose reading this has already moved along so I'll finish up here. If you have an interest in difficult fights, expansive worlds building your own character and crafting your own armor and weapons, look up a video and make the decision. I personally think it's well worth your money and time if you're into this kind of game."

That does not mean that it is easy, it has a lot of the quality of life changes that really help the game. I whole heartedly that anyone who has considered playing a Monster Hunter game that this is the best one to start with.Its not without its flaws, there are some truely amazing weapon designs the embody each monster and uniqueness. on the other hand there are some lack luster bland samey weapons that populate more than the fair share than they should. The armor on the other hand, you feel the theme of each monster. Some designs are strange but every set tells you exactly what monster it came from. Fashion hunting is not that hard as well while striving for maximising Armor skills to the maximum.In conclusion, both veterans and new players alike will thoroughly enjoy this game. It has a lot to offer and a huge dev support to make it great."
1239,babycakes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/agucheese/,3,,1,"1,913.2",November,"10,",140,0,1,"After 300 hours in Monster Hunter World, my family and friends voiced their growing concerns that I may have a problem. I beg to differ. There is a macrocosm of a time sink in MHW. So many things are going on simultaneously; new players may be overwhelmed or turned off by the fact that you could spend hours researching/reading/understanding the various mechanics of the game in order to actually play it. The basic tutorial tips and tricks do not explain it all. There are extensive amounts of: objectives (bounties); item and ingredient collection; armor upgrading (for you AND your Palico sidekick); literal farming (cultivating bugs, plants, and mushrooms); item crafting (potions, powders, ammunition, traps, etc.); capturing pets; decorating your room; changing appearance; customizing food buff recipes; main story quests; optional story quests; unwritten optional quests.1) GameplayIf you love murdering animals over and over again so that you can wear their skin and organs, then this game is for you. The addictive essence of this game involves making gear to improve your build(s), theorycrafting, revising your gear, hunting for drops to craft your revisions, and then hunting some more to ensure that you are satisfied with your build. 1a) Multiplayer Contrary to what the game title suggests, MHW is not open world. There are huge maps, but hunts are instance based, and multiplayer is sort of like that too. There is a max of 16 players allowed in an Online Session. I’ve spent countless hours both soloing and in groups. (The online connection has greatly improved since the game’s release.) While multiplayer usually enhances the hunting experience, I feel that MHW is best played with actual friends. Firing SOS flares is a mixed bag: I’ll either get a pro, or I’ll end up babysitting the troll picking flowers on the other side of the map during a 15-minute timed instance. Occasionally, I’ll get someone who’s actually just… normal. Guild cards are an interesting concept. You get to design your own hunter-approved business card detailing your equipment and other gameplay statistics. You can trade these with other players, and I frequently customize mine after changing my gear or after unlocking a new background. However, Guild cards do not act as the in-game friends list. This is a big missed opportunity! Guild cards should allow you to see if that player is on and allow you to join their Online Session. Currently, guild cards allow you to inspect the player’s gameplay statistics and their Steam profile page. I would much prefer joining that person’s Online Session within the game, so I can keep my Steam friends list uncluttered. 1b) Weapons Weapon variety is quite amazing in this game. So far, I’ve learned 5 different weapons. Each time rejuvenated my interest. I’d watch at least 20 minutes of YouTube videos each and take detailed notes for each weapon LOL. Certain weapons deal specific categories of damage, which in turn affect monsters in different ways. With each weapon being drastically different from each other, it was almost like hitting the restart button and learning the game all over again. The weapons have unique sets of moves, yet they remain balanced. For instance, larger weapons which do more damage per hit often sacrifice mobility and/or ease of use. Weapons with top tier damage output are often the most technically demanding. And then there are weapons which are easy to use, but difficult to master.1c) Limited time raidsThe current (and first for PC) limited event is the Kulve Taroth raid. In MHW fashion, it took me 10 hours of experience and 2 different explanation videos to figure out how to maximize the hunt and earn the best drops. Still, I find it very enjoyable and well done.2) Character CreationDesigning a character is one of my favorite things to do ever. If you go through my screen shot history, you will see that my hunter has undergone routine change of hair color and clothing dyes. My only critique would be that I expected a higher level of customization for a PC MMO, i.e. change body type, height, facial structure - similar to Saint’s Row 3 or something. I enjoyed the preset noses and mouths, but I wasn’t 100% satisfied with the the eyes, jawlines, and brows. I was also underwhelmed by the selection of hairstyles. Having male and female hunters share the same hair styles is rather lazy. Like is anyone really going to put the Admiral hairstyle, sideburns and all, on their female avatar?3) GraphicsGood, but I expected better. Like others, I was disappointed that the detailed graphics in the character creation aren’t consistent with the in-game graphics. On the first day, I took screen shots and saw how blurry it was on the character model in the sunlight. Nevertheless, there is a lot of detail in the environment and background. Animations are also superb, from your hunter’s moves to monster’s attacks. 4) ControlsCapcom spent a decent amount of time optimizing MHW for PC, but it feels like they neglected the controls. For starters, you CANNOT REBIND GAMEPAD BUTTONS. That personally grinds my gears because I consider that the hallmark of a lazy port (I’m looking at you, Bayonetta). I can’t execute certain attacks properly if I don’t like what the Y button (Xbox One controller) is bound to, so gamepad’s out the window for me. While I am used to playing MHW with keyboard and mouse, that’s not perfect either. There should be a permanent hotkey bar when using keyboard and mouse. It wouldn’t need to look or behave differently than it already does except prevent it from fading away. Players who do not want it to be permanent should be able to uncheck that setting in Options. Having to hit an F1 - F4 key and then a number key is not a big deal when you need to tap whetstone or HP potion. But it can be absolutely dreadful when you're laying down traps and tranquilizer bombs. Sometimes in the heat of battle, it can be stressful hitting the correct item. To this day, I will STILL accidentally waste items because of this. Further annoyances include keyboard and mouse getting the short end of the stick because they didn't program really small but significant details from the gamepad to keyboard. For example, you can fire your sheathed Light Bowgun without reloading on the gamepad: simply press RT (Shoot/Fire). However, pressing Right Click (Shoot/Fire) does nothing. You want to expertly dodge and shoot the monster in the face? Too bad; you get to reload and then get knocked over by its next attack! 5) Misc Complaints- The Handler (your storyline partner) is so obnoxiously cheerful that it’s unsettling.- For some reason, I find that the male character model looks extremely old, even at the youngest age setting.- Why are 95% of the armors so HIDEOUS that you wouldn’t want to wear them? I get this isn’t frou frou anime wonderland, but it is extremely difficult to find combinations of gear that have optimal skills *and* look good. - Related to that, the inability to fully customize armor pigments drive me insane. WHY MUST ONLY THIS MINISCULE BELT BUCKLE DETAIL CHANGE COLOR? This further decreases your chances of making useful AND good looking equipment!- Why don’t you see other players in your Online Session on every floor of town? They only appear on the 4th floor, but I’m never up there unless there is an event and you have to talk to a specific NPC up there. - Why is there no fall damage, but there is friendly fire? You should definitely die when you jump 3 stories off the map. - New gear from collaborations comes more slowly than anticipated. Maybe there are regional sync/licensing issues."

Weird errors, certain processors not supported, and just an overall increase in CPU usage for no reason. I nearly stopped playing just because the stuttering on Iceborne content was so terrible.Now these issues are (at least mostly) fixed, and they are consistently working on fixes and putting in the crossover events from PS4, it's clear they want this to be a good port. Title updates have FINALLY been matched with consoles as well, so PC players don't have to wait a month or 2 for monsters to come out.The multiplayer can still be hard for people to understand, there's a dumb stipulation where you can't join a story quest until the host as well as anyone wanting to join the quest has watched the cutscene on their own time.ALL THIS BEING SAID, ♥♥♥♥ is this game fun. I mean really fun. Iceborne REALLY kicked up the difficulty later on AND added a lot more monsters. Essentially double the roster.There's no better feeling than just getting together with friends, goofing around, hunting some big-ass monsters, stealing your Insect Glaive main friends mounts with a hammer, customizing your shoutouts to be goofy, the list goes on. The flow in this game is great, and the animations, the scale of the monsters, they all add to the experience.Some of the late-game weapon designs have actually been improved in Iceborne as well, there are some beautiful weapon designs in this game, but I still think there should have been more.So yeah, it's a bit buggy, and a CPU hog, but those can be fixed. The gameplay, which is something that should have been solid from the start, is damn solid. Iceborne added a lot of much needed content to the game as well, so if you're enjoying the base game, feel free to pick up Iceborne for the other half of the game.10/10, would introduce friends to my favourite series again.

1244,1L1NC4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1L1NC4/,4,1,1,493.3,August,"24,",960,0,1,"Long time MHW fan. Online issues are a bit of a drag, but haven't stopped me from pumping more hours into this game than I've worked in the last two weeks. A couple of tips to help your enjoyment.Don't bother with matchmade lobbies until they're fixed. They're mostly pointless anyway. Create a lobby and search for SOS flares when you want to play with randoms. If you're playing with friends, create a lobby, don't bother making it private unless you want to restrict a friend from joining. If you search for a lobby and there's none to be seen, someone will need to make a new lobby to join. If someone is having difficulty joining a quest, just drop the quest and re-take it. This can result in some resources being lost, like a use of an investigation or a voucher, but by the time that's a factor, you'll need to take that into account.Vouchers double the money you get from a quest, do them in single player early on, later on they aren't as important as  you can use the bandit mantle to generate more money faster with the right weapons.Lastly, if you're going to play with KB+M, expect some weirdness, you're likely going to need to rebind controls, especially if you play shooters or anything else. I highly recomment steam controller or another controller if you have it. If you like Monster Hunter and don't have it on another platform, this game is a mustbuy. If you haven't played Monster Hunter but are interested in the series, this game is a fanstastic jump on point. If you plan to play this game multiplayer, keep in mind that certain aspects of the story quest lock other players out. Like players not able to join prior to seeing a cutscene, players not able to join until they have completed said quest. It's a lot of frustration if you go into it blind. Just keep in mind you're going to have to play alone(or with randoms or a friend that's ahead). Once you hit high rank, the quests require you see the cutscene, but you can then abandon and join your friends and progress together, it's a bit of a work around, but it's acceptable for an otherwise solid game.I have difficulty not recommending a game that I've put 86 hours into and expect to be in my top 5 most played games in a year."

1248,Yono,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ROYISBOTTOM5/,4,,1,456.8,August,"20,",585,0,1,"I really do not understand the negative reviews at all.First of all, let me preface this by saying this is one of the best games I've ever played. It's absolutely the best Monster Hunter game in the series, it strips away TONS of the tedious, frustrating things about the old games. It feels way smoother to play, all the weapons are more interesting, hitboxes are better, monsters feel more fair and telegraph their attacks better, item management is way smoother, gathering is less tedious, the environment is far more immersive, grinding is less RNG based and more skill based since you now have options to do hard challenge quests for easier grind, armor sets are simplified... It's truly an astounding game and I would recommend it to anyone.As for the negative reviews this game is getting, to address the complaints.--It is not optimized badly at all. There is one graphic setting, Volume Rendering Quality, that needs to be turned off, however. This setting covers the game in a blue haze that makes it look way worse, and also causes tons of performance issues. Leaving this setting on by default was a mistake, however, after turning this off, I run the game at max settings without ever dropping frames on my GTX 1080. This isn't an easy game to max, that doesn't mean its badly optimized when the game looks so amazing. --The online in its current state, yes, has some problems. However, they are greatly exaggerated. I think the biggest reason for the sheer volume of negative reviews is the fact that at the current moment, the auto-matchmaking button isn't functional at all, and always returns an error message (at least for me). HOWEVER, playing with friends works ok, SOS flares work perfectly, the lobby search function works ok, joining lobbies via code is 100% failproof. There are some disconnection issues, but not enough currently to hamper the experience for me. I can understand people's frustration towards this, however, to bombard the game with negative reviews for it just makes absolutely no sense to me considering I have seen games with FAR worse connection issues have review scores above 90%.This game is 100% worth your time and money for me, and that's why I'm leaving a positive review."
1249,Little Light,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042676242/,3,,1,"1,346.9",August,"19,",302,0,1,"**October 2018 updateThe game is getting better with patches to fix the bugs and events to catch up to the console versions. You'll still find a lot of negative whiny reviews that make up BS until proven wrong or those who will simply make a negative review because maybe they didnt get one thing they felt entitled to. I suggest avoiding those for more realistic expectations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You'll find plenty of reviews telling you what the game lacks and has issues with, so I'll try not to write a book on those. The game just released on PC so I'm realistic to believe there will be some issues with it, and the disconnection ones can get annoying at times, but I'm hopeful it will be resolved in time.+PhasingOne thing that does impress me is how the game phases to a single player experience should you do get disconnected. Instead of the game crashing like most other games, the other people disappear to you and your cat takes over. Not to praise it over the errors it has, but how seamless it keeps the game from ever just crashing because of them in my experience. Now if it only scaled down the creature when you end up fighting it alone. :3+GameplayShould you be lucky enough to not experience any real issues you'll find a game that will take over your social life, but the best part is you can take your friends with you. It's a mix of fast pace action, and casually collecting things you need, so a little patience helps in order to get all you need to be most effective. There ends up being a lot of things you can do back at the hub.+CombatI regret this is my first Monster Hunter experience, but I love fighting giant creatures I have no place picking a fight with and coming out successful. The controls took a little time to get used to since I use a controller and couldnt remap them, but wasn't a problem after a while. Each an every weapon has it's own unique playstyle so I'd recommend looking up any of the great guides on youtube to get the most out of them.+Other StuffThe game has a lot of little nuances to show you a lot went into it, like even just sitting in your room interacting with the pets you can collect. There's just a lot of little things to go into the most random stuff. I just feel too many people give reviews for the wrong reasons and not what reviews are actually about. If I couldnt get the game to play, I wouldn't review it till I actually could. That would be a more accurate impression imo. I think the worst kind of reviews are those that blame a game for the users own mistake, which I don't see too much here. But the ones blaming a game for not being a perfect port at launch are not realistic. There has never been a perfect launch or a perfect port right out the door. Expectations for that are too high. I'm amazed the game runs as well as it does.+Final ThoughtsThe game does have DC problems you will encounter, but if you can deal with them you'll find the game super fun. Just be patient and have realistic expectations to when stuff will be resolved. I mean for example, there's still people out there that are surprised when a Bethesda game has bugs. Most of us that have been around a while expect them and they've been making PC games forever. So who honestly expects a perfect port of the first PC Monster Hunter game without any issues? Now I'm not defending them for the stuff that doesnt work. If they don't fix them, by all means bust out your torches and pitchforks, but reasonable launch expectations are reasonable."

With that out of the way, this is a port of the original PS4 version and the port, while working well enough for most players, have been suffering some issues with a large enough number of players to range in four digit number. I'm not talking about minor problems that doesn't stop you from having a good time, but rather CTD's, incomplete optimizations, FPS loss and not being able to start the game. An unofficial patch is out by now and it can be found in the Steam news.For more info on what the problems are, check the forums. Capcom have not patched it themselves yet but the game launched one day before the weekend so it's not that strange.The online funconality is also not working constantly server side, but this will most likely be fixed.

I think there is a few settings I'd like to see added but nothing I can't manually disable via the files. (I think even motion blur is in there).

Give it some time; this is the most accessible Monster Hunter title out there, and their servers are overloaded right now, as expected.As far as performance, you need a good rig to handle this game, no questions asked. That said, it of course still has its issues (lightning-based elemental particles seem to really cut into the framerate) but overall, I'm enjoying this port over the PS4 version.More on performance, I'm using a good rig (Nvidia GTX 1080, Intel i7 6700k processor, 16 GB of RAM) and this game runs at a consistent 60 frames a second almost all of the time. As I said above, lightning particles seem to dip the framerate and cause it to stutter upon contact. Aside from that, the load times are significantly improved over the PS4 version, so much so that I almost find it jarring at how fast it loads. I put this game on my SSD, and because of that, the load times are cut down to about 2 to 5 seconds, compared to the PS4's 30 to 60 second load times.As far as content itself, this Monster Hunter title has overall less monsters than previous entries to Monster Hunter, but that's also because they're likely having to remake assets and animations for this game, since it looks completely different than the other titles. Because of this, expect it to be somewhat shallow in comparison. Make no mistake, there are still plenty of monsters to fight however. Additionally, this port does not have the content that the Playstation 4 has *yet*. We're likely to get free DLC such as Deviljho and etc later on, but some crossover content present in the PS4 version might be missing (aka content such as the Horizon Zero Dawn content might make it over, it might not, we'll just have to wait and see).tl;dr: The game itself is very very good, although it's missing a notable amount of monsters from the previous titles. Performance is actually very good, *if* you have the hardware to handle it. There are still some strange things about the performance though, such as lightning particle effects causing the game to stutter."
1258,Wolfgand,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048133996/,3,,1,"1,481.4",August,"10,",385,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is the next step in the Monster Hunter (MH) franchise and one of the best installments in the series. Although it takes some notes from the classic MH experience, it provides significant improvements in terms of making the game more accessible with maintaining the notorious difficulty. If you are new to Monster Hunter games and you are planning to buy Monster Hunter World, keep in mind that this game is mainly grinding boss battle after boss battle and retrieving their dropped materials, then repeating the battles until you obtain enough materials to craft better equipment so you can fight the next, stronger boss. If this gameplay loop does not seem like something you enjoy, I’d strongly advise against picking up this game. The fun of Monster Hunter is reflected best in its fighting, which brings to the forefront the incredibly tight combat mechanics, along with the monsters themselves. The monsters may initially seem like massive damage sponges, but once you start engaging their attack patterns, moves and behavior it becomes very clear that these bosses hit hard and hit fast, making fights thrilling and lots of fun. While World has one of the smallest monster rosters in the series, it still contains enough variety to keep players satisfied. World brings many quality of life changes to the series, cutting down a lot of the convoluted systems and making them more easy to access and manage, with the most notable examples being the skill system. Smaller changes that are still worth mentioning are eating meals, managing equipment during hunts, item management, being able to consume items during movement, and etc. For the people curious about end game, this may be the most polarizing part of the game. The end game will mostly revolve around you farming jewels to create that perfectly mixed armor set in order for you to fight new upcoming Arc Tempered Monsters. These hunts will then reward you with an even more extreme version of the original monster’s armor set. While I and many others are fine with and love the end game, it’s also understandable the disappointment of others in terms of expecting more. However, even now Capcom is working hard to improve that with interesting and fun events and collaborations, Kulve Taroth and Behemoth being more recent examples. Although I love this series and specifically this installment, it’s important to mention this game’s shortcomings. While Monster Hunter World is the biggest graphical evolution the games have ever had, it’s sad to see how uninspired and boring most of the weapons and armor sets when looking back at the old games. Although this also seems like something Capcom is slowly fixing with updates, releasing interesting and fun new armor sets as well as layered armors is something that could greatly add to the game. Another problem I have with world is the decision of making the end game grind about collecting jewels. Previous games would allow you to obtain jewels by fighting specific monsters which led to the player having much more interaction with most if not all of the Monster Roster, however in world you just keep farming tempered elder dragons over and over hoping to god you’ll get an attack jewel. Instead of this boring grind, you could have to fight specific monsters for them, such as Paoiumu, Jyuratodus, Uragaan, Radobaan or any other monsters you have very little reason to fight in late game. In summary, this is a strong staple in the series, a FANTASTIC entry point to newcomers and a clear step in the right direction for the future of the franchise. The game could also improve a bit on one of these flaws are deal breakers but rather small inconveniences. I'd recommend interested newcomers and vets pick this one up. Happy Hunting"

Not totally fixed but at least it happens less frequent than before. Just to be clear, I bought it for its multiplayer feature. That's why I gave it a Negative Feedback."
1260,Bellona,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BellonaSabine/,5,,1,82.4,August,"16,",512,0,1,"So I have now beaten the main story of MHW and I believe it is now appropriate to give it a review. Before I start off, full disclosure. I have played Monster Hunter games in the past. I’ve played 70hrs of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Wii U and I’ve played 30hrs of Freedom Unite on the PPSSPP Emulator. Since enjoying those games years ago I have been eagerly anticipating a more streamlined Monster Hunter experience for a better and more powerful gaming system, namely the PC.This review will be broken up into 4 sections. The Good, The Bad, PC Performance, and a ConclusionIf you have never played a Monster Hunter game one of the best things it has going for it is its sense of progression. Over time the player feels a sense of how they have changed and adapted over the course of the game. This ranges from better and cooler looking gear to being more competent at the gameplay. While the player progresses and acquires new gear they will encounter roadblocks along the way, these are called Anjanath in LR and Nergigante and Vaal Hazak in HR (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Val Hazzak is crazy). There are two ways to move on when one reaches this point, either grind for better gear by beating up the same monster a couple of times or improve tactically. Though at a certain point new gear is a must, but there is that option if you are good enough. This rinse and repeat is essentially the game play loop. You have to like this to enjoy the game, especially the very weighty and deliberate combat similar to the Souls Series (this came out first btw).For those who have not played a Monster hunter it is not an MMO (think similar to Warframe if you have played that). At the core it is a 4 player group up hunting game. It is the best game series on the market in my opinion for this type of game play. Co-op is a must to truly enjoy this game to the fullest.The game has a lot of content in it, however I’ll come back to this point later in the review.Streamlining of game’s systems has helped out this title immensely. The game has way less tedium than the older games in the series and more emphasis on the hunting with less time spend trying to find a damned flashbug.If you like the gameplay of the Monster Hunter Series this is everything that is good about it made better. However, those people have already bought this game. I’m hoping to speak to those more on the fence, especially if you are wondering if this game is for you. I will talk about this in the conclusion.There is still tedium for things like ore mining and collecting materials this is made worse by the fact that the farming (like a garden) aspect of the game has been nerfed for some unknown bizarre reason.Finding the gems for monsters if RNGesus doesn’t look favorably on you can become terrible I know this from past Monster Hunter games, it is the same in this game, but I’ve yet to experience it.The story and its voice acting in both English and Japanese is absolutely terrible unredeemable trash. I have no idea why Capcom thought Monster Hunter needed a story. It’s terrible and it interferes with game play as you have to back out of the mission and restart just to do a story missions with friends.THE CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE. WHY DO I HAVE TO WATCH UNCANNY VALLEY TALK TO UNCANNY VALLEY x12. I JUST WANT TO FIGHT MONSTERS!There is a lot of content in this game compared to other AAA games on the market, but compared to other Monster Hunter games it is shorter, While I understand why as they can’t just add all the old monsters as they need an HD revamp. Currently I feel a bit lonely without some classics like Tigrex, Brachydios, and Lagiacrus (I need water combat as an expansion plz). Without G-Rank the game is shorter than other Monster Hunter games so make of that what you will.So I will start with if you have anything less than a GTX 9-- series card or an Intel i7 6---k CPU you are SOL. These are pretty much needed to get 1080p 60fps. I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 8700k and I still get frame drops in the Teostra fight. This game needs a performance patch badly, some particle effects just wreck the game. Additionally, the new Nvidia drivers for the game are completely busted (398.82) roll back to the June drivers (398.36) you’ll gain 30fps. The game also has motion blur that is terrible, disabling the ingame anti aliasing makes it much better but the effect is still there. This needs to be patched. Finally the game is currently plagued with disconnects and its terrible I don’t get them often but some of my friends do. It’s really a mixed bag. I’ve heard mixed things about KB+M, but I don’t know as I use a controller and it works really well. The game is designed for it from the ground up. So overall the performance is just passable. (this is all as of 8/15/18)Luckily with the freedom of the PC in the future there may be more we can do with configuration and graphics stuff through modding ect. But that remains to be seen, except for a performance mod by the same guy that made FAR mod for Nier: Automata.If you love Monster Hunter and want to play it in glorious HD at 60fps you already bought the game. Personally if you are on the fence, go watch some gameplay and see if the core gameplay loop interests you. I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but I would recommend everyone at least check it out as you may find it to be to your liking. Also the game will be receiving 4 new monster like the PS4 and XBONE version in the near future so Capcom seems committed to wanting the players to stick around likely because they will make an expansion with G-Rank, so keep that in mind as well.I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments. I will update this review in the future if the state of the game changes drastically with regards to performance and content."

Preparation is key. Farm your bounties; investigations, mats etc, until you have your armor nice enough for the fight. If you just blaze through the main quest it will make it impossible. Same goes for weapons. I have been having fun.Downside was the connection issues at first. I alt tab a lot and that caused my game to disconnect from multiplayer. After disabling the steam (friends) overlay and setting my display to windowed fullscreen, the issues stopped for the most part.Another thing I have noticed is a lag when you have four people and two monsters going at it. They start to skip around the map. I have no problem with the graphics except the can randomly be low res on some structures. Overall, great game. The story is progressing nicely but it's kind of short (thank you google). Combat is kinda clunky with ranged weapons (so I went with hammer) and it's nice when you play with other ppl. You can almost always find what quest you're on in the SOS section to play with randoms. Plenty of armor and armor designs; currently dressed up as a unicorn."

Overall this was a let-down, a stick with no carrot.I wish there was a neutral rather than a yes or no vote as I'm really mixed on this one.  Giving it a thumbs up rather than down simply due to the fact that playing it through once  solo definitely was a tonne of fun but I just felt thoroughly disappointed when I got to the ""end"".I was gifted this by a friend, we were meant to play it together but mostly weren't able to due to the port issues at launch.  These initial issues, constantly being disconnected were a real game breaker.  The amount of time it took to get that fixed was sad; especially considering that the PC release was postponed significantly to iron out such issues, and this was a HUGE one.  It was eventually (mostly) rectified but it came way too late since the population by then had already left in frustration at not being able to play an MMO as an actual MMO.edit: Tried coming back to the game for Icebourne but feel completely lost.In the end I found it's easier to get things done solo than in a party with others anyway, again killing the MMO aspect of the game.  Generally playing with open squad someone joined, got insta-carted and spoiled the rewards and or killed the mission completely despite the fact that I almost had the monster dead before they arrived, awesome bro thanks for nothing!  On the other hand, your trusty Palico when armed with the right tools for the fight is actually more reliable than a teammate 130% of the time.The length of the main questline, left me feeling I'd missed something, I wanted more, way more!  The monster animations and artwork in the game are REALLY incredible, the creation of the world is SUPER immersive and it definitely has that going for it.  However once the main questline is done and you hit HR100 there really doesn't seem any point in continuing any further.  Yes you can grind for more parts to make more gear but for what?  New content coming in another 6 months?   The combat just isn't that replayable, especially when it's better played solo, that totally killed it for me.  I found the rare house pets, I got all the food bits, I did 92% of the achievements but I just can't keep going, I wanted an MMO, this failed to deliver.edit: Tried coming back to this for Iceborne but so many new gear sets I have no idea what's going on anymore.  Like new gear but no new content...not sure where to begin."

I picked up the trail of the Pukei-Pukei I was hunting, but found an Anjanath (think T-Rex) footprint right in the middleof the trail. I advanced cautiously, and found my prey already locked in battle with the Anjanath that towered over it. I crept forward, wanting to see how the fight was progressing before deciding whether or not to join the fray or find another target, when a furious Great Jagras steamed right into the back of me, getting the attention of the battling monsters. A rolling, tumbling, chaotic four-way fight ensued. During this a pack of regular Jagras weighed in, but most of them were stamped to paste by the Anjanath in short order. I think at one point I rode the top of the Great Jagras, stabbing it in the head. I know I cut off the Pukei-Pukei's tail. The last thing I saw was the Great Jagras eating the last of its kin to bulk up, mid-fight, but the Anjanath, finally tiring of the fragile Hunter, chomped me to unconsciousness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back into the field to see if the Pukei-Pukei survived. If it did, I plan to correct that situation, promptly."

I have played Tri, 3U, 4U and Generations. This review, if mentioning the older games, will be in referance to those.Monster Hunter World is a great game to start at if you are new to the series. It revamped some things, which makes the game slightly less complicated than previous games. That being said, there is still alot to learn as a beginner. The game is somewhat cluttered. Theres a ton of little things to learn and remember, which veterans take for granted in just knowing from experience. I feel, though, that any beginner can easily pick these things up with time and practice.As far as this game being ""too easy"", I think it's relative. I felt this game to be easier than previous games, but it could also be because I am used to the delayed movements, constant need to roll and dodge, repeated movesets of certain monsters that was used in previous games, and the million little things to remember when it came to items, armor, weapons, the canteen, etc. I think its an awesome game, and I think its a fun challenge that will be fulfilling and rewarding for new and old players.Despite all this, Monster Hunter was always a game I hesitated to confidently recommend to others. It isn't because it's a bad game; it's a wonderful game. It is because it *can* be a grindfest, and I know that is a deal breaker for some people. I personally don't mind that about it at all, but after thinking about it for a bit, came to a conclusion of who I think would like that aspect:If you are the kind of person that does not mind repetative actions, sometimes tediously, as long as its to reach a goal (game advancement, new armor or new weapons), then you will probably love this game.If you are the kind of person that does not like repeating things of any kind, irregardless of what it brings you, then I think this game would annoy the crap out of you. Lol!Monster Hunter has always been known as a game that was a grind in order to get materials for weapons and armor, and for the people that played the game, *thats why they played it*. Part of the joy of Monster Hunter was the work and effort it took in order to FINALLY get that piece of armor and that weapon you've been wanting for ages. If that is you... buy this game. Haha. (Although, I will admit, advancing in the weapon tree is much easier than previous titles IMO, but it still provides a nice challenge!)As for other things in this game, the graphics are beautiful (to me), but keep in mind this game is a port. The movements are delayed, as if using a controller, even if you are using a mouse and keyboard. Using multiplayer can be finnicky; people will drop from sessions or quests from time to time, and seeing other peoples quests to join sometimes can be a challenge. But, after playing many many multiplayer missions, I found the problems to be few. This game can also be demanding of your computer, but my computer isn't new and runs just fine, despite a little lag.All in all, I love this game. I love the grind, I love the corniness, I love the outrageous armor that makes me look like a meatball half the time.... I just love it.But that could be nostolgia speaking. ;) ---------Previously Updated Review:Thankfully, the issue was fixed for me and the game now works. I've been playing Monster Hunter for close to a decade, so this being on PC makes me excited. From what I can tell so far, it looks like a wonderful game. Camera angles can be a little wonky, but its nothing bad at all! I hope it continues to work for others so that we can all enjoy this game.---------Previous Review Upon Game Release: Crashes in the same spot during the intro every time.

There are simply numerous problems (very poorly optimized for PC, hit boxes & hit detection is a complete joke, clipping scenery during fights ranges from poor to very poor, camera fixture and targeting will make you sick after a while as it switches and spins the camera so much during a fight it defies believe, choppy frame rates during fights even on a top end pc, very poor textures in many places especially when close up, spend more time on the ground/knocked down/stuck in scenery/waiting for some animation to finish before I can control my chr again mostly from 'shaky' cam as I cannot predict what the monster will do next and in which direction, often network issues drops you in the middle of doing things with a group, etc etc). The game has real potential, I like the open world, the way the game organizes you into monster quests & fetch quests, survival & gathering resources is done pretty good (apart from the TERRIBLE inventory system, not intuitive at all pretty much the opposite, spend way to much time to having to sort your inventory due to it being designed for controller ONLY and even then its still really poorly done) and overall story is not bad.I should have known better, a title coming directly from console is never, or very very rarely, going to work well on the PC at its release. Alas I bought it cheaper from somewhere else which means I cannot refund this pile of monster poo. But that point is mute anyways cause the tutorial in the game takes 2+ hours so even if I bought it on steam, I would have run past the deadline once I gotten to the real game.Overall, after the initial tutorial part and figuring out part, the game became a frustrated affair more and more so to the point where I no longer felt it was worth my time and effort. It needs some patching, as in its current state I would not recommend you touch this with a barge-pole. That opinion does not even take into account that I play with black bars on either side of my screen as it ONLY supports 16:9 resolutions, not 21:9 nor 16:10 nor proper 4k (from what I have read on forums anyways). A real shame that developers/publishers still think they can get away with porting over decent console titles to the PC without putting any real effort into the port itself leaving it in a terrible state with numerous problems and issues which can easily be resolved should they actually be bothered (but its all about the money!).My 2cs."

That being said, what blew me away in World was the sheer ecological scale and the expeditionary atmosphere that I think no other game has come close to accomplishing in recent times. The soundtracks are wondrous (case in point, Stars At Our Backs), the gameplay is challenging, and visually it is absoloutely stunning, all of which contributes to a pretty stellar and memorable experience. If you've never picked up a Monster Hunter game before, and/or you're someone who wants to experience the sublimity of a New World (heh), then Monster Hunter:World is perfect."

Performance is actually very good (It was my primary worry for this game) and other than the finnicky item select the keyboard controls are actually pretty nice, good enough for me to switch off of my xbox controller at least. My only gripes so far is how some cutscenes don't match the video with the audio (This might be fixed through a patch) and how the game doesn't render in ultrawide when playing at 2560 x 1080 (It doesn't stretch the screen at least, it just displays black bars on the side)Overall, a lot of these problems can (and hopefully will be) fixed. I hope I won't run into more issues, however so far the port is pretty good!EDIT: You can actually switch to keyboard item select mode, not sure how to use it yet but it appears to be a simple 1-8 hotkey bar, so it seems that problem is mainly caused by the game not automatically switching between keyboard/gamepad quick switch layouts (If it did, it would probably cause some compatibility issues, so I'm not going to call this a negative point by any means)"

A lot of issues with connectivity and fps. And other assorted issues people were having. After hedging around for a bit I decided to just buy it.I am SO GLAD that I did. First off, let's address the issues people are having with the game. It's most likely either drivers related, or hardware too low specced to run the settings they are trying to run. The game is fairly demanding, especially on the CPU. Make sure you have a decent CPU and a decent CPU cooler. Also you want a fairly new graphics card, older cards are going to really struggle.Secondly the connectivity issues are largely fixed, there are still some issues (like all online games I have ever played to be honest) but they are not common and they are very fast to fix. That said I think they still have a few more little bugs to hammer out, but it is easily playable the few times I've had issues it did not affect my gameplay for more than a few seconds, and it happens rarely.Third: Guys, I have not bought a major title in a very long time, and the ones I have bought were very disappointing. I have more lately been likely to play simple pixel indie games. But I LOVE this game, Capcom banged this one out of the park, and they have left themselves tons of room to expand. This is new ground for them so yes, there were some rough spots. The real tell-tell sign that this game is great, is that even the people saying not to buy it have hundreds of hours of gameplay invested, if you get 100 hours of gameplay out of your game I think you really got your moneys worth. I won't get in depth or anything, because anything else I could say has been said many times over. If you're on the fence because of negative reviews I highly suggest you try it, because most of the negative reviews are either out dated or very impatient people (mad that they have to wait for content released already on other systems). -Byron"

1299,Stim The One,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stimtheone/,4,,1,177.1,September,"28,",534,0,1,"This certainly wasn't a game for me, yet it has charmed me nonetheless. Some might think it has an RPG feel, but the feel ends at the surface and underneath that your character is unchanging and in no way growing, with only your ability and equipment improving, often the first being the most important. At times it is downright unfair as monsters can downright destroy anyone except a particular build made for them... an example is with the Nightshade that will either torture you, disable you or be able to do nothing if you are immune to its gimmick.But, despite all this, the game is accessible, action-packed, the story is not terrible and apparently it has several improvements of method compared to past games, the cats are adorable, Catma makes the best food cutscene, and yes, I am including Iceborne in this review because honestly, playing without it feels like a cut of content. The sense of pride on beating a monster, especially a harder one... especially if you have turned a flawless strategy to downright humiliate it... it is strong. There are several points in the story where you need to take your skill a step up, the first few being the Anja and the Rathalos. And after that you will continuously hunt them like it is nothing.Not for everyone, though it has something for everyone."

It's visually stunning - Playing at 3840 x 2160 with settings set to High. I did notice that some levels I would get a frame drop to 40fps but most of the time I would get a solid 60 - 70fps.The game is designed to be Co-Op, If you nobody on your friends list also plays you can always use the in-game Group finder or just fire off an SOS signal at the beginning of the mission. There were a few bumps at the beginning of the game with this but these have now been fixed and I always had a full group a few minutes after the SOS signal went up.I found the Mouse and Keyboard controls really weird and ended up playing with my Xbox Controller. I did find a few people online who did use Mouse & Keys so it's personal preference really. I tried to rebind keys but I just couldn't get used to it.The biggest let down for myself was the story. I'm not really sure what to say here, It was just... bad.Rinse and Repeat.Also the cutscenes being really poorly synced up with the english voice acting didn't help.In all honesty, MH:W isn't about the story, it's about grinding gear and making yourself look badass. Although the gameplay is fun there isn't much to it. Once you've worked out the pattern you can beat any monster while eating dinner at the same time. It's not very challenging at all, it's also quite fustrating when you're trying to craft a peice of gear and are only missing one part but due to RNG you have to kill the same monster 3 - 4 times before you get the right bit. I would recommend the game - I certainly enjoyed myself and got my moneys worth but if you haven't already bought the game yet then I would either go to CD Keys or wait for a sale."

Even if I take off the rose-colored glasses of nostalgia, and look at this game objectively, I simply cannot give it a negative review. ______________________MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD features beautiful graphics, dynamic cutscenes, and one hell of a grind for gear. For some, that last one may be a negative, but I can assure you, this mechanic has  been at the heart of the series, and truly makes MH what it is and has been all these years for me. If that isn't your cup of tea, stop right here, and find another game. The roster of MHW monsters includes a perfect blend of new and old (in my humble opinion), and lots of brand new NPC hunters to get to know along the way. You can play this game solo or multiplayer, and with 14 different weapon types to slay your feathered, fuzzy, or scaley foes, you're in for a long haul. Even after you've completed the main story line, you're not done! Rest assured that the Fifth Fleet will still need you, and Capcom is sure to add better, bigger monsters with even more grandiose fighting mechanics. Now, let's talk ...I'm willing to admit that on PC release, there were definitely a few things that didn't quite hit the mark. Mainly, the multiplayer error issues. For a month or so, it was  difficult to play this game in any sort of mulitplayer fashion, as almost everyone was getting disconnected constantly. As someone who prefers to play this game with friends, I can understand the countless ""would not recommend"" reviews here based solely on the fact that it was basically impossible to play with friends in that state. Capcom stepped up to the plate and communicated those issues, and worked with the community to fix them. At one point, there was a call for players to send developers their error codes, etc. Since the updates, I have not experienced a singular disconnection issue due to servers while playing with friends or strangers. In closing, I would 110% recommend this game, especially with a few of your best mates in tow. There's a tremendous amount of fun to be had here, and it is definitely worth a play."

Even after 300+ hours even if the base and dlc main stories have been completed, there is still a lot of room for improvements in terms of skills both with DPS and weapon mastery.The game seems a never-ending cycle of hunt and its also amazing that there is different ranks of monsters as well as the ranking system for hunters such as Hunter Rank (HR for Base world) and Master Rank (MR for Iceborne) Lastly, it is quite funny to see a DLC being more expensive than its actual base game! But it is totally worth it in my opinion as the number of features added in Iceborne is simply over the top compared to the standard Base World.I strongly recommend this game if you are a person who likes challenges, rerun after failure to become stronger and also meet a wonderful community with only 0.333% of toxicity.

Monster Hunter World is the first Monster Hunter I've put time into. I tried playing 4 Ultimate on the 3DS but I couldn't get too far. I got MHW on a whim because it was on sale and say ♥♥♥♥ it let's try this one. I was very surprised how accessible this game was compared to the previous titles. There are still mechanics and skills that the game doesn't tell you which is infuriating at times especially if it's your first Monster Hunter game. The premise behind the game might be simple, but it tells a somewhat complex story. You're part of the Fifth Fleet in pursuit of a colossal Elder Dragon known as Zorah Magdaros. Once every decade, Elder Dragons trek across the sea to travel to a region known as the New World. This migration event is referred to as the Elder Crossing and has baffled the Guild for years. The Guild is the main governing body in the Monster Hunter universe, and they work alongside the Elder Dragon Observation to monitor and research particular species. To get to the bottom of this mysterious pattern, the Guild forms the Research Commission, dispatching them in large groups to the New World. The game begins as you're shipwrecked upon arrival to the New World after an attack by Zorah Magdaros. The main objective in Monster Hunter: World is simply to battle gigantic monsters in epic locations. As a hunter, you take on numerous quests to kill increasingly difficult beasts in their unique habitats. Depending on the region, like the Coral Highlands or Rotten Vale, you encounter different monsters which utilize their environment to their advantage. While the story revolves around acquiring contracts to hunt down monsters, the enemy variety the game presents is truly astounding. Just like previous entries in the franchise, Monster Hunter: World maintains the sense that the creatures are the stars of the show. Even if you come across a Kulu-Ya-Ku or Pukei-Pukei in the wild, you realize that they have distinct personalities. Unlike other games, you never feel like you're battling mindless creatures. A large part of the journey is discovering what playstyle suits your skill level. Whether you choose to equip a massive sword or a projectile weapon, mastering it takes time. For example, you may not like how an oversized hammer feels in comparison to the quick attacks of a bone sword. There are dozens of options, so determining what works for you is imperative to success. You can also craft, upgrade and purchase new items at any time. Monster Hunter: World features in-depth customization options which allow you to tailor your character and feline companion. It's great to generate a hunter that looks somewhat like you. This process allows for deeper immersion because you feel like a part of the game. This is just for the base game. The expansion Iceborne adds more monsters, quests, etc. It is a paid add-on but it is definitely worth the cost. The game does go on sale during the Steam events so keep an eye on that. Iceborne also includes a 2 new areas and an endgame. We recently got the final update for the game so the game is fully completed. On this date of this review I have not fought Fatalis but I heard good things about the fight. I'm glad they ended layered armors and weapons. The game is hella grindy so if you don't like that then the game isn't for you. I recommend the game"
1329,DriftOff,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202520195/,3,,1,539.1,November,"11,",46,0,1,"Monster Hunter has been a long loved franchise of mine, and Monster Hunter World is a unique experience. For veteran MH players, this game poses both fun activities and challenging hunts. The variety of weapons and armour skills allow players to find their preferred play style, enhancing both solo play and group play as well. For newer players to the series however, this game will for sure be a challenge at times. The hunts are long and extensive, and unless geared correctly, players will face difficulties slaying stronger monsters. You have the option of calling for help as the game allows auto matchmaking after turning it on during the hunt through the SoS flare.The game ultimately comes down to repeatability, as one would need a few hunts of the same monster for rarer materials to upgrade or craft deadlier weapons and stronger armour. However, this is simply a way for the game to allow players to familiarize themselves with each monster, and players will often find each hunt being easier and easier until facing off against a new monster, which the cycle then resets. There are a few event quests that have lenient hunter rank (basically your player level) minimums, such as Fatalis and Alatreon. If you are looking for a challenge however, they are both very fun and rewarding if successful.In terms of game space, the game is simply just beautiful. The environment is immersive with incredible details and many interactible features to assist hunters on their hunts. The music is heavenly, and offers a significant mood enhancement during the matching activities. Some maps even have secrets for hunters to discover, as well as indigenous species for hunters to interact and communicate with. The monster design are diverse and realistic. While many monsters are returning icons of previous titles, they were brought in with new moves and new armour and weapon designs. The Iceborne DLC is a MUST GET. It doubles the base game content and allows players to traverse newer areas to face against unique monsters to the series. It also adds an additional raid on top of the base game.Overall, this is a true PvE game. It is both solo and group playing friendly, and with friends, it can be very fun. 9.8/10"

It improved on the base game substantially and made the endgame a lot more fun. When compared to the older games (I only have a bit of experience with MHGU / MHXX) the QoL changes make the game so much more enjoyable, so much so that it was rather hard for me to get started with MHXX (I’m currently emulating it, with a retexture it looks pretty good for a 3ds game). That said there are a few things in my opinion capcom and the monster hunter team have to improve in the next game.Coop Story progressionI understand that the devs want to incentivise players to fight the monster alone, so they learn how it behaves. But in my opinion limiting coop in assigned missions isnt the correct approach. It was extremely annoying having to wait for a friend to watch the cutscene, just for me to be able to join. This in my opinion is one of the things that they have to drastically change in the next release.Bloated damage valuesFrom my understanding this was done so players have a better understanding of how much damage they would actually do with a given weapon. This though hurts more than it actually helps, since it confuses new players especially with skills like attack boost, that only show you how much true raw you get from them, thus making them look less valuable. In the next game we should have at least an option to display true raw instead of bloated raw. When it comes to elemental damage, this should also be changed. Currently bloated elemental damage is just true elemental damage * 10.Displaying elemental damage separatelyOne of the reasons why I think players might consider elemental damage less valuable at first glance, is because we have no visual feedback. Having an option to display elemental damage separately from raw (elements could have a designated color) when attacking could clear up this issue.Increasing viability of elemental damage on certain weaponsSome weapons like the GS and Hammer don’t benefit much from elemental damage, thanks to the huge motion values and slow attack rate they possess. Since elemental damage isnt affected by motion values, this means that the damage increase they provide is a lot less valuable than raw. In order to fix this, capcom should increase the elemental damage on those weapons, till they can at least make up the difference that the huge motion values provide. This could be very useful for crit draw GS, where most of the time the player isnt taking advantage of those huge motion values and elemental damage might actually have a chance to catch up.On another note, GL could get elemental shells (similarly to PEPCBs), which would change the way GL is played. Instead of being able to ignore all HZV, now GL would have to precisely attack those juicy elemental HZVs.Finally the lance, currently in MHW it has an elemental modifier of 0.8. In the next game they should buff it to at least 1  or higher.Clutch ClawPersonally I hate this mechanic, for the soul reason that it forces you to tenderize to deal damage. In addition the claw often grapples me to the part I wasn't aiming to, which is also infuriating. If they ever use this mechanic in future games, I would like it if they refin it to be less clunky."

1339,Grandpappy Smith,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fsmith1/,3,,1,"1,379.0",July,"4,",389,0,1,"Honestly, in terms of just general feel and depth of content, MHW and the Iceborne expansion are head and shoulders above most other games out there. There are definitely some reasonable criticisms to level against the game, especially with regards to clutch claw implementation, optimization, and some other odds and ends, but it took me hundreds of hours to even start to feel the drag of such things. Beyond that, none of those concerns actually outweigh how much plain fun I have hunting monsters and building gear. While I mostly play solo, group play is another thing entirely and there's just so much engaging content to be explored here. If you're looking a game to get absolutely lost in the world of, and to always have considerably different play styles available by a simple weapon switch, look no further. There's some overlap between weapons, but honestly if things start to feel stale you can always start messing around with something else and it's like a whole new game, and all the weapons have layers upon layers of mastery to discover. The learning curve can be steep, but it is very worth it and very rewarding. Highly recommended."

For new players, it's a game in which you fight big bosses to craft new and powerful gear so you can fight bigger and harder bosses that give even better gear, etc. Although the base game lacks a bit in content (for a Monster Hunter game) with only 36 or so monsters to fight, the combination of the Iceborne expansion and the extensive changes and quality of life improvements to the classic Monster Hunter formula justify this. Monster Hunter is a franchise that will eat up days of your life and you'll only be halfway through when you realize it. The monster fights have some the best music, atmosphere, and flavor of any video game experience ever. Can't recommend enough."

Veterans complain about it being too easy or lacking in content compared to older games, but the easy counterpoint to that for me is that the experience here is so much more fun and refined that I've gotten much more time out of this game than something like Generations Ultimate which has much more content. Also, the only things that are ""easier"" are quality of life improvements that simply make the game better.In short, if you like third person melee/ranged combat and boss fights in general, I highly recommend this game, especially if you can get some friends to hunt with you."

1397,Demii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Demii_1/,3,,1,254.8,January,"23,",868,0,1,"150 hours on Playstation, and at the time of writing 63 hours on PC. This game is a masterpiece of gameplay, level design and RPG Mechanics. I've always been interested in the Monster Hunter genre but it was only until Monster Hunter World that I really fell in love with it. The gameplay is really smooth, the Monster fights are appropriately challenging. Most of the normal monsters are no problem, but if you don't prepare for harder fights you'll struggle. The progression into increasingly challenging monsters and utilising gear crafted from previous kills to aid in future fights is really rewarding and satisfying, you feel as if you are improving as a hunter as you progress through the game.The campaign is great and is not as grindy as some of the game's predecessors.The only thing I'd say is that after 200 hours, I'm naturally less motivated to play. The End Game is about optimising your gear for the most effective DPS, so a little bit of a grind for not much reward, but there's a good 60-70 hours of the game's main story and Monster progression arch before you get into that, so it's honestly not a bad thing at all it just gives the hardcore playerbase more goals to achieve."
1398,TheBlackCake,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBlackCake/,4,,1,709.6,May,"2,",38,0,1,"First of all i want to say that i love monster hunter series, so i'll just talk about things that i've disliked in MHW since i'm already fan of the game, it have my upvote aways.Cons:Connection Problem: everyone know about this one, its pretty sad when you are playing with a friend or a random and someone get disconnected, the biggest problem is that the monster scale for multiplayer keeps active, so when someone join your session and someone gets disconnected you need to quit the mission and try again, or fight agains't a monster buffed for 2-4 players and have the double of the needed work, the system should add some kind of reconnect or down scale the monster stats when someone leave the session.. and this take me to the second point.Multiplayer Scale: When someone join you the monster gets buffed, but its not always a pro player right? sometimes is just someone learning how to play, there is no problem on it, but i think the game double the enemy HP on online session so, if you have a teammate that are not doing so good, you will have a lot of extra work, since MH series its has a lot of focus on multiplayer it should have a better party system, at this point its better to clear a quest alone than play with friends, trust me, you will clear it much easier doing all on your on. i think they should change the hp scale or damage, to incentive the multiplayer, not incentive the solo play. and this take me to the next point.Revives limited to 3: When you are playing on your on, 3 deaths is fair, but when you are playing on mutiplayer it should make the 3 death individual, or else you have 4 players with a 3 death limit, that its the other thing that make the multiplayer less viable than solo play, everyone do mistakes, that is normal, but when you have 4 players and 3 deaths, if everyone do 1 mistake, you've failed already, and since the hp is hella buffed, it much better have 3 lifes and play alone than play with other ppl that you don't know if they are on a good day or not. i think the 3 death only should be only for quests like Kuelve Taroth or Behemoth since those are suppose to be hard and everyone know what they are doing, but for normal missions the death counter should be individual and if someone die 3 they need to keep on the ground and watch his teammates play, or get quitted from the quest and not recive the reward. for those two above, either scaling less the monster hp for multiplayer or making the death counter individual would improve a lot the party system and make much more viable to play in party than solo, at this point, i would only recommend to play in party if you have a pre-made team with pre-made builds, else, don't try to play with random's, do it on your own.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Grinding: Monster Hunter is a grind fest since ever, who plays it usually likes it, but  MHW look's way more casual, its super easy to craft the weapons and sets, i haven't seen any difficulty in craft system, the only thing that make it a little more hard its the gem's, but you can drop one with less than 10 runs, and can also purchase it with week tickets, i've made my Drachen Set so easy at HR 60 or less... and its the end game set actually... the only two things that make's you keep playing at certain point its the events with new layered armor and the Decorations, i also want to say that the decoration system 100% based on luck its pretty bad, its somehow impossible to drop the Deco you need without and event like Great Jagras, it should have a craft system for Deco, but first you need a better craft system for set's, or else player's will not have anything to do...---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------That is all i can remember right now, my Cons are more likely things that need some kind of improvment, none of them make the game inviable, the game still pretty cool, for a casual player you should be able to play for like 300-600 hoursfor someone that already know the series, probably 100-300 hours if you don't want to grind the luck system of Decorations...the game still epic, i'll not talk about Pros  since there is a lot of stuff, and everyone talk about them already =P, the game is cool, if you like it, buy it, its worth.Sorry for my bad english and Thanks for reading it until here"

Its Shadow of Collosus meets Assassin's Creed meets Final Fantasy meets Tomb Raider.  This game has the RIGHT AMOUNT of grinding, upgrading, story, exploring, questing, CO-OP PLAY etc.  Its a GREAT game with a HUGE variety of weapons (fight/play style) choices - all of which can be upgraded further.  You can use a 600 pound hammer that plays like its actually HEAVY, you can use a heavy GUN with all kinds of custom crafted ammo, you can use twin daggers that have VICIOUS crit chance... and there's over 10 other weapon types!  Everything has a skill tree!  It's creative and well thought - there is tons to hunt and grind and explore.  The maps are HUGE with 3 layers of height/depth.  So basically each area map is made of 18ish smaller maps, and each of those maps can have a higher ground/lower ground map.  Its EASY to utilize though, and you can set waypoints for yourself on anything or any creature you want!   You get an ADORABLE little buddy to fight alongside you who can help you out by dropping heals or setting traps - he also routes out items for you and even levels up himself!  You can equip and upgrade his sh!t too!  The attention to detail in this game is AMAZING - ex: your little friend hops on a tiny raft when you go in water too deep for him.AND THE CO-OP!  YOU CAN PLAY CO-OP and I'M NOT TALKING THAT CRAPPY SPLIT SCREEN CO-OP IM TALKING REAL MUTLIPLAYER!  AND ITS SO DAMN FUN!  You can d!ck around in the same area for HOURS and not get bored!  You can capture monsters, track monsters, kill monsters, carve monsters, break monsters, jump onto the backs of monsters, run and hide from monsters....  ITS SO GOOD.  You actually do have to hide if you run into something you're not yet ready to take on - which makes it FUN - its not stupid-easy like so many other games out there!The environment is endlessly open - you can harvest, farm, dig, mine, grab, capture almost everything!  The freedom of movement in the game is FANTASTIC.  You can slide, rappel, climb, dodge et all. The negative reviews from its first release on PC are due to the controls - the game started on console (PS4, XBOX) - where it did amazing, by the way.  When CAPCOM ported it over to PC there were some control issues, but most - if not all - of that has been resolved now.  It doesn't take long to tackle the menus and inventory and all the information you need is there.  Meeting up with your friends is a little non-intuitive, but really its not difficult and once you do an Expedition with a friend, you will be immersed for HOURS.  Basically, you have to do the first 1 or 2 quests alone.  Then, you have two options.  You start a Quest/Expedition and send up an SOS which your friend will search for and then join you.  OR, better yet, just start a Quest/Expedition while you and your friend are in the same online session, and he/she can search for it and join.Haven't had this much fun with a game in AGES.  After getting duped into trying ATLAS (IT IS HORRIBLE) this has TOTALLY lifted my spirits!!!!!!"

It can feel a bit grindy mid game, but the 'gameplay loop' is very refined and there are tons of players responding to SOS flares.The game has significant amounts of mods including QoL and transmog (works online), has a lot of advanced graphics settings now, and again the upcoming free content (witcher 3 crossover) looks excellent.The only downside I can think of is the relatively high system requirements and some odd learning curves figuring out different mechanics and systems within the game.

I got everything singleplayer could get me as i did not have acsess to online at that time.

Finally after all these years i finally get to play one of my all time favorite games on the platform of my choosing and its all i remember it was and more. The nostalgia from my childhood came rushing back to me as i started this game and i loved every second of it. Even though this game had a rought start with online connections and still suffer right now to get some of the promised new content out i will still highly recommend this game for anyone who loves the thrill of hunting huge monsters with fellow friends/players.

Yes it is.This is basically my first Monster Hunter game and I've had nothing but fun with it, okay and some angering moments... lol I have MH4U on 3DS, never got invested much into it. :\ Moving on! You get some tiny blades, giant ass blades and some bows and some other thing that you throw a bug at the monster and get buffs. That's pretty neat. THERE'S AN AXE. THAT TRANSFORMS into a GIANT ASS SWORD too. My favorite is the Charge Blade, sword and shield (fuuuu-SHUN HA) NOW IT'S GIANT ASS AXE. Slay those monsters with'em for endless hours of *fun* and even rage enducing failures. Like... You died... To a Great Jagras, . Or you just straight up missed a roll and got one shotted, it's okay it happens to the best. Even worse. A poison dart from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Gajalaka... . Disclaimer: Results may vary amongst players for the fun part. There's grind, but stop complaining. It's worth it. It's rewarding grind. Super! Rewarding! You get stronger, bruh. There's farming, hunt and gather! Gather and hunt! Unless you're jewel farming, you'll never get the one you so desperately need. :( You can slay a monster or capture a monster. Capturing kinda works like the Pokemonz; weaken it for 100% success. lol There's even little creatures and critters you can trap and have as pets in your room!There's collab events too. For example: We had Mega Man and Devil May Cry events. Get some themed gear for you or your palico. What's a palico? Your very own cat buddy! They meow and throw bombs and heal you. They're great, they're so great. Sometimes really annoying and dumb. For multiplayer, there's open sessions you can join. Or just have a private session for you and your friends, or community. Uses a session ID that you can just copy/paste. It'll change every time you play too, to be noted. You can also play solo, you'll eventually have to get some help. But a lot of the game is doable solo, that's how I played.The soundtrack is beautiful. Bazelgeuse and Nergigante's themes are my absolute favorite. The sound design is sooooo damn fantastic. Environment sounds, ambient and just all of it. The monster roars are SO GOOD. The fact that they put irl animal sounds in with a lot of the monster sounds is amazing. You'll notice chickens and whales, for example. I love this game's sound design so much. OH! Deviljho's sounds are so gross, I love it. You'll see, er hear.The game runs great. Little high on CPU usage. But. It's not that bad. There's peeps with higher end processors getting high readings too. Everybody struggles a little together. ;) Lil rough for streamers on a single PC setup, but it's doable. Pro tip: In OBS, under video. You might have to drop it to 30fps, if you're getting to much frame drops. It'll lower OBS' process and give you a little more wiggle room. It's what I do and some others do aswell.If wondering (Note: at the time of posting this):FX-835016GB GTX 970 SSCAverages 60fps after some tweakings. I really recommend this, full price or on sale. Fun solo, funner with a buddy and even moar funner with a full party. It's also not for everyone, do some searching, watch vids and streams."

This is one of those games where you cannot just look at videos, trailers, gameplays and expect to know and understand what the game is. To truly understand this game, you need to have friends who play the game and love a chill grind session without anything to worry about.The game's story ends at 30 hours but the game just starts getting better from there. Starting from the various limited quests to the other collabs like the recent Devil May Cry Collab.

1430,PiranhaPig,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PiranhaPig/,3,,1,243.4,October,"31,",352,0,1,"As a long time Monster Hunter fan, I can confidently say that this is the best game in the series, technically speaking. Many of the things that have kept players away from the series have been remedied, and i'd say it's a much better experience throughout.  World certainly lacks in this department. Nobody really uses voice chat, and it's much harder to make new friends than it used to be in games like mh3u, mostly due to the bigger lobbies.That said, playing with friends is flawless from my experience, haven't had any issues there whatsoever. Instead of having the online be restricted to gathering hall quests,  quests can now be played co-op, even the story quests. (Every player needs to enter the quest individually first if it's the first time fighting a monster to watch said monster's cutscene which is rather annoying, but minor.)As for solo, it's the best solo campaign in the series, without a doubt, though I dislike not being able to skip cutscenes (EDIT: after a second playthrough this issue is a  bigger than I initially thought! Playing the game again feels like a drag after seeing all the cutscenes once already. This only really applies on repeat playthroughs, though.) If you're a Monster Hunter veteran, the first half will probably be no challenge at all, but the later game stuff, especially the so-called  bring some appreciated difficulty. A lot of features have been streamlined, such as the loading zones in between areas, your inventory size, and some other less notable ones. These changes took some time to get used to, but made the game a more enjoyable experience overall.It seems relatively well optimized, nothing amazing here, but I was able to run it at 50-60fps throughout at low-medium settings on my mid-tier computer, which surprisingly still looks pretty good. There's a  of new monsters, though the returning monster-scene is rather dissapointing in comparison. That being said, the new monsters are very cool. This game really promotes using the environment to your advantage, and i feel as though the new monsters use this to the fullest. All of the returning monsters have been given some new moves and visuals as well, though, again, there's not many of them.All of the weapons have also been given a  of new moves and combo's. Even weapons like the dual blades are slightly more complex this time around, bringing in some much needed variety, and weapons like the Insect Glaive and the ranged weapons have been simplified, bringing in some much needed usability. (EDIT: The Iceborne expansion improves the difficulty and lack of content a lot, though it still doesn't come close to 4u or generations in terms of total monsters or weapon design. It also includes a lot of fanservice for veterans of the series with returning monsters, music and classic armor sets and weapons.)  Monster Hunter fans will feel right at home, even if a lot was changed or straight up removed. The online isn't great, but the amazing environments and new additions make up for it. If you're on the fence about this game, i definitely recommend picking it up."

1433,AzuRe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/al-hameli/,3,,1,"3,485.5",October,"26,",312,0,1,"Edited Review.Monster Hunter: World (the 5th Generation in the franchise).This game went through a lot on the PC platform, since August of 2018 and the Dev. Team is fixing almost every game breaking issue. (This explains the mixed reviews).In previous games, you start the game, create a character, gather items, fish and hunt, and repeat, every rank has its own load of Monsters, they're very challenging and enjoyable to fight. There was basically no story back then, if a problem happens...kill a monster.. if you like a monster....kill it, if someone is stealing your honey....kill it....and so on. At some point it will become grindy and repetitive....RNG was a pain. Lots of that changed in here.In Monster Hunter: World they for once added an actual story with NPCs revolving around it.You start, create your character and start, you gather & hunt. Every encounter will have its own purpose with exception to few. As you progress you'll find yourself achieving higher ranks, and so fight new monster or even previous monster but harder and much rewarding.You craft gear, combine items and use the farm to make sure you never lack the essentials.To each armor there are different skills, and so making and armor based on look (fashion hunting) or mixed set (skill based) is very possible. There are 14 weapons, each is unique, but all of them fall below two type: Melee or Ranged.Each will have its own playstyle, and each can be played however you want as long as you have the correct skills set. Some can output very high damage, others can be very defensive and some can be used as support (keep in mind ANY weapon can be used as one of those).You also have a companion that helps you very well...they're talking cats....Palicos .====Pros:====- The Graphics are amazing (comparing it to any previous generation) It is too good to be real.- The music is special, some fights have their own unique music and some give you anxiety when you hear them.- Multiplier is a thing, previous games you could have 4 people in a room, now you could have up to 16, but a quest can have up to 4 hunters with scaling difficulty. You can join other during their hunts or even fire and SOS flare to let others join you if you find yourself in trouble.- Controls are very flexible, supporting all types of controllers (as long as it is supported by Steam) and Mouse & Keyboard (which can be optimized even further with Macros).- 14 weapons --> plenty of possible play styles.- Solo gameplay....yes you're NOT forced to be online to play.- Grinding is NOT as heavy as previous games, there are specific quests that give much higher chance than regular quests to give rare items. (We're talking about up to 16% drop rate).- Free Updates, the game has been getting free update since it release, last update was released already, the next one is a payed Expansion almost as big as the base game.- Mods, Capcom stated its not with nor against modding., there are plenty of mods out there, but if you ever consider cheating please do it offline.======Cons:======- PC Optimization is a bit  lacking. It took 6 Months for them to enable actual HD Textures (30 GB aside from the base game). The game CPU usage is still not optimized....I highly recommend using Special K mode to resolve that issue.- Content Delay, PC was released 8-ish months after consoles, however now we have almost everything the consoles have (with exception to exclusives).- Hackers sometimes ruin the hunts, but you can easily kick them out if you're the Quest leader or the Session leader.- Previous games had PLENTY of content....this one is lacking them since the monsters and everything else was designed from scratch. But this issue will be solved with Iceborn release.=====I have been a fan of the Franchise since 2004-2005, This game is innovation. it is very addictive, and kinda repetitive but as you make friends and hunt with others or even alone you will always find something new or different to do. Can't wait for Iceborn and G/Master Rank, returning monster and NEW monsters and MUCH MORE."

From what i have learned the monsters get 2.6hp multiplier no matter how many people are in, so don't worry about it being more difficult with more players.2. Most players are very helpful and try not to let you cart and while trolls exist yes, during my almost 100 hours i have not met one player who didn't work their hardest to make the hunt work.Good things about multiplayer and MHW in general:1. Can play with friends hunting monsters, go on expeditions and explore the vast worlds or just hang around in the gathering hub.2. The variety of weapons, there are so many types of weapons and the weapon trees are huge and really in-depth, same with armors. You can't stick with only one set of armor and expect it to carry you to the end-game.3. The game is beautiful and really breath-taking. Showed my non-gaming some of the screenshots and they fell in love with it.Negatives about multiplayer:Cheaters(damage multipliers, infinite items and so on) - i personally don't mind these people if they don't actively ruin the experience like one-shot the monster you've had the pleasure of fighting the first time.Connection issues - this has now been fixed and it is very good to hear that people are listened to and problems are being dealt with.The variety in design - after a bit most monsters look the same and the weapons have the same problem, luckily the armor sets do not share that problem which for me is a huge part of some games. Fashion is necessary at one point haha.In conclusion: An amazing game with little flaws that aren't noticeable almost. Expect hours upon hours of fun, a lot of grind and many monsters that you will learn to fight. It feels great and i would suggest you to look past the negative reviews and try it out for yourself. After all, its an experience and everyone differs. So go for it and become the greatest hunter in the fifth fleet to date."

Challenging and incredibly immersive with the coming on PC being a huge step for the franchise. Incredible additions to quality of life compared to the previous franchise and a massive amount of detail in its work.MH community is famous to be whiny with hardcore vegans players. The developer team is not experienced at all in PC as Japan is all about consoles; ***the game need to be entirely reprogrammed for it to have a PC port, thus the delaays***. The port is great and works smoothly with issues being read and fixed as they go.We keep having more events and DLCs, all of them which comes with their A+ content. All the whine just disencourage how CAPCOM *finally* decided to take a step towards PC to give a hand to their western audience."

It's quite possibly one of the coolest non-combat hubs I've seen in a game. I also really love how dino/monster fights can have unexpected twists. A monster might get tangled up in vines or you might find a new monster suddenly attacking the one you were just fighting. I also enjoy climbing on top of a monster and riding it while attacking, or enlisting other monsters in the hunt. This game is not just for everybody, and it's important to realize that before jumping in based on review scores and word of mouth alone. If you enjoy the game, fine. If it's not for you, that's fine too... this game is worth 10/10 for me. :)"

(I pre-ordered the game and saved at least 25 USD but I still think its worth the price.)Is Monster Hunter: World fun?- Sure, it had its issues when it was first launched in PC, but this is definitely a fun game with lots of content and hundreds of hours of fun activities which will keep you logged in always. There are tons of players and even if you're new to the series, experienced players usually just enters your room and help you slay the monster. Is Monster Hunter: World perfect for its genre? - Definitely not. While a great game, I first started playing the franchise when it was on PSP and it's a bit repetitive if you're a fan of the series for that long. Should this stop me from buying future Monster Hunter release? No. It will not. While huge new contents are almost rare to none, this is still a great game and is improving over time. Overall thoughts on the game: - Just buy it, it's fun."

I enjoyed every single one.Let me jump straight into the negative point(s).-only 32 boss monsters -lacking some graphical optionsThat's it.BUT! They will add free(!) content with new monsters in the futureThey've fixed the connectivity issue and the game works fine.The connectivity issue wasn't even a problem for solo players to begin with.To all players crying about coop because they can not handle some monsters... git good.Every single one is solo-able.It has beautiful graphics and the loading screen time isn't worth mentioning since it's almost non existent.It's a beautiful game for both veterans and beginners since it does have a decent story and some sort of guidance throughout the game.I am highly recommending this game. 10/10
1441,Wowenz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wowenz/,3,,1,514.7,September,"4,",196,0,1,"A very good game, especially if you're into grinding. You'll feel the weight of every weapon. I have already played the console version, and bought another one on the PC for playing with PC friends and to experience the 60+ fps smoothness. Very enjoyable, you'll be surprised you have already spent a ton of hours in the game.I would ignore the negative reviews, since most of them are about Denuvo, their PC not being able to handle it,  visual options that aren't in the game, connection issues(which is now fixed btw).

For those just entering the series it's the perfect game. I fully admit there were some excessively detailed and often bothersome mechanics in the previous games. I think this one over-simplifies many aspects to the point of being boring (like putting cool drink mushrooms at the entrance of every lava zone), but most of the ease of life changes are much appreciated (like not having to go to the wiki to look up monster weaknesses). Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Very enjoyable, but slightly too easy."

1445,Rukinaa,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055953136/,3,,1,656.7,September,"3,",161,0,1,"arrived on PC in August of 2018, continuing the  franchise and bringing a plethora of quality of life changes and a huge graphical update to create a  game unlike anything that has come before it.      It is no secret to long-standing fans of the series that the plot of  games is usually quite weak and unfortunately,  doesn't break from this pattern. With an unremarkable scenario and characters who you probably won't care about or for, the game does very little to create a story that compels you to make any progress, relying instead on its gameplay. For newcomers to the franchise, you may be disappointed by the storyline, though veteran players will not be suprised at all.     The quality of life changes brought to the table in  make it one of the most engaging hunting experiences yet. All the weapons you expect are present and have been updated to improve their gameplay experience and alongside the much more interactive environments really lend themselves to creating more dynamic and variable hunts than ever before, all layered with a plethora of new monsters to fight and some old fan favourites making a welcome return.      is without a doubt the best looking  game and some of the environments look fantastic. The introductory Ancient Forest map in particular stands as the poster boy with a brilliant aesthetic which really brings the forest ecosystem to life. Despite this however, some ofthe environments are much more bland with dreary colours that sort of blend together and lacking any features that make them stand out or make them memorable. On the other hand, all the monsters look fantastic, whether it's the new monsters who you are meeting for the first time, or old favourites who have had a facelift, you'll certainly be impressed.      has a good soundtrack overall with a few standout tracks, however the music mostly falls into the ambience of the hunt and you usually don't pay it much attention over the roars and slashes of the fight. That being said, if you find time to listen to the soundtrack, you will find the kind of melodies that have become inexorably tied to the franchise - quality music, but I don't see myself listening to it in my spare time.      , like any  game has fantastic replayabilty with a number of quests to undertake and gear to craft once the credits have rolled. It's not uncommon to hear  players stating that the main scenario is just the tutorial for what is to come, and with a load of incoming DLC content on the horizon, I'm inclined to agree. As you set your own goals, you will find hours slipping away from you as you spend time in the New World, looking for those elusive monster parts or the perfect decoration for your armour. Of course, due to the nature of the game, the endgame is grindy but, at least in my opinion, the gameplay is fun enough to keep it from becoming a chore.      Overall, I think that  is a solid entry in the series and that the changes made here make it forward into future games. With it being the most acessible to new players yet, there has never been a better entry than  to try out this series of games."
1446,Skurkanas,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006330972/,4,,1,225.5,September,"1,",342,1,1,"Alright so seeing this getting torn to shreds because it doesn't support 2012x3086 resolutions or whatever, I thought I'd add my 50 cents and talk about wether the actual GAME is fun.Disclaimer: I haven't touched a console since the N-64 and haven't played any of the previous Monster Hunter games. I also generally avoid japanese/korean grindfests like the plague, so I was pretty sceptical going into this.~ 140 hours later ~What I like:1. For a game about killing monsters, there is a surprising amount of depth to it. With low rank, high rank and the unofficial ""endgame"", there are distinct chapters to the game that each offer a new level of challenge. And unlike the ""New Game +"" found in many other asian titles, it isn't just a cheap way to extend playtime by copy-pasting everything with twice health and damage, but you actually unlock new layers of complexity (New Monsters, New Armor Sets, new Skills, Gem-Slots, Augmentations...), that would be overwhelming if introduced right at the start.2. Customisation. There's a ton of ways to build your equipment to fit your playstyle. And 16 really distinct weapon types, that completely change your approach to a fight, offering a fresh angle if you get bored of your ""main"" weapon.3. The Fights. They did a good job adding weight to the animations, both of your weapons and the monsters. There's plenty of ""oh ♥♥♥♥"" moments when you see a house-sized mass of fangs and horns charging at you, and plenty of gratification (and feedback) when you land that Hammer Smash right in its face. Or manage to dodge at the last second. Or manage to blow the pesky thing out of the sky. They did all this while still making the fights feel - mostly - fair. While arbitrary hit-boxes do exist, there is not a whole lot of them. If you die, you (usually) know what went wrong.4. Quality of Life improvements. Talking to a mate who played the older games, Capcom apparently went out of their way to make this game ""streamlined"". Aka, they removed a TON of pointless tedium so common in asian games (and thankfully absent from western games since the late 80ies). There are still plenty of gripes and nuisances (and I will get to that in a bit), but for someone like me who usually avoids asian games, it's at least tolerable.What I dislike:1. The ""Consoleness"". They didn't really manage to get that out of the game. The menus, the interaction with NPCs, the crafting, the item management. Everything takes about 4-5 times as many clicks as it has to. Pretty clunky when you are used to Mouse&Keyboard, but probably can't be done better for controllers.2. The Grind. It's much less than I feared it would be (for much of low and high rank, you will get enough materials from killing monsters once or twice to craft their gear), so progression feels smooth all the way into endgame, but once you reach endgame and start farming for gems and augmentations, the Grind is definitely there.3. The Multiplayer-System. I don't mean the multiplayer itself. IF you get it to work, it's a ton of fun to murder a monster as a group (especially since this also brings in combos and support-""classes"" you won't really see in solo). The problem is in getting it to work.Used to MMO's full of people you could readily interact with? Used to hotjoining friends at the press of a button? Think again. MHW-multiplayer is trying hard to bring back those LAN-party days of needlessly complicated peer-to-peer. Much like the menus, joining a multiplayer session takes about 3-4 times more steps than necessary. And despite servers for 16 players, you will not actually see any of them outside of a very specific hub node.On the upside, they took quick action to fix some very annoying connectivity issues and as i mentioned, once you DO get on the same server and into the same quest, it's a blast.So in conclusion, while the game really shows its console roots, it did away with enough of them to be enjoyable, even if you are new to the series or this kind of game in general."

An update dropped - and with it all the networking problems dissapeared. This game is a blast to play with friends now, and I highly reccomend it. That said, there are still a host of issues. The optimisation is pretty bad. You can't play it with mouse and keyboard unless you hate yourself. The chat system and menu implementation is atrocious. But all in all - It's now a game I can play with friends and enjoy. But seriously capcom. Get rid of the need for everyone to have watched the cutscene in singleplayer before they can play the mission with friends. That was a straight up dumb idea."
1460,Laken,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kzLaken/,3,,1,525.8,August,"21,",80,0,1,"It's definitely worth your time. Everything about the game was beautiful. The difficulty, character models, progression, storyline, small cinematics/cutscenes, community, and everything in between was top notch.This is my first rpg in a long time. I've played nothing but Mobas and Battle Royale for so long, hopping to a game like this was a great first time experience.This is a game you can definitely progress at your own time. There's no need to rush to the end game. Perhaps it may even be better to take your time. By taking your time, I mean; grind for your gears, head onto Exploration find all gatherings, max out your trackings, help out newcomers, etc.So about my ratings, Here are the things I enjoyed about the game.-- Combat --The combat is clunky. That's how it is. I'm used to the fluid dynamics of animation cancelling, barage of abilities, and no haptic feedback. With this game, every move you make staggers a little bit. It shows the weight of your attacks and weak points for pulling of abilities. It's a slow paced game. You need to attack, dodge/counterattack every move the monster makes. Trying to bust out a over 9000 dps ain't going to help you out in this game. Every assignment (assuming you are using a weapon relative to the boss being fought) should and would take roughly 5~30min completion.-- Storyline --The story was beautiful. I don't want to say too much and spoil it. But when I got to the end, finished the final boss I felt a sense of achievement. Watching the credits roll down and the music playing It felt amazing. I felt my character progress from zero to hero at that point. All my hardwork, achievements, dedication to the Guild and all Hunters made my heart sway-- Plenty to do --There's plenty to do. Did you finish the game? Try doing it again with another weapon zero to hero. Do this 14 times as there are so many weapons to choose from. Plenty of armors to collect, builds to discover and invent. I completed the game using a bow, now I want to try complete the game with a different weapon.-- Community --There will always be people who are there willing to help. There were plenty of times I got stuck on so many monsters, I had to queue up in sessions just to get it done. There are people who are most likely doing the same quests as you. Even if you start the game late, people are taking their time. they also want x specific materials but they don't want to grind it alone so they go back hop onto Join quest and look at some SOS for free quick zen cashes or mats to grab.-- Difficulty --There difficulty is well set. At the high rank level the bosses require a lot more game sense and structural approach. the were plenty of cases such as the first time Anjanath i had difficulties because you don't know the monster's abilties at first. It's all about trial and error and adapting to the situation. Get into the habit of taking your time against the boss; Hit and anticipate. Every monster in the game won't let you just bash their life out without retaliating at all. Always look for that window.-- It's not going to die anytime soon --The game isn't going to die. Thinking about investing time, but realizing in a few months/years time it's going to die doesn't apply to this game. Games like these are fun both single player and multiplayer. Technically it's meant to be played as singleplayer. games where the community is heavily important isn't that important for this game. Though it is fun and better to be accompanied by people.Honestly, It's really worth playing the game. If you're feeling empty; searching for that game that will interest you, keep you up at night thinking about strategies approaching you will do after you get up in the morning, or come after school/work. I think this game would be it. give it a go"

Play it on console if you can afford to. (GOOD ON PC NOW)The PC version:-several months behind in content -server issues -poorly optimized, even with high end GPU, FPS dips constantly in certain situations -very CPU heavy, requires an insane rig (""25% of all CPU time is spent switching active threads because the game has over 100 threads."")  -awful keyboard and mouse controls with no meaningful adjustments available in settings -uses Denuvo, if that sort of thing bothers you It's shame, because if the FPS and server issues could be fixed, then I would highly recommend it. It took them 6 months to port this game over to PC and it feels like I'm playing a bootleg emulated version of the console game. I'm hopeful for fixes in the near future, but knowing Capcom and their track record, we won't see noticeable improvements for months or ever. If servers are no longer an issue when someone reads this review, then it's likely because so many people have finished the game and aren't playing, reducing the load on the servers.As a long time MH player since the PS2, this game was a massive letdown. For returning fans, play Generations Ultimate for the switch instead.MAY 2019 UPDATE TO REVIEW:Most graphical and performance issues have been resolved. Keyboard and mouse issues have been resolved.Game is still several months behind in updates, but at least it's now playable on PC.Gameplay still panders to MMO audiences rather than MH fans, but it's a good game on it's own merits. If you don't like min-maxing your gear in MMOs, then there's not much endgame content to enjoy. Timed events limit your ability to do as you please, but it adds a longer life span to the game; for better or worse.Final verdict: Monster Hunter: World is a good game, it's just not a very good Monster Hunter.

1468,Zazz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImtheZazz/,3,,1,279.7,August,"14,",520,0,1,"I was going  to give this game a negative review just so they would pay more attention to the connection issues the game is going through, but it seems that won't be necessary, so far that's the only negative point of the game I can agree with (this coming from someone who strongly agree with most of the negative reviews around with the exception of those that don't provide any useful information at all).Now despite the disconnection issues (which I think steam has something to do with) I've been having a great time with my friends and yes the progression on the quests may make you play alone for a bit  you can still hunt the monsters with your friends once they finished watching the cinematics (you can leave the mission at any given time to continue it later) Here in some negative comments they make it seem like you have to complete the whole game to play with your friends, so fear not, if it doesn't work they can always join you through SOS signals, I think there is information out there on how the multiplayer works.Now adressing the graphical issues, so far I am running it at constant 60FPS on high settings with a GTX1060 (3GB) with the other specs are above the recommended, only FPS's drops I get are when it's either raining or when in a party 4 with a lot of effects going around, without dropping below 30fps, the blur everyone is talking about is named volumetric fog and there is a pinned post on the discussion thread of the game that tells you that disabling it will increase your perfomance (although it doesn't specify that it will get rid of the blurry effect as well) so you should be good as long as your specs are on or above the recommended ones, forgot to mention that you can set the frames to 30fps,60fps or no limit, I would recommend disabling v-sync unless you are streaming. The complains about the combat system: It is a bit clunky I'm not gonna lie and the target system is awful so don't use it, aside from that that's the way Monster Hunter's combat is and has been for a long while, you have 13 other weapons to try if you don't like your current one's moveset, you'll see this won't bother you at all once you get better with them.So without any bias; The combat system is quite fine and won't drag the fun out of the game (except for the dumb target lock-in don't use that crap with mouse and keyboard, it's awful).Now adressing the ""♥♥♥♥ port"" ones, these ones... Clearly have no idea what a bad port looks like, the things you need to configure are there in the options panel, and for those that aren't go to the game folder and modify the config.ini file text into whatever you wish and unlike other ports the game shows you the keyboard/mouse keys you need to press instead of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Xbox controller ones. Obviously it's not a PC game, but if you are gonna bash the game for being a port then do it properly.And finally my personal opinion about the game.It's great, but keep in mind it's not a game for everyone since you'll need to grind materials in order to get better gear (Not to an excessive MMO grinding style unless you are looking to use all the weapons and armors in the game) so far I didn't find it as repetitive and dense as in other games since everything I do feels like progress, you can have more than one character so you can also play alone while your friends aren't around if you wish to progress together, it's really enjoyable when it comes to multiplayer, except for the disconnection issue that's going on right now which can be painfully annoying, the big monsters feel quite unique along with their weaknesses, each map also feels quite unique and quite pretty, love the conceptual art of the game and the work behind it. I would keep going but I think there are better well structured reviews here that'd do a better job than me at it.tl;dr : Game is nice just make sure you know what the game goes about and what you do in it, if multiplayer connection issues will make you hate the game then wait until they patch it although they aren't as severe as the negative comments make it seem, you can go online through the in-game board and rejoin the session if that helps."

It's a heck of a fun game and the gameplay loop is addicting and the monsters have a really cool design about them. Getting toknow the creature and it's animations and getting better everytime you fight it is satisfyting  and adding a friend in makes it all the more fun. The story is meh and feels a little more pushed into my face , especiallly with the unskippable cutscenes. (welcome to 2004) I know I have a lot of hours left in the game, so i'm really looking forward to that. If you asked me to recommend this game, I would say rather confidently: No, not right now. -M/kb support in my opinion is pretty awful. The mouse feels way smoother than it should and doesn't feel natural at all. -Connection issues galore. Besides it having an issue with keeping the steam community from going wild when playing to the point that I just have to go offline on steam to stop pop ups of friends coming up. It took me 30 minutes to connect to a server- and then 30 more minutes to find a party I can connect to. Once I connect, the chances of me being DC'd in the middle of the hunt are rather high. -Even when playing with friends, we would get these connection issues and it is pretty frustrating. The game lets you continue on the hunt alone if you get DC'd, but I was hoping not to face THIS many issues at launch. -no 21:9 support. My favorite moniter has been rendered useless. It'll say that the game is running at my native resolution but i'm playing with black bars on the side. Luckily, I have a 2nd monitor that i'm able to force the game onto and play 16:9. An indie game I got for free the other day has 21:9 support. -The co-op system isn't ideal and is feels very dated. This isn't a technical problem, but bad game design. Still, not in my favor buuut my friends and I just deal with it. Not a big problem, but could turn some people off from playing the game with someone. -Aesthetically it's a pretty game, but not pretty enough to be demanding so much from your CPU. I'm not a super technical wizard, but the game pushes my 6700 into 75-90% CPU usage. I don't suffer any framerate lag, but I can definitely hear and see my computer using all it's got. I've played most of the demanding games out there with minimal to no issues at my native resolution, but this game makes my computer do its best Torbjorn impersonation. I'm sure there's a lot more issues going on with a lot of other people out there, but this is all I could think of off the top of my head. If you really want this game RIGHT NOW, be aware you might not have the smoothest of gaming given to you for your hard earned money. If you can wait it out a bit and hope for a patch, then do so. You might be rewarded. I don't regret my purchase, but I'm definitely not completely satisfied with it. Anyway, I'mma go hunt some monsters. Tibby out.UPDATE 1.22.19 It's been a long time coming, but CAPCOM has updated the game into a state in which I could whole heartedly reccomend it. There has been a steady stream of updates and fixed a lot of the issues which were ailing the experience for me. The best part of all these updates...THEY FINALLY ADDED OFFICIAL ULTRAWIDE SUPPORT. Thanks, CAPCOM. Please don't break it."

1476,Cervantes,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987668595/,3,,1,660.2,August,"13,",259,0,1,"I had never played a Monster Hunter game before, and I don't own a controller so I had the mixed pleasure of getting the full PC port experience. The controls will feel awkward, there's no way around it, nothing was tailored with KB+mouse in mind and the only effort the devs did was to let us rebind most combat controls with relative freedom, which I appreciate.From what I've heard this game is a good Monster Hunter game, but if you were not into that to begin with it won't change your mind. I can understand that, because the core gameplay is very... special. It basically revolves around switching between weapon sheathed and drawn to perform two very distinct sets of contextual actions, a lot of those you would expect to be able to do in any situation like for example ""moving at a decent pace"" or ""grabbing something on the ground"". Nope, gotta spend 5 whole seconds to fold your ridiculously huge weapon fourways on your back before you can do ANYTHING else than attacking with the aforementionned weapon.This makes every fight feel like an uncomfortable mess of animation locks, awkward movements and sheer frustration, since most monsters in the game move quite fast and hit quite hard (as in one or two shot you). The gameplay is all about timing your actions properly rather than quick and/or complex executions. And since every decently big monster in this game has a ridiculous (and invisible) HP pool, most hunts will take longer than a damn Timewalking dungeon in WoW. However, it does feel really satisfying when you manage to go ham on a monster, be it from teamwork, mounting it or just landing a really big (and long-winded) attack.Also the game involves a LOT of grinding, especially when you start to get into item sets. You'll need to kill that same monster you struggled on for 40 whole minutes about 120 times before you finally get the one 2% component you need to craft the final piece of armor you need from him.The multiplayer aspect of the game is very important, and that's where most of the fun you'll had will come from. Unfortunately it's full of oversights and problems. First off, the server keep sh*tting the bed. It seriously disconnects you from sessions way too often to be dismissed as a ""release issue"", fix it already. Then there is no ""matchmaking"" to speak of AND no global lobby or even global chat to use to find people to play with. The only time you'll see other players is during the mission itself, during which communication is usually extremely limited since the chat is awkward to use and every mission is timed. So you'll find yourself joining randoms from the ""respond to SOS"" menu, then leaving and never seeing them again usually without exchanging a word once the hunt is over. Playing with friends through the ""story"" was also a bit annoying since most missions require you to play solo until you get all the cutscenes, then quit in front of the monster, redo the mission and THEN you can invite your friend assuming he's done the exact same thing.To conclude I'd say the game is a good timekiller. The story is easily forgettable and just here to introduce the various monsters and areas in the game. Visuals are great and I thought it was a good discovery experience, albeit riddled with frustrating controls and server errors which prevented me from reliably play with my friends. It is quite addictive, and there are a lot of weapons to try out and a lot of big monsters to kill or capture. I probably won't spend the hundreds of hours required to fully gear myself out and take on the biggest challenges, but I can see the appeal.[edit]Guess I did anyway. It sure is an addictive game !"

I'll just cut to the chase.>Pros:-A few things are streamlined in a pretty good way. You have infinite whetstones, picks, and bug nets, and you always have a BBQ spit and fishing rod with you. None of this takes up any inventory space. I guess I enjoyed the flow of having to buy picks, bug nets, and whetstones, but I always took those items with me anyways. You were honestly screwed if you didn't bring whetstones. You'd never run out since you'd have a full stack or so, and you were kind of forced to bring them anyways.-Gathering goes by a lot quicker. The animations are faster to the point where you can gather while running by items, and the nodes tend to give you a little bit more herbs and such this time around too. This streamlines the process in a pretty alright way.-Every weapon seems to have at least one new thing it can do, and they're all pretty neat.-Combat is actually pretty fun, if not a bit too easy.-Paintballs have been removed and replaced by the scoutfly feature, which is fair enough. I don't mind actually tracking the monster down.-They're adding in new monsters via updates, which is nice.>Cons:-There are only around 30 monsters in the game at the time of writing, and I doubt we're going to see a lot more in the game with the updates.-The game is WAY too easy. I was only genuinely challenged a few times throughout the game so far, whereas other MH titles have brutalized me before.-There are tempered monsters which are buffed versions of the monsters in the game. It just gives the monster a damage multiplier. It's lazy and not nearly as unique as the hyper, frenzy, and deviant monsters we've seen before.-There's so much healing everywhere it's ridiculous. There's not nearly as much pressure from running out of supplies as there was in the previous games because there's free healing everywhere more or less. -Armor system is a mess. You can just take whatever pieces of armor you want and slap them together and get full benefits, as a single piece of armor will give you a full skill. There's really not much of a reason to get an entire set anymore.-Weapons all look incredibly bland. In previous titles weapons would all be unique looking, but in Monster Hunter World, they're all more or less the two ""bone"" and ""iron"" versions of that weapon with a few edits.-Armors actually look relatively bland, too. This is most likely to make it so sets that are all mixed together don't clash as much.-Network issues are fairly common. Expect to be disconnected and be unable to connect.-A lot of random FPS drops out of nowhere.-Denuvo doesn't exactly effect the gameplay, but this game has it. I suppose it's up to you whether you're okay with that or not.-You only get about 80 hours or so of content compared to the hundreds you'd get in other Monster Hunters. I'm hoping the G-rank update fixes this.This game can be fun at times but they really messed up on several parts, and the slog of getting through hunts that don't really offer much of a challenge kind of makes that fun a little harder to get to. I normally don't write a lot of reviews but I wanted to say something. Just play one of the previous titles if you're looking at getting into the franchise."

1506,Scrub McGrub,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GSKerns/,4,,0,148.9,August,"24,",569,3,1,"*This review is written after reaching credits and 72 hours of playtime*The game of Monster Hunter: World is very well documented and reviewed thanks to the console version at this time. I could have played that version of the game at launch, but decided to hold out on PC for a smoother experience and improved visuals....... well that was a mistake. Even on a GTX 1080, 32 gigs of RAM, and a i7-8700... the game has bad issues. Serious frame drops down into the teens on some of the late game content. Texture bug that will have you seeing muddy low res textures through the whole game, even when set to the highest texture setting. What should have been the best way to play the game is actually a couple steps behind PS4 pro and Xbox One X. The game itself is fine, very enjoyable... limited mod support ATM. You'll need it if you want the proper controller prompts on Dual Shock. Obvious this port was rushed and sloppy. Upcoming DLC is free anyway- so not like Capcom will give an apology gift.Bottom line.... if you waited this long like me. Give it a couple months of updates and you'll likely hit a holliday sale on the game anyway. Or if you're the type of person that likes a sub-console experience on your PC (maybe that's all your rig can do).... then have at it."

I did not purchase/install the expansion (Iceborne). Previously I used med/low settings at 1080p30. The menu now runs at seconds per frame rather than frames per second, and dropping every graphical setting in the game to the lowest value (or off if possible) still leaves the main hub running like a slide show. Perusing the forums shows I'm far from the only one with this issue. I cannot recommend this game in its current state to anyone.EDIT: As of 1/21, after a game update and updating my PC from Win7 to Win10, the game is now working again. However, it now crashes upon any loss of focus; this includes selecting any options within the steam overlay, like controller settings. While the base gameplay is great, the ongoing technical issues leave me hesitating to recommend the game.EDIT: As of April, the technical issues appear to be resolved. I am getting good FPS and the game no longer crashes upon loss of focus. The gameplay remains extremely solid. Since the tech issues are resolved, I can now strongly recommend this game."

Charge blade quickly became my favourite weapon in any game ever (and took me weeks to learn everything it has to offer).The main thing World has that stands out from other monhun games is the environmental design. It feels SO carefully put together to feel like actual places rather than the collection of rooms connected by corridors the other games don't really try to hide. Monster behaviours feel distinct from each other and even something as simple as variation in how aggressive different monsters are when they see you really feels good (even if it's odd that they're all aggressive when you first meet them in a story quest). Having monsters WAY stronger than you're intended to be fighting roaming the areas is scary (at least to a monhun first-timer) and it feels great!World really stands out as an experience above all the other games, though I would say Rise is more fun to play. The slinger & clutch claw stuff is annoying & when you're using it fully it just makes the game easier in a way that isn't fun at all. Elder dragons are mostly just frustrating to fight in World and I was surprised when I actually had fun fighting them in Rise."

My only complaint? Allow me to join missions with people that are higher than me in the story. Just don't give ME the credit till I've completed the story up to that part. I cannot believe some of these reviews. You own a PC, do you know how to even run it? If you want something to work without effort, get a console system and don't complain you are locked at 30fps. If you want run games at 60+fps with all the settings high...upgrade more than once every 10 years, learn how a PC works, and learn how to tweak your system. Seriously.

World brings high levels of Custommisation and build veriaty with 14 diffirent weapon types and hundrets of armor sets with interchangable parts and unique abilitys to fit whatever playstyle you prefer. every weapon type feels unique and brings a diffirent style of play, light- and heavy-bowgun might look similar at first but feel worlds apart in actuall play. sword and shield and dual blades might seem like similar short ranged fast weapons, but while dual blades are a test in stamina manigement, positioning and timing, sword and shield is a utility beast, being able to do cutting and blunt damage and using item with the weapon drawn. the lance makes you feel like an impenetrable fortress but the gunlance offers unimaginable offensive abilitys. no two weapons feel alike even if they have similaritys at first. the monsters that you will be facing through out the game also have no equil, every monster has their own personallity and every hunt is a learning experiance to perfect playing around them as efficiantly as possible. but this game isnt just you with a sword in a blank room, fighting an overzised lizard, part of what makes a great hunter is the ability to use the enviroment to your advantage. wether that be by picking up slinger ammo to chuck at the monster to cause all sorts of effects, or knocking over rocks to crush it for massive damage, tipping over plants to make them spill poison that the monster can step in. the world feels full of usfull things and looks wonderfull at the same time. now, my recommendation comes with a bit of an asterisk. if you are truly going to get into this game i would suggust doing it along side someone who already knows it somewhat well, and this has a few reasons.firstly, the game can be VERY overwhelming at first and even tho it tries its best to explain everything to the player it can be easy to just skip over some of the text boxes and miss important information. learing through text boxes can be quite boring and might turn some players away entirely (i've certainly met people who ranted endlessly about how bad the game is just because they didnt understand/know about a mechanic that they had skipped over in the tutorial). having someone at your side to explain more important mechanics along with basic things can be extremely helpful at first, a lot of youtubers also make great tutorials on weapons, armor skills and the such to help anyone wondering about how to optimize or even just improve their play, tho none of this is really required. all in all its a game best enjoyed with an open mind and a good friend."

I'm no tech guru but what they have done with the Anti Temper Code is ridicilous. Please look for the Tech section as mentioned in the initial Review to learn exact infos about the whole situation.Iceborne is the peak of mhw's lifecycle. The game itself is amazing. Just the code behind it is even for japanese standards.. pretty anti consumer and 10 years backwards.I can't change this Review to Positive even If I love this Game. The way they handle the PC Version is a disgrace. Monster Hunter deserved better and I hope they use their new RE Engine for mhw2 without blowing a lot of cpus off.Go ahead and try this excellent game. If you have issues, steams refund option sure comes in handy.--------It is a shame what capcom is doing with this Version of the game. This is Monster Hunter, a game where people hunt and slay monsters. It is fluid and fun. Its repititive and grindy but the overall gameplay variety due to the awesome weapons makes it up for the for a MH game small monster roster.I'm a huge fan of the series. Especially now with ""next gen"" graphics and QoL improvements.So why a negative review? It's simple.Capcom screwed it up. They aknowledged that they dont have a real clue about PC game developing months ago. Which is ok. Everyone has to learn. But the way they patch the game is by far the worst Ive ever seen.They don't really fix things. They make the game with every new patch totally unplayable for a lot of people.I don't have any crash problems but the stutters and framepacing after the kulve taroth update seriously makes me nuts. (Still playable but annoying imho)There are countless threads in the mhw steamhub tech section for more info in that regard.I just want to voice my opinion with this review that capcom should get their butts together and aknowledge the problems half the playerbase have. They are silent..  one look at steamdb shows that a lot of people just quit during the kulve update because they simply can't play at all. Capcoms response? None at all. That shows me that they don't really deserve a positive review at all.. regardless how fun the game is. They screwed it up big time with the inability to handle PC version development.I will change this review once capcom decide to finally fix their game instead of giving candy via useless limited event content which half of the community can't play due to stutters and crashs.People on the fence buying this should hold it and watch the patch progress. Or buy it and try it out for yourself and refund it if you have problems.------------..."

Being the first PC Monster Hunter experience, Monster Hunter: World has definitely captivated some new fans (myself included) into the genre...albeit with the current meta of games holding true to the ""RNG"" scene of things.With a variety of weapons to choose from (fourteen to be specific), there's a different playstyle and different strategy with each weapon, and each monster; add one, two, or three extra buddies into the equation, and either you can wind up with a hellish torment of salt and rage, or a barrel of laughs so large that no comedy out there will ever outdo it.The story is short, able to be finished within a relatively short amount of time (I'd estimate...ten or so hours, at most?, non-stop?), provided you aren't the type of player who gets into a desire to hunt/capture a specific Monster for their parts to make the newest, greatest, best of gear you can have at that current time!  Plenty of extra quests on the side, though most still involve hunting, or gathering-that's a good, easy description for Monster Hunter:  Hunter/Gatherer.  But the developers at Capcom have a way of tying in continuous events and other universes in their repertoir to entice and interest players for days/weeks to come.If you want action,  MHW has got it.  If you want thrills, MHW has got it.  If you want salt, hell, MHW has got it (trust me, sometimes, mechanics will leave you questioning the meaning of life)."

As indicated by the comparison of recent reviews to overall reviews, Capcom has proved themselves on PC as more than willing to resolve issues, listen to player feedback, and implement great updates and changes. At the time of this writing (Nov. 29 2019), that's an 89% postive of 11,810 reviews on recent  (just the past 30 days alone) to a 63% overall of 52,370 reviews total. This game never deserved mixed reviews, however if you are on the fence at all I implore to check out gameplay and guides. The quality of this game is undeniable, and almost all the negative issues present at launch are gone, or reduced to outliers! (connections issues were the main culprit, some very niche concerns of PC port options, refer to previous update notes if you're interested)The Monster Hunter Series has never held your hand, but MH World is by the far the most entry friendly entry in the series. It's a game that may require patience to learn your enemy, learn your weapon, and keep standing back up after getting beatdown. It is NOT a hack and slash game. Also the entirety of the game can be played solo if thats your cup of tea. Capcom has not only been updating with great fixes and QoL updates, but also tons of FREE content. Adding entire new monsters, rotating event quests, seasonal celebration events, collaborations with series like Megaman, DMC and more.  All in all, Monster Hunter Worlds is truly an amazing game becoming one of my favorites of all time, and it honestly would be a shame if you didn't at least try it. Monster Hunter is a game series that essentially boils down to big boss fights. In Worlds, that is big boss fights in beautiful seamless maps with no loading between zones and many many quality of life upgrades from the old handheld bound titles. Yes there are little small fries too, its not just one big boss in an arena. One of the themes of Worlds, is well...being a world. The maps look amazing but the focus on detail of being simulating an actual ecosystem is immersing. Many large monsters can roam the through the forests as your tracking and hunting one specific target, there are many species of small monsters native to the different maps, and tons of endemic life throughout. You can even catch said endemic life with a net and allow them to roam back in your house! I highly recommend watching Making of Monster Hunter video series to catch a glimpse of the passion, reasoning, and crafting care put into this game. The core of gameplay revolves around two parts, monsters and weapons, I'd argue this the summary of what you need to master. There are 14 weapon types, and these might be more akin to classes you'd see in other games. The movesets, attacks, playstyle, it will all be quite different from one another. As playstyle can vary quite drastically, it should only be a matter of patience finding what suits you. Check out the ""All weapon types gameplay trailer"" to get a teasing idea of the main weapons and how they might play. It's a game that may require patience to learn your enemy, learn your weapon, and keep standing back up after getting beatdown. Check out Arekkz & Gaijin Hunter for guides to learn the core of each weapon, and they also have other great informative videos to gleam info from. A good Hunter always takes notes, so they may better hunt their prey. The other, more obvious, key of gameplay is the monsters themselves. Much like learning your weapon, learning your enemy is key to victory. Each monster a range of attacks and patterns, and if you want to avoid being lunch it's best you pick up on them. Monster behaviours can vary from hunt to hunt, even if it's the same exact monster. In the game there are Low Rank and High Rank versions, and some variants later on. Low Rank are a basic version that is teaching you both the monster and the game. Remember, an informed hunter is the best kind. Don't be afraid to do your research on the monster, whether in-game looking at weaknesses etc, or out of game guides and such.To elaborate more on this, the headlining and most frustrating is the ""Connection lost"" message during a hunt, though pretty much resolved and now occasional stuff you might expect in just about any onine game. If dc/d you remain in the same hunt, but now youre by yourself.However, as hunts in multiplayer are scaled up, unless the monster is almost dead is it best to just leave if you are stuck solo. There are two options to leaving a quest, ""Abandon Quest"" and ""Return from Quest"". Abandoning allows you to return the hub in the state you were before the hunt started, allowing you to keep all items you may have used up, but losing anything you picked up during the quest. The other option simply returns you as you are, keeping any new things you gained, but on the same note any items used will remain expended. *Side Note* Cutscenes cannot be skipped, nor can they be watched together. So the easiest way to play these quests together is to post the quest and go in solo (you can still be in the MP lobby) get to the cutscene, then your friends can join in as long as they have watched the cutscene themselves. You can also fire SOS flares at that point, allowing any random player to join in, or you can return/abandon quest and repost in the hub if you so desire.  I have played a lot of ports, including many Bandai Namco games, and I have to say MHW is a great port on PC. Easily better than any of the Dark Souls ports, 3 included. Capcom has also included many updates addressing qualms or issues PC players have brought up. The game has a good many options, good customisable keybindings (including side mouse butons etc). Frame limits can be 30, 60, or Unlimited. You can use a controller, but mouse and keyboard are great, and with almost everything being remappable you can find what works best for you. There is NOW an option to turn off motion blur but I don't really notice the blur being intense like many other games, but I also always keep it on in my games I tend to like it or at least not care. Some resolutions or widescreen may not be supported, so if thats something serious to you definitely look into what is supported for your setup. (I have not bothered to check if this is part is any different when updating this review so I'll leave as is) I play on the higest graphics settings, with my FPS ranging from mid 40s to mid 65s. I haven't bothered turning down settings and seeing what FPS I get because this game runs super smooth and plays nicely. I have a launch edition gtx 1080 or whatever, but Capcom really put the focus in development to the gameplay running smoothly. My fps stays around the range, the low end is when I'm in a lava area with enviromental effects and lava spewing up with two monsters running around with explosive scales going off and all 4 of us trying to murder their faces. I think the game runs smooth and crisp, and pretty much offers almost anything one could want. As long as you can run and play the game, it's about the overall experience and it definitely delivers. Sadly if you can't get it to run no matter what, there's always steam refund. Left for reference MHW has become the most successful Japanese game on steam, surpassing even the Dark Soul series.. That's not to say it's good because a lot of people are playing it, that you should ignore all the negative reviews and just buy it, or whatever comes to mind. Look around, look past the initial red thumbs down reviews saying bad pc port and severe connection issues. As I have gone over, those issues do exist but not at all the extent you might think by just browsing the negative reviews. At this very moment there are 305k people in game, 8500 thumbs down is ."

I played it shortly after my finals ended to give me something to do over the break. I thought I would play this for a bit and then go back to NieR: Automata again. I did not. In the time since I've started playing, I have logged over 190 hours in less than a month. That makes up for a little over 30% of all time I've had since I booted up the game for the first time, and accounts for eight days straight of gameplay.A fantastic combat system, beautiful music, gorgeous graphics, amazing depth, and the promise of even more to come. 9/10, one of the best action games I've played in a long time, please Capcom get the PC version caught up to console ASAP, I need me that simultaneous Iceborn release."

Nearly everytime I tried to play with my friends it would kick one of us out of the instance and force us to continue the fight alone. This wasn't always what happened, sometimes things were fine and we just got to enjoy the game, but getting though a fight without the servers decideding to split us was a rare treat. Even then it was tainted by the continuous threat of disconnecting us.I looked up and tried all the fixes I could find, turns out this is a fairly common problem, and none of them worked. A couple seemed like they were working only for us to be split up again and again the next day. I wasn't losing internet, I was on discord with them the whole time, and I've play other online games with them.For a game that is so focused on playing online with your friends to screw up the online portion of the game so bad is a real shame. Because there is a good game in here and I like it, I just wish the servers were usable"

1548,IroncladLion,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036431987/,3,,1,927.9,November,"29,",362,0,1,"At just over 900 hours, I have now just 100% Monster Hunter World. As a 0.4% player to have completed all achievements MHW has to offer, here is my review.This is a superb game, I didn't even think I'd like this game when looking at it in the steam store. It looked a bit like an MMO, which it isn't at all. People said it was grindy, which it isn't, until well after you've finished the main storyline. And while the story is basic, it does an excellent job introducing you to the world, and hits the immersion factor just right.Here's the deal with this game, it's about big hunts, and big accomplishments. What I mean, is that unlike other games, you don't plow through 100+ enemies in one mission / raid. You generally hunt ONE monster per hunt (can have multiple targets per hunt on occasion). But that one monster could take anywhere from 5-50 minutes to track down, weaken, and either slay, or capture. Every hunt you take on is a challenge which will test you. Whether you come out of that hunt alive or not is based on how well you prepared, your knowledge of the monster, using the environment to your advantage, and the expertise with your weapon of choice. Every monster you take down is a memorable experience, which makes it that much more rewarding when you can high five other hunters / huntresses who have also beaten that same monster. It's a different style of gameplay, but I find hunting one monster in this game far more rewarding than blasting 100 generic enemies in another game.Another excellent aspect to this game is that it is equally enjoyable solo as it is in mutliplayer. Every hunt is scaled to be able to accomplish solo, or provide a challenge to a dedicated hunting team of 4. I played through most of the early game entirely solo, and only ventured into multiplayer once things got really tough, which let me tell you, the monsters get tough. This isn't a game where the brave hero clobbers everything in sight, and the game gets easier as you unlock more abilities. This is the kind of game where every new challenge you face will make you think it's impossible, until you take the time to improve yourself and best the monster standing in your way. Which by the way, . There is no easy mode, if you want to make it to the end, you better become one hell of a hunter / huntress.As for actual content, I don't think I've ever played a game at this level. It's not just about the numbers of monsters in the game, which there are many. It's about the quality of everything that goes into MHW. The monsters, the animations, the worldbuilding, the maps, the endemic wildlife, the weapons, it's ALL SO DAMN WELL DONE. Speaking of weapons, there are 14 different weapons types. Every single one feels like it could be the main weapon in it's own game. I've taken the time to go on 100+ hunts with each weapon, and they all have something unique and useful to offer. Want an excellent beginner weapon? The Sword and shield is a great start. Want to try a heavy weapon? The Greatsword hits like truck. Want to feel like you are going through a pre-flight checklist before unleashing the big nut? Charge blade is ready for launch. Want to feel like you are in an anime battle? The Longsword is for you. Want to try a ranged weapon? Score a bullseye with the Bow & Arrow. Think all the other weapons are nerdy and want to play a shooter? 360 noscope with the Light Bowgun. This list goes on, but I'll stop there.Can't forget the negatives of course. The biggest issue I've found while playing is that depending on how steam feels, you can have a great day of multiplayer hunts, or you will be constantly disconnected from multiplayer matches. This isn't an issue when playing solo of course, but if you are trying to play with others, it CAN be an issue. Bugs? I think I can count the number of times I found a bug on one hand, and that's after 900 hours. Early on, the user interface (UI) is extremely confusing. This IS a console port after all, and was designed with consoles in mind. With time, it all becomes very quick to navigate, but new players will often struggle figuring it out (I had to sit down and push buttons for about an hour to finally understand how all the menus worked). Last thing to address is the grind, which many people will complain about. Given the scale of the game, I honestly feel that the pace of progression is perfect. Some players try to craft  as the progress. DON'T DO THIS, you will go CRAZY. That'd be like walking into a grocery store, buying one of every single food item, and trying to eat them all to figure out what you wanted to make for dinner that night. The game has so much content that you can spend a lot of time crafting every piece of armor or weapon, but unless you try to 100% the game like I have, all that can wait. You can complete the game with any one weapon type, and a handful of armor sets. I crafted 3 armor sets which got me through the main storyline. The game really isn't grindly until post storyline, but by that point you will be 50+ hours in.The biggest deciding factor on if YOU will like this game, is if you enjoy hunting big monsters, crafting new gear, and hunting even bigger, tougher monsters. If you like that idea, this is hands down the best game you will ever find. There's a lot of little details in the game that make it that much more enjoyable, but I'll let you find those out for yourself. Now excuse me, I need to get back to hunting."

You need a good equipment management, good item management, and good skill. There are many weapon with different styles. For first play i need to get a weapon that match my play style and after i spend more hour in this game i starting to change weapon so that i never get bored. Every weapon need matching equipment to make it work better. So i can say this game is all about grinding, and thats what i like from this game.For the story it’s not really that good, but it’s okay i guess..I don’t recommend this game for the player who play for the story."
1554,bedsheet,https://steamcommunity.com/id/badsheet/,3,,1,417.8,June,"26,",453,0,1,"I decided to wait until I'd sunk a few hours into this game before reviewing it, mainly because there's so much content to explore it wouldn't seem fair to write a review before I've experienced the majority of it. I'll preface this by saying that this was my first actual Monster Hunter game, so I can't really compare it to previous titles.I'll start with the obvious, you're going to need a powerful PC to run this game. This game looks just as stunning as the screenshots and trailers show, with the downside to that being it'll make your GPU run like a jet engine if you're not careful. If getting the most framerates possible never bothered you, this game is a pleasure to the eyes graphically. If you're like me on the other hand, the beauty of the game is hampered by the less than ideal performance on powerful hardware, especially in dense regions such as as the Ancient Forest when it's raining. This can obviously be countered by turning down either the resolution or the settings, which I'd personally recommend due to the nature of the game being very active and reaction times and input lag being big factors on how you perform.Onto the actual game, it's very fun. You're hunting huge monsters for what seems like forever, usually about 20 - 30 minutes (!) with the constant threat of death lurking at every corner. You'll need a lot of patience for this game, but god does it pay off when you finally kill the bastard you've been hunting for ages. Every monster you fight is a boss battle, even the easier early game monsters feel like a final boss. Craft armour and weapons with the materials of the monster you just killed, only to realise you need to kill it a few more times to get the thing you wanted. It's not very forgiving and very grindy, but if you're looking for a game you can sink hundreds of hours into without even noticing, its perfect. You've got a lot of weapon choices, all of which have their own unique characteristics with pros and cons, i'd recommend experimenting with as many as possible during the story so you can optimise how you approach the end game a lot easier.About the story, it's not very good to be completely honest. Then again that's not really what the game is about, the story is just kinda there to give you a reason to hunt these big monsters, and it accomplishes that goal perfectly. So no real complaints from me. The game picks up after the story though in my opinion, you're given free reign over the map with loads of side quests and investigations to do. It's also when you start becoming good at the game, killing monsters that used to take over half an hour in under 10 minutes. It really feels like you've become the chad hunter all the npc's always called you. You get access to the hardest monsters in the game, which reward you appropriately with some of the best gear in the game. This game can be boiled down to grinding till you're at the top, and then grinding some more, that's why I love it so much. There's a few QOL issues, but there's a lot of mods available to fix anything that you might find a little bit annoying. Overall though, the game feels polished, the multiplayer is a lot more reliable than it was back at launch and I don't think I encountered any game breaking bugs or glitches throughout my entire playthrough. Other than the less than ideal performance I mentioned earlier, I don't have any real complaints about the game. I used to complain about difficulty but if you play smart and get better at the game in general, you'll realise how it's a bit stupid to complain about it. I would 100% recommend this game at full price, and considering how often it feels like it's on sale, there's not much reason not to bite the bullet when it comes to a game with this much content."

1566,Amatus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cyberspunk2069/,3,,1,724.6,December,"29,",70,0,1,"A slightly slower-paced hack n slash action game than other titles in the genre, though there are plenty of good systems to complement it. Inventory management and a level of strategy are required in this title, making for a fulfilling experience that sets itself apart from other action games. Character customization is quite good, with a surprising amount of options to set. Fashion is not too amazing in the base game due to linear gear progression and the limited amount of Layered Armors (cosmetic-only clothes) available at the moment. The expansion Iceborne will fix this by adding craftable Layered Armors for most, if not all of armor sets already available.Make sure to back up your saves manually, because you will put a lot of hours into this game and cloud saves are very unreliable on Steam.The PC version is sadly far behind the console version.

1569,Shirroy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShirroY/,3,,1,"1,533.6",July,"3,",177,0,1,"A masterpiece IMHOThe game truly puts you in the role of a fresh ""Monster Hunter"" you start off slowly, scrounging around, getting some end monster parts and crafting or upgrading your first weapon of choice. Then after some time you get to the real good stuff and that is the HUNTS. you get into challenging fun battles alone or with a buddy or three.The battles can be hard but the rewards will more than make up for it.Resource gathering can be a pain at first but that all gets easier with time and as you progress through the story and unlock various stuff that can help with it.The environments/maps are all Beautiful and lots of interact-able stuff are added from environmental hazards that work for both the hunters and the monsters to endemic life creatures that you can capture and place in your personal room.The sound effects/BGM are beautiful too from the ambiance it provides while traversing the maps to the thrill it gives when facing the Monsters. The sound effects given to each Monster fits them so well that you can clearly know, after some experience, which monster is where and what they're doing.As for the story, don't expect too much for it, Monster Hunter franchise never really did focus on the story aspect of their games but it's there. Compared to previous Monster Hunter titles the story for world and iceborne is way better though.The Grind is the main factor and the end-game when considering this game, fights are hard but rewarding, the harder the monster the better the reward kind of thing, but it won't always give you what you want after the hunt and may require you to rerun specific monster for upgrades then hunter the higher tier monsters after, rinse and repeat. TLDR; Game is very much Worth it, A must-buy on sale and definitely worth playing with friendsThe Devs have really poured out their love for the game with continuous free Title updates, excluding the iceborne DLC expansion itself, they have released lots of long-time fan favorite monsters all for FREE. The only paid ""microtransactions"" are cosmetics and totally optional."

For player who like to optimize you can look in depth at all the armour sets and skills and see what works for you, this does not however alienate player who just want to look cool since for most monster you shouldn't need to follow the meta like a religion.the game isn't without its flaws for example the start of the game can drag out a bit and certain other sections of the game can be a bit of a drag but overall the pacing is relatively good.  TLDR the game does a good job at providing diverse play style to all kinds of different players if you can get past the somewhat slow start to the game.Post Iceborne:Alright here i am again so iceborne is worthwhile for all players because for new players you get loads of new monsters that can give you quite a challenge and for old player it adds loads of monsters that were sorely missing from the base game even monsters no one could have seen coming. it also adds onto the already great weapons by adding new moves and loads of new weapons to craft as you would expect from an entire new rank. in shot iceborne takes everything good about base mhw and adds to it significantly making the game even more worth while."

A lot of stupid sh1t can happen together.- a lot of diffrent Boss fights- a lot of diffrent playstyles (DD/Support/Tank or a mix of all 3 together) melee or ranged, a lot of combos and weapons to choose from- You can be creative with your builds/sets play however you like- You have to adapt, every Monster has its own strengths and weaknesses, that means your favourite set might work on one monster but not on othersAll in one this Game is pretty fun"

1589,U.D.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UltimusDraconis/,3,,1,700.8,November,"22,",429,1,1,"Monster Hunter: World is a good game for a bunch of reasons.The visuals are amazing, every area is unique and the world really feels alive, as there are many different species interacting with you, the environment and each other.The gameplay is pretty fun, even though it just mostly consists of you hunting one large monster after another for their loot to make better gear to hunt monsters better, but it does not get all that repetitive. With a large variety of monsters to hunt and 14 different weapon types to use, and a large pool of passive effects from your gear, you can put a lot of playtime into this game.However, to those who have played some of the previous Monster Hunter titles, this game might not have enough endgame content to satisfy you. After completing the main story, all you basically do is hunt stronger versions of the same monsters you already fought dozens of times or wait for a new event to show up for any bit of new content.Until then though, there is still plenty of satisfying gameplay, so generally I still would recommend this game."

Some people will claim it's hard, some people claim it's boring or lame for lots and different reasons. Fear not, for i will try my best to pull you into this world (wink wink) of awesomeness.In this game, there are 14 types of weapons for you to use, 3 are ranged and 11 are melee, varying from fast and light to heavy and brutal weapons, so i'm pretty sure you will find at least 3 weapons that you will play the most. Now to the real reason people play this franchise: Everyone likes boss battles, right? Now imagine that EVERY SINGLE hunt is a boss battle, with huge monsters and flashy details. That's Monster Hunter, my friend.There are lots and lots of monsters in this and other MH games, so you will have quite a lot to do, and yes, you will need to farm in this game, but the thing is, you will fight the same monster over and over again, right? But every hunt will be completely different from the previous one. How? Well, in one hunt you might cart twice and have a hard time, on the next, you might absolutely rek the monster and in the next, hell, who knows?One thing worth mentioning is, sometimes you gotta research or do some trial and error all by yourself, without someone telling you to, for things to properly work. You know, google some answers, monster elemental weaknesses, where to find what, what weapon is best for you against what monster, or even go with the classic social relationship, where someone you know, knows something you might not know and pass the knowledge further, which is pretty great.Overall, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awesome game. Also, please don't compare this game to previous ones because it is completely different. I mean, the core of the game is the same, kill stuff, make weapons and armor of said stuff, use newly acquired stuff to kill even stronger stuff and so on and on. But what i'm refering to is with the slinger, living ecosystem, using the environment to your advantage, it's all first appearing on this game, so previous games are pretty different, but don't feel discouraged to try the previous ones, too! They are what built this awesome game, so do yourself a favor, and try them aswell.EDIT: After 850 hours of game, i gotta say, this game gets boring as ♥♥♥♥. I only managed to get more out of this because i kept making specific weapon-only runs, other than that, i rather play any of the old MH's, but that's my opinion."

There isnt much story / drama, but more Sandboxy elements than expected.Aside from just fighting giant monsters in the wild, you'll end up:- Tracking and researching monsters- Picking flowers / mining- Fishing - Exploring for camp sites- Arm wrestling - Staged arena battles against different combinations of monsters.

Especially obvious during the main menu, of all things.Xeno Save ""issue"": for some people, one of the final bosses will autosave before a cutscene that will crash your game until you install a windows package.Little annoyances like not being able to skip cutscenes and not being able to join a friend until they've already seen them.Performance is also garbage, with top cards struggling to hold 60fps, but for some reason very old cards, below minimum requirements, can run it at 10~15fps. The inability to turn off things like motion blur, bloom, change depth of field, and other post-processing options might have something to do with the bad performance.Requires a mod that you can find in the steam forums (tech support section) to fix alt-tabbing on fullscreen, the insane CPU usage that freezes your pc if you try to do anything else, and the slightly lower resolution than what it should have.These are the main issues of the game right now. Even after all of this, it's still superior to the console version is almost every way, and plays very well on keyboard after you customize it and change some settings. The game itself has incredible gameplay with tons of replayability, but the plot is awful and the characters are as bland as possible.Lots of gameplay hours here. Feels like Dragon's Dogma 2, even carrying some of the same problems regarding the awful writing but great gameplay.Worth 130 reais? Probably not. 60 dollars? Maybe. It's a very fun game, and i've already played it for almost 100 hours as of the writing of this review. I like it, but it's hard to overlook the port issues. Beware."

I haven't experienced any issues. The game itself is amazing. I love these type of grindy games where I get to slay really cool looking monsters in a beautiful world. If you don't like grinding, or long, difficult boss battles then this game isn't for you. If you're into Dark Souls or Bloodborne you'll love this. This game reminds me of Dragon's Dogma A LOT and I loved that game so this is a must-have for me. The feeling of finally killing a monster that's been a pain in the ass is great and it truly feels rewarding. Every weapon is unique and really feels different from the others. The same can be said for the monsters, which have such cool, well thought-out designs. Of course, the most important thing, the gameplay, is fun and challenging. So yeah, I love this game and I think it's a genuinely good game. I'm sorry for the people who are having issues with the game and can't experience it how it should be, but I'm sure Capcom will fix these issues soon.One thing I would say is the price on Steam is a bit too much right now.

This game can be brutal and quite difficult to learn, so as someone who loves a challenge this is certainly a game that I love to play.  It has wonderful visuals and tons of RPG elements and a fun grind to it gathering materials.  The game has had a rocky launch with lots of disconnecting which causes quests to fail or groups to disband when playing multiplayer(quite annoying).  I really hope they are able to patch all the server issues we've been having over the last couple of days.

Luckly, within a few days of release and getting better by the day. I am now able to carry a hunt with my newby friends. Controls are still bad on keyboard and unfriendly to left handed players. Please capcom fix this issue, it would be make the game a lot better. It's like a fly buzzing around you while  you're trying to eat a high quality well prepared steak. It's annoying and ruins part of a other wise amazing game.If you're going to purchase this game go buy a cheap 20$ controller or a wireless orUSB cable adapter if you already have a console controller. Right now it makes a huge difference in playing enjoyment.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Firstly, I come from the console version of this game. It's amazing and addictive, having put almost 600 hours into it since Release. I put off doing the current Behemoth expansion crossover because didn't want to not burn myself out.But, what was a smooth and fun experiance on console has become rather frustrating and rage inducing for some of my friends. I bought this game for not only myslef but for 3 other people seeing I had such a blast on PS4. Since those three people have never played a monster hunter game it's really frustrating that I cannot help them. I'm a hunting horn main without a team to buff, it's disheartening. We can't even connect to eachother with out the error time out smaking us apart! Also, the cutscene restiction is very multiplayer unfriendly, it plauges the console version now the pc. Can we at least play the story missions together from the start?Graphics are amazing, and that 60fps on a mid teir cpu like mine on highest detail settings! I've been so pleased.The mouse and keyboard controls are really bad with no left handed support and it's very confusing. Two of my friends are left handed and it's hell for them to remap their keys and half the time the keys don't work. Can't use the num pad well either. Even the keysboard is right handed oriented it's still bad. We had to switch to controller which we didn't want in the first place.Please capcom get on that connection problem, if you're not going to fix anything else can you please let me play soundly with my friends without being afraid to DC half way through a hunt. The monster hunter team has been amazing for addressing console issues, please show the pc version just as much love and attention.As much as I don't want to. Until the connection problems are fixed this will be negative review.I bought the pc version FOR co-op with my PC friends, I do not want to solo this game again,"
1609,diasandro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/diasandro/,3,,1,458.1,August,"10,",935,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is a hunting game focusing on fighting the big monsters. It is the first series that is finally coming to PC after its previous predessecors which were only released on PC. With its release on both PC and consoles MHW brings many veterans hunters and new hunters alike, to the new world which fulls of beauty and danger lurking in every corner of the world. It is your job as a hunter, to balance this ecosystem and make sure the danger does not destroy the world.MHW is an open world game, with 5 different maps. Unlike previous titles which are clustered into different region, MHW have seamless map, making sure you have no loading screen during your hunt. With its open world, hunters can use the environment to their advantage, such as using the vines to trap a monster, ledge to have an over head jump attack, wedge beetles to swing around, etc. As you are travelling around the map, you will find some big monsters to hunt and some small ones as well doing their activities. Sometimes you might find some monsters are interacting to each other also.Combat in MH is always unique in a way. If you are a new hunter, be aware that it is not a hack and slash game. Combat is rather a stiff and rigid one, which is doing an animation after an animation. Unlike typical JRPG hack and slash which can be done by blindly spamming attack, MH is more like timing your attack to hit your target. MH is always like a 'live version' of turn based game, in which you need to attack when the monster is in passive state (not attacking) and choose whether to dodge, evade, or counter when the monster is attacking on you. Further there is no life/hp bar to show your monster's health, rather you need to watch your monsters behavior as it will weakened after certain attack.The point of this game is for you to fight a monster, gather their material, craft the weapon and armor from it, wear it, then hunt a stronger mosnter than before. This cycle makes the game itself called a 'boss-fighting simulator'. There are good amount of monsters you can hunt to give yourself a plenty hours of fun until you are burned to nothing left. There also tons of weapon types and sets you can try. Just experiment and enjoy yourself playing the game.While the multplayer was bad at the beginning of the game, Capcom has fixed this issue. You can join lobby or throw SOS in order to get into multiplayer. However it is advised that for new hunters to play SOLO along the first part of story lines in order to learn about the game. Some monsters tend to be hard to beat first time. While SOS is one way to skip the hard part, you might find it hard later on. However, if you are someone unable to beat a mosnter, some hunters might wanna help you still, just throw the flare and wait for help to come. There are some hunters out there willing to lend a hand to you.Unfortunately, I have to say that the game might not be able to run properly on a toaster. Even though the min requirement is a bit low, still you need to have a higher specs than that to have it running well. Hopefully few patches more from Capcom will fix some of the leak in the game that might slow the game a bit. Is the game worth the price? Full price of the game is already worth it. I finish the story line in about 45 hours, spend some times to do the tempered, which finally reaches HR 100 (to get the final optional / side quest) after 180 hours. You will find a lot of fun during the time. However, I do not advise to get the paid DLC, as the DLC is basically some cosmetics that does not do anything to the game, only change visuals aspect, yet it is worthless.In conclusion, I personally have fun with the game. Only some minor leakage from the game spoil the gameplay. As I already reaches 180 hours during editing this latest review, I could say I have the game worth more than the price I have to pay.Edit: 27 January 2019After one year release of first release, there is a big event happening almost around a month. For people willing to buy the game, now it is a best time to get it. A lot of events that were there in the previous additions are presented here and you might have a full lot of content to play for the whole month. There is also an announcement of Iceborne expansion (paid) coming later this year, which features new map, story, and Master rank (one rank higher than Arch Tempered).PC is finally about to catch up to console updates, with only a few monsters left before we finally catch up to them. Game is more complete now and some QoL updates are being released also on fix on the bugs. It is totally playable now."

You play as a hunter of the Fifth Fleet and tasked to discover and solve the mysteries of the New World.I usually wait for sales before but this is the first game that I've bought a game exactly when it was released. Although this is my first Monster Hunter game I allotted some of my time to take a look of the previous games. Aside from the improved graphics/visuals from the previous games the gameplay really improved a lot as well. There are different kinds of weapons that you could choose from each with different play styles. You can fully customize your gears as well, mix & matching them with the skills and deco slots that you need. You could also change your sidekick Palico gears as well. So far, I have tried most of the weapons and change loadouts depending on the hunt I am doing. You are free to choose if you only want to use one specific weapon or try all of them.The story is ok but It falls of short to me since that's what I'm looking for in games. But I think MH is the endless hunting of monsters praying to the RNG Gods to give you the decos that you need. I think we couldn't get bored with the games as long there some continuous updates with new monsters and also season events. Right now, only the console have the season events but eventually it will be on the PC version as well.But for me the real end game is...Hahaha! You also have a room that you could put pets. You can move into bigger rooms as you move on with the game. The bg music and the ambience of the room is so relaxing that you could just sit on the bed or the garden all day.My overall rating:"

Witnessed 83-MW1 spams at the launch, Teostra almost crashing PCs with supernova, and other huge struggles the launch gave me and everyone else. Even when the road was bumpy and full of blockages, I still kept going forward, enjoying every hour of the game I managed to play solo and with friends. Playing with friends can be a mess in the start to understand because of being unable to join quests and such. Good tip to play with friends is to have everyone initiate the quest like normal going in solo, you find the area where the monster quest cutscene starts, you watch it throughout (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unskippable cutscenes absolute ass). After this, you return from the quest (DONT ABANDON). Now you are able to join anyone who has watched the cutscene as well.  You repeat this with every quest sadly, but this is how Ive done it with 3 different friends Ive played the game throughout with.For the older fans, its a completely new Monster Hunter, that has taken a huge turn in terms of gameplay change and such. While they added a lot of QoL features, they also gave some very questionable game mechanics, such as massively increased superman dive iframes, mantles and palico special items. Ive only played most of the newer titles such as 4U and GU, tried Port3rd and FU only a bit to tell World is very  different to the older titles. Not necessarily in a bad way, but in a completely new experience-kind of way.For newer players, its a third person ARPG that has some MMO-ish elements such as grinding for materials to upgrade weapons and such (arguable for RPG titles in general but MMOs really get the rep for this). Monster Hunter World is basically hunting monsters to progress story and finding out whats going on in the New World.Some pros and cons based on my own tastes and experiences:+ Replayability value is huge if you're into grinding    - Though if you dont have a taste for grinding, the game might as well last around 40-50 hours which is still really solid.+ Monsters and armor look amazing compared to the older titles. Armors have a nice mix of practicality and high fantasy    - Weapons lack creativity and its often a big complaint towards Capcom.+ Maps feel very alive. The endemic life and gathering makes it really enjoyable to just run around gathering materials and possible endemic life to decorate your home with the new pets you found    - Maps like ancient forest can feel extremely choky and small at times when fighting big monsters. Map amount is also quite        limited.+ Mod support    - Some of them are very questionable and defy the standards of the game such as solomoth and DPS meter.I could be writing on for days, but I want to keep the review at reasonable lengths.Big tips for new players to either avoid or get the game definitelyAvoid:- Dont like grinding- Dont like big monsters- Has to have massive open areas to explore- Played older MHs and wants a more traditional experience.Definitely go for it:- You loved old MHs but felt like they needed a major change- Love grinding- Set yourself personal improvement goals such as speedrunning certain monsters, no hit-challenges and dodge rolling roars.- Have friends to play withTL;DR If you're a MH veteran and want something similar, play GU and avoid this game completely. For newer players, if you hate grinding, I recommend avoiding this game. Its a fun experience but it has a lot of tedious parts scattered here and there."

Things are looking good.Edit 3: Getting improved changes to keyboard and extended keybindings. They also don't seem to mind mods for now so you can get some pretty cool stuff and QoL changes, updates seem fine with Kulve Taroth arriving, then Lunastra soon and Arch Tempered content at the same time, we can expect to catch up to consoles pretty soon."

The base game is extremely challenging to newcomers as it throws you directly in the deep water with little to no assistance; leaving you all on your own. However, after about 20hrs in you will start to gain the basics and of the game and the core mechanics. If you are struggling with getting the hang of things then have a look at youtube where there are tutorials which will guide you into the NEW WORLD and BEYOND!!!I recommend Arekkz Gaming - The game has a huge assortment of weapons and armour sets to craft. Each weapon has its own individual play style and skill ceiling for you to master. As you progress through the game you will find the the various trees with elements in order to upgrade your weapons to make the stronger and specific to certain monsters.The monsters are very difficult in this game, each with their own abilities and attack patterns. But once you learn them they will be easy to overcome and net you a quest completion :) The game should always be played with other people in order for you to learn and be successful.I will recommend the game to any monster hunter fan who wants to be put to the test at their skills.Now coming to ICEBORNE, the DLC expansion shipped in a broken mess with many bugs and glitches and not to mention the game's anti-cheat taking up 95% CPU usage. But that has all been patched since and it look stable from now. The DLC expands with a new region and many new monsters, weapons and armour sets to be hunted and crafted. There will be many updates in the coming months to match it up with the console road map. If you have completed the base Monster Hunter game and are looking to expand your world then ICEBORNE is surely the DLC for you."

I actually really enjoy this game, there is something to do for everyone let it be the grinders, the explorers, the supports or plain hell-rain loose on all players.I really enjoy just spending ages exploring the map collecting stuff or just enjoying what there is to offer. I like finding secrets and heck found something I was not even looking for because I got lost by mistake. Beating the crap out of monsters over and over is satisfying specially if you get the hang of mounting them for massive damage.Plenty of weapons to choose from so you don't feel you need to be tied down to a certain gameplay and I do like that type of freedom for gameplay. Events are very rewarding specially for your level even if the items they give are not a weapon or armour you use it is still nice to collect and have.I do however, REALLLYYYYYY hate how you cannot skip cut-scenes even on a 2nd character slot. I am sorry I understand story is important in a game, at least to some but if we have already seen it on another character or already in your cutscene gallery, let us SKIP IT.Some of them go on for WAY too long and even cringy to watch due to how stupid the characters are and the lip-sync and mouth movements are just weird.I hate the Handler, sorry but she is useless. You can take her out of the game and nothing will really change. She is a forced plot device to get stuff moving which can be done without her. She loves to get in trouble and wander ALONE into new lands multiple times and is still shocked when a monster appears to try and eat her. If anything the story is focused way too much on her and makes you feel like the side-kick.I don't find her funny or charming or anything they were trying to go for unless it was annoying and I am not alone in this. She can really take you out of the story they are trying to tell and how much she talks in the hub world about the main mission even though there is a text box telling you what you need to do to carry on the story.That is just my nitpick, I adore the game and can spend hours on it even if I am ignoring the story to do what I want such as grind stuff for my next armor/weapon."
1646,Death's Index Finger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/N3pG34R/,3,,1,618.4,April,"23,",153,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a game about hunting HUGE monsters and netting little monsters as pets.The game features 14 different weapon class/types. Each weapon has different play style. You could be a samurai with a long sword, a rambo with a bow gun, a real man with a Great sword or be THE  trumpet dude.It has max of 4 players coop in a mission but It can be also played in solo.With each different class you can build a composition depending on the monster you hunt.Nowww it the questionsWith these being my first MH game, I'd say its a little difficult. The difficult part for me is learning the weapon, I suggest watching youtube soo you understand and know what weapon you will use. The monsters are interesting, their attack feels more of RNG than a pattern which makes it really fun to fight the chaos. If some games a 5 minute boss fights may feel an hour, THIS GAME IS LITERALLY CONSIST OF 20-40 MINUTE BOSS FIGHTS and you cant pause the game. so no pee break. Cutscenes cannot be skipped and the story is not the best but its not bad. But you don't buy this game for the story, you came here to make your character as your waifu and check each armor and see which one looks the sexiest right... RIGHT!Yes. To get your equipment you need to hunt different monsters and get different parts. the material you get is RNG so it may take a few more hunts to craft what you want. I'd say about 4-6 hunts to get a full set of armor if you are lucky. Late game grindiness: Why not add with another RNG. The another one is the decorations, they are added stats to your armor, its also RNG when you defeat a hard monster( tempered).Kinda. like i said, learning the playstyle of a weapon is boring because its mostly wall of text given to you and trial and error soo i'd suggests again watching youtube for guides. The order of each monsters in story makes it possible for you to learn your moveset. unless you constantly change. Yeah,really worth. It took me 50+ hours to finish the story and it doesn't stop there... there are tons of sidequest, and more variants and harder monsters to hunt. This game got me hooked that I got 80 hours within 5 days.You can play this game with a 4 player co-op optionally, having another player makes the game much MORE CHAOTIC, its harder because you don't know who the monster will target, its harder but its more FUN. Some hunts is made for multiplayer - Ancient Leshen, Extreme Behemoth, Kulve Tarot- These monsters are made for Multiplayer, dont be a fool like me wasting an hour on Ancient leshen and 4 hours soloing KT. ITS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ BANGERS. REALLY . GREAT . OST. Each makes the fight more intense specially proof of a hero. my issues:Hit boxes is kinda clunky so its quite frustrating.IM ALWAYS LOST IN ANCIENT FOREST!and rip decoration farming its hell.NO PAUSEIts a really fun game that I look forward playing every morning. Each weapon has a unique experience EXCEPT I ONLY PLAYED GREAT SWORD LIKE A MAN; and each different monster has different experience that makes you adapt more. Hitbobxes may be frustrating but its just skill issue. jk. So overall a 8/10 games. Really addicting, really fun and has tons of content. Worth the bucks that will give you about 200 hours of hunting frustrations so happy hunting. EGG MISSIONS are made by SATAN himself."
1647,FluffyButtSheep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FluffyButtSheep/,3,,1,"1,124.4",August,"11,",162,0,1,"Best game for people starting with the Monster Hunter franchise.Most fluent combat in the series, everything feels smooth when using it.Very immersive, beautiful to look at and lovely looking environments. Provides a decent enough challenge for new comers to enjoy. All 14 weapons feel different in how they play and have their own style. No pay 2 win mechanics at all and you get the whole game with one purchase.  Unnecessary story, it's a game where you hunt monsters and progression and you have a credit stealing side-kick just to insult it further.End game is a grind, an extremely RNG based grind which can get frustrating quickly with particular events only lasting so long.Awful excuses for content which are limited in availability as well. (Arch Tempered System)Artificial difficulty content which adds almost nothing new fight wise for most of the end-game content in the game. Game does not explain in-depth mechanics which are key to understanding how the game works. Connection issues which make me want to strangle a Dodogama. Monster Hunter: World is the 5th game in the main series of Monster Hunter, if you ever wanted to get into the franchise this is the best game in my opinion to try. But I do recommend you have a friend to play with or just someone who knows how Monster Hunter works. This game does not hold your hand and gives you the information in your ""Hunter Notes"". This was my first entry into Monster Hunter and I'm glad I picked it up, Capcom did a good job in making it easy for new players to come along but a decent enough challenge for experienced players. There is so much to do but it isn't intimidating or a chore to do for the most part. For the most part you can just view the story as a ""it's there"" sorta deal. I tried to enjoy what it gave but it didn't give me much to enjoy, except the cutscenes with the monsters involved, they really set you up for what you have to deal with, they're beautifully done and most monsters are enjoyable and don't feel like bull crap when you face them.All the weapons in this game feel different, no two weapon feels similar at all, leading into different ways to approach the task at hand. Do you go in with a massive slow heavy hitting sword or shoot it to death with arrows? It's all up to you to decided how you want to do, just have fun it is a game after all. Endgame wise this is where I have my nitpicks with, it becomes nothing more than a grind. Sure you can bring friends to have fun and take your mind off it but for me it got annoying, decoration farming can be done very quickly and there are some events that make it easier to get more. However there is a siege monster which is strongly recommended you face in a group working together is the worst case. The fight itself is fun, for the first few times but it get stale and when you grind it 50-100+ times and still don't get what you want is frustrating. There is no pay 2 win bypass which is a blessing, but there is no other way to trade in parts of the monster to get the weapon you desire so badly. The worst part about endgame in this game for me personally is the Arch Tempered system. It is meant to be very difficult to do and is reserved for the strongest monsters the game. For a majority of them they do nothing different for the most part, only a select few change it up if not at all. They add more health, more damage and change mostly nothing at all. There are good boys and good girls in the AT system but more bad boys than good. Go play the game, it's fun with friends and makes for some great giggles and just a great experience, just wish Capcom would stop the awful excuses for content."
1648,Ottomic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ottomic/,4,,1,458.8,July,"5,",593,0,1,"Monster Hunter is, perhaps, the greatest series about level-less(ish) fights where player skill and knowledge is king over everything else that factors in. Choose your weapon among the over dozen types available, know its moveset, know your enemy and beat incredible odds by slaying or capturing incredibly powerful monsters. Craft equipment out of their spoils to complement your hunting, and move onto even more dangerous, powerful and difficult creatures, alone or in company.This installment brings a whole heap of changes to the franchise, making the world and hunts feel way more chaotic, wild and unpredictable than before. The player will be able to take further advantage of its surroundings be it hiding, ambushing or using the environment against their foes but also bringing new dangers and ever-changing conditions into the fights. The movesets have been more balanced and diversified, and the game feels the same it's always been, albeit more evolved and dynamic than before.Compared to the old games, it's true that MHW loses part of its 1v1 charm, and that doesn't mean everyone will agree with all the changes that have been brought to this installment, but I don't think any of them can be considered a net negative, and as the first ever in the series to reach PC, I'm very happy with how the game turned out. If Generations was brought to the PC I would probably play that as much if not more than World, but both the old and the new formula stand out as excellent products, each in their own unique way. The only thing I really feel brings the game down a bit is the new story focus as it railroads the player into boring and frankly kind of stupid ""story missions"" that don't really help the game flow, and maybe the lack of a ""new game plus"" mode (which to be frank has never been in any game in the franchise).8/10. This is a great game I would recommend any fan of games such as Platinum Games brawlers or Action RPGs in general and in particular the more punishing, skill oriented ones such as Dark Souls. It can get frustrating at times, and some weapons are a bit restrictive when it comes to playing them ""right"", but it is a great product overall."

A title that's rather ironic, since it honestly sounds like a generic mobile game, while actually being the complete opposite. It's incredible how unique this game actually is. In my 15 years of gaming there's really no other game that I could compare it to, well, at least not to something even being remotely this good. Anyway, I'm gonna elaborate on my positive statement a bit more and dive deeper into some of the game's minor problems as well.First of all, it's important to know that games like these are supposed to be played slowly. You need to take your time with it to reach the full enjoyment potential. Sure, it's possible to speedrun the game and just go for the main quests for whatever reason, but you would just probably ruin the game for yourself, since it relies heavily on something entirely different to have remaining content. MHW essentially revolves around monsters the most, there's no real story that goes along with it, and that's totally fine. The main things are the variety of monsters and planning/crafting your gear. It may sound dull, but it's actually incredibly fun. There weren't many cases of me being bored while hunting the same monsters all over again for gear, and it's really hard to achieve something like this if you think about it. In summary, there's a gameplay loop you always do while playing it - Prepare, Eat, Hunt, Craft, Repeat. In other words, you prepare for the upcoming hunt, take best possible weapons, items etc. Then, you (should) eat before every quest to boost your stats and hunt a certain monster. After returning from a quest, you will gain monster materials, which can be used in many ways to craft something. That's that.Now, for a game like this without any actual story or lore, it's obviously extremely important for the gameplay to be very good. It is in fact, very good. There's something to be taken into a consideration though, character behaviour is rather unique compared to the other games, which may result in a clunky and slow feeling, but the harsh reality is, that you are just still bad at the game. There are dozens of negative takes on any Monster Hunter games in general that judge the gameplay by being ''overly sluggish'', and honestly I don't blame them. I had the same mindset when I first started playing the game, even considered refunding it. Obviously after getting into it more I started to understand that this game is simply different, and I have to adapt to fully enjoy it. Different is often seen as something unacceptable, and in this case, it gets ♥♥♥♥ on by most of the newer players that didn't even hit the 2h mark yet. Anyway, my point is that MHW is a game that simply requires some time for the player to understand it's true beauty.There are 14 weapons in the game, but it's honestly disrespectful to call them ''weapons''. Those weapons change the gameplay so drastically that they should be called ''classes'' instead. Everyone will probably find their best pick, since they vary from stuff like long sword, hammer, lance, as well as ranged weapons like bow or even bowgun. All of them have a completely different moveset, so learning them all at once would be a hard challenge, thus pretty much everyone mains a certain weapon for tough monsters. It's an amazing feeling that is, getting burned out cause of a certain weapon - slaying monsters all over again without breaking a sweat, so you decide to try out a new weapon and the game becomes fresh again. It's one of the biggest pros of this franchise in general, the pure difference of gameplay everyone experiences with their certain weapon is amazing.Sadly though, there's a rather annoying cosmetic problem this game has with those weapons. For some reason, World decided to just slap some of the monster parts on the majority of weapons, and only a few get unique design. It's sad, because fashion-hunting is important for a lot of players here, including myself. Seeing a weapon with great stats while looking ♥♥♥♥ makes me not even want it, that's how serious it might be. Well, at least all armors look amazing and different. From what I've heard, Rise will bring back the unique weapons again, so it shouldn't be a problem anymore, thankfully.I realize that it's already a very long read, so in my second to last paragraph, I'm going to talk about the influence of soundtracks. I’m a serious soundtrack enthusiast so I appreciate the variety as well as quality of them in every entertainment media. Many people tend to underappreciate the influence of soundtracks and see them only as a background noise. What they don’t realize is that those “background noises” actually make you feel emotions while engaging yourself in a fiction, that’s why they are there in the first place. And without a doubt, the soundtrack in MHW absolutely delivers. It can vary from a happy fantasy-like themes to dark Latin chanting making your bones chill. Quality is there, quantity is there, and its overall uniqueness is there. What more would you want? Now for the last topic: The story, or rather the lack of it. I mentioned before that’s it’s not a big deal that MHW focuses solely on the gameplay, but who wouldn’t like to see a decent story to go along with it? Unfortunately, MHW is the first Monster Hunter game that really tried it, and sadly utterly failed. I’m not gonna talk about it in big details since it’s still spoilers, that’s why I also avoided talking about monsters as well. Anyway, it’s just not good, it constantly tried to make you feel like being in a middle of some mystery, but honestly I just couldn’t care less, so I can’t even fully explain its problems even if I tried to. Don’t get me wrong though, I still felt really engaged in it because of the amazing monsters that I had to fight against, but at the end of the day you can’t deny the fact that it’s just straight up flat.I could keep writing on and on about a lot of other positive aspects this game has, but it’s probably more considerate to write about the most impactful pros and cons. So yeah, MHW could improve in a lot of way, just like every other game out there, but I’m ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ certain it’s a near perfection for sure if there ever was one. The amount of memories and joy it brought me is outstanding, the feeling is so strong that I even decided to buy a Switch to experience the classic Monster Hunter, as well as to await the newest entry in the series that is MHR. Thanks you Capcom for releasing the first ever Monster Hunter on PC, since it allowed me to finally discover this amazing franchise and let me feel a variety of priceless emotions while playing it."

I often play games while listening to some songs in spotify, but i rarely do that in MHW just because i wanna listen to some monster soundtracks that sometimes gives me PTSD.Oh and a little advice for new players that bought this game along with the iceborne expansion, I recommend you to get to HR 50 first at least, before jumping into iceborne.

The game runs perfectly beyond a few FPS issues on High with my GTX 1060 and I7 core. Some reoccuring issues for many people is the connections (which is nothing new, the PS4 inital launch was the exact same, espcially since its the 1.0 patch), and forceing cutscenes on people. That last point is pretty annoying in multiplayer but it is ONLY for the main assignments aka the story missions. after you finished low rank, cutscenes are sparse and very far between. Its almost comical how much I honestly forgot about cutscenes until I go back and help friends still in low rank.Beyond that, the combat is great, the mechanics and difficulty are incredibly rewarding, and Capcom have outdone themselves. I've played this for 160+ hours on PS4 and am enjoying the process all over again."

1664,Marwissa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marwissa/,4,,1,593.6,August,"22,",72,0,1,"Updated March 06 2019 Storyline is good, but between HR 16-30-50 it's a time for you to pick and choose on your own so doing event quests help! But it's boring between since you just have to raise your HR level. With Iceborne coming it might help if you've passed HR 16+ but depends. They're adding G-Rank (or Master Rank as they call it) so it's good to see they're adding games like the old ones!Bow is much better now than 4U! It feels like an authentic bow experience, but LBG is still a bit weird compared to the old games but it might be setting/binding issues. Multiplayer issue is now fixed but you might get a drop once in a while (Haven't had one in a long time, and usually its my team disconnecting as opposed to me due to their internet). But alt-tabbing can cause multiplayer to disconnect so playing in borderless solves that. Radical menu wasn't an issue but to prevent it from being auto-resetted you have to save the loadout which saves the radical menu. Also, for HR 50+: Finding Tempered Elder Investigations is annoying but it also feels like an authentic experience similar to farming (Spent like 1 hour 30 following Kirin to get tracks lol) -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Originally August 22 2018 Recommend: MaybePlayed MH4U, MHGen and MHXX (IG/LBG)Comparing to the old games: so far it's been pretty good. Storyline is as good as 4U, much better than Gen/XX! There's been some changes like Mega Dash Juice not present and armour, skills, palico and effect system but overall the changes aren't so bad. I think it's actually easier now to make better armour sets and skills. New monsters are interesting to fight and it's nice they kept some old ones. The new pet and room upgrade is cool too, feels more like a 'world'.  Hoping they bring back some 4U and Gen like Glavenus and the Magalas. They took out the Hunter Arts from Gen/XX but it's not so bad, since attack combos seem a bit more buffed (i.e Aerial art is now included in the Insect Glaive, I think). The new LBG is weird to play, so not sure how I feel about that. Glaive options has been slightly nerfed, doesn't seem like there are as many choices for some ailments. The apperance of the IG doesn't seem to deviate much, so appearance wise it's a bit lacking compared to some of the beautiful glaives in 4U :( Also, if you've played 4U/Gen/XX, sometimes it's easy to figure out an attack pattern because of how some similar they are to previous monsters. There are some new attack patterns present, so it's not a huge issue. However, they really simplified the game. There's no paint-ball, there's no waving to the ship, no micromanaging Palicoes. No mini-games now for sending Palicoes to gather things.  Auto-crafting is nice but I've never used it since it wastes materials. The Argosy is a cool new feature but I feel like I'm using it to just make more cash.  It feels like it's spoon-feeding you some aspects of the game. To me, it feels like this game has been easier so far than 4U and Gen. In some ways, that's good for sanity but also feels like a half-authentic experience. Hopefully, in future DLCs, G-Rank will be implemented. Using controller and so far it feels like a 3DS/Switch experience. Sometimes the right trigger (on a Dualshock) doesn't work, so alt-tabbing or pressing Steam home button and going to controller will fix it, but it's definitely going to be annoying for weapons that need the trigger/pods. There are some issues: 1. Multiplayer: Keeps disconnecting even with some 'fixes' like making your own session before joining a friends. It's really annoying when you're trying to hunt together. Sometimes it's you, sometimes it's your friend, and this is really big when you're helping with story or trying to hunt for parts together since the monster's multiplier is still there even after disconnection. Friend invites kind of work, kind of don't. Definitely need to fix this, because it's infuriating. There's a disconnection every hour, and sometimes every time we start a quest. 2.  The new Radical Menu: It's a good implement from the new system, but for some reason it won't save even after changing items, and keeps defaulting to a really old 'saved' version. 3. Alt-tabbing crashes the game sometimes. Game can also alt-tab on it's own for no reason, and then alt-tab back in. If you're hunting with friends, the Discord overlay is a life-saver, if you don't disconnect first...  Overall: Multiplayer is super infuriating and upsetting, but the story and play is good. Solo play is excellent.8.5 out of 10 for issues above, would be a solid 10/10 if they fixed the issues. (On a side note...this game has made me and my friends appreciate Siege servers)"

Yes, MHW as a PC port has its problems, but you'll find that most negative reviews have been given in regards to network stability. Which is something that Capcom has no control over as the online portion of the game is handled through Steam. In other words, complete and utter morons that have taken no time to research the issue have decided to put the blame on an innocent party instead of trying to find a solution. And yes, there is a solution to the problem.You see, MHW, doesn't utilize dedicated servers. All networking is peer to server to peer with Steam being the middle man that handles the connections. Until recently, Steam utilized traditional networking protocols (TCP/UDP) with their services. MHW on PC was developed with this in mind. When Steam released their last major update, introducing such things as a new UI and Discord-esque communication services, they also changed over to the WebSocket protocol.Because of this, MHW and any other peer to server to peer titles on Steam have found that the new protocol provides horrible service for the usage of peer to server to peer connections for online gaming. That's not to say that peer to server to peer with traditional protocols doesn't have its problems, but certainly not as bad as this. Steam is completely to blame for this problem and one can simply add ""-nofriendsui -udp"" or ""-nofriendsui -tcp"" to their Steam shortcut launch options to revert the changes and improve their network stability for the time being. With that said, due to MHW primarily being a singleplayer title, saves are local and thus dropping a connection does not hurt your progress in any way. Again, there are other problems with this PC port of MHW and this is certainly not a game for everyone due to how difficult the game can be.But in regards to the vast majority of negative reviews, they simply shouldn't exist and these people are an embarrassment to our species. As a fan of the franchise, MHW is a great title and even tho it was quite annoying having to change many settings and keybindings to get a proper KB+M experience, I highly recommend this title to my fellow Monster Hunters. Happy hunting, fivers!"

If you're a longtime fan of the series, well, you're probably playing it by now. If you're new to these games, or have only played one or two of them in the past, probably on handheld devices, don't worry. This is quite different. Systems have been streamlined, for approachability or to cut down on mechanics, yes, but the depth of gameplay is still there, if not improved upon. If you want to know if you'd like this game, watch some videos about how a hunt goes and how the different weapons work. If you could see yourself trying new things and fighting monsters over and over to perfect your skills and build just the right equipment, you'll love Monster Hunter World. If that sounds boring and repetitive to you, then it probably will be and you should give it a pass. The gameplay model isn't for everyone. Just remember, this is a Capcom action game. There's gonna be janky hitboxes, and there's gonna be goofy animations, and a lot of the stuff you're capable of is going to be ridiculous and over the top.

1686,poorboy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/poorboy13/,3,,1,243.7,August,"20,",710,0,1,"A terrific game. I have finished both story arcs at the time of this writing (80 hours of play in). I may update this review if/when I reach HR100 for the final cutscene.First of all, why I recommend this game for new prospective buyers:-Fast, intense combat mechanics-Careful gameplay is rewarded; mindless spamming of the attack key will get you killed-Comparisons may be drawn to Souls-like games, Souls fans will appreciate MH-MHW is the most acessible MH in the series (with the exception of MH Generations, which is reasonably accessible but is only availble on 3DS and Switch at the moment)-The graphics are the best of any MH game, and are beautiful in their own rightHowever, there are people who refuse to think strategically, who want scripted setpieces, and linear corridors. If this is you, this game is not for you.Now, here's my analysis of MHW as a MH veteran:-Amount of content is lower than other MH games. This is a big deal. It took me 80 hours to complete both story arcs; it took me ~120 hours to get to this point in MH4U on the 3DS.-Easier matchmaking than any of the past MH games. I have to stress that MHW's multiplayer worked absolutely fine for the first two days; I firmly believed that Steam updated its multiplayer API and that is what caused all the connections issues-Certain mechanics have been massively simplified and are objectively easier than previous gamesAn explanation of the last point:-Most item crafting has been made mind-bogglingly easy. All crafting has 100% chance of success. Potions and Cold Drinks only require one ingredient. Tranq bombs are now made with only two ingredients. -Mining and gathering points respawn over time, meaning you'll never actually run out of resources mid-hunt.-Palico Abilities are incredibly useful, and can be requested on demand.-Palicoes basically never die. When they faint, it's for a matter of mere seconds.-Free traps exist throughout the map.-Potions can be consumed on the move, which makes the game unbelievably easy for many monsters. (For people who say that you move too slowly while drinking potions for it to make a difference, you obviously haven't tried sprinting while drinking a potion.)-Scoutflies have replaced Psychoserum and Paintball-Many items that had to be manually thrown (without any form of aim assist) are now fired by a slingshot that has autoaim, such as stones, dung bombs, flash bombs, sound bombs.-You can fast travel all over the place-You can equip an item that literally makes you invulnerable (or another item that makes you invisible)-You can withdraw items from your item box mid-hunt if you need to restock your items.-Unlimited Whetstones.-Monster carves, mining/bone materials, and account items go straight to your item box, negating the need for inventory managementWhat does this mean for us? Gone are the days where we would meticulously plan our items in a perfect balance of utility and leaving free space for gathering. Gone are the days where if we ran out of potions, we had to scavenge raw materials from herbs and mushrooms and honey from certain gathering points to make more. We can literally just leave combat, fast travel back to camp, pull potions out of your item box, and go back to the fight. There's no more danger. There's no more careful map knowledge needed. There's no fear that once you have picked the land clean of the mushrooms and herbs, that you would no longer have any more materials, since they respawn anyway. There's no getting around it: MHW is easier than any other Monster Hunter before it.One could argue that they are simply quality-of-life changes. I'm ambivalent. I don't think they're good/bad since they have both their drawbacks and their benefits. I'm glad that Capcom wants to innovate rather than keep everything the same (like some certain titles and series). It's one of the few ways to make a game fresh, especially since there have been almost a dozen MH games already. If you are looking for ""classic"" Monster Hunter, your best title is going to be Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate. MH Generations won't be for you either.TL;DR MHW is the most accessible Monster Hunter and is suitable for newbies who like smart and tactical gameplay. MH Veterans will also find something to love here, as Capcom has changed certain mechanics to make gameplay feel fresh. MHW's graphics may also cause MH Veterans to shed a tear, MH has never looked this beautiful.Note: I recognize that, at the time of this writing, MHW has lots of connection issues. I attribute this to Steam rather than Capcom; the connection issues only started when Steam rolled out an update. Plus, the game just launched. Launch issues are to be expected for any triple A title. I finished the entirety of the campaign solo."

Most of the changes compared to previous games were done with either realism or user friendlyness in mind. For example theres much more interaction with the environment by both the player and the monster, or supplies are easier to craft with an auto-combination function upon collecting the ingredients which are far easier to find and collect than in previous games. Just casually picking up some highlighted herbs and some honey without even having to stop, just slowing down a little, while following the monster into the next area, which are automatically converted into megapotion sure is handy, but compared to previous games can feel almost too easy. Multiplayer has been improved a lot, its integrated with the story, not forcing you to decide between doing one or the other, however what i would like is an option to limit the max hr for the quest participants, since higher level players can join low level monster hunts and make the fight too easy, taking some of the fun out of the game.The number of monsters may seem a little small, but i guess i've just been pampered by the 4th gen games on that regard. However that number mostly originates from there being little monsters from previous games, with most being originals, and the ammount of new original monsters is up to pair with other games. For comparisons sake, Monster Hunter Tri had even less monsters. Its a little dissapointing to not see some of our most favorite faces like Zinogre or Nargacuga in the new world tho, but at least Deviljho and Uragaan made it there, *sigh* yeah thats greatI can't say i personally had many performance issues, but i also have a gaming rig. Sure its not exactly a game for a budget pc, but i cant say i havent been warned enough of that before buying it. What i heard about it i cant say its reason enough for me to give it a bad review, mostly cause I've seen a lot of games with even worse launches or pc ports. Remember the pc port of Dark Souls before the remaster? Overall, i do enjoy Monster Hunter World and will enjoy it for a while, even if it makes me feel like an old person reminiscing about the good old days where we had to collect blue mushrooms alongside herbs to craft potions, but hey, at least i got MHGU coming to the west soon for all those nostalgia feelings."

I even bought a extra analog stick for that when I didn't have an XL 3ds and bought one for 4u and monster hunter generations. I have to say, for various reasons this is my favorite monster hunter experience.PS: I had about 300 hours clocked in on, 4u and generations. The only reason I currently have 10 on this is because I just bought the game 2 days ago. I can easily see myself clocking 300+ in on this. It made 10 hours fly by so fast I didn't even realize until now. 11/10But if you are looking for a much more hardcore experience. 4u followed by generations , or if you have a switch generations ultimate may be more for you.

Game is still great, with improvements to the PC controls and the better networking, I would 100% recommend this game.  Old review is bellow for reference.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would like to preface this review by saying I love to play this game. It is a lot of fun to learn how to hunt each monster and farm and craft the materials from each hunt. Playing this game with friends is where it really shines, and unfortunately this is also where this review goes south.At the time of writing this game's multiplayer is mostly an error code simulator. I have successfully hunted in a group, it is possible but nothing is more disappointing then getting disconnected in the middle of a quest. You lose all of your party members and although you stay in the quest the difficulty stays at the multiplayer level, the monsters get a slight health boost ect. so to finish the hunt requires extra effort. This often leads to a l lot of wasted time.Aside from the multiplayer issues this game is fantastic. The controls take some getting used to unless you opt for the controller. I mapped a lot of buttons to my mouse so it feels pretty good for me. I cant in good sense recommend this game until the connection issues get fixed. If you plan to play solo 100% this game is ready for you today and you will love it. If you are like me and want to play with friends, you will be disappointed."

With tons of weapon guides online I managed to master this first weapon and stayed with it pretty much the whole base game.Once I found myself a bit bored I just switched to another weapon, Insect Glaive in my case and it's like playing a new game. Maybe a little bit exaggerated but it is still pretty fun to master different weapons since every one is so unique.Highly recommend this game."

The game has had a very large number of free content through updates and the one expansion they have essentially doubles as a new game in of itself, the total amount of large monsters in the game rivals that of the older games despite a lot of older monsters being left out of this game. The online multiplayer is a lot of fun and quite balanced and the overall community of Monster Hunter is helpful, nice, and welcoming so most people are always down to help in any way that they can. This game can either be played casually or hardcore with the level of grind that's in the game, min maxing is totally optional and because of that the game can easily have hundreds if not thousands of hours of replay value and enjoyment. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who is either a fan of Monster Hunter or wanting to get into Monster Hunter, 100% worth the price of both the base game and dlc, especially moreso if both end up on sale!"

I cannot stress how much this takes away from the combat gameplay.- Optimization is greatly lacking. I got an average of ~35 frames on an RX 580 / Ryzen 2700X and ~50 after disabling volumetric rendering.- The menus are clearly designed for a console and very unintuitive with no changes to the layout or even adding in a scrollable field. If there are 25 items within a menu, instead of being able to smoothly scroll through all 25, they are locked to pages.- Going off of the last point, the escape button doesn't work to exit out of any of the menus. What modern day game or application doesn't make use of the escape button in 2018? It's such an intuitive action for me to take and after 5 hours I still find myself trying to hit escape to exit out of menus instead of the right mouse button.- They also didn't bother to change a good number of tooltips off of their respective Xbox buttons rather than the actual keybind.

It's possible THE best pure pve game I have played.Personally, I think it's very hard to pull off a pve multiplayer game that is balanced. But Capcom did it. This game... It's so smoothly balanced, in term of weapon types, combat style, damage points, armors and items farming, environmental, buffs, and the FREEDOM, there is just so much.You have to experience yourself. MHW made me feels entertained, surprised, interested, satisfied, and ACCOMPLISHED. Capcom must have studied game and human psychology good. Cuz by combining these two they created an utopia that it's hard to resist, it resonates the ""heroness"" within ourselves, and the vision where hard work can be visually and measurably pays off. Try it yourself, or you could be missing out big time.Now let's hold the high horse for a sec. Yes, I'm very new to this game series, mhw pc version it's actually my first encounter to the series. (Never heard of this game before, and no one I knew well enough were a mhw gamer, btw I'm very introvert and don't social much so..)Therefore I can very much understand how this game can appear ""too complicate"" and tmi at first for the new comers and how that can be somewhat off putting. But for me, it was worth it, putting all these hours to explore, to study, to try to understand and master it. (Yes I'm only at level 11 lol) However, this game does require some patient or it won't be as enjoyable. This review is getting long, ill come back and add more thoughts as I go. So far the only few suggestions I could make is:1. I wish there were an option for posting an expedition which could let your friends join in, right now it's just weird and hard to do. 2. the inconvenience of sending back guild card. Edit: apparently Capcom kinda fix the issue, you could go into setting and set it up as automatically accept and send back guide card. Edit: 3. Multiplayer can sometimes be too easy. Could need some re-balance work. p.s."

There are a lot of aspects to the game, not just hunting monsters. Controls are on point and I love the balance between story, dialog and gameplay.I currently only have a little over 300 hours in-game and I'm nowhere near done plus there is always a new update and/or event to play.I would highly recommened this game to everyone, especially if you've never tried this type of game before.

When the game first launched there were numerous issues with the multiplayer systems, which explains the overall mixed reviews, but thankfully Capcom fixed them all the following months, and since then I personally haven't experienced any major issues since then.After playing the game for over 400 hours I can safely say that this is one of my all time favourite games, and with the Iceborne DLC dropping sometime this year (hopefully), I can see myself easily managing to put another 400 hours into this. I would highly recommend getting this game, playing the MH4U on the 3DS created some amazing memories and MHW let me re-live them."

All connection issues have long since been resolved and a lot of the people who gave it a Negative review never bothered to update their reviews.""""Or so I thought when I first saw the trailer for MH World. I don't consider myself an MH veteran, but I've been playing MH since Tri first came out on the original Wii. To me it seemed World was trying to set itself apart from the older titles to the point where it couldn't be considered a true MH title. I reserved further opinions until I played World first-hand and suffice to say, I couldn't be more wrong than that.World takes what's offered in the recent games (mostly 4U) and repackage it in an HD offering. Depending on the game you last played, the mounting system and verticality emphasis in 4U might be new for you. It takes some time to get used to, but it feels right at home when you learn how to use it. Also for better or for worse, some mechanics and QoL improvements in Generations, most notably Hunter Arts and Styles are missing.""""Apart from the QoL improvements, there are three main things that I notice really. There are new environmental hazards for you to play around with. For example toads that can paralyze, boulders that can fall at enemies, and flashbomb-like insects. Slingers, mini-bow which shoots select objects which you can find randomly on the wild. Finally, there is also a grappling hook which propels you across distance. Much to the traditional MH tradition, the three are poorly explained especially the environmental hazards. However they make great additions to the core gameplay. I admit I miss the point of using slingers, but these make dungs and flash bombs not as tedious to use.World is first and foremost, catered to newcomers. As a newcomer, it can get daunting to get so much mechanics thrown at you at once. But I think the game did a good job explaining some of the mechanics via the in-game tutorial, something I would really appreciate back when I first started in Tri. The game is considerably easier and also much more ""lived-in"". All in all if you would like to check what Monster Hunter is about, World is a good entry point to start with.Right the issues. From a gameplay standpoint, I think the inventory and crafting system is too dumbed down, but that's something I can live with. Port-wise is something I have issues though. I do have FPS problems, but I'd choose it over the server issues any day. It can be abysmal at times and connection errors will periodically occur even when idling. Right now, I won't hope much for the multiplayer component of the game.Overall, I think World is a great game with a somewhat troubled port job. While I would recommend waiting for a while if you only want to play multiplayer, the game is still fun when soloed on its own right."

You have insane amounts of weapon combos to boost, overpowered to top it off.You can slam monsters against walls with your nut slinger, because why not.

Pros:Combat is fantastic, weapons work very well with controller and feel satisfying to use.The new monsters are interesting designsIt is a challenging gameBest looking monster hunter game released yet, probably one of the best looking games this yearCons:Unskippable cutscenes and very heavily story focussed for a MH game in my opinion. Back in the day it was just ""There's a big dragon coming to town, take it out"". At least let me skip the damn cutscenes! (hopefully this will be modded out soon enough)A strange multiplayer system. Before in MH you had a gathering hall and a village quest system. Essentially it was a single player and an offline series of quests. Here it somewhere in between. Good luck trying to quest with a friend at the same time, due to the story and cutscenes you can't do most quests right off the bat. I believe both have to see the cutscenes to be able to que together. It's annoying.I have probably played at least 1000+ hrs in all the previous games and while I think this game is certainly the simpliest of the franchise it is still worth it. They simplified a few systems and improved older ones. I see why the changes have been made but it just feels different.

Notice that I do not have hundreds or even thousands of hours into this game yet, but I will. This is more of a novice review, as we've only completed the campaign and Iceborne, and there is so much more. MHW is as deep as the Mariana Trench, and as wide as the Pacific Ocean, let me explain...What makes this game so challenging, yet so masterful, is each weapon. I've used the Insect Glaive (favorite) for most of my play time. It's very fun to use, as there are many ways to attack and evade enemies. It took me a good 60+ hours to even figure out and effectively use every move with this weapon, chances are, I'm not even that great with it. I have used the Switch Axe and Hammer as well, both equally as interesting and fun to use as the Glaive. The hammer is becoming my main weapon, as it's move set and ability to knock out the monster is amazing. I'm simply impressed with how each weapon feels vastly different from one another, yet still viable (though some more than others.)You have to also tweak your build(s) to fight each different type of beast or to match your play style. Each weapon and armor set have numerous different paths that allow you to efficiently tackle each challenge. This, in combination with the monsters' weaknesses, weapon variety, and other buffs make this game extremely deep and complex. I have yet to master any of it personally.The monster and world design is excellent, I still get lost in the Ancient Forest sometimes. And seeing another monster swoop in and start fighting with the monster you were tasked with killing in the first place, is awesome to witness. Each monster you fight feels like the end-game boss battle, you have to learn it's attack patterns and adapt. There are many different locations to explore, though some are more fleshed out than others.There are cons, however, and I know I will get flamed by all the diehard Monster Hunter fanboys, as I've already seen it on many other reviews. The first negative about this game is very important to me, because I put this game down for 2 years and never touched it til now because of it. Cooperative play is not as good as I'd like. If you want to play this with your friend or friends from beginning to end, that won't happen. There are many hunts in the campaign that you HAVE to solo, which is frustrating. I understand that I need to learn the mechanics of the game, that's fine, but I bought this game to play with friends, and many people just disregard or cover their ears when someone mentions any issues about this game. It should all be co-op (cutscenes included), or none of the campaign should be. Quit splitting up groups of people for a cutscene. The co-op opens up massively in Iceborne and the endgame, which is what we stuck around for.As a whole, I'm a huge fan on the franchise now, but this game isn't for everyone. If you want to turn your brain off, this game isn't for you; if you want to hack n' slash, this game isn't for you; if you want to enjoy a seamless co-op experience from start to finish, this game isn't for you, if you want a game to hold your hand and tell you every little thing you need to do, this game is not for you.If you want the ultimate challenge, this game is DEFINITELY for you."

It's amazing seeing the leap in graphical fidelity and gameplay designs that this game has gone through in MHW. Gameplay is much more fluid and the world feels much more alive than before. Going from MH4U Gunlance to MHW Gunlance is almost an entirely different game. When I first got heavily into MH3U, I always wished monster hunter could turn out to be the game MHW is with its open environments, monster tracking system (and not just paintballs), and gathering/crafting system and I can't get enough.- Graphics are top notch and each area of the game is screenshot worthy. Rotten Vale with its Dalamadur skeleton-based upper half and the Coral Highlands' surreal ocean-like appearance are so unique and I love them.- Monsters interact and have meaningful turfwars. I remember bringing Anjanath to Rathalos on purpose so me and my boss could finish the fight in time.- Gathering is much faster and the new auto-crafting option is really handy.- Radial Menu is a game-changer. Going from smashing through the item bar to this has saved me time and time again.- Gunlance no longer sends people flying on normal shells. This might not seem like much but I've been kicked from lobbies in previous games simply for playing my favorite weapon because people were afraid of getting disrupted.- Weapons in general are more fluid. Attacks can flow into other attacks more freely while previous games had more of preset ""combo"" inputs. This is more apparent in weapons like SnS, GL, Lance, and Greatsword.- Voice acting and cinematic scenes are amazing! People might not like Handler and the crew but hearing the NPCs around me talking and being a part of the environment is a huge deal.- Camps in the mission area alleviate last-minute prep mistakes and allows me to swap weapons and armor sets that I might like against one monster over the other.- Playing with friends is a blast now that I can actually play with them on a system most of them play on. 2000 hours of playing mostly solo or with randoms is mostly gone and it feels great.- NETWORK ISSUES ALL FIXED, DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES ANYMORE- Performance can take a significant hit on Nvidia's latest (398.82) drivers even though they state it's optimized for MHW. I don't know why they did this but I would typically sit around 45-60 FPS during missions. During Zorah Magdoros I dropped to around 22FPS with resolution scaling dropping as well. Once I downgraded my Nvidia driver to 398.36, I've not yet dropped below 50FPS. Zorah is now a consistent 60FPS. Please keep that in mind. This is with everything in the game on highest and volume rendering at mid.- STUTTERING ON THUNDER AND BLAST EFFECTS FIXED- No PS4 input icons by default. I love my PS4 controller and unfortunately had to install a simple handy mod to replace the xbox controller buttons. It would be nice if there was an option to swap input icons in the settings.- Gathering Hub seems kinda useless. I wish they chose to forgo the multiplayer hub and redesigned Astera for multiplayer gameplay. The area is much bigger and has everything in it. On the PS4, loading times meant going to the gathering hub was a total waste of time, but thankfully it's pretty quick on PC and SSDs (about 2-3 seconds) so I'm more okay with going up there to see friends. It's still a fairly useless area of the hub though...- For some reason the PC version has lower texture resolutions than the consoles. This seems like either a mistake or a really odd choice to make. Thankfully someone found out how to fix it by editing mipmap levels and I look forward to that mod but this REALLY should get fixed officially.This review is probably pretty choppy and I probably left out a lot of things I love or dislike about the game but instead of figuring it out I'm going to go back and dump another 500+ hours into it like I did on the PS4 lol______________- Intel i7-4790k @ 4.0GHz- Nvidia GTX1080 8GB- 16GB RAM- 500GB Sandisk SSD"

Despite this game being more user friendly, it's still incredibly cryptic and you won't get far without doing some research on your own. The game doesn't do the best job of explaining itself to say the least. Also, the multiplayer menus take a minute to get used to. The process of figuring out how to get multiplayer to function the way I wanted it to was pretty annoying.Now that my gripes are out of the way, this is one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are beautiful. Sound effects and soundtrack are fantastic. And most importantly, the gameplay is superb. A perfect balance of grind and reward. It doesn't take long before you're wearing some awesome looking armor and feel somewhat powerful with your weapon of choice.That being said, this game isn't easy. Not only is every weapon super unique and have different purposes, but you need to be very good with at least two or three of them to get by. Learning the combos and proper technique takes a bit of research, unless you go with the dual blades or sword and shield builds. The boss fights are incredibly difficult, rivaling Dark Souls and similar style games in difficulty. But it just makes the grind that much more rewarding.10/10"

To me it seemed like a minor issue anyway, since I always got my connectivity issues resolved within around 10 minutes (though maybe I'm an outlier) by just trying to reconnect a few times, never mind the fact that this game is thoroughly enjoyable as a single player experience as well, if you're into single player games (which I am).I'll leave this review short, and just urge you to try if you're into RPGs, ARPGs, CRPGs, JRPGs, fighting games or any other good games. A quality product, through and through. 92/100, if you like points."

Capcom needs to fix this issue as soon as possible-If you look for a good storyline, I suggest you turn away, Monster Hunter has never been story-focused game, it's not a bad story, it's pretty meh-Low to Mid PC should be aware that this is game is huge CPU tax-I want to dress my cat as a hot dog, where is the damn hot dog costume Capcom?!"

That said, this is a really lazy port and the studio behind it should be embarrassed at the low quality of the product they're selling.  I play to write a more detailed review later, but for now I'll just say the multiplayer code is buggy and the options don't even try to conform to the standard PC users are used to.  Still, if you are willing to look past that, the game offers the highest-quality gameplay experience which is even better with friends. (When it works.)*Edit: So it seems like they cleaned up the multiplayer code a bunch as I don't have nearly the amount of problems I used to.  That said, I hope the next game does a better job at matchmaking options as finding the hunt you want can be tedious.  The game itself is solid, but I do have a few complaints just in case a developer ends up reading this.1.  Have control setup options that work for mouse/keyboard users.  I shouldn't have to press an f-key to bring up my quick menu, I should be able to map buttons to my mouse or keyboard that just let me quick-select certain items (of my choice).  It's super clunky as is and takes away from the fun factor.2.  Give us damage meter options.  The awards at the end of the hunts are laughable, I don't need to know who grilled the most steak.  Let me know damage, blocking, stunning, sleeping, and other relevant combat stats so I have an easier time improving my performance.3.  Either make things more intuitive or give your players better tutorials.4.  Your pterodactyl crashing randomly adds absolutely nothing to the game, please do away with that crap.Those are my four main complaints 300 or so hours in.  Let me say again how great this game is, happy hunting all!"

You can slowly travel through new lands, and then all of a sudden get into a fight with a big-ass T-rex who will beat you to the ground. It has some specific mechanics, and if you jump into - you will need to learn a lot. But this will give you an advantage in upcoming battles. You can play it solo or in coop, and I'd say - coop is awesome. You can do a lot of things, but you can't skip the GRIND. It's a essence of the game. Some will love that, some will pass. Depends. But I'd strongly recommend to try this game.EDIT: Still a lovely game. Now you can get the game by -50% and you have a chance to play it just before the new DLC will be available called Iceborne.

1809,Avalanject,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yaboiavalanject/,3,2,1,737.9,June,"26,",248,3,1,"TL/DR: An incredible game that everyone needs to try, and with Iceborne out now it couldn't be more worth it. So many things to do and discover, and if you're not just in it for the Monster Hunting there's hundreds of other little activities to partake in. Play it with friends though, its a 100 times more fun.This is easily my favourite game that I've played in a long time and since I'm enjoying it so much I figure that I might as well spend the time to type up a legitimate review to pay homage to this incredible game. This is my first entry in the Monster Hunter series, although I did play a trial for Generations on my 3DS a while back, but I couldn't get into it. It didn't seem like my game.I was hesitant to spend the big $80 toll on this game, but I eventually gave in, and I was launched into a brand new world unlike anything I'd ever expected. The game can start off extremely confusing and overwhelming, but once you've played around 20 hours, you should get the hang of everything and how this world works.The game-play consists of tracking and hunting monsters, fighting them, killing or trapping them, looting the corpses for profit, then turning their skin into new weapons and armour to help you take on stronger monsters. It is a bit of a grind at times, but the game itself has never felt too grindy to me. In fact, I don't enjoy grindy games such as Destiny or Warframe, but there's something about this game that hits different, and it is so much more enjoyable. It has around 14 weapons or something, and each one feels very fun in its own right and can make the game a whole new experience. Throughout the base game I stuck with a trusty Hammer, and it is quite satisfying crushing the skulls of giant monsters and flipping through the air like sonic, but it does get quite old after 200 hours. For Iceborne I decided to take a different route and started using the Switch Axe, which is a little bit more complicated and allows me to dig my axe into the sides of monsters heads and drill their skulls out until they explode (♥♥♥♥ is crazy).  Using a different weapon feels like I'm playing an entirely new game and that's another thing that I love so much about this game. Every weapons play-style is extremely unique and its always fun trying out new play-styles. So mix it up every now and again for a better experience (although I wouldn't juggle more than like 5 weapons, because you're going to run out of materials pretty fast if you hope to craft a very strong weapon/armour set for each category)The world itself is very beautiful, interactive, and overall very immersive. Nothing from the plants, bugs, monsters, or wildlife feels out of place in this big world. The monsters range from giant lizards, giant pulsating pickles with legs, flying fire lions, to lightning powered unicorns, and not a single one seems as though it shouldn't be here. Each monster fits its appropriate environment accordingly and the way that each monster interacts with these environments, from having nests and feeding grounds, only adds to the immersion of this game, and shows just how dedicated the team behind this game is. The different layers to some of the maps, the spots where monsters get stuck, and the boulders around the maps that you can drop on monsters for massive damage are incredible and really make the player feel apart of the world.The story overall isn't anything too exciting and as said in a popular review; is realistically just more of a glorified tutorial. This doesn't necessarily mean that it's nothing interesting though. I'm not exactly knowledgeable on Monster Hunter lore, but the story was still quite engaging to me, and every new monster introduced made me thrilled to fight it and see what its armour and weapons might look like. Its definitely worth the money on it's own, and i finished it at about 100 hours or so (including having done a few optional missions and what not).So if you like to show off achievements you'll love this game, and Iceborne even more. There's tonnes of little side objectives such as optional missions, trying to catch rare endemic life, collecting treasure, taking photos for research, exploring to discover and befriend secret cat tribes, fishing, collecting mini and large crowns for your monsters, and so much more. This can all be shown off on your spectacular Guild Card, and this can be customised however you wish with titles such as ""Spread for Papa"" or mine, ""Commander of Cute"" which is pretty stupid but I'm not really that creative. You also have your own personal room where you can choose to display your rare fish and other creatures, but now with Iceborne you can catch and display a much larger range of rare creatures, edit your entire house and even have 16 whole people inside your room, around a table drinking and passing out. I once spent around 10 minutes just floating around with 3 strangers in the Hot Springs and doing nothing, before we all left and went on a mission together. If these other aspects of the game aren't enough, just get it for the community because I've never played with anyone toxic in my entire 400 hours, nor have I ever seen a negative community post. The community for this game is amazing.The crossovers for this game are also lots of fun, such as the mission for Geralt, and being able to use Igni whilst dressed up as Geralt or Ciri, it's all really fun and something that not a lot of other games let you experience alongside the base game like nothing is wrong. There are a few console exclusive crossovers which is quite unfortunate, but lots of games have console exclusive content so we just have to learn to deal with it. A lot of people would also argue that the developers of this game do not care as much about their PC audience due to late releases etc, but I'm considerably patient and don't tend to hold grudges so it doesn't necessarily bother me. Also, seeing as the Iceborne updates are going to be caught up with consoles in about March, then every update after that will be in sync across the board, I give extra credit to Capcom and I think that this disproves a lot of these claims. How can you hate them when they let you dress up your cat as an 8-bit Mega Man?Overall I love the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game and that's why I've taken the time out of my day to write this. It's been a long time coming. The world, the characters, the monsters, the weapons, the armour. Everything in this game is absolutely beautiful to me and I want to thank Capcom for not only bringing me this incredible game, but for introducing me to the world of Monster Hunter. A world that I would now consider myself a part of, and a world that I'm more than happy to be a part of. :)My original review: (At about 35 hours)you hit barroth and he goes back to poo lair, he love poo he loves poo i collect his poo for research poo"

Admittedly, I have never had the opportunity to play any other Monster Hunter title since I only play on PC, but as a newcomer to the series I am definitely excited about the franchise now, I've never played something quite like it.If I had describe the game to someone who has no idea what Monster Hunter is, I'd say it's a bosh rush with very unique weapons that take time to master, and fill very nice niches a lot of other hack and slash games haven't really covered, at least to me.As someone who always looks to the user-rating of a game, I'd say it's worth to look past the mixed one on this game, as most issues are adressed, and there's a tremendous amount of fun to be had!"

Slightly buggy multiplayer gameplay with the occassional server problems. Cute and ugly monsters to fight with their own signature attacks to follow (Pukei Pukei poison farts). An interactive environment during gameplay and battles, whether it is hanging rocks or paratoads, which assist one in bringing down monsters can be found scattered all across the maps. A wide variety of weapons to choose from and master, whether selecting to weild a single weapon and mastering it or being adept at handling several weapons, this gives the opportunity for players to customize the gameplay to their playstyle. Further customizations can come from the multitude of equippable gears that the player can create and utilize the various stat effects each provide. Not to mention our fierce and loyal Palicos that flick around their feline tails, bonk monsters thrice their size on the heads and help you during your battles with a variety of their own set of equippable gears and traps.  And ofcourse being served a dish by a chef cat before heading in to the unknown. With perhaps more better optimization and added game content the game could be an even better joy, albeit the grindfest can be an annoyance after awhile for most players and can make the game more tedious unless one enjoys it."

I've dumped 500 hours into the console version and I expect to dump at least 200 into the PC version with my friends. As a game, I can 100% reccommend this game. But as a port, I cannot back this game 100%. The PC port has quite a few issues, the biggest being that you can kill the final boss and your save DIES. That is unacceptable. There are a lot of things I'm willing to let fly, but that is not one of them.I'll play devil's advocate; you CAN just back up your save right before that fight. Which is what I advise everyone to do. But not everyone is going to be made known to that knowledge, which means some of the less fortunate won't have done that, resulting in hours of work down the drain that no one is going to want to do again.I'm torn because I want to say ""BUY THIS JAWN CAUSE THE GAME HOT"" and honestly I'mma still say that. But don't go in without taking precautions. For everyone who has the game and knows about this, take it upon yourselves and spread the issues like wildfire so people don't go in blind and then have their saves die after some odd 40+ hours of work. For these reasons above, I'll be downvoting. People are more likely to read downvotes anyway. Take the steps necessary to prevent your save from going down the drain. And when you do buy this game, go get the Special K fix.EDIT: It's been forever ago and I'm certain the fabled save issue is long gone, so I'll go ahead and give the thumbs up back.

1828,Maulman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/YouGotMauled/,7,,1,239.8,August,"13,",283,0,1,"I really cannot stress enough how flawed the review balance for this game is right now. It's sickening to see that people are hating so heavily off of what was told by capcom to be a port, sold as a port, for the first time for the series on a PC platform. The game functions as advertised. It's very entertaining, minimal FPS drops, and engaging gameplay with characters. Sure, the cutscenes and NPCs are off because the animations are still for the Japanese language. But you can get over it very quickly with how little impact it is towards the game as a whole.What I will address seperately is: The multiplayer problem:I live in Japan. This is a very hard place to be from, when all of your friends are foreign.I am friends with a lot of foreigners. I am playing Japan to Austrailia or Japan to Germany, literally all the time.I can connect with such little issue to them that it is often the Austrailian's internet that prevents them from playing with me. I have never been so badly disconnected that in the middle of a fight with one of the bigger monsters in the game (i.e. Rathalos, Diablos) I have been left alone. It's probably not the servers. It's you.Now onto the rest of my review.21:9 Support? use a 3rd party program to force the ratio.This game was not meant to be played on keyboard and mouse. Treat it like souls and buy yourself a wired controller. You can use it for other games as well. I'm sorry if you can't.The UI is meant to be simplified for consoles but is honestly still crap. Bad for organization and those with intense OCD qualities like yours truly.TL:DR: Game's good at heart, polished to near perfection, but a little clunky around the edges.If you can't treat it like it wants to be treated, like a woman, it will scorn you."

However, it is not at this time a multiplayer game. Playing with a group of friends has been a trial, most quests require everyone to go forward, see a cutscene, then abandon the quest and remake for everyone to play together. Some days we will be disconnected every quest, and not only does it disconnect you, but it puts you back in your own offline session. You can continue to fight, but the monsters stay up at scaling for 4 players, instead of scaling back down when there is only one player. The disconnects wouldn't be as much of an issue if they fixed the monster scaling, or the monster scaling wouldn't be such an issue if they fixed the disconnects. The fact that the PC version had 6 months additional development time, and this issue wasn't resolved (and so far hasn't been fixed or even lessened in the first two weeks of release) indicates that this is not a priority for the monster hunter team.

1838,Light Tim,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lighttim/,3,,1,"1,136.8",January,"13,",642,0,1,"TL;DR: Monster Hunter: World is a game that I 100% suggest to all people, with a few warnings for the few players that might not like the genre.Monster Hunter: World (or MHW as I will put it for now on,) Is a action RPG that is about playing a up and coming hunter going on a boat to the new world to a science post to learn about why the giant 'elder' monsters come to the new world every so often. You hunt, you grow, you hunt bigger things, and you find the focus of the game: hunting. The game focuses on the hunting experience, and everything is built around it. You craft better armor and better weapons to get hit by giant monsters, and hit them better. You collect food and meds to support your hitting, and being hit, of giant monsters better. And that is were I suggest were people really think if they would enjoy the game. Do you like hunting? If yes, ask if you would like hunting very big things? If yes again, would you hunt things that would make your caveman ancestor proud inbetween his screams of terror? If yes, then you would likely like this game.Now here is the part were I post things that you should watch out for so you know about it ahead of time. There will be grind, but if you like hunting, then all grind is reduced to just collecting meds to keep hitting the monsters you like hitting.You will have a wealth of choices, and some time will be wasted on ""Will I hunt X thing now? Or Y thing? Oh hey Z thing popped up?! Do I pick that?""And lastly, you will curse your luck on rewards. You will love and hate gems before you even find out what they are. You will hate how you get one item in midgame you will love, and be told you have a chance of picking up more, only to never get one 200 more hours in, and your friends will say ""Oh my five Xes? I just got lucky."" while they envy you for the Y rare thing you picked up they need but you don't.Also if you main a weapon that isn't ranged, you will fear the mating call of air raid sirens that have become locked onto your butt. This is not final destination, you can use other weapon types."

I even played Monster Hunter Frontier in korean because i wanted a PC Monster Hunter game so badly. The game improved in many ways and even got a bit less complex, without making it too easy for casual players. They added a lot of new monsters to hunt and the new maps are also great in terms of atmosphere. Performancewise it runs solid on my GTX 970 (60 FPS) with SSAO and Volumetric Fog disabled. Server disconnects happen here and there, but for me, it doesnt destroy the gameplay experience at all. So yeah.. i love the Monster Hunter universe and im glad i can finally play it on the PC. Thanks Capcom!"

1843,Cosmos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/uhurulol/,3,,1,153.1,August,"11,",219,0,1,"50 hour update:  This game has made me feel feelings I haven't felt from a video game in years. It's up there, for me, with Dark Souls 1, Shadow of the Colossus, Ocarina of Time, Breathe of the Wild, and many other all-time favorites. This game, despite the current connection issues, is as close to perfect as a video game can be. NO SPOILER REVIEW:I avoided all trailers and videos while I waited for it to come out on PC, because I love MH and the excitement of exploring yourself and finding all of the giant monsters. So, without spoiling any of what I've found in my ~10 hours so far, I will simply say that everything has exceeded my expectations. As a fan of Monster Hunter, I was certainly already hyped, but after diving in I can say I never expected a game of this caliber. The world the player finds themselves in is nothing short of spectacular. The environment is infinitely more lush than any MHW predecessor, the colors are and tone of the world are beautiful, and the player and beast modeling is excellent. Tracking and fighting one of the gorgeous beasts is absolutely epic, and the length of the battles and sturdiness of the monsters makes them truly feel like a worthy adversary. Combat-wise, the mechanics are just like previous MH games. If you haven't played one, think Dark Souls meets Zelda, with more of an edge toward DS. Each weapon has a very individualized moveset and playstyle, all catering to different types of players. Evading (see: rolling in DS) is your primary damage avoidance---certain weapons may come with shields, as well, or unlock alternative Evade abilities. I, personally, have enjoyed the Insect Glaive, which allows you to zip around through the air attacking super-fast, while simultaneously buffing yourself and your party with your Kinesect offhand (this isn't a spoiler, this is one of the first weapon options you are provided with).As for the multiplayer, you can now hang around town with up to 16 in your online session, and then do your quests or expeditions with a party of 4. Smacking monsters and exporing with friends is a blast, but so far does not seem to change the game much, other than making it actually possilbe to nail some of the bigger monsters, which would be quite difficult to solo. All-in-all, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true adventure to get themselves lost in."
1844,Dominus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198325728245/,4,,1,468.7,January,"12,",66,0,1,"MHW is an incredible RPG where you can explore colorful landscapes and hunt a plethora of beautiful and dangerous monsters. There's a ton of variety in terms of how you can play the game. With 14 different weapon classes, each weapon provides a unique way to experience the game. From chopping off tails with a sword bigger than your body, to unloading a machine gun into a dragon's face, to bonking an unicorn on the head with a giant guitar, MHW provides you with many different ways to get an adrenaline rush. Each monster is unique in their own way and provides different levels of challenge. Some of the more difficult monsters in the game have given me some of the most intense gaming experiences I've ever had. The game itself requires a good amount of time investment to get into the good stuff. There's a lot of grinding required as you learn how different monsters behave and as you farm up monster parts to build the next best weapon or piece of armor. On its own, the base game can provide around 100 hours of gameplay (although Iceborne's Defender gear has substantially lowered the amount of grinding needed) with tons of customization and monsters to battle. Iceborne is the cherry on top and builds on top of the already impressive base game. At a price of $30, the base game is well worth the money and I highly recommend getting MHW if you're looking for a challenging RPG where you get to bully monsters all day long. May the Sapphire Star guide your way!"

I am a mostly-solo hunter with a lot of experience in the franchise, but MHW is the first game I've been able to recruit a full hunting team, and it's been a blast. Yes, the network errors (that as of the time of writing Capcom is actively working on a fix for) can be a bit frustrating, but most can be resolved by simply restarting the game or recreating a session.The game looks beautiful, it runs well (after a few tweaks) and the variable resolution scaling helps a lot to smooth out those hitches. It's just plain fun to progress and fight bigger and badder Monsters in this big beautiful world. I am anxiously awaiting additional content that I'm sure will be added... and also those fixes mentioned above.I rate the launch of the game at 4/10I rate the game itself 9.5/10*** Update: The 'Save Corruption on Defeating the Final Boss' is not real -- it is a Codec issue only with playing the cutscenes.

It takes the foundation of the older games and builds up on it. The maps are no longer broken up into separate sections that need their own load screen to enter. And all the weapons have been given brand new mechanics to them making them feel more diverse and deep. However with the changes to the game over previous titles it also lacks some of the longevity that titles like 4u and the new generations u have. By that I mean the amount of monster added to the game and the addition of G-rank. In world there is only 24 (about only 21 on pc currently) in the game, and more to come. While on the 3ds title there was 70. In the end world is a step in the right direction. However it's like your grandpa who went to walk up the stairs to go the bathroom but instead only make it 3/4 the way there and ♥♥♥♥ his pants instead.

Game runs like butter, even with a full party using elemental weapons.TL;DRThe game is very well made with beautiful design in most categories (Combat, World, Character, Armor, Weapon), more than 100 hours of content and tons of replayability. But the online needs some work, because there are server issues. I would get the game if you aren't using wifi. I think I had a total of 5 disconnects when playing with friends and I have a ton of hours on this game. Controls can also be improved. Definitely worth $60.I'm not going to seperate the pros and cons, since they are kinda intertwined.The soundtrack, game design, and combat are fantastic. There is hidden content, the game doesn't really tell you about. IE Cat villages that give you different tools for your Palico (humanoid cat), bounties and investigations that give you extra bonuses from hunting monsters. Most of the different items you can use aren't well explained, so newbies to the series might not use them at all. Using the training area is HIGHLY recommended. Each weapon has different mechanics. Even something like a bow has combos and different skills. The game world feels alive, with monsters interacting with each other and the evironment around them. There are even turf wars between some monsters. You can use the environment to your advantage when fighting monsters. Making them run into trees, dropping boulders on them, kicking frogs (you'll understand if you play), etc. You can even break different parts of the monster (break their horns, cut off their tail, crack their nails, shred up their wings, etc.).Once you get High End, the difficulty increases by a lot, more monsters are introduced, and more game mechanics are introduced as well. Low End is more for an introduction to the game and world. Getting to High End takes about 20-30 hours.I don't really know too much about the voice sync problems, since I always listen to games in the language they were made in and the japanese sync is passable.Compared to other MH titles, the game is a lot more streamlined. Geared towards making grinding less tedious, and trying to expand it's fan base. You can take this as a con or a pro depending on how big a fan you are of MH.   This is a game where you are meant to grind monsters and take your time exploring. It isn't something you are supposed to sprint through at a break neck pace. If you try, you will end up wasting tens of hours backtracking, because you'll soon find enemies can one shot you and your weapons aren't doing a lot of damage. If you aren't into that, don't get the game.However, there's something satisfying about getting stomped by a monster, grinding for 2 hours, then obliterating them for revenge. Then, putting them in an arena, only to wreck them again with a dragonator.You're also meant to explore the different weapon types. If you try to focus on one weapon type, a monster will come along to render it useless. NEVER play with randoms, NEVER use SOS. That's probably the reason why there aren't a lot of public servers open. Most are cancer. They join, then leave, causing you to solo a monster meant for 3-4 people.There are connection issues, but they will be fixed. When it comes to making an online game, you can run all the tests you want, but having servers support hundreds of thousands at once for the first time without bugs, is near impossible.I played the game through with a few friends, and yes, let me tell you. The game is fun alone, but it is a blast with friends. Enemies are more difficult, and you can use different strategies to take down different monsters.As for the controls. I use mouse and keyboard, but it can be difficult, if you don't have very good hand-eye coordination. The UI for item usage is the best out of any MH game, but I can see why people are complaining about it. It requires you to press multiple buttons to switch items (Hold ""Q"" while mouse scrolling, or left and right clicking). I have a gaming mouse, so I can just map the stuff. Not really an issue for me.Comboing with the different weapons requires you to use Left CTRL and Left and Right Mouse buttons. TheI don't use the lock on at all. It takes away a lot of the camera freedom and can switch to different body parts if you move the camera the wrong way. Free handing it is far better more me and I don't have the same problems with acceleration like the other people. Maybe I'm used to it, or the problem is insignificant.I play the game a lot, so if you think I have bias, feel free to try and call me out on it. I'll try and respond to everyone that disagrees.Finally, and most important. Use an ethernet cable, and download the new GEFORCE Driver for MH and your game issues will decrease significantly."

After a while my friend just bought the game for me. Basically: Super fun.The game is kind of slow to start. The first hour or so is pretty cutscene heavy and feels very hand holdy, but it picks up. I'll be honest, the actual story is pretty meh, but all the story is anyways is a fat tutorial so... yeah. Gameplay is this games strength though. I think the easiest way to explain it is that every fight is a boss fight (minus killing the pesky smaller mobs of course). Some monsters are really easy to fight, especially if you're padded with the right armor. Later on you might as well be wearing paper, you'll get punished for not knowing fights/not knowing when to hit and when to dodge/block. The community is pretty friendly for the most part, there's some people who get salty at higher ranked things but that's kind of unavoidable. Playing with other players is really fun, but do your best to know as much as you can about the weapon you're using and the monster you're fighting and what you should bring. You don't wanna be the guy who uses the last of the groups carts (respawns). For learning a monster I'd recommend just soloing it and playing evasive while you learn all of its abilities/tells. For learning your weapon, I'd probably just look up a youtube video. I recommend Arekkz, he has fairly quick tutorials for every weapon and it'll really help speed up the learning process for your weapon. Oh and as far as I know the textures for pc are still bugged, so even on high settings you'll only get the lowest textures. Just look around on Nexus for the high res work around.Oh and you should send your guild card to people you group with and take guild cards from everyone that sends them to you. It's not a friend request or anything, you get to see their hunter stats n poses n stuff, but the real benefit to this is that you're letting hunters use your palico and getting more palicos to use for yourself in tailraider safaris. Those'll open up towards the end of the story.TL;DRGreat fun, nice community, do your part/be as learned as you can and you'll be fine. Textures are buggy, just check the nexus for a fix. Accept/Receive all the guild cards you can."

Controls are cool i like the M&K controlls so i have no idea on the status of controller stuff, graphics, likewise i have no idea if they did any form of changes to it bc my pc is beefy af. I really like how a lot of the stuff is streamlines, the mantles and bounties are really nice the investigations are also cool too and really helpful later on. And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i love the unique monsters in this game geez. so that about covers it this game got better and i reccomend it bc it's great, dont know what else to say :shrug:.review from launch:Monster Hunter World was my most anticipated game this year and so far I am kinda let down. For this review I’m going to go through several things that I do not like about this game and only give slight attention to things to that people have already said in copious numbers of reviews i.e. denuvo, connection problems, and video settings. However I will still address them and give my thoughts over them. So, first I want to preface this by saying that I have played over 1500 hours collectively in the monster hunter game series and have been a part of its fan base for about 4~5 years, with that in mind I will relate how I feel this game could have been better given prior game interactions and where this game improves upon the typical monster hunter formula. Bugs:I can’t just ignore these problems so I am going to get to them in the beginning, this game is pretty solid gameplay wise I have not run into any form of bugs aside from bad graphical quality, but one of my friends game's does freak out whenever he tabs out of the game and then he has to restart it (we both play in borderless windowed and I don’t have this problem). The main bugs that plague this game are in its multiplayer section. So, in prior monster hunter games online play was super easy since the single and multiplayer sections of the games were sectioned off, all you did was make the lobby and bam you were good, just give friends the passcode and they were in no server issues everything worked really well and there weren’t many connectivity issues if any. This games current lobby system is a gigantic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess, with crappy servers and net code that die almost always when someone is in your lobby and not to mention that the only way to remake your lobby if you have been given an error code is to restart the game instead of just being able to restart it from a menu or from the title screen. This is why I brought up the whole prior games separate systems because it prevented this annoyance which I guess I took for granted. The only other bugs I can think of would be denuvo and I only think of it as a bug since it is a pest :/ I don’t understand why they had to put it into the game denuvo doesn’t work all it does is just punish the people that buy the game pirates will break it like they always do. All together I wasn’t too worried about it since I WAS going to treat this as a predominantly multiplayer game but well can’t think of it as that with these ♥♥♥♥ servers, so oh well. Gameplay: So the gameplay itself is pretty good when you are able to play it, the graphics are pretty good and I love all of the cool animations with the weapons. In prior monster hunter games the story sat at its own back burner being able to be done whenever the player felt like it and in this one it's kinda forced on the player which isn’t really a bad thing but just again another annoyance. This is without mentioning your annoying ass partner that I wish I could just turn off. There is also the problem of not being able to skip cut scenes which I always hate. I love monster hunter's gameplay it is fun as frick and all of this forced story and nonskippable cut scenes just distract from that. What I wanted was a fun experienced fast paced monster slaying experience but instead all I’m feeling right now is just this slow ass early-game. I’m hopeful that late game is much better so when I get to it I’ll edit this part. Graphics: My pc's specs are:Ryzen 7 1800x cpu 4.0 ghzNVidia gtx 1080ti16 GB ddr4 ramAnd at the moment I have most of the settings on high except for that one volume thing that every review said to turn off. I can’t really complain about the graphical quality the game looks great and I’m able to run it well given my high end specs. It is another annoyance that I don’t have more options for settings, the main reason I play on pc is so that I can have those options, I get that it is practically beating a dead horse at this point but given that this is 2018 and that this is a title that sold millions of copies and that Capcom had been working on this for like 8 months this shouldn’t really be acceptable. Improvements on the series:Okay so here is what I think the game got right and brings to the table. I think that the mantle and the slinger systems are really cool and love all of the interactive environments. At first I was reprehensive to the map design since I felt like I was getting lost but I love how you are able to track down monsters through footprints and their weird secretions. I do kinda miss the style oriented fighting that was introduced in generations but I also like the new moves and mounting finishers that were introduced in this game as well. How it could have been better:First separate multiplayer and single player content most people I know were only looking forward to playing multiplayer and were used to that given prior title experiences. Second, more options for pc or even console like turning off tutorial hints or the expedition lady or just anyone trying to talk during a quest, it is distracting and pulls you out of the fight. Third, skip cut scenes I just want to have the choice I like having the choice to do things. Fourth, an improvement to the lobby systems, I’m talking about removing this weird ass 16 player lobbies but the max cap is 4 people a quest just make the lobbies 4 people to help server side. This ties in slightly with the prior point, there is a literal gathering hub that the devs could have used for multiplayer only content separating the two, I wish they had it would have improved this game by a lot in my eyes. TLDR; this game could have been great if it hadn’t been brought down by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, I guess what I was really wanting though was a typical monster hunter experience and got something that strays far from the typical formula and succeeds to a degree but otherwise flops. For now, I’m not going to recommend this game, but if these problems get fixed then I’ll make sure to change it and this review accordingly"

1878,emara,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tenukki/,3,,1,59.3,December,"9,",524,0,1,"I was initially hesitant to purchase this game as it was relatively new (2018 I believe), as my laptop typically struggles with the extreme graphics many AAA games have, and I was unsure I would have time to actually play the game since it was finals season. A friend convinced me to get it since it was on sale and despite my hesitance to actually start playing, I was immediately hooked. I've put around 40 hours into this game in the past two weeks since purchasing it. That is 40 hours I probably should have used to study instead. -The graphics were not so intensive that my computer struggled to run it -Multiplayer system is fun and enjoyable. I've had more fun running around on expeditions just hunting monsters and gathering resources than progressing through the main story line.-Resources necessary for upgrading weapons and armor require some grinding, but it has not been to a point were I was getting bored with farming the same monster for upgrade parts.Overall, I would give this game a solid 8/10. Playing with a group of friends and engaging in the co-op makes the game several times more enjoyable."
1879,Necrokattuz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Necrokattuz/,3,,0,335.3,August,"13,",123,0,1,"Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, and I can see myself playing this for many many hours - but there are glaring issues that keep me from recommending it at a $60 price tag.Control options are telling of a ""lazy port"", you're basically just assigning keyboard keys to gamepad button functions from the consoles, and there is incredibly little in the ways of customization. This means if on console ""Triangle"" controlled four to five different things based on situation, mapping that function to E will control four to five different things based on situation, with no way to split the functions. You're going to be gathering items with the secondary attack button when your weapon is sheathed and there's no way to change it. The mouse look feels more like it's emulating a control stick.The online system is wonky and unintuitive, as I gather this is how the game is set up on console too, so this is a design choice, and a poor one. You can't join people doing the story until they've seen every cutscene in a particular hunt, even if you're at the same point in the story, which makes progressing together, something that you take for granted in other games, a massive pain in the backside. This is reminiscent of some early 2000s crap that leaves you scratching your head that a big budget title could go this direction for something that has ""World"" in the title.There are connectivity issues that seem to be more of a client issue than a server issue. People who have problems consistently have problems with disconnects and such, and people who do not have problems seem to never have problems (thankfully I'm one of the ones who do not have problems, about half of my buddies in discord get disconnected all of the time though).There is also some pretty sketch performance issues with graphics cards that don't appear to be an issue with ""potato PCs"" as some may call it, rather very fincky driver version needs - and some Nvidia driver versions (notably the most current one) causing two of my friends to crash during cutscenes (which are unskippable, by the way).Overall this game is rich in quality content, but you may have to break through a thick shell of frustration to get to it. There are guides out there if you go digging in Reddit and such to help you out, but you should not have to go digging for guides to get basic features that we normally take for granted to work for a full priced 60 dollar title."

1887,Baxie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/baxie_loves_you/,5,,1,"3,051.1",December,"5,",659,0,1,"I started the amazing journey with this franchise with Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate and I played through all the western releases since. I was truly excited when they finally announced that the next game will be on PC.As a veteran I must say this is a really great game. Especially with Iceborne which added so needed variety in monsters (even tho they are still mostly wyverns and elder dragons).Compared to old games, this game has many quality of life improvements and whole experience is simply less frustrating. Prior to this game I used to tell my friends that MH is amazing franchise which they should definitely try, but that there are some frustrating mechanics they have to get used to. They'll either love it or hate it. But I don't have to say that anymore.Surely, the game keeps some frustrating aspects (or brings a new ones - hey jewel grinding, I'm looking at you), but overall this is one of the best entries in the series so far. It's definitely the best game if you never played MH before. And it's the great game to continue your MH journey if you're a veteran.Some people say that difficulty decreased compared to old games. I used to think so too, but then I realised it's not really a difficulty which decreased. It's just a lot of frustration is gone. And that's a good thing. One great example why this game isn't easier is the final fight against Fatalis. This is easily one of the hardest fights In the whole series and you'll love it :) And if you never played MH game before and you have no idea what it's about, it's basically a boss fight after a boss fight (note: a few tutorial/early quests might be just gathering/exploring and not actual hunting, but compared to older games there is way less quests like that). So there is a constant action and a lot of challenging fights. Each boss (monster) fight rewards materials specific for that particular monster. Those can be used to craft various weapons and armor. If I have to compare it to other games, I like to say it's Dark Souls meets Diablo. But much much better and still unique ;) One advice for newcomers - there is defender armor. Try to avoid that. It's meant to help you get to the Iceborne content faster. It does its job well simply because it gives you insane advantage. But as a result, early progress can feel too easy and not enough challenging. Boring even. So if you want the full Monster Hunter experience you'll surely enjoy, progress using other armor you craft and upgrade or replace with a new one from monsters you hunt along the way. Also try to play at least through the story solo or with a friend(s) who started a new character with you. Basically for the very same reason. Having experienced hunter with the end game gear in your quest will feel too easy and boring.If you avoid these, you'll surely have a great time. Even tho the game is no longer getting new content, it's still worth picking up and I'll definitely keep playing for a while so I'll see you in a gathering hub maybe."
1888,Xedhadeaus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137728235/,3,,1,947.4,October,"11,","2,155",0,1,"Monster Hunter... The perfect grind game. Historically known for having delightful amounts of content shoved into such a small space that you can somehow justify having a console specifically for one of their games. Hopefully I can be as brief as possible with this but it is absolutely atrocious that a game that is about hunting can have more mechanics and equipment tailored to specific ways to accomplish practically anything related to survival, AND have more equipment diversity and item purpose than any survival game that could ever hope to exist... While not being a survival game. Back to the point. Monster Hunter is like a vast painting that has you searching for Waldo, except that there is more than one. And while the typical person will find Waldo and move on. The people who appreciate the art and stick around to find that there are a whole lot of Waldos just strolling around just shy of plain sight. Everything about the game can be made into fun with a little know how.Unfortunately, this review isn't about monster hunter, it's about Monster Hunter World.-Monster Hunter World is a Fantastic game set to appeal to the masses, delivering much more fluid combat, Crystalline attention to detail, admirable amounts of content, easy to start co op, An array of weapons to choose from and adapt to, and skills to support every set up and idea. Please stick around for the rest if you read this, because I am going to start with the bad. Monster Hunter World made a big mistake (In my opinion). The things you would normally go out and kill monsters for has been trivialized beyond recognition. The shortest way I can describe this to you is, Imagine if a good game had several seasons of content, and the content costs nothing now so they make the entire game laughably easy to catch you up so you can get to the content they can gouge you for. But instead of there being content at the end, it's RNG, and instead of the game being old and full of content, it's brand new, and has very little at the end. -Do not mistake me, I LOVE this game, But growing up, half of the mettle was getting a crew of able willed hunters together to slay, and in most cases, dismantle a monster to craft its armor. Where half the battle is people using traps so none of us have to constantly flank the monster, or breaking several wings to make a piece of equipment... Monster Hunter World made practically every item but gems and plates, and choice irritants like Vaal Hazak's fang or Nergigante's tail, EXTREMELY easy to obtain without severing or breaking. The whole point of Monster Hunter is enjoying the methodical turn of the thickest solution of delicious thoughtful and well excecuted content... And Monster Hunter World literally pours water in it to make it easier to mix up. But it doesn't taste the same.-In a month or so, Everyone on PC will be farming Kulve Taroth to get some of, if not mostly the best weapons available in the game in another slog of RNG delivered progression. Weapons that mostly outclass or replace what weapons you wasted your time earning. And because it is a limited time quest, once it is gone, you will be left with inferior weapons to chase, or more RNG supported decoration farming... The general content climate of this series departure makes absolutely no sense to me. Moving on...GOOD STUFF! Monster Hunter World Is a graphical marvel and overall sight to see, the game and many of its assets are top notch, animations are mostly fluid, and performance is almost perfect now that teostra's fire has been fixed, There are a few lighting hiccups here and there, but that's on my end.-The quests are more involved, and only require brute force and VERY little know how to complete, you won't be catching fish or killing copious amounts of raptors because you're hoping you don't need to kill big bad Tigrex to boost your hunter rank. (It isn't always a good thing.)-SOS flares! No more looking outside of the ad hoc party seeing a few minute men wave at the screen and then make and destroy half a dozen houses so you can open your room and help them out. -General quality of life changes, infinite tent and item box access, being able to eat mid mission, the entire slinger mechanic...-Free DLC Updates, New monsters, gear. They said they were going to make it accessible for everyone, and they sure did. Monster Hunter World is an undeniable addition to the roster of games. There is a lot to do, and fun to be had. You will fully enjoy this game without issue until you hit the endgame, at that point I recommend you make some friends or answer some SOS flares. unless you are patient enough to wait for more content.-To be fair, other games exist, and there are other things to do. But I hope the developers know that our tastebuds have demanded a king's ransom after experiencing the reimagining of a game we used to pour our lives into decades ago, so as much as I want to cry and complain that my game changed a little, and I miss the old days. It's finally on PC,"

The combat seems much more fast pacedI really enjoy this game...when it works. It seems that my mates and I experience connection issues everytime we play. We often get so disgusted with connection issues that we just have to stop playing. The game looks decent enough for being developed on an older engine. Graphical performance has also been underwhelming due to the fact that my gtx 1060 will go from a solid 45-50 fps to 10-15 fps at certain points, and especially while using dual blades. I have noticed other people experiencing similar performance issues. Until these issues are fixed, I cannot recommend this game."

As of writing I've played all of today (2 days after release) with no multiplayer issues whatsoever.Currently running on an i5-4690k, 970 and 8GB of RAM on high with little to no frame drops or performance issues, so just make sure your PC is reasonable and you should be fine. Denuvo also hasn't been a problem. As long as you don't have a potato PC and can connect to the internet (which you should be able to considering you're downloading a game on steam and you're getting a game with a large amount of multiplayer) then you shouldn't have any problems.

1902,Atratzu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/,4,,1,121.6,February,"17,",374,0,1,"Whew... where do I start?Monster Hunter is a huge RPG developed by Capcom and released in 2018. Monster Hunter has lots of small detailed armor and crafting work to compliment the very large level maps, and countless hours of content. My brothers are consistently surprised that I insist on paying attention to stories in games, but they were especially surprised that I could kind of follow the Monster Hunter story.I don't blame them though, the story is hard to follow. And there are huge gaps in the main story as you get derailed hunting/farming/fishing/gathering/crafting/researching/leveling.You are part of the Fifth Fleet which has been summoned to help ""Research"" Monsters in the New World.I think the plot can be summed up best (and spoiler free) a conversation my brother and I had after we finished the main game:Me: ""We did it... now we can go home""Tim: ""You never go home"" I'm not someone who gets overwhelmed by open world games easily. I've played a lot of open world games, and seen a lot of mechanics. I've also played many MMORPG's which are often most guilty of presenting far too many activities/options to the player too fast.Monster Hunter: World left me baffled within hours. Not only did the combat seem complex, but the crafting, grinding, and questing system seemed foreign and strange to me....It doesn't help matters that I wasn't actually playing in my own style for the first 15-or-so-hours. My brothers were trying to speed me through the story because Monster Hunter has no idea that friends want to help friends progress through the game!! But one sub topic at a time.I suggest getting a feel for the game on your own for a few hours, go explore, try to fight smaller monsters, poke around. Let yourself make mistakes at the start of the game. Once you're later in the game you REALLY don't wanna mess up on what gear you're crafting and waste materials you spent hours to get.Next, the ""early co op complaint"". Friends can't join your game until you're seen cutscenes. On one hand, I get it... the cutscene stops combat and you need to watch Tyrannosaurus Rex do his animation and see his name and exclaim ""oh god! run away!!!""But on the other hand... I want to run around the world with my friends, or HELP my friends FIND the Tyrannosaurus in the first place.Now once you get into the same game... NOW the fun can really start.You're more than capable of playing through the whole game on your own, and if you had a bumbling sidekick like me, you'd be all the better without it. But having another person can really help take down monsters faster. That's part of the reason why my brothers wanted me to get Monster Hunter: World. The end game is tough and it's easier with a friend or three! Safety in Numbers.I'd love to go into greater detail on the different weapons (I stuck with the Bow when in a group, and the Insect Glaive or Charge Blade on my own) but believe it or not, steam reviews have a character limit... I uhhh... I've hit it before.

I sometimes find its use ... somewhat complicated at times I still get confused switching from the sling to the grapple.[ITA] Version:E da quando ho scoperto per la prima volta la serie di Monster Hunter tramite la versione della Wii ""Monster Hunter 3tri"" che mi sono innamorato perso del brand, con quel suo stile interessante e unico, l'idea di cacciare mostri e ricavarne da essi materiali per creare armature e armi sempre più potenti mi affascinò tantissimo, il 3tri non lo riuscii mai a finire mi ero intrappato molto con l'online all'epoca, ma solo anni dopo quando uscì la versione per 3ds-WiiU del 3tri/Ultimed lo finii al 100% arrivando ai massimi livelli delle missioni di gilda, provai una volta a giocarmi i primi titoli per Psp il primo Monster hunter e il Freedom 2 e Freedom ultimed, il primo mi fermai all'inizio nelle prime missioni a 3-4 stelle mentre il Freedoom 2-Ultimed non lo iniziai neanche, da allora ho smesso di giocare ma come in molte cose seguii sempre da fuori gli aggiornamenti sul gioco, sapevo dell'esistenza di Monster hunter: world su PC già da tempo ma l'idea di comprarmi l'espansione per poter giocare ai livelli massimi mi scocciava, dopo tante peripezie mi sono deciso di comprarmi alla fine World e Ice Bronr e posso dire di esserne d'avvero soddisfatto al 100%.Di base il game play e come me lo ricordavo non ho avuto problemi nel capire le meccaniche l'unico problema che ho avuto e stato nei controlli che se giocato con mouse e tastiera questo gioco risulto d'avvero complicato, infatti fin da subito sono partito col giocare con il controller e in fatti mi sto molto meglio, e lo dice uno che di base su PC gioco prevalentemente mouse e tastiera.Wolrd comunqe di base in molte cose facilita molto il gameplay come la ricerca dei mostri che grazie agli ""Insetti guida"" rende meno ostico la ricerca dei mostri da cacciare senza dover più usare le fantomatiche ""bombe colore"" come nei precedenti MH, anche le zone di caccia sono molto più belle più esplorabili e ""meno sistanziate"" rendendo la propria esperienza molto più entusiasmante e più libera, anche la raccolta dei materiali e più semplice ora basta avvicinarsi ad un punto di raccolta per poter raccoglier i materiali da poter combinare per creare oggetti o da usare alla forgia per nuove armi e armature, in sostanza World ha migliorato di molto la qualità della vita rendendo molte missioni meno frustranti e più facili per tutti sia per i veterani della serie che per i nuovi giocatori  che giocano per la prima volta ad un MH.Pero ci sono dei pro e dei contro:[PRO]-Grafica sbalorditiva-Varietà dei mostri d'avvero ampia-Quantità di missioni infinite-Creazione e personalizazione del personaggio più ampia rispetto ai precedenti episodi-Possibilità di creare armature cosmetiche!-Storia interessate piene di filmati ben curati nelle animazioni-Con Iceborn ti regalano un equipaggiamento per poter arrivare direttamente alla fine del gioco e giocare con i tuoi amici ai massimi livelli-Zone di caccia Open world senza caricamenti da un area all'altra[CON]-A parte le prime zone di caccia , la zona corallina e troppo grande e dispersiva...dopo 3 giorni faccio ancora fatica a capire dove andare per scovare i mostri e seguirli, mentre la zona del ""cimitero"" e quella lavica sono troppo piccole come se gli sviluppatori non si sono concentrati abbastanza su quelle 2 ultime zone che percarità sono comunque belle da vedere ed esplorare.-Trovare un server e difficile alle volte vai in sessioni piene di giocatori ma tutti di grado alto Maestro e te piccolino non vieni preso di mira...alle volte apsetto un pò di minuti perchè viene qualcuno a venire in mio soccorso (forse perchè il gioco ormai e arrivato alla fine del suo ciclo di sviluppo?)-Giocare con Mouse e tastiera non e semplice, questo gioco e nato su console e come un gioco per console deve essere giocato per forza col controller non ci sono altri modi.-Anche se il rampino e una meccanica interessante aggiunta con Iceborn... trovo alel volte il suo utilizzo...alquanto complicato alle volte faccio ancora confusione a passare dalla fionda al rampino."
1906,Al,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990640813/,2,,1,827.1,October,"21,",162,0,1,"Monster Hunter World isn't called Monster Hunter 5, but it's totally Monster Hunter 5. It's also kind of a reboot for the series. MHW feels like a game that takes into account the things most people ask themselves when they first play MH, such as “Why is the map an item taking space in my bag?” and “Why is the quest rewards window on a timer?”. MHW gets rid of a lot of the stupid stuff that has carried over from game to game for no good reason besides it being how it has always been done. A lot of things have changed, but at its core, this is still very much the same style of game.For the uninitiated, Monster Hunter is a game about hunting monsters, of course. But seriously, Monster Hunter is a game about boss fights and loot. It’s about learning bosses’ attack patterns, preparing for fights, and reaping the rewards when you beat the bosses. Bosses don’t drop weapons and pieces of armor, like in Diablo or WoW, though. You get monster parts from carving their corpses, and then you craft your gear from those parts. This might sound gruesome, but there is very little gore in the game. The game has a light-hearted comedic style to it, and is no more violent than something like Zelda. There is a story tying everything together, but it is not much more than an excuse to lead you into new areas and introduce new monsters to kill.Compared to Monster Hunter Generations, Monster Hunter World controls much more fluidly, but if you’re looking for a Monster Hunter game that controls as smoothly as Devil May Cry, you’ll be sorely disappointed. This is still that kind of clunky, complex, animation priority heavy Monster Hunter. There have been a few key improvements that make the game feel much better to play, though. The biggest ones being the weapon sheathing and item using systems. You automatically sheathe your weapon when you start running now, so you can get away from a monster more quickly. You also don’t have to stop running to use an item anymore, so you don’t have to stand there and go through a long drinking animation and risk getting hit again. These might sound like small things, but they’re huge improvements and make the game play much better.The biggest change to the game is in the hunting itself, though. In previous games, you had to carry paintballs around, run around an area to find the monsters, and throw the paintballs at the monsters to track them. Every zone was also separated by a loading screen, which could slow the game down a lot, depending on the system you were playing on. These were things some people defended as if the game wouldn’t be Monster Hunter if they changed them, but they’ve changed them, and the game is better for it. There are no paintballs in MHW. You don’t have to carry anything, craft anything, or throw anything at the monsters to track them. In MHW, you find monster footprints, hair, and scales, and track monsters by scent, like a dog. Their scents are visually represented by the scoutflies. The scoutflies are swarms of firefly looking bugs that lead you in the right direction, and even highlight gatherable items, like mushrooms, herbs, and more monster tracks. You gain experience tracking each monster as you collect more of their tracks, and eventually, you’ll automatically start tracking a monster without having to find their tracks. You can also put a pin on anything on the map, and have the scoutlies guide you to it. It doesn’t even have to be a monster. You can have them guide you to a mining node if you want.Zone loading screens are completely gone in MHW. Monsters still run away into other zones, each zone is still numbered on the map, and monsters are still kind of tethered to one zone at a time, there just aren’t loading screens. Each level feels like a big open world, but it's really not much different from how it was in the old games, it's just bigger and faster. The core monster tracking and chasing game is still the same.Monster Hunter World is also really good at slowly introducing you to the game's mechanics and explaining things through tutorials and tooltips. The amount of info thrown at you in the beginning of the game is pretty overwhelming, even for a MH veteran, but you can always go back and read all of these tutorials again, because the game saves them all for you. The game also keeps a detailed notebook full of monster weaknesses, weak points, and even loot tables. You can pull all of this stuff up any time you want, too. Tooltips on rare monster parts even tell you what you have to do to get them. There's a small Wiki's worth of information built right into the game.Monster Hunter World introduces a ton of other improvements as well. You can now go to any area and freely explore, hunt, or farm herbs and mushrooms without taking some useless voucher turn-in quest. Crafting has been greatly simplified. You don't need recipe books, required materials have been reduced, and the game even gives you the option to automatically craft any item when you get the required materials. You only get one Palico and they don't have talent trees anymore. All you need to worry about is their gear. You have access to food and your bank at the starting camp in every map, so you can rebuff if you die, change your armor and weapon, and even store and restock items in the middle of a quest. You don't need to carry honey to make more Mega Potions anymore, just fast travel back to camp and restock. Did I mention you can fast travel? You can open up your map and travel to any campsite you've discovered. Items like the whetstone, bug net, BBQ spit, and fishing pole get their own dedicated inventory slots, and the whetstone has infinite uses. There are no mining picks, and you never put anything you carve from a monster in your bags, so you have a lot more free bag space now. It also makes it so you never have to discard an item to loot a monster part again. There's too many things for me to list here, but they all add up and make the game much more intuitive.Multiplayer on PC has been pretty iffy so far. A patch that fixes some of the network issues has been released now, but online was a mess during the first week and a half after launch. It wasn’t just when playing multiplayer either. Since you have to make online sessions when you start a game, I would get huge lag spikes and disconnect messages, even when playing alone. It got to the point where I would just start the game in Steam’s offline mode to avoid these issues. There are still some problems, especially during peak hours, but the online is working much better now.Monster Hunter World has some beautiful graphics, but it's the art direction that really makes them shine. Environments in MHW look natural and tell a story of their own. The way each zone blends into the next is seamless and makes sense. For example, the desert area has a river going through the Western part of the map. The river starts at a waterfall in the North, and ends in a muddy lake in the Southernmost section of the map, where the mudskipper monster, Yuratodus, hangs out. There's tall grass around the river, and cacti deep in the desert. The trails going from the river to the desert look like they were eroded by streams flowing down to the river, like maybe this area floods sometime during the year, or maybe the swamp covered more of the desert at one point.The game looks great, but technically, it’s kind of a mess. Some issues have been alleviated with a recent patch, but others remain. The most noticeable issue is the low resolution textures. For whatever reason, the game doesn't load the high res textures, even though they are installed on your computer. Modders have gotten them to load with mods, so we know they’re there. There are also major issues with one of the Elder Dragons, Teostra, and the last map, Elder’s Recess. This map has a bunch of lava, smoke, heat wave effects, and a ton of sh"

Yes the multiplayer could be worked on however after figuring out how things work it was very easy to join friends even if they were mid fight. I also understand that (at the time of making this) only have 11.8 hours, but for never playing monster hunter before this one it is extremely enjoyable and fun whether you are fighting a monster or just roaming around gathering materials for better armor, more potions, making items, etc. Lastly, the campaign could be better because it is somewhat straight forward and doesnt leave any room to feel attached however it is a great way to hone your skills and gain experience fighting bigger and stronger monsters as you progress. 8/10 i would say?"

So, if you don't like fact pace action games that require quicker reaction times and tons of grinding then this game is not for you. Now for some of the cons: if you're looking for a good story you're not going to get it, you have this creepy partner that will annoy you at nearly every given moment, and the learning curve at the beginning will frustrate new players to the Monster Hunter series.

MHW has many quality of life improvements over previous titles, making the game more accessible to those who have less time to play. Still, the game retains its depth. It is very noticeable that the MH team has wanted to release a PC title for a very long time.||||||||||||||||||||||| PERFORMANCE|||||||||||||||||R7 2700x, 1080ti,  3200 14-14-14-34 RAMI am able to maintain a solid 60 fps while recording at 1440p. You will need at least a modern quad core processor and a 1070 to play this game at 1440p, and at least an old i5 and 1060 to play this game at 1080p. Yes, you will need to turn the fog off, but maintaining 60fps+ is very easy otherwise while maintaining great visuals.||||||||||||||||||||||| GAMEPLAY|||||||||||||||||I have never felt such a high level of immersion in a MH title. This game truly makes you feel like you are part of the Monster Hunter ::world::, and ditches the gimmick mechanics from the spinoffs (MHX, XX, etc) in favor of amazing combo play.The game starts off extremely easy and then ramps up back to normal difficulty just before high rank. The monsters behave more reasonably and are less abusable. Every weapon class feels unique and useful. Utility items and status effects are more part of the game than they were before.||||||||||||||||||||||| DESIGN|||||||||||||||||Most of the armor sets and weapons look great, though many of the ones in low rank are very boring. The new armor system is simplified, but encourages varied gameplay. Meta sets are much less dominant, which is great for those of us that like to roleplay. The new gathering system and merchant NPCs make the game feel less repetative and allow you to focus on hunting monsters. The scoutflies are an amazing addition.The improved audio, visuals, and animations come together perfectly to deliver a long-overdue upgrade to the series. This game looks and plays much better than previous titles, yet maintains its distinct MH feel. This is how you make a game - great graphics do not mean a loss of stylization. Previous monsters breath new life, and new monsters have their distinct personalities.I feel like I am re-discovering Monster Hunter. This is what the game should have been from the start."

My personal experience, The mongrel Diablos, God I spent hours hunting him to get a kill/capture on him!Many times I wanted to just stop, But I just couldn't, You get sucked in pretty bad (Or atleast I do). : These can be really funny, Watching your friend get constant CC chained then proceeds to die can be hilarious, Grouping up can have its pros and cons:; You can all smash a monster together, You can gather materials together aswell it's a good experience all round in my opinion!; If you group up with a bunch of randoms, Sometimes they dont pull their weight, Either it being them doing no damage or them dying constantly causing the mission to fail and you lose all progress. It can be frustrating wasting 25 mins on a hunt for it to go down the drain... Thats the main con other than the one I listed at the beggining (Disconnecting)But, Overall I've got something like 35 hours on my character and I'm just hitting the harder content, Ive enjoyed every single bit of it. I highly reccoment this game! Its a fun game to jump on with a bunch of friends and even making friends!Hope you enjoyed this review and it wasn't toooooooo long!Happy hunting!Toshi~EDIT: Just lost all 190 hours of work due to a bug they haven't fixed yet, Theres absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I backed up the save files prior to now, I wasn't informed it was an issue so I did not backup anything.

Because this game was originally built for console, some controls may be confusing to use but there are easy workarounds if you find them. I would also say that the communication controls are a bit lackluster for a game that relies so much on coordination with other people. Many people have complained that some weapon types are confusing to use and can deter new players, which I agree. New players should definitely take some time to use the training area to test out different weapons and watch guides when needed. There are certainly easy and effective to use weapons as well as more difficult to learn but fun weapons that cater to a variety of playstyles. It also really helps to have friends to play with. It really enhances your experience when you find yourself working as a coordinated team with 3 other friends or strangers to take down big monsters. Happy Hunting!"

Pros: - A MH game that looks good- tweaks to classes that make them more enjoyable than previous games- being able to walk and shoot my LBG / HBG- no more zone segregation- no more tedious farming runs- much faster paced and fluid combat- multiplayer is much easier to setup- easier to organize gear and gear setsCons:- story is forgettable garbage- gear set customization is horrible- lack of monster variety- not very many maps- massive lack of endgame content (ie, monsters, gear sets, challenges, missions, expeditions, etc)- horrible RNG on gem creation (which also affects endgame and gear-set customization)All in all, this is a good game for newcomers to get into. The biggest issue is whether or not you played the previous MH games. If you have, the more prevalent these cons will probably apply to you. My biggest personal issue was that I could not find enough enjoyment to sink hundreds of hours into this game like I did in 3U and 4U due to lack of monster variety, missions, and no meaningful purpose behind expeditions.I've gotten to 200 hours on PS4's release.

1955,Dodowingster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dodowingster/,3,,1,"1,448.0",September,"18,",193,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a game, a brilliant and fun game.Everybody knows that Monster Hunter games have always been bad at their graphics. The game looks awesome and crappy at times BUT this is a  game after all, in fact this is the first Monster Hunter game that looks absolutely amazing compared to the older titles, where as looked more PS2 ish. The cutscenes might look a bit off as the camera tends to blur a face partially at times, but most of the time it's the handler.Let's be real here, MHW's visual and audio designs especially hitting monsters are  compared to the older titles, which includes blood slicing here and there. The soundtracks are pretty amusing to hear especially the elder dragon's except for Kushala....overall the OSTs are great but it still can't beat Monster Hunter Tri's OST....... Monster Hunter never had a story to begin with, but MHW fills the gap and it is not that bad. It's pretty nice got something here and there. The only problem with the story is....the handler, not because she's annoying (which she is) but the game fails to portray us players what a handler actually do....maybe not.....just patch her out and it's fixedUse Monster Hunter Language to avoid her annoyance....you are welcomeEvery weapon in this game is viable, and that's the fun part. I was once a SnS(Sword and Shield) main and never wanted to try other weapons, then I went to Charge Blade which can also block and works quite familiar with SnS. Then I change to LS(longsword) which turn out to be fun until.........................migod the weapon that I sh*t on the most turned to be my most favourite of all. The game also have dynamic environmental that you could interact with to gain the upper hand against the snorting Trex or other monsters. The simplest joy to wedge beetle and be the next spiderman that is PS4 exclusive at coral highlands is really fun....until Kirin hit you and you fell down.........There's not too less or too many monsters in the game but you will meet, a velocidodo, a puki puki, static squirrel, snorting Trex, married wyverns, married underground bull, flying lion, lightning horse, a cameraman, fluffy bat and a retarded jagras and many more. Wait I forgot to mentio- Boeing 52.......................... f*ckMost of the time it is the connection issues but they are fixed now. Still when you fight a Kushala or a Teostra, then beware for some FPS drops..... The keyboard and mouse controls are okay ish but the key bindings are a little messed up. Why does the shortcut are binded to F1, F2, F3 and so on? It's odd but can get used to but I rather 1~8 to be the shortcut.Overall I give this game a 7/10  if they add in G Rank with Lagiacrus my baby into this game then it deserves more than that. Most likely a DLC but its okay for me"

However, you are still able to play this game offline and enjoy the story mode. So, I don't understand why many people are upset about connection issues as the game offers both single and multiplayer gameplay. Personally, I haven't had any of my games disconnect and I played with a friend in Korea and I'm currently living in England. If you're looking to play this game with a group of friends then I suggest you wait until they stabilise the servers. Because other reviews have said that their is a online server issue. But if you can enjoy this game on your own, just play single player in the meantime. Trust me, it is worth it. I was only gifted this game yesterday and I am addicted. It's definitely a thumbs up for me, disconnecting servers isn't enough for me to leave a negative review on this game. I have an AMD R9280X and I'm still able to enjoy the beautiful graphics!UPDATE: Be warned once you hit HR this game likes to troll you. However, it is still fun until you get randomly dropped off right next to Odogaron or in a swarm of Girros'. GRRRRR! Still love this game though.PROS: - Runs better than PS4 MHW (DUH)- Visually stunning (Considering I have poor GPU)- Large monsters are ACTUALLY challenging (Definitely a pro, as easy quest games are boring)- Endless amount of gameplay and content- Fun times with friends- Cute customisations - Easy controller use (I use a PS3 controller)CONS:- The Handler - Not being able to connect online (very rarely happens)- Random location drops (Only happened at the start of High Rank)- Not being able to skip cut scenes. Well, maybe that bit is okay but not being able to queue in Quests w/ friends until you've all watched the cutscene seperately. (Really disturbs the MHW grind)PC SPEC: - CPU: i7-4790 (3.60GHZ)- GPU: AMD R9 280x- 16GB RAM"

No more connection issues, no from fps drops against certain monsters, raw mouse input has been added to the game, keyboard customization has been expandeed upon. Some of my other previous complaints can be addressed with modding. The only remaining thing that bugs me is not having DoF options and off course the UI still remains control centric. However, this is now a great game worth playing.-------------------------------------------------------------Review Update 8/26:A patch addressing the network connection issues was rolled out. This has greatly improved network stability, I have not disconnected except once since the patch was rolled out in the 30+ hours I've played since. However, I have noticed that I now fail to create online sessions (lobbies) every now and then. Not a big deal as usually trying to create a session one or two more time gets it through. I am not changing my review to reccomended, yet. There are other significant performance issues with the game and after 140+ hours and testing across two machines, the game needs an optimization patch. Certain areas of the rotten vale causes significant fps drop anywhere from 20 to 40 at its worst. Two late stage monsters have attacks that can cause significant drops as well and these two happen to be monsters you will be farming quite a bit of in the end game. Once in a while the game will also hang almost as if it froze for 1-2 seconds and in the middle of a fight this can be disasterous. From my experience, this is not common and has only been happening to me the last 3 days. There have been no changes made to my machines, drivers and so on. What needs to fixed:-FPS drops on certain maps-FPS drops against two specific monsters (that I've noticed so far) -Random stuttering -Need raw mouse input -Options to disable/enable motion blur and DoFWanted improvements but not deal breaking: -Better menus for keyboard and mouse -Ability to skip cutscenes -Being able to save your SoS/matchmaking filter preferences PC specs this was tested on (tested on both nvidia drivers 398.36 and 398.82):AMD:Ryzen 2600X @ 4.2GhzTeam Group 16GB 3000Mhz RAMGigabyte GTX 1080 MSI X470 GPLUSCorsair SF 600Intel:i5-6600K @ 4.4Ghz TridentZ 16GB 3000Mhz RAMGigabyte GTX 1080ASUS Z-170A Corsair HX 750 ----------------------------------------------Let me start by saying I absolutely adore this game. I put in 200 hours on the PS4 since it launched on that and stopped playing it in anticipation of the PC port. Unfortunately, while the game is fantastic, these rampant technical problems are a deal breaker. I'm still playing through bregrudingly in hopes that it will be fixed sooner than later. The frequent disconnects is absolutely maddening and there is no real excuse because no smart attempt was made to make sure this doesn't happen AGAIN. This happened on console but not nearly to the extent it is happening on PC. Why was there no public beta of the game like on console? This problem would have been discovered immediately and the launch reception wouldn't be ""mixed"". From another technical perspective, while I appreciate the ability to rebind everything, the amateur hour shows when it comes to the development team's familiarty with PC. The menus have not been changed for ease of navigation with a mouse and keyboard, there is no tool tips when you hover over something with your cursor. Inventory management with a mouse is not intuitive. Emulating a joystick with a mouse instead of giving us raw input is a mind boggling decision that anyone that has used a mouse before would not make. Not being able to turn off motion blur is another huge turn off. The game tries to overload the processor with 32 threads and most people are running 4 core and 4 threads, even those of us with 6 or 8 core processors and 12/16 threads don't cope with it well. I get a stable 60fps 95% of the time but that's only because I'm brute forcing my way through the performance issue with overkill hardware. Would I reccomend the game? If you already like monster hunter, absolutely, it might be worth coping with the issues as they are until it is resolved. If you are unsure about the game or you are unfamiliar with the series, for goodness sake do yourself a favor and skip it until it's fixed."

The problem , with any luck, will be fixed in time I am sure. That being said, the game looks and feels amazing. Playing it on the PS4 as long as I have, the Load times on the PC are MUCH better.  In the PS4 variation you could get up while your group was waiting for the pre level loading, and go make yourself a hot cup of tea and sit down just as the game finally finished loading and spit you all out on the map.  Here on the PC? Oh yeah, sooo much better!The game has a few challenging points... but trust me, once you start getting into the groove of things, the game still keeps that challenge but its fun , and when you start getting further into the game it gets incredibly satisfying when you win a mission.Edit: The Monkey Is Coming.

Low Rank hunts are pretty barren on Steam, I've come to realize, but that's negated somewhat by the new Defender gear designed to bring newcomers up to speed for Iceborne.

I'll update the review after finishing the campaign or after patches.-Windows 10 removed perfomance issues ingame. Stable 40-60 fps. Not sure about intro sequence or cutscenes. Pretty sure it's because of 388 nvidia driver, try it! Later patches improved performance.- You CAN play all the story missions in co-op with friends. Sure, they have to watch the intro cutscenes for them first, but they can abandon the quest itself afterwards and join you. But you gotta have friends, that's a big issue for me.- Low Rank quests are really easy for me. I got carted like 2 or 3 times total. And I'm using a new unfamiliar weapon class every day. But difficulty picks up a bit in High Rank and tempered post game monsters pose a reall challenge. That's cool!- Networks has been stable after patches.-People don't seem to communicate a lot.

The mouse acceleration or smoothening is a bit of a let down on PC when ""raw"" is the best way to go. Using a gamepad is a much more enjoyable experience IMO. You need a beast PC if you want to crank up the settings, don't even try to run many background tasks that utilize the CPU because of Denuvo DRM. Textures in cutscenes look like something from a few years ago even on best setting. During gameplay the world and graphics do look good, but it feel it could be better considering the kinda small zones you get to play in, it is 2018 afterall.

It's a truly immersive game world, and while I will always go back to the handheld titles for their unique qualities, this game will remain a great entry point for any new player. The coming ""Iceborne"" expansion will be more significant than any expansion to a game that you are used to, and the equivalent for previous titles has constituted a whole re-release of the game.

2002,Saph,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chiprw/,4,,1,674.5,August,"20,",505,0,1,"Held off on writing a review until I finished the story.First and foremost, there is something you should be aware of before purchasing:-The cutscene after the final story monster can allegedly corrupt your save. Simply back up your save beforehand to avoid losing progress. It's under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata[YOUR STEAM ID HERE]\582010\remoteNow then, onto the port. The game has run beautifully from start to finish on my little old 960 with a mix of medium to high settings. A solid 60fps ensured that every hunt felt incredible, from flow to mechanics to just enjoying the stunning environments as I bashed Azure Rathalos' stupid noggin in.Make sure to check your specs on the store page. If you aren't up to snuff then it's not a great idea to buy the game.As for the game itself, well.Monster Huter World is the most recent addition to the franchise, it boasts much higher graphical fidelity, greater quality of life features and most importantly, no zone transitions between areas.I went in blind on day 1 and immediately got hooked, taking out low rank relatively quickly and having a blast while doing so. From Jagras to Magdaros, every fight felt unique and challenging in their own ways. The monsters themselves feel much more responsive than previous games and some are pretty challenging if you haven't done your homework on them.As for gear, the team did a fantastic job of re-imagining the move sets for weapons. Adding in new combos and mechanics that make them all feel organic to the combat as a whole. I started with the trusty Insect Glaive which boasts a new aerial dodge, new attack animations for the ground and air combos as well as a new elemental/status/healing bug swarm for the Kinsect to summon. Once hit, the cloud of bugs will apply whatever damage, element or effect your Kinsect is alligned to and they can make for some great combo extenders and openers.About halfway into High Rank I switched back to my MH3U main, the Greatsword. Oh boy, the new greatsword... They added a shoulder tackle that you can use to cancel out of your charged swing or out of a roll as a quicker way to reach the new finisher that does some pretty big boy damage and feels incredible to land. The addition of aerial combat as introduced by 4 has been expanded upon too, when you jump off a ledge there's a brief window where you can hop in any direction when you begin the aerial swing which can be used to combo even the hardiest monsters into submission. Plus you can now charge your aerial swing which allows for greater damage and a higher chance of mounting the monster.There are a number of new mobility mechanics that make the game flow so much smoother than older iterations, my favourite being the slide. When you sprint or roll on a slope your character will slide down at incredible speeds. You can even use new slide attacks out of it and some can even be charged or have a follow-up move.There's also a grappling hook that makes climbing feel much faster as well as its utility in the newest addition to your hunter arsenal, the Slinger. This little wrist mounted crossbow type weapon can be used with any weapon type and has a ton of ammo types and the ability to grapple onto special grapple points in order to swing around some areas for quicker movement and a nice evasive/offensive option in fights.The slinger boasts a ton of ammo types, including things like throwing knives and various pods used in previous games. There are a number of other types that can be found in the environments including ones like: -Brightmoss, which glows and sticks to whatever it hits, useful for pointing out monster weak points to inexperienced members or just for lighting up dark areas.-Stone, becuse who doesn't love flinging rocks at monsters? Useful for drawing agro and knocking down certain flora which includes some other ammo types.-Scatternut, does a lot of stagger damage and can be useful for extending your friends' combos as they go to town.-Slinger Thorn, sticks to the target and can be hit to deal additional damage. Useful for monster parts that bounce some weapon types and for breaking parts in general.-Watermoss, deals a small amount of water damage and can be used to wash certain dirty monsters for easier damage. There are many more types all with unique effects and utility, making the Slinger an incredibly useful tool for hunting and exploring. Some more fantastical than others, but they all have their uses.Now for quality of life.The first thing I checked was item sets, these are useful for hunters that like to save time at the item box between hunts. Although for another point, camps also have item boxes now. You can enter your tent to change gear and access the item box mid hunt. To make them even more useful you can now eat at camp, meaning if you forget to get your pre-hunt grub on you don't have to worry about being at a disadvantage any more. Oh, and you can fast travel to your camps from anywhere on the map.Moving on, there's the item wheel. This handy little guy lets you quickly use specific items on the fly without cycling through your entire inventory. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this feature is a massive help to the Sword and Shield as it is the only weapon that lets you use items without sheathing it first. It also let's you use the slinger while it's drawn which is great for setting up combos.I also want to talk about how decorations and charms work now. Instead of the traditional points system, abilities now use levels. Say you have a Fire Res decoration, it'll just give you a level in the Fire Res skill when slotted instead of just 2/5 points needed for the first tier of the skill in previous games. Decorations also come in three sizes and as such, so do decoration slots themselves. Meaning the bigger the decoration, the more levels it will provide in the skill it gives.Charms are more or less the same deal, they give specific abilities just like decorations but now they can be upgraded depending on the type. These additions really streamline the skill system and make for a much easier time going for a build you want to use. Armour also functions in the same way, but now there are set bonuses on some sets. Unlike other games though, most don't require you to wear a full set, but rather just 2-5 pieces of the set. This allows for much more freedom without making it feel like a chore to go for specific setups.The verdict, All in all, I'm really enjoying my time with MHW. Connection issues aside it's a fantastic port of a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Couple that with Capcom releasing existing console events and DLC quests for free at a faster rate and you've got a pretty good deal in my book.I will say though that I do have a couple of minor peeves with the game. The first is that the faces look pretty bad up close and the second is the lack of unique weapon designs. Both very minor things, but they do detract a bit from my personal experience.I can't recommend the game enough to anyone looking for a fun hunting sim/ARPG hybrid. There's plenty to do in the game which makes it a great time sink too. Just make sure you can run it before purchase and all should be well.We even just got a patch to address the connectivity issues that were present at launch within the month of release, that's what I'd call consumer friendly.TL;DROnline can be pretty bad at times currently with disconnections from Steam, but the game itself is incredible and completely playable solo. It's well worth a buy in my book and I'm dying for more content already.If you like to hunt, or play good ARPGs, get it."

This isn't going to be up for debate when it comes to MHW, or Rise. I don't care what you prefer, it's your preference for a reason.That being said, let's get into it.(For the sakes of story progression, I am practically only giving the opening cutscene's worth of knowledge, as to save spoilers, because nobody likes those!)Monster Hunter: World drops you into the boots of your Hunter, an obvious, monster hunter. Aeyy get it?Your job, once arriving in the newest uncharted part of the world, is to seek out, slay monsters, and document the various types of endemic life in the area, all the while attempting to stop an encroaching geological catastrophe. This game is hard, and this game is unforgiving, but some people like myself appreciate, and enjoy a challenge.If you find that you are someone who really enjoys a specific sort of game where you grind for your progression, this game is a game that will captivate your attention for a long time coming. The graphics are beautiful, the soundtrack is incredible, and I've made many good friends over the years out of a shared interest in this hobby. The playerbase has slightly declined over the years, as it came out in 2018, but it is still actively thriving. You can always open up a server browser and look for active sessions, so finding people to play with isn't difficult. It DOES however, follow the Dark Souls law of the land, where if you are doing a main story mission, you can not have other players join you via the lobby system, or the SOS flare system, until you have finished watching all cutscenes pertaining to that specific fight, event, or assignment. (But this isn't a problem, and you will quickly come to learn how every single fight goes.)Thanks for reading! If you have any questions, leave'em below! If not, have a good one!"

With i7-8700k, 1060 6gb and 16gb of RAM, I had to lower my graphical settings to mid-low to alleviate the micro freezes/stutters. These freezes caused desync in multiplayer and made the monster teleport soon after to catch up. In singleplayer I got audio desyncs during cutscenes.I've enjoyed previous MH installments and I do not regret spending 60€ on this one but I feel like if you haven't played MH before, you probably should wait for a sale, or a fix to some of the problems we are having right now."

Maps are cool and their size is decent but you will have to revisit them often if you want to dive deeper into the game. That means they can get boring after few hundreds of hours or less even if they look nice and have a lot of detail. This game clearly has some grind because you will be hunting same monsters multiple times but there is large amount of them and you have different species. If you upgrade your gear and improve you strategy then you become a more efficient hunter.Then you have big amount of cool weapons to use. Large amount of cool armor sets that give you different stats. I am a cat lover who owns a cat so having a cat companion in the game was hype for me. There are fun crossover missions like Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy or The Witcher. The Witcher has 1-2 hours long story mission fully voiced by original Gerald VA. Other missions are more like special scenarios that unlock special skins. Try to google Monster Hunter DMC Charge Sword. It looks awesome.Today it's not a expensive game and it will provide you with a long and fun adventure. You will spend good amount of time playing it but once you finish the main story then it's time for your love to the game to shine. If you continue doing stuff you will unlock new monsters but that requires time and dedication. After you complete the story there are still many monsters to battle and stuff to upgrade. That means you have to ask if you like this kind of stuff and want to continue. Even me after 300 hours I still have few monsters I haven't batlled yet and I heard they are not easy. Good game and worth your time if you like this stuff. For such small price you will get a lot of content."

MHW is a great, well rounded game with plenty of character customization and satisfying combat. Few things are as satisfying as learning monster movesets and acquiring better gear, then absolutely destroying monsters that gave you trouble before. I get it, the movie sucks ass and it's possibly the worst way they could have represented Monster Hunter in Hollywood. But review-bombing a great game instead of the trash movie just makes you guys look like retarded kids who would lash out at anything around you."

2030,T.K.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/isuckatvideogames/,3,,1,491.7,August,"22,",301,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World is, without any hyperbole, my Favorite MH game to date. Bearing in mind, I had only every briefly played a small snippted of 4U (the demo) and I have put over 200 Hours into Generations, and I have also put 300 hours into World already on Xbox One, and if a game is strong enough for me to buy it twice then I feel like that is saying something.The gameplay is fantastic, weapons all feel strong and unique and I definitely struggle when picking one to main, all of the combo improvements and flow changes give weapons many might have considered ""clunky"" or ""slow"" a lot of new life and make everything feel amazing and fun. The monsters, even familiar and returning ones, feature interesting attack patterns and are genuinely fun to fight against (once you start getting past monsters like Kulu Ya-Ku and start fighting things like Anjanath and Rathian, thats when the game really starts feeling good.) Level design is also great, with the maps flowing really nicely with shortcuts and hidden pathways, and navigating them and searching them is super rewarding because more often than not you'll find a hidden campsite, or an upgrade for your Cat Companion, or good places to gather materials and supplies! With all of these positives, I do want to get some of my personal gripes out of the way, and the overall negatives attached to this game, so I'll list them off in bullet points: - A lack of weapon design variety. While I like the idea that we start with base weapons and upgrade them into unique ones, more often than not a weapon tree will only have 5 or 6 unique weapons models while most are just the base Ore/Bone weapons with animal skins lazily stapled on.  - A lack of Monster Variety.  There are only TWO lightning monsters. TWO ice monsters. And worst of all -- ONE SINGLE WATER MONSTER. A surprise when you consider the game features nearly FIVE MONSTERS THAT ARE WEAK TO WATER. It seems very imbalanced and it also just makes the lack of weapon variety more apparent when there's only a handful of variants. - The Story. Most MH games don't even feature a story outside of text-boxes, and honestly I feel like it should have stayed that way. The story is incredibly weak, full of hokey and pointless dialogue about ""aether currents"" and ""energy"" and all of this other nonsense. It's a very weak narritive to string together the excuse that you're killing creatures on a new continent.  - A lack of maps. This could potentially be solved with the addition of new creatures but there isn't a Tundra specific region, nor is there a dedicated water area, you fight the single solitary water monster in the desert. - PC Specific issues. Textures are just bad, and its easy to miss that on PS4/Xbox but oh my god are they terrible on PC. Pixelated, smudgy, even at max some textures just look rough and unpolished. Fixed with potential patches or fan mods, but we'll have to wait and see. Servers are also very flakey, though they tended to be on consoles as well, the problem is even worse here. Dropping out mid quest happens frequently, quests can severely lag mid hunt, and there's constant connection issues and errors, as well as a weird bug where if you disconnect from a lobby you can't reconnect? forcing friends to essentially rotate hosting lobbies. - PC control issues. Weirdly there's a mouse smoothing thing I noticed when attempting to play with mouse and keyboard. The controls themselves are fine, especially since its rebindable, but there's an acceleration put on the mouse to make it move in-game to that of a thumbstick which i found really weird feeling, and I wasn't able to find a way to disable it, so for the most part just stick to controller if you can. -----------------------------Conclusion-----------------------------This game is incredible, and despite it's minor issues I can still completely recommend it to anyone who's thinking about purchasing it. It is 100% worth it, and it is even better to play through with friends!"

Problem is that after 170 hours of play time game decided that it had enough of me and corrupted my save files. No warning signs, no nothing. Tried multiple suggested fixes but of course nothing worked. So, naturally, I contacted capcom support. After initial back and forth waited over a month for the reply for my last email (I guess some folks are slower than others). After even more back and forth I'm happy to report that so far I've got 6 template responses that's translates more or less to ""woops, sh*t outta luck,son"". The lovely lady at capcom support even remarked that doesn't matter how many times I write their official stance is to throw arms up in the air and leave the customers to fend for themselves. I guess, capcom values compliance more than persistence.So here we are - 30 euros (thank God, I didn't buy it on launch) and 170 hours down the drain. As for game itself, it was fun while it lasted. PC port is mediocre at best but than again most of these japanese ports are. Definitely recommend getting SpecialK mod because more likely than not the game will run horribly without it.Oh, and for the love of God, back up your saves manually after each play session. Steam cloud will not help because they don't keep previous versions of your save files and as soon as you close your game corrupted data will be uploaded. So make your due diligence because capcom didn't make theirs.With the Iceborne dropping in January (console release already launched, mind you) this might be even more relevant because I'm sure the base game will be discounted at some point before Iceborne PC launch.Lastly, I want to say I've never ran into this issue in my 20+ years of PC gaming. Maybe it was luck. Than again, I never have played capcom games up to now...Oh, and capcom name not being in capitals is on purpose too. I don't feel that company that is completely fine with shipping a product with such inherent flaws AND refusing any kind of support deserves to be in capitals, do you?"

2037,⎛⎛Lord Sithaniel⎞⎞,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Sithaniel/,3,,0,277.1,September,"1,",292,3,1,"I had an awful starting experience and played it during launch. I held back with writing a review because i tought they gonna patch these issues. But well they sure took their time! And they patched many of them just to introduce new bugs or reintroduce old ones.Monster Hunter got a solid gameplay foundation that exceeds as a multiplayer coop game. Its fun to slowly get better gear by killing weaker and then stronger monsters.Combat is incredible challenging and rewarding in the long run. There are lots of things to do and most of them are really fun because the game is definetly unique in its own way. Weapon variety is really good...until you play a couple of them. Some have barely any combos while others got a couple, but being it a game that has only a handful of maps and not many enemies to beat the amount of combos you can make is really really low. There are many different armors and weapon upgrades on the other hand but i rather would have prefered less weapons and a better focus on the balancing and combos as some upgrades are often more op in every situation. Also i dont seem any reason that some upgrades require very special parts which make you farm the same monster over and over again and you still dont get that part. Its less in this game, luckily you dont need rathalos plates for every crappy equipment anymore, but its still there to some extent. I dont mind if its a bit grindy, but atleast only if you know what you are grinding for. The game should tell you from the beginning which item has a % drop rate or even better by completely removing low drop rate items and instead give more items the bigger the monster was.The games difficulty spikes very hard. At one point you are breezing trough the game but keep failing at 1 specific monster until again you win easily. The last bossfight as an example is one of the more easier monster for some reason. Too many of the enemies have stunlocks or 1 shot attacks which punish mistakes harshly.This might be fine at a game where you can quickly try again but in monster hunter it takes a longer process to quit and start another quest. Everything is unnecessarily slow in this game. There is also no aggro system or in any way its predicable who the monster will attack. Im currently healing in some far away corner while my friend with a two handed sword is completely depleting its life bar. So suddenly the monster decides to turn a 180 and jump dozens of meters at me. This is problematic because some monsters have undodgeable/blockable abillties that are can only be known/dodged if you know its complete moveset by heart.At last there is something i personally found an issue with that is rarely mentioned. For a game that features collecting things and building it into armors or weapons the whole inventory system and ui isnt made out to sort the items successfully. This isnt a problem if you just rush trough the main story and keep using the same weapon but rather in lategame when you need to switch between fire to ice armor and so on. Making the player do their own costumized inventory tabs would have solved this issue or introducing a better sorting system. Even the best part is pretty much riddled with tons of issues. First it starts off being a coop game. Then the devs had the great idea to lock the coop in the main missions until everyone met the monster. Which makes no sense whatsover since you can just quit, restart the level after seeing the monster and then everyone can play together. So as a coop game it fails but when it works, it is indeed really fun. There is also a common connectivity issue that just kicks out all or or one player. People cant rejoin you after that and if you are fighting a monster with your friends for 30 minutes and one gets kicked out is an experience i dont want others to have. There is only a handful of maps. Those arent really as big as you might think they would but finally they fixed the levels by not making them into sub levels connected with entry/exit points but rather a proper level that connects smaller fighting arenas in a setting with liniar pathlines. Im not really a huge fan of these pathlines as they serve usually no porpuse than wasting your time with walking. I wished the arena system would have been scrapped . Otherwise the maps itself look really greatly designed and each arena is completely different and easily recognizeable.While the whole environment looks fantastic human characters as an example look really silly and cartoonish because of their bad facial gestures. On a technical level the framerate is complete garbage and even newest hardware has problems. The monsters really look great on the other hand. Their animations are well done for the most part but thats about it. Often the camera is blocked by the environment because some spots are too narrow fighting big monsters. Also lots of monsters are just bigger reskins of older ones. Thats okay for introducing a stronger variant of the older ones but the amount of monsters and maps for a full price game is just lacking.Soundtrack is very ambient but i rather prefered something funky or rock/metalesque while fighting monsters. I mostly use my own music and muted the ingame music very soon. The soundeffects of the monsters feel good as they have a good impact and especially if you use your weapons as they make lots of good special soundeffects that feel fullfilling.Completely crap. They shouldnt have invested so much money into the animations of some boring talking cinematics and instead did more to fix the issues with this game and add more content because it severly lacks. And if you say that the game has hundreds of hours of playtime to get everything. Yeah it does. But if would cut out all the walking sequences, cutscenes and reduce the life of the bosses you probably wont even have a 10 hour game.Back to the main story its a complete boring mess. I skipped all of the textboxes and only watched cutscenes and i still understood as much as my buddy did who read everything.Monster hunter world suffers from a lot of different issues, be it technical or gameplay wise. Having some weapon balance issues can be overlooked but getting kicked out of the session because of some connection errors on capcoms site can make the game really tun sour quickly. It doesnt help how they designed the coop nature in the main story campaign and how the story itself is rather boring. But monster hunter exceeds in challenging and a rewarding combat system, while not completely perfect, it is really fun. But i solely dont recommend the game because of the many technical issues the game has.6/10 Above average"

But instead of ignoring the movie on release date, they instead chose to damage a good games reputation simply because its 2020 and every one has to find something to ♥♥♥♥♥ and complain about.Actual game review:Great game, 14 weapons each with INSANE amount of variety for each one (Different monsters apply different effects towards each weapon in terms of stats, bonus effects and looks.)Crazy amount of Armour that can be used to mix and match in order to find a good game style for your weapon/overall style.Monster count is MASSIVE. The only way to get bored if you spam one monster over and over again because they refuse to drop that one item you need to finish your specific item in order to move on with your game and not spend hours and hours on grinding because the monster is a stingy piece of existing moving fecal matter.The grind can get boring a little if you just spam the same monster. But the game is 100% worth a try because it can turn to a 1v1 with you and a monster. to a 4v3 with randoms/friends against 3 monsters who hate each other and hate type of fuster cluck. At first it can be a little bit hard in terms of figuring out what weapons but the end result is satisfying once the weapon is found.Weapon Tips:Great sword: Massive Damage, Low mobility when in hands, can use block and kick.Sword and shield: Low damage (when compared to the other weapons) great attack speed, great mobility, Can block.Dual blades: Low damage, Great movement, high critical hits, 2 forms of attack.Long Sword: Decent movement and attack speed, Can punish monster hits when timed correctly, great range (can hit other hunters)Hammer: Slow and heavy damage like the Great sword, Can be charged up to attack harder, Can be used to stun or break monster parts.Hunting horn: Lower damage then the hammer, Can buff allies and self.Lance: Great range, decent damage, 3 attack in each combo. Can charge towards a monster to increase damage output, can block.Gunlance: Decent damage, can block, can use ammo in a limited range in order to provide point blank shots.Switch axe: Decent damage, decent speed, amazing elemental damage, can latch on to a monster and blow the weapon up in them, changes modes from axe to sword and back.Charge blade: Sword and shield with greater damage, slower attacks, can self buff both sword and shield components and combine to get an axe, sacrifising mobility for even greater damage.Insect glaive: Fast, great range, Self and party buff (I think), areal combos, insect companion to shoot monster with.Bow: Fast damage, great range, Can be used to debuff monster.Light bowgun: Fast movement, fast damage, can be modified in order to add bonus unique twists, Can plant mines on the ground or plant mines into monster.heavy bowgun: Slow movement, Massive damage, can be modified in order to add bonus unique twists, Can either go full minigun or a powerful sniper shot.I hope this helps someone and if I messed up with some weapon information I am sorry. Feel free to correct me in the comments (If you so wish) Otherwise Please do not let the negative reviews hurt this game because some people want to complain about a movie that was never meant to be taken seriously."

There's a range of weapons to choose from both melee and ranged, heavy and light weapons, Bloodborne style weapons that can morph into other weapons, some support weapons and even a weeb weapon (looking at you long sword). Each weapon has it's playstyle, Hammers bonk the head to Knock Out the monster, Hunting Horn plays songs to buff your hunting squads, Dual Blade attack at a fast pace, Bowguns attack from range using different ammo types... there's a weapon for every person who wants to play this game.Further into the game you unlock better and better gear which in turn allows you to easily create builds to either meta slave (Builds that make fights 10x easier) or augment how your weapon/playstyle works already. Attacking in the air a lot more? Deal an extra 30% damage from Airborne Attacks :D. The Base Game alone is honestly worth it but recently we got an expansion. Iceborne. Wow just wow. The xpac brought along a new game mechanic: The Clutch Claw. This has been a massive, massive boon to certain weapons (Hammer and Lance/Gunlance). The Clutch Claw makes fights extremely fun and faster pace than the base game. Along with the Clutch Claw, Iceborne brought along Master Rank (harder monsters to fight), more monsters to fight, subspecies of monsters and new zones, it improved on the base game tenfold and continues to do so with every update. :)If you can pick this game up for full price to support the devs, they deserve it.If you pick this game up on a sale, it's hella worth!If you have any questions, feel free to comment :DEnjoy the hunts, fellow HuntersSome Basement Dweller :D"

2059,Şmirgol Şaşlık,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ExSynth/,11,,0,363.8,August,"21,",99,0,1,"I waited for this game's PC release impatiently. What was delivered wasn't what I've expected.The main game was extremely short for 60€. After the main game you can start grinding and levelling your Hunter Rank to further upgrade your equipment and fight against the same monsters but with more damage. But the game quickly starts feeling extremely boring afer completing the story. It's not like the story was any good but you got to unlock new areas, monsters and equipment as you progressed which felt very rewarding.Sometimes like randomly when you try to slay an enemy one or sometimes even two large boss enemies will coincidentally pop out and meet up on the same spot. The announcement trailer showed how Anjanath and Rathian fought against each other. My experience is 80% of the time at least one of the two or three enemies will focus on you instead fighing each other even though during that they hit each other with their heavy attacks. Like:"""". So to me it is rather a nuisance than a feature. You can use an item that makes one enemy bail out but still an annoying and unnecessary game mechanic since you don't always expect this to happen. I am not sure about this but I also got the feeling that they aren't even damaging each other. Never occured to me that the monster I was hunting died or starting limping after receiving couple of hits from other large monsters.Tried playing Co-Op with friends. Can't really recommend. I don't know how exactly the game scales the difficulty with a party but the monsters became way more tankier and I was better off doing the quests alone. Esspecially because the whole team is allowed to faint at maximum up to three times. Some quests even allow less faints! Also as a closed ranged hunter 50% of the time you need to chase the monster since the AI very often changes its target and runs between them.Speaking of Co-Op. I was trying to help a friend since his savegame got corrupted and he had to start a new game. I wanted to carry him through the beginning quests quickly to where he used to be but technically I couldn't. I always got disconnected due to communication errors.The gameplay is really difficult at the beginning. Most weapons felt clunky to me. I decided to go with the longsword. The game didn't teach much. Looked up tutorial videos on the weapons. After getting used to it a little it was really fun esspecially the counter mechanic and mounting enemies. But there were still things that bothered me:I wished one could have more control over his character. I despise clunky gameplay and stuns and think it is really bad game design. I like to have control over my character and not being locked into slow animations. The only weapon with high speed are the dual swords but they are really situational due to their short range which I didn't like. The game could have been made more difficult in other aspects like more limitations concerning healing resources for example. Having less healing means in exchange for more swiftness and control. That would have been nice.I would recommend this game if at least:Everything else is still bearable."

I've written pages about the steps and missteps of the game in the past, but I'll skip all that here.  What I want to say is that with this final major content update, Capcom have given the game a great sendoff.Fatalis is an excellent boss battle.  It feels like the perfect difficulty, without gimmicks or tricks.  It can be fought solo or in a group.  The custom arena makes for an interesting setting, and the tools are provided to the player to make the quest manageable.  Capcom hit it out of the park with this one.With this update, the much-maligned tenderize mechanic has had its effect duration doubled.  While I think this should have been done sooner in Iceborne's life, they got it right eventually.  The new Shaver jewel also makes tenderizing faster for light weapons, again letting you focus on the combat itself.They rebalanced decoration drop rates, reducing the unrelenting grind.  Essential jewels are now meldable, making certain classes like bow more viable without early luck.Finally, mod support has been re-enabled without requiring workarounds.  This survived a bugfix patch so I'm assuming this was a decision made and not an error.  The game is better with mods so this is a welcome change.My wishlist of game changes is still long, but Capcom have been taking more steps forward than back.  With Iceborne's story complete, I'm now happy to recommend this game."

Constant communications errors and joining friends' quests is next to impossible.Update: Now that the communications errors that were present at launch have been fixed, the game can be quite enjoyable in co-op. Some design choices haven't been fixed yet and most like never will be. To play a story quest in co-op each player must first enter the quest alone, watch a cut scene, exit the quest (or wait for other players to get to your location), and finally re-enter with the party. In the long run this might be a minor inconvenience, but still something to be noted.UPDATE 2020:With Iceborn released the game has become unplayable for some people as the newest patch comes with a new anti-cheat system. PCs with slower CPUs might start to experience problems. In addition to the new anti-cheat system, some limited bounties now cannot be completed without purchasing the Iceborne expansion. I would avoid buying __JUST__ MHW as it has been kind of crippled with the release of the Iceborne expansion. People with slower CPUs might want to avoid buying the game or the expansion until the high CPU usage problem due to anti-cheat/DRM has been fixed.UPDATE 2020/12:CPU usage problems have been solved for some time and the game is still fun to play with my friends.  I would recommend this game for players that like the genre. My only major worry as a player is the end-of-service for the servers.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. loved it as it was the best time had spent with my Son since my wife had died.

I have been waiting since the console release for the PC release, and damn I was not disappointed. I didn't check any streams/reviews/spoilers and jumped straight to it at DAY 1. The servers were working only 2/3 of the time, but I played mostly solo in the beginning so I didn't really mind. The first two quests were pretty silly, I didn't pay much attention since they were irrelevant. But then the game starts to progress fast! Around the  mission, my friends hopped in, and damn doing this thing with three semi-geared people is pretty tough! I was so fascinated with all the kinds of armour and weapons the game has to offer! Every time I slayed a new monster, I returned back to the blacksmith to see what kind of new EPIC gear I can make out of it.  That was mostly the hype I already had for it, but even after 50-60 hours, the game was still so attractive.   Everything has a progression which is really interesting! Damn even the stupidest thing, like the Canteen that you eat from can be upgraded! Side quests are interesting and fun to do... most of them! Some are just to gather stuff around the map, others to slay some specific monster, just what sidequests are supposed to be!  Now... I won't lie. If you want to play Monster Hunter, be prepeared. You need to farm the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. You have to kill monsters multiple times in order to create weapons and armors from them, which is pretty reasonable in my opinion. If I had to kill every monster once or twice and be done with it, it'd be pretty damn stupid.   The main story took me around 80-90 hours without trying to rush it.   Would I love for it to have more or even endless monsters to kill? Sure! Looking forward to the DLCs if there are any!--Cons--   I SWEAR TO GOD, THAT ONE B***H THAT IS YOUR ""PARTNER"" IS THE WORST NPC IN ANY GAME THERE IS. SHE'S DUMB, ANNOYING, USELESS AND UTTERLY IRRITATING. I WAS STUCK IN ONE QUEST AND EVERY TIME I LOST AND RETURNED TO BASE, I HEARD HER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ VOICE. I HAD TO MUTE THE ""VOICE"" FROM THE ENTIRE GAME JUST SO I COULD BE SET FREE FROM HER. SHE'S THE DEVIL AND CURSE WHOEVER CREATED HER. F*** THE HANDLER. F*** THAT. IF SOMEONE CLAIMS THAT SHE IS THAT BAD, THE THE WHOLE GAME IS BAD BECAUSE OF HER, I WILL SUPPORT HIM.Since we're done with that, let's move to other, less important cons. Many people are complaining about certain things and I plan on adressing most of them:1. Graphics:  The graphics are not the best, but they sure are solid. This game has GAMEPLAY > GRAPHICS, which in my case didn't bother me at all. Please stop being obsessed with the realistic pristine graphics standard, it some times does not matter.2. The delayed release:  Guys, you knew it was delayed, Capcom said that they did not intend to release the game on PC and didn't want to release a rushed version but also not delay it too much since they are doing it anyway. Leaving a negative review and saying ""the game was delayed for 6 months"" is absolutely moronic.3. Keyboard/Mounse Issues:  The game is meant to be played with a gamepad (aka xBox controller, ps4 controller etc), just like Dark Souls or Rocket League or so many other pc games... the controls are not simplified just so mouse/keyboard users can have it easy. So if you don't like that, don't buy the game to begin with. You KNEW that a gamepad is recommended, if you ignore that don't come back whining.~TL;DR~The game is amazing if you know what you're about to play. Most bad critics imo are from players who didn't know what they're buying. The game is excellent for what it is. 100% recommended for either solo or co-op."

You will probably die a lot and you will probably spend a lot of time tinkering with equipment too  unfortunately this game does not clarify how these things work so for some who are looking for that hand holding, you will probably be unhappy to know that it doesn't do much of that for you. ..... and its lackluster approach to multiplayer matchmaking wont win any points either, especially with story missions where you cant join games unless you your friends and the host have seen all of the cutscenes for that particular mission can make helping others along with the story a very tedious experience for newcomers.getting past that though it has a huge community, and with time invested in learning your weapon of choice and understanding how to properly prepare yourself and learning how to dance around the monsters and breaking through the games steep learning curve there is a ton of fun to be had with this game. It heavily outweighs the cons in my personal opinion.It offers enough variety in customization with its range of weapons and armor customization along with decorations(a sort of materia-like gem slot system) which help you customize your hunter with a range of modifers to handle pretty much any situation the game has to throw at you.  It offers a solid challenge to players too, though the game makes you fight mostly the same 20+ish monsters which may sound repetative, but they iterate them and make changes to their strength and behavior depending on their size rank and temperament, their difficulty will also scale depending if your playing with other people online (which makes them pretty hard if you have 4 people) or if your set in a mission/investigation where you will have to hunt multiple monsters in the same run. for me, no two runs ever feel the same and its what keeps me coming back to the game. there is also something very satisfying about having the ability to topple a bloodthirsty monster that is more than 3 times your size."

The visuals are top-notch for a MH title, and never before have I felt so immersed in the world itself. The removal of zone-by-zone loading helps make areas feel vast and seamless, and the addition of endemic life and monster turf-wars was astonishing. Really makes you feel like you're a small part of something grand-scale.Unfortunately some of the biggest parts of Monster Hunter, namely the creature variation and weapon appearances are noticeably lacking in this installment. Compared to past titles in terms of overall content, this one is rather dry... so a long-term investment may leave some feeling underwhelmed by the end of the day.However, I feel that the level of immersion (and actual storytelling in a MH game?!) is something that shouldn't be overlooked--I was pleasantly surprised.

Monster Hunter World takes the battle mechanic that previous games had and improves it for the better, including some QoL changes as well, such as walking while taking a pot, infinite Whetsones, improved and added weapon combos, etc. Although it has great changes, as the time of this review it lacks G Rank, some old monsters and a Thundra map, but that is something that might come with a future update."

(updated at 1000 hunts!)Monster hunter is a hard to explain title to someone who's new to the series. Its mainly a co-operative ""thinking persons"" beat em up (although single player is possible). It combines that with a crafting system, progression via XP (Hunter Rank) and a LOT of customisation options for your character. It's not the kind of game where you make 1 build, limited to the class you chose at the beginning though, it remains completely open and you can change class/weapon/abilities on the fly between battles.The key premise is that your character NEVER levels up and gains abilities, you craft new armours, weapons and decorations which grant extra abilities instead. So you always have a kind of ""level 1 character"" but beefed up by his high level armour etc.If you are new to monster hunter this is the perfect entry point, it's a lot easier to play without making the game boring or too easy.  There's a challenge there for newbies and veterans alike, but vets have to wait some time after the main story for that challenge!Mixed reviews are not the best result for this game, which admittedly did have online connection problems for the first two weeks following launch.  Finally, do make sure you have slightly better than the minimum recommended spec as this game will destroy even the most capable PC on the highest settings (I have a VR rig and it pushes it on Max!)"

Basically - if you can see it move, you can capture and study it. This applies to everything from giant dragons to birds to even ants and tiny fish swimming in schools. There are even creatures and critters that only appear at certain times of the day!While in-game movement can at times feel clunky, i haven't encountered anything that severely detracts from the experience or is in any way game breaking. Setup with a controller (which is absolutely recommended to play) can be a little confusing at first, so here's how to disable Steam Big Picture mode so you can use the regular steam overlay while you play.Go to Steam in the top left corner of the steam client > Settings > In-game > Untick ""Use the big picture overlay when using a steam input enabled controller"".I also suggest disabling motion blur and V-sync in advanced graphics settings if you are playing on a high definition monitor. Now tech advice aside, once you start the game you are given language options. Scroll through the list of SPOKEN LANGUAGES and change it either to ""Monster Hunter Language"" or ""Japanese"" for the best experience, both with dialogue and cutscenes. It DOES have a dub (that most certainly doesnt seem low quality at all) but the lip sync seems to be aligned to either Japanese or Monster Hunter Language, and like any originally japan-exclusive franchise the game has exaggerated animesque body language and expressions.Is my review missing something? Suggest in the comments."

I have the platinum trophy.This game takes a while to get used to, but once you do it's really satisfying, and has a lot of content and replayability value. I've played through the game 3 times. Changing to a different weapon completely changes the way you have to play, so if you're starting to get tired of the gameplay loop, just changing your weapon will give you quite a big change. Certain weapons feel like you're playing a completely different game.It takes a bit of time and fiddling to get used to some features that will help you out in the long run - like the Radial Wheel menu. Using it will let you place bombs, traps, and use healing items nearly instantly, rather than having to scroll through a left/right menu for a few seconds. It'll really help your survivability and your effectiveness.Overall this game is a lot better than its predecessors on handheld consoles. The gameplay is a lot more accessible in this iteration.That's not to say the game is too easy now, it definitely has the same core gameplay, but it just feels better - because of the improved framerate and visuals. The amount of combos and different attacks available is much higher as well, from what I've played of the older ones. It just works better.Overall, this game is great."

This game is what It feels like; every hunt is thrilling and will keep you on the edge, no matter if you hunt solo or with groups.  It seems very difficult at first; however, if you're careful and understand the moveset of each monster you'll be able to deal staggering blows that feel extremely rewarding. Hunting a monster without taking any damage and getting in the flow of the hunt is pure catharsis.There is a great variety of weapons, and they all seem to come straight out of an anime, so don't expect much realism if that's your thing; melee weapons like greatswords that take seconds to deal a single hit from dual blades that devour your stamina to ranged weapons like bows that shoot arrows the size of your character and bowguns that can shoot like a minigun, there is always a weapon to fit your style, and they're all equally viable from early to late game so it's all down to a matter of preference, though some are more complex than others.The game is split in two parts: Low Rank (LR) and High Rank (HR). LR is where you spend most of the main story missions; monsters deal less damage and have less hp but your equipment is also weaker. HR is where true Monster Hunter begins; monsters have more hp and damage but this is where you start crafting your endgame gear.GraphicsPretty good, but it's heavy on the hardware and requires a better gaming PC to run it properly.SoundNo music while exploring the maps, it starts when the monster is attacking you; also becomes a cue to when the monster is about to sleep when it stops playing. Some monsters have unique tracks. Weapon sound effects are very satisfying, and it really feels powerful when you deal a critical blow.PlotBarely enough to justify your hunts, don't get into this game if you expect to feel something other than satisfaction while slaying monsters.ConclusionGame is fantastic, one of the best I have ever played. No microtransactions or lootbox BS except for a few cosmetic items (and even then, there are plenty you can get by just playing). Port is ok, had a few problems on release but they all seem fixed now.MH:W is the first game of the series that I have ever played, since every release so far was on a console that I didn't own. I always felt that I'd enjoy the series and I'm totally hooked; hunting giant creatures for ""research"" never felt so fun."

However after clicking Yes in order to continue I was mad to discover that all my progress so far has gone down the drain and now I have to restart from scratch including re-doing the painstaking character creation and re-watching the unskippable cut scenes - Groundhog Day style. It makes me cringe thinking that if I ever want to continue playing this game then I will have to restart from the beginning - I get that I have only played 17 hours which is small fry compared to other players who have lost their character progress after 50 hours or so, but still, 17 hours is a lot considering all the other AAA games out there that I could have completed in less than half the time.What kind of game in this day and age can't even get the fundamentals right? I have played many games from many genres over the years, and something as common as a crash to desktop has never required me to start from scratch due to corrupt saved data...until now. If this game is so vulnerable to saved data corruption, then the developers need to allow multiple save slots per character so that if your most recent save file gets corrupted then at least you can load an older save file and recover most of your progress. But this game is intent on putting all your eggs in one basket which is never a good idea for a game designed to take most players between 40 and 50 hours just to finish the story mode.This game is already a grindfest to begin with, but the allure of fighting new unique monsters and the journey of building up my character's weapons and armor in preparation for the final boss kept me going. However, until the developers fix this issue, I'm not willing to spend another hour on this monster of a game (pun intended) with the horrible idea lurking in the back of my mind that another crash might mean bye-bye to my character.**EDIT**I appreciate all the helpful comments here especially the one with a link on how to quickly back up the saved data using a script. If I have time I might start playing this game again and run that script each time I complete a mission (and have 10 different timestamped backups at any one time). This doesn't mean I find it acceptable that gamers have to resort to doing this just because the developers can't implement a reliable save feature. If this was a cheap indie game made by some unknown developer then I would have been more forgiving, but this is an expensive AAA title made by Capcom and I am shocked at why this sort of issue should even exist from such a major game developer."

The graphics are beautiful and the environments are diverse, from jungles to deserts to volcanic crystalline regions.The expansion is also genuinely excellent, adding in a bunch of new creatures, new weapons and gear, and a new snow area.If you enjoy challenging boss fights, deep combat and unique creature designs, this one is a must play."

2167,Berry,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DiscoGreninjaFrog/,No,,1,956.1,August,"20,",243,0,1,"It's been about 8 or so months since I've placed this review and been playing. This review will be updated slightly to reflect that. I definitely now consider myself a fan of this series.This being a completely new experience to me going in, I had just one expectation going in - sounding like this was an MMO-like title, I wanted to see if I could play with my friends. With all the current time I've spent in it going through all of the main story and a bit of the endgame, I must say that this game left me conflicted a bit. It goes from something so extremely fresh to me that these past few days I quite literally couldn't put this down, to just being beyond frustrated to various things that only a very few other titles managed to do. Yet exhilarating would be the main word I would use to summerize... for the most part. The premise is simple, alongside the story, which is simply you going out into set maps and tasked to hunt down monsters of all kinds using the tools and weapons available to you. It's progression based with rpg elements into it - but instead of improving your own character you rather improve the tools you use in the game in order to take down stronger threats later on such as your armor and weapons. Doing so generally requires you to constantly hunt monsters or gather gear until it's strong enough to get to the next part of the game. In regards to hunting monsters, you have two options to take them out which is either simply killing it, or using tools to capture it - however capturing monsters is not available to any monsters classified as an ""Elder Dragon"" which is more or less a boss fight in simple terms.While you may not get a lot of depth in the story department or maybe even some of the visual elements present in the game it is a complete beast to go into the gameplay mechanics, yet not hard at all to understand. When going into the field to do the main part of the game you're given a large open map for you to roam around in to hunt monster or to gather up materials for use. This game does feature an item crafting system, so theres a lot of field collectables to get in order to stock on supplies - it also has a feature turned on some items by default to automatically craft ingredients out in the field into items such as herbs into potions, really neat. To find your monster target, you generally need to search around the map to find it though you have a lot of tools to help you do so. The field all around you can potentially have tracks left by the monsters like footprints, gashes, or even various markings specific to that monsters left lying around that your scoutflies (essentially this game's version of a tracking system, which also highlights items you can pick up) will notify you of. You can interact with this in order to give a lead for your scoutflies as well as get some research experience on it, plus these are left around real time so you can actually use it to detect the general location of where a monster is located at. It's very immersive with just a really simple mechanic, a trend this game does in spades.You have a selection of 14 different weapon types (11 Melee based, 3 Ranged based) all playing very uniquely from each other to combat monsters with as well as your other gadgets like your Slinger (Essentially a slingshot with makeshift ammo), Tools (like mantles), and various combat items like bomb barrels. Monsters animate, react, and fight in a quite realistic matter and almost always can have various body parts of them chipped off them which can actually affect how they fight move, and so on. If you're in a party of 1 or 2 human players, you also have your NPC partner aid you in fighting which is a cat creature called a Palico. The other basic stuff you can expect from this kind of game is here and it's all up to you to use the generous amount of tools at your disposal to deal with your target as you see fit.This game has quite a lot of mechanics to it but actually playing it in action is very fluid, simple, and crazy addictive to use, learn about, and even strive to get really good at it as you thread through progression. There is some form of tutorials within the game to help you get started but this game is more on the side of letting the player figure things out and for the most part it works out really well.There really is quite a lot of great things to this game, but even the latest entry in the series that tries it's best to introduce new players into it still shows a bit of it's jank.For my problems with the game itself, some monsters come into mind in the subject of their attack range not being totally accurate to their animations being done (The monsters known as Nergigante and Diablos in specific) esepcially when a lot of the other monsters not having this kind of issue it can get really jarring going into those. Then theres a lot on info in the game that is very briefly mentioned or not explained at all like some weapon skills, various quests type, certain skills in how to proc them, the various buffs in the game either via items or skills to name a few that I ended up having to seek outside assistance for. Some of the smaller things include some missing oraganization UI elements - managing your investigations properly is one big thing for me, and the fact that loot drops is all RNG based so especially in regard to weapon/armor upgrade, sometimes all you can do is just keeping farming monsters until you get the part you need (Breaking specific parts to get specific items is also, up to RNG, again specifically with Diablos for an example with horns) - However to add a little tidbit even though bad rng is a thing this game does keep grind to a minimum from beginning and even a little to the end generally. Pretty much all the online issues and many of the PC port issues many people and I've had in the past has been fixed so that's great! There is some weird things still present like if you disconnect from everyone in the middle of the hunt, the monster you're fighting if there is one will still have multiplayer multipliers on them even though you're now solo against it although that's very likely intentional (still kinda sucks when the d/c was not intentional)It's unknown whether or not we'll get updated to consoles or if cross-play can even become a reality for this title. I'm also fairly sure we are missing a few, if just small cosmetic things, event items due to the fact we didn't get certain events played on the PC version when the console versions was the only thing there. Speaking of events, the special quests recycle every week which is something I've never liked at all. While it seems seasonal festival enables a lot of the special event quests to be active I never liked the idea of having to play a game on a specific time frame to access content I can miss - specially when a lot of the event quests in this game could be vital to character progression.It is most definitely worth getting the PC version now, if you don't mind having a slight delay on game content. Otherwise I'd still recommend the console version if that's something you're worried about.08/20/2018 - first posted review.04/13/2019 - updated, and still playing the game to this date."
2168,Midir,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MidirCuRoi/,2,,1,85.2,November,"28,",734,0,1,"Monster Hunter arrives in full force on PC! While it offers a few twists on the familiar MonHun formula, MHW is very much the classic experience but beefed up for current generation consoles and the PC market.For those looking to expand on their existing Monster Hunting experience, this game might feel a bit barren, especially compared to the most recent Ultimate and Generations titles released on handheld and console, however for new entrants to the franchise, this is very much the perfect place to start, offering a good variety of monsters and weapons to hone your hunting skills.All in all, MHW provides a stable and amazingly nice to look at platform for both it's current and future content and most fans of third-person action will have little to complain about with the depth and breadth of activities on offer here.Average Game Length? Milage may very hugely here especially given the random nature of certain drops, a staple of the series. A singular hunt can take anywhere from a few minutes to nearly an hour whereas completing the story of the game will likely take most players around the 30 or more hour mark if you aren't speedrunning.A Bit Like? Monster Hunter! More seriously this game really birthed it's own genre, but for similar titles try God Eater and Dauntless.Is It Fun? Absolutely. Battling huge monsters is a blast with or without friends, exploring the amazing environments, the satisfaction of finding that one loot drop and time-limited challenge expeditions all add together to give a hell of a lot of entertainment.Worth The Price? MHW does carry a full fat price tag of around £50 when not on sale and while it would be hard not to reccomend for the amount of time you can get out of it, it's worth bearing in mind that other similar titles can be cheaper if you're unsure of the genre, but rest assured this is a complete expereince with more content being added at a steady clip with no additional costs for new monsters or hunts."

As someone new to the monster hunter series, prior to World I had only played the first entry. I have had a really enjoyable experience and am really glad this game came to PC. Hours of Monster Hunting fun, multiplayer, customization, and just a ton to do. Many announced free updates coming down the line to add even more content to the game just sweetens the deal. I don't really know how this compares to previous Monster Hunter titles, but I would really recommend it if you are interested at all, its been a great experience so far. The only negative I have had with the game is the bad Capcom servers, but I expected that going in. They are working on the connection issues now, but my gut tells me even after there fix connections will be spotty.  Overall even with that one issue, I have had tons of fun multiplayer with friends, and I would recommend the game to  veteran Monster Hunter fans or newcomers alike."

2176,SoapyTarantula,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SoapyTarantula/,2,,1,199.7,August,"12,",798,0,1,"Let me preface this by stating the obvious, the game suffers from a pretty textbook case of ""console port"" syndrome. Performance isn't good and can hardly be justified. It has technical problems and for a lot of people it'll make your CPU run at basically all out for no good reason (my 8700k spikes to 50%). While I got used to it, if you want to use keyboard and mouse controls you may find it very awkward, especially the mouse. There is no direct input control from the mouse, its all emulating controller inputs; this means *very* noticeable pseudo mouse-acceleration, there are ways to combat it a bit but it will always remain to some extent.But I still enjoy the game.This is my first entry into Monster Hunter and apart from inital hiccups, I've been having fun. I  playing weapon or character barbie in any game (I picked up Escape From Tarkov almost entirely for the gun barbie) and this game has plenty. Once I found a weapon or two that I don't hate (I will never like the Greatsword) I've been having loads of fun just roaming outside the town and hunting whatever I may find. The game really makes you feel like you can take down any beast you can see, no matter the size.The game does not really make it clear what the information it gives you is supposed to mean. Sure, this weapon adds 10 Affinity, but what even is Affinity? How is elemental damage applied? Is it per hit? Is it a chance on hit? The game doesn't explain a lot of things to you, and most of these things are things I'd expect any other game to tell me more about. What is attack buff (M)? Is it better than attack buff (S)? Be prepared to Google a lot of things, or have them explained to you by someone that already has.I had a lot of my own self-hype ripped apart by my introduction to the game, but I still believe its a game I'll be putting many hours into, and with any luck CAPCOM will try to solve the port issues soon."

Kinda clunky, grindy and very difficult, yet rewarding and enjoyable experience.Edit: Took me around 32 hours to beat the final boss. Still really enjoying myself. Network play is an issue to an extend I guess, but after getting connected to friends' lobbies, it seemed to mostly work fine for me.

The story element is actually not so bad, and pretty wholesome. Pickle is still a SOB, Bagel has the best music in-game, Palicos are actually useful now. The game is BEAUTIFUL, expeditions are a treat because of it. the co-op is pretty damn good, I kindof wish there was a way to know which optional quests you haven't unlocked in-game, but I love that the game doesn't hand-hold you through anything.

My 5 year old PC chugs a bit here and there but I'm playing just fine and the load times are a lot faster than on the console.The only cons I can think off is that it lacks proper PS4 controller support and the modular visual approach on the weapons is a bit stale and boring sometimes.

The whole Monster Hunter series is amazing through and through and the fact even after two years of release they've added an expansion for it called Iceborne as well as several FREE title updates that includes festivals and even more monsters is simply amazing. You can easily find yourself putting over a 1,000 hours into the game. I played it on PS4, and just recently bought it again for PC and still absolutely love this game. To put this game in the simplest of terms you go around killing monsters and using those monster parts to make armor and weapons from which you'll use to go hunt and kill stronger monsters which you again will use their materials to craft even stronger armor and weapons than you had before and repeat. The only really grindy aspect of the game that may put people off is when you get towards the very end of the game, BUT by that point you'll already be well invested into the game. If you've never played the series at all I would HIGHLY recommend giving it a shot. If you're ever struggling at any point you can shoot up an SOS flare that will allow other players/hunters to come and help you with a quest. The whole Monster Hunter franchise is easily one of my top 3 favorite franchises, so I very much so recommend this game."

The coop experience is not exactly great at first since each player must see their cutscenes separately, but when there is no cutscene involved (after seeing them all or doing minor quests), it is great.I would personally recommend watching the weapon showcase series  and then watching a gameplay with those you liked -- if possible one where the player actually is good (just type ""MHW + the name of the weapon + TA rules"" on youtube)."

I also feel comfortable in knowing that after purchasing the game it can be played offline as well even though it might be difficult to kill endgame monsters alone. This was my first entry into the Monster Hunter franchise and now a comfort game for me. Easy to get addicted to since how this works is that you fight strong monsters to get stronger weapons that help you with stronger monsters. The game at least has a bestiary and information on drops so if you don't have access to a stable connection you don't need it to find information on monsters. The game is cute, charming but difficult and at times unforgiving with how the monster AI functions and yeah having to tenderise a monster for critical spots can be tiring but it's a minor inconvenience. Please please PLEASE try the game out if you ever wanted to get a taste of what Monster Hunter is all about, the price is really worth the experience and the DLC is practically a whole new game. Most of the DLC after that are cosmetic which a good chunk (but not all) can be earned in-game anyway as well."

As a power house of man you smack monsters in the face with a giant hammer, you hop around like annoying fly using insect glaive, shoot them with a gun bigger than GAU-8 Avenger, or you just became an indestructible mountain and make a kebab using your lance and shield.And all this feels so satisfying, because every successful hunt is well deserved. You want to slap monsters like Jerry slaps Tom, then you have to work for it. Every new monster is a challenge, tough, but fair. But after few tries, you'll became stronger. You'll study monsters moves and use them to your advantage. You'll utilize a new move of your weapon understanding it little bit more. And after hundreds of hours of fun, you'll be that power house who just wipes floor with most of the monsters.Behind that, there is another game. Game of tactics, careful preparation, studying weakness of each monster. Building gear with skills that suit your play style to max out your potential against that feared elder dragon looking at you across the mountain.Monster Hunter has been my favorite game series for many years and Monster Hunter: World only reassured me in that view. I can only recommend this game, and I always will. It can be overwhelming in the beginning, but it's worth it! Poogie for life!"

Even though it HAS a multiplayer, the servers are utter garbage and random disconnects aren't anything special anymore. Added to that comes the fact, that if you're playing with a party of 2 or 4 people you're at a huge disadvantage in MP, since there's no real scaling for the monsters. It's either single player, or MP ""difficulty"". So no matter if you're 2 or 4 people, the monster will be exactly the same.And difficulty regarding the scaling is basicalls:- HP increase /which doesnt really matter)- the fact that breaking parts takes usually 10 years longer than in SP, so most of the times you kill the monster before the parts break even though only hitting  one specific part. (Looking at you Val Hazak)- Insane damage increases for the monsters, up to where you can get oneshot by any attack no matterhow much elemental def or normal def you have.There's probably a lot morethat I forgot, but it is just frustrating.I really like the game, and I really want to have fun in MP, but this game just isnt fun in MP, and sadly not very hard in SP. In the end it's still a decent Monster Hunter, but I just can't recommend it.EDIT:WELL, I guess it's time to edit this review. While it wasn't a pleasing experience at the start with lots of internet issues, it surely turned out to be a masterpiece once those problems were fixed.Lots of cool monsters that got added with the updates, fun events and even sieges with other players.

Learning the moves the monsters make and also there being a lot of depth with each of the 12 weapon styles that are in the game (each of which have a lot of variants, cosmetically and gameplay wise). Monster designs are very unique, fantastic effort to make them feel realistic and are excellently animated. The story is ok, I wasn't really there for the story and the game was brilliant either way. But I think the real selling point to the game I don't really know how you would not like the sound of using a gigantic Axe that can transform into a sword that is powered by explosives to fight a T-Rex that breathes fire. I played that one mission 14 times not just because I wanted to grind that monster but because it was a fantastic experience each time, and I got better and better at it.To those who have played a monster hunter game before; This game doesn't have nearly as much endgame as MH4U, and for that I am very sad.

Story is alright but nothing too fancy just like the other games. I play on a prebuilt crap ACER desktop with a 1060 and get very good game play. Anyway here are my thoughts:[Pro]- Good Graphics and animation- Balanced in a way so even if you don't have friends MOST quests are solo-able.- Lots of even quest to gather good weapons, armour, and items. As a Great Sword user, with the proper augmentation and gems, the Wyvern Ignition Impact which is obtainable thorugh a event quest is very very good.- No pay to win- Fulfilling when you beat a elder dragon for the first time- Very interactive field. - No cancerous online players who chat crap or talk crap about you[Cons]- Some quests are definately harder to solo. (Eg, Kulve Taroth, Behemoth, etc)- Shop seems kinda lacking so I use a mod that allows me to buy great potions and flash pods which are otherwise a pain in the ass to make if you want to do a lot of quests in a quick succession- Great Sword designs are mostly all the same - Some weapons types are better than others imo- Not beginner friendly at all. I played MH before so I knew basic stuff but if you're a beginner, you might have a difficult time figuring things out. One thing that is very annoying is weapon combos, The practice range doesn't show you all the combos so you're better off watching a YT video.- Once you beat everything, it's kinda like, what now? (Guess this can go with all games) I help my friends out tho.- Have to watch all cutscene before someone or you friend can join or reply to your SOS call during quest,- Sometimes Glitchy. When I play with my friend, whenever one of us dies, our screen freezes for a short time.- Some times, monsters are a bit glitchy but it rarely is a problem.- Hate pink rathian's running around move where she constantly knocks you down repeatedlyOtherthan that, its an all right game overall. Will 10/10 buy Icebourne when it comes out even thought I can kinda guess what monsters will come out XD."

I've been anticipating the PC release of this game for quite some time, and it did not disappoint. The game is not without its flaws: network problems still exist, although drastically reduced after the most recent patch; monster pool is significantly smaller than former games; every once in a while, certain monsters' attack will case a frame drop (Teostra's supernova), although that could just be my PC; mouse and keyboard controls are apparently not good, although I just use controller. But as a whole, this is a great game. Monster design is still rock-solid: new monsters are fresh and don't just feel like reskins of older monsters, and classic monsters look awesome. New features like the SOS mechanic is a very welcome addition. Autocrafting is extremely useful. Controls, with controller, are set up well. Weapon/Armor reworks made certain aspects of the game more simplistic, but not overly so.

2239,Jeb,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066063886/,2,1,1,521.3,August,"12,",200,0,1,"I recommend this game mostly to those who are newer to the Monster Hunter franchise. Veterans will be disappointed. Anyone seeing that the reviews are ""Mixed"" and 50% of them are negative, it's entirely because of the ""broken"" multiplayer. I have not had a single issue with the multiplayer so far and I've played well over 12 hours with friends. Not recommending a game because of a miniscule part of it that is a non-issue is honestly baffling to me because you could, instead, not recommend the game because it doesn't live up to the expectations of the other games but puts out in many other areas.Arbitrary ratings that I will explain:Combat: 7/10Story: 3/10Content: 6/10Port: 5/10Monster Hunter is simple in both the name and combat. The title of the game is ""Monster Hunter"" and your objective in the game is to literally hunt monsters. If you've came for combat that's refined in almost every aspect, this is the game for you. At the start of the game, past the intro, you have access to all weapons. There are a total of 14 of them: Sword & Shield, Dual Swords, Greatsword, Longsword, Hammer, Hunting Horn, Gunlance, Lance, Bow, Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun, Switch Axe, Charge Blade, and Insect Glaive. With other games, a large catalog of different items usually equates to many much similar playstyles, however in Monster Hunter over the past 14 years, they've refined and perfected each weapon to feel and play extremely differently, including even the bowguns. Because of this, you can enter the game, play through all of the content, and play through it again with a different weapon, forcing you to evaluate when & how you need to attack and when to play it safe. The only drawback with the newest installment, Monster Hunter World, is that for some weapons they have become extremely powerful as the tools in their kit have been increased while others have only had minor tweaks, falling much farther behind other weapons. However, you can still as easily play through the entire game with even with the objectively worst weapon in the game and only be slightly behind the pack. What doesn't make this a 10 is the monster cast. Playing as both Bows, Switch Axes, and Longsword, I never felt any challenge against any of the monsters or it, instead, felt artificial. Normally, the most annoying monster to fight in the franchise has always been the Diablos as he charges and charges and charges while his shoulder checks are the size of the Pacific. Though, in this installment, he didn't seem to have that same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ characteristic I always gave him. His mischievous behavior felt tame in comparison to the older games, including even MH4U. It's almost as if they turned the dial down from ""Normal"" to ""Slow"" for World. Even outside of this, the only times I've ever felt threatened was when I get chained by a monster's combo, but even though it was my own mistake and I should have carted, I didn't. The story has never been the strong suit of the game. It's CapCom. In some of the older games, the lack of story didn't feel like a downside to the game at all as your goal as the player is to rise up in the ranks of the revered monster hunters and defeat the beasts that plague the lands. With all of the cutscenes, dialogues with NPCs, and overarching story, it feels arbitrary. Had it been the small tidbits of information we got through quest info or talking with the NPCs only briefly, I wouldn't feel the need to even grade this because it's obvious that's not one of the areas they were focusing on. I will say one thing that does help its grade: the voice acting. Some of it is bland, but all of the main characters have conviction, sound fluent, and even some of the dialogue was (not much for the better) changed to be a bit more western. It's a good shift that I think is underappreciated by many. Back to talking about the story: it's trying to shove it in your face all of the time. There's always the Handler saying the same line over and over after each mission you complete, if you're farming for a weapon or armor piece and there's the massive objective pins. It's easy to get lost with the real game when you start entirely because the story NPCs keep shoving it in your face that ""YOU HAVE TO DO THIS QUEST NOW!!!"" I don't want to spoil the story, but it's honestly not that much to talk about anyways.I hate to give this anything under a 10. In the earlier inclusions of the franchise, I refer mostly to Monster Hunter Freedom Unite as that is the game I played most, there was always G-Rank. There are three ""difficulties"" in the game that are categorized as Ranks. You have: Low-rank, Hi-rank, and G-rank. Low-rank is entirely to get you used to the game and find what weapon you want to use. Some weapons aren't that great in this section but in the newer sequels to the game, they've polished this up. Hi-rank is to ease you into G-rank. It begins to show you the diverse cast of monsters that are difficult both with damage, attack patterns, and mechanics. Closing towards the end of Hi-rank, you begin to fight Elder Dragons, which are effectively the bosses of the Monster Hunter franchise. This includes the: Teostra, Lunastra, Kushala Daora, Kirin, Fatalis, Alatreon, Jhen Mohran, Dire Miralis, and Dalamadur to name a few. Each monster feels different and some even have sub-classes like the Oroshi Kirin or Rusted Kushala Daora which change some of the core mechanics of the Elder Dragon to make for a new twist on the beast. However, without G-Rank, you are left without the ultimate difficulty and, personally, the way the game is meant to be played. You can first see this in Monster Hunter Tri where they decided to ditch G-Rank and stop at Hi-rank, leaving the ""ultimate challenge"" to be the Alatreon, which was an interesting fight for sure, but not a proper way to leave the difficulty scale. As the games forged onwards, G-rank seemingly kept being ""delayed until a further date"" because they couldn't finish it in time. For a game like Monster Hunter World, this makes perfect sense as they could actually have good graphics as opposed to the seemingly 144p of the handheld consoles. However, after 9 months of the base game being released, along with an article saying that the PC port will ""launch with G-rank"", there is no G-rank. For those who don't play past halfway through Hi-rank, this doesn't affect them in the slightest, which is supposedly most of the community. Even without G-rank, the game still stands with a decent amount of content as the monsters feel diverse, even though they don't feel threatening. Each monster feels unique, each with their own gimmick and they play around that gimmick. A lot of other people talk a lot of ♥♥♥♥ about this port, which is well received, but in opposition to them, I've NEVER had an issue so far with multiplayer. No dropped connection, lag, anything. The controls feel wonky, the mouse has an emulated console camera acceleration that makes it feel awkward."

2248,Friend,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pussypix4free/,46,7,0,308.2,August,"29,",331,15,1,"I want to preface this review by stating that Monster Hunter is my all-time favorite series of games like... ever. I think across the board I have something ludacris like 14k hours total, yes, even the lil spin-off titles and whatnot. I won't waste a lot of your time, and I will try to make my review look pretty so it's not just a wall of text. The list will mostly be for people who are new to the series. Those that are grizzled MonHun vets can look to the section below the bullet points.I hope this review helps! :DThere is plenty I might have neglected to really speak about above, but for the moment, those are the biggest positives and negatives about the game, coming from the standpoint of someone who has played the previous titles and basically slaves away on these games. Hands down, this game is BORING. I found myself 100 hours in, really pushing myself to find something to do. I literally had no direction at all! The game drops you off at the end of the story, very low hunter rank, and just basically tells you to sniff dirty footprints and lick mucus until you find the tempered monsters.From that point on you will be rinse and repeating the same monsters you've fought throughout the entire game, except they just hit harder. It's actually really disappointing. Monsters like Xeno don't even come close to real end-game monsters from previous games like the Fatalis or Rajang. It's slow, telegraphs everything like it's in slow motion, and sucks gigantic balls. In previous games, you got into G-rank. That was where you put hair on your gooch and fought the monsters that really were absolute hell to take on 1-1. Suddenly you are facing new monsters you have never seen before and boy do they either move fast and slam you hard or they have really nifty attack patterns you have to learn to avoid taking a beam of some elemet to the face, vaporizing you instantly. World just... LACKS all that high-class stuff that separated good hunters from REALLY good hunters.If I can make one big comparison, it would be Glavenus compared to Anjanath. In Generations, this was a t-rex with a really sick twist. This bigass freak had a bladed tail it could run across its jaw to heat it up before spin dashing at you. It had flair, personality, style, and was a really cool monster to fight all around. Anjanath on the other hand is like Glavenus' stupid little brother that has allergies. Not only does his ""fire breath"" come out as a lame sneeze, his design is much less WOW than Glavenus. It's simplistic and uninspired, which I guess kinda fits World's narrative for being ""more realistic"", but then again they throw in ♥♥♥♥ like Teostra and Kushala just to get old fans of the series rock hard, so that all goes out the window.I think the thing that was most infuriating to me personally was the weapon/armor designs. I found my friends on Discord asking me ""What weapon/armor is that?"" because the designs are so flat. In all the previous titles, the armor and weapons you created from monster parts really expressed the personality and design of the monsters they came from.I ran out of characters! D:"

Levels are fun to explore and it is exciting to find monsters and the new world in the beginning.Weapons are interesting and differ enough to make the player to want to try them out. The fights are, at times, too slow for my taste and the tedious sheath mechanic to use heals, sling ammo, utility etc. is just annoying and tedious.Monsters mostly have super obvious attacks and they don't really differ that much. Flying in attack, spinning tail, swipe, charge attack. Repeat, reskin. The difficulty in this game comes from the absolute necessity to be skilled enough to set up your attacks & combos in addition to predict the next move so you can hit the monster with a big bang.It's an ok and unique game"

There's so much to do and so much to learn, so this game singlehandedly occupied me through the 2020 quarantine. And even after finishing pretty much everything, I still keep coming back just because the hunts are so fun. The monsters you meet are always challenging, but never unfair.  The weapons handle unlike any other game, and feel extremely satisfying.To get the most out of the game, I suggest:- Try out a lot of different weapons, there are 14 for a reason.- Take your time progressing through the story. After hunting a monster for the first time, check if you like the armor and weapons you can make from its parts.- Either have someone who can explain mechanics (ask me if you like), or be prepared to research them. There's lots you want to learn, in and out of combat.- And most importantly, DO NOT use 'Defender' weapons or 'Guardian' armor! They only exist to make you skip the base game and buy the expansion quickly, by being much stronger than all base game items you're able to get.Oh, and Iceborne is just as great as the base game. It starts after MHW's endgame content, and comes with a complete story, followed by its own endgame. Don't bother buying it until after you finished all base game content and want more."

2259,Kharne,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dain3/,2,,1,572.8,December,"11,",290,0,1,"The current review bombing on this game is completely unjustified and just plain stupid. I write really rarely reviews for games but I had to stand up against this massive influx of BS.To counteract I will just deliver some background information why this review bombing is happening:In the new released Monster Hunter movie someone stated a bad joke which (why ever) insulted a lot chinese people, which in return see it as their sworn task to damage this IP somehow. Ultimatively resulting in angry folks redirecting their anger in the most pathetic way towards this game...Now, let me explain why this game is actually great:The game itself is a very smooth transition of a series from handheld and nintendo consoles to a truly beautiful experience on pc. It sure takes some time to get adjusted to it`s somewhat initially felt clunky combat system. but after a while you start to adapt and to learn how to manuver correctly and to use the environment fluently. Leading into a wonderful symphony of fighting massive monsters in astounding environments. Sure the areas are limited but very diverse in appearance. This together with loads of content and a very diverse weapon pool you can sink hundrets of hours into this game before you actually get bored of it.The core mechanics of this game consists of the monsters itself and the loot they provide. Loot which in return is used to craft better and better gear, like armor and weapons. Despite its simpel core mechanics, it feels heavily rewarding.The story is nothing to focus on to much and represents the weakest part of this game. Monster hunter games where never known for good story writing anyway. BUT if you are looking for a captivating game to spent hundreds of hours solo or even with your buddies (4 players give the best expierience btw.) and don`t mind a little grind here and there and that the story is somewhat flat. Then you are here spot on!~ Oh, and a very important tip of mine, use a gamepad. It makes this game so much more accessable."

Controls are surprisingly good, coming from the handheld series to mouse and keyboard.Online also works surprisingly well, with making and joining groups a breeze after you get the hang of it.ConsNot as hard as older titles. Much less content (32 large monsters compared to 70+ in handheld games).Handler can be pretty annoying (I eventually muted all voice acting by about mid-game).The decision to make viewing the cutscenes mandatory before a friend can join your hunt in story quests is a bit of a pain. All in all, I'd recommend it for the experience alone. It's an impressive title that builds up its environments exceptionally well. The quality of life changes make it easy for people to get into it, even if they are unfamiliar with the series. Iceborne will remedy my gripes about the low monster count a little, but paying the price of a whole extra AAA game for DLC isn't worth it, for me."

I played Monster Hunter before, with 3 Ultimate on the DS and got similarly addicted this time. But I had an even greater time with this game. The fights are intense, and getting stronger feels incredibly rewarding. Being able to play with friends or randoms so easily makes it even better. There's really not a lot to be said about the game, but it's basically just boss fight after boss fight, to gather materials and become stronger. The becoming stronger and more skilled part is the most satisfying, though. Being able to shred through a boss within minutes that was able to easily kill you just 10 hours ago feels so good.

2266,Shep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shep_elma/,2,,1,362.8,July,"6,",562,0,1,"Veteran hunter, I've been around since MH3U, and have played all of the titles released since then, including the MHFU port to iOS. I say this because there are some comparisons between this game and previous gens that are necessary to properly critique this entry into the series.I was super duper hype for Monster Hunter World, to the point that I play it both on PS4 and PC. I prefer it on PC since I get to have a little more control over it than I do on the PS4. Spoiler alert, I don't recommend it on PS4, but if you have more friends playing it on PS4, get it for PS4, it's still really good, and the stuff I say below still applies. The real meat and potatoes of MonHun. Quality of life changes have been made out the wazoo; it's never been a better time to be introduced to the series. Gathering was streamlined, inventory space has been made far more spacious, and the armor skill system was simplified so that it's not a complicated mess. Combat is nuanced, to the point that you'll want to go and watch an Arrekz(?) Gaming or GaijinHunter video to properly understand your choice of weapon. The learning curve is high, but it's incredibly rewarding once you pick up on how things work. More in-game tutorials would be appreciated, but frankly it's still a huge step forward from what it previously was. 9/10You don't play Monster Hunter for the story- you hunt monsters. The Handler looks star-y eyed at pretty locales, won't let you skip cutscenes, and generally slows down the main gameplay loop. There's some INSANE lore if you go back and look into the official art books, and look at the landscapes of MH4U, but MHW doesn't really offer much. It takes place on a ""New World"", which is to say a big ol' island nobody's colonized or documented sufficiently. Don't expect to be captivated by anything new or unique. 1/10 There are some bumpin themes from across the series. These ones are good too. If you don't like the music, you can turn it off and just play something on Youtube in the background. 7/10 The graphics of the previous games have all been compared to PS2-era graphics. This is an apt comparison. The graphics of MHW are a monumental step forward, with lots of attention and detail put into individual nooks and crannies of the world. The monsters are high-def, the views are spectacular, and the faces of all humanoid characters dip into the uncanny valley at a rate that makes me wish I could always hide my eyes. 8/10The total playtime I've got for this series as a whole is somewhere in the 2500-3000 hour range. I've dunked maybe ~150 hours in total on MHW, with 100 of those on the PS4 version. I blame this disparity in time sinkage partly to the fact that previous titles were on 3DS or Switch, which are far more portable than my heavy-ass desktop computer. I also attribute the lack of hours this gen to the . The Monster Hunter dev team gets huge kudos for putting out such quality content that has me always coming back for more, but I'm more than willing to wait another year or few if more monsters get developed, tested, and churned out. Monster Hunter World is a good game. I've enjoyed it, and I'm playing it some more to fully appreciate the last of the weapon types that I haven't solo'd my way to High Rank and beyond with. It's far from perfect, and there are some aspects of this entry that I feel lack the luster I've come to enjoy from previous titles. But it's something I always try to recommend others try, if only so I can do some hunting with them too. I heartily recommend this game, and hope that the Iceborne expansion brings us some fresh-ass content."

2277,Snoob,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Snoob/,2,,1,221.4,January,"2,","1,808",0,1,"Ever since I picked up a copy of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate for the Wii U in a desperate attempt to get a game for the system that didn't suck, I've been hooked on the series. This is a franchise that, historically, will take you on an adventure, obfuscate a ton of things that are probably vital information, and, most importantly, ask you to take down giant monsters with comically-oversized weapons so you can make armor and more weapons from their corpses. It turns out that the name is a bit on the nose, you could say. And then comes World, the black sheep of the family and the most polarizing member of the whole shebang. But I'm getting a little ahead of myself.In Monster Hunter, the player's job is to... hunt monsters. Big surprise there. Choosing from an arsenal of 14 different weapons, each with their own crafting trees to explore, the job has a few core tenants. First, scouting the area is important, both to find your quarry and see what parts of the environment you can use to your advantage later. On top of that, natural resources are important for your continued progression, and should be harvested when possible. Next comes the actual  part, as you go toe to toe with a motley assortment of beasts ranging from ""somewhat oversized iguana"" to ""a veritable mountain that threatens to eradicate all life in the world"". Yeah. Power creep's pretty high, but the game starts you out small and makes you scale up slowly (sometimes a bit too slowly, honestly). Rarely will you feel out of your depth, even if you might have to look for some guidance every now and then.The biggest selling point of World, in my opinion, is the improved combat system. Monster Hunter has always felt a bit... clunky. And while that was its signature style, going to World just feels like such a breath of fresh air. There's a freedom of movement that feels so liberating, like you're an actual person and not an entity locked into place while performing a variety of actions. The addition of the Slinger and grappling capability have made delivering payloads like incapacitating Flash Bombs more streamlined, but now the monsters are a bit smarter about things and eventually learn to close their eyes (or something) at higher tiers. Damage numbers are a nice quality of life feature, even if I turned them off once I got more comfortable with the weapons' rebalancing, and so many tactics that you used to just have to know (""Hit Rathian in the face"") feel less like hidden stratagems and more like things you can learn through natural experimentation. Most importantly, though, with a mouse and keyboard, using a ranged weapon no longer feels like hot garbage (although it's still a little clunky).Capcom's MonHun team have also been hard at work adding more value to this game ever since it launched. Much like on the console versions, it feels like every single month adds something new, whether it's a monster, new sets of armor, a limited-time festival, or all of the above. This all comes completely free of cost to all owners, allowing everybody to stay on the same playing field, and makes it sting a little less when it was announced that the ""G rank"" equivalent (effectively a ton more content, and traditionally a seperate game entirely for this series) would be a paid DLC this time around not too far back. This has given it a lot of additional mileage in my book, and I keep coming back to World to check out the new content despite being technically ""done"" with it in record time for a game in the series.No game is without flaw, however, and World has one or two, especially if you're a returning fan. It's incredibly obvious that the series moving to an entirely new engine meant that all work had to be thrown out and done from scratch, and so a lot of fan-favorite monsters didn't make it back, at least not yet (but despite this, we have enough room for 4 variants on the same skeleton in the form of Rathian, Rathalos, and their variants...). Each of World's existing monsters stands out on their own decently, but without classics like Nargacuga, Tigrex, or Zinogre, the game feels like it's missing some important icons that would look amazing in ""true"" HD. Furthermore, there are several points where the game is clearly just throwing busy work at you to pad it out, whether it be needing to grind Hunter Rank to get the ""real"" end-game quests unlocked (more egregiously than the series usually resorts to, at least), a multitude of quests which seem to exist just to show off a monster you'll have to fight on the next one, or (and this one is the most egregious) a point where you have to goof around doing other quests for a while while marking tracks for unknown monsters in order to unlock the last few you'll need to complete the game by fighting the ultimate big bad.If this giant wall of text has scared you, here's my summary: Monster Hunter World is the perfect way to get into Monster Hunter as a series, especially if you've been turned off in the past by how esoteric it is. While it makes me somewhat anxious that Capcom may simplify the formula down more further down the line, World effectively acts like a much-needed booster shot of modernization, a teaspoon of bitter medicine that many fans may just need to swallow. It's become one of my go-to ""Do you have this yet?"" games to suggest for co-op, and the only reason I don't have more hours is because the back half of the year had so many excellent releases I needed to play as well.Plus, you know, there's still Generations Ultimate on the Switch if you like the old formula more."
2278,RiderRonin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067266942/,2,,1,699.3,November,"22,",574,0,1,"Alright so I wanted to throw my hat in the ring after reading a good chunk of reviews and comments for this game. I may not have the highest hour count on THIS particular game but have been playing Monster Hunter since the dawn of it's first day so it's my most played game series hands down. I have a huge love for this series but haven't really had a chance to voice it until now. I am going to voice this from the point of a new buyer who has never played the series before and at the end voice my old hunter geezer opinion.This game is one hell of a ride if you have the right taste for it, it is diffenitly one of those games that apeals to a certain group of folks. So I can't blame anyone who just doesn't vibe with it because it's one of those games that you bash your head against a brick wall till it breaks. Yes this game is a bit softened up for the newcomer which is great, many people I tried to introduce to this series before either stuck with it or ran away. The more new blood the better and I had even singed up to take on a new hunter and teach them the game (this group was the Adopt a Hunter program if you wanna check it out). Once again I understand that this isn't for everyone but I hope this helps.Pros:Beautiful game with great graphics, lighting, sound and music can't go wrong there.A healthy variety of monsters, locations, quests and side bits to do.Great pool of weapon choices that can fit a play style for everyone and revamp it's game time by switching things up.Armors have unique builds of a matching set or even throwing random pieces together for flexability.Open area exploration (not a true open world) with large map spaces with secrets and resources unique for each place.Group hunting that allows you and three more buddies to gear up and quest out even in the ""story"" side of things.Constantly being updated with more fun stuff including monsters and soon to be areas.Cons:Can feel like you are bashing your head against a brick wall, steep learning curve that can be overwhelming.Weapons can look identical when upgrading until hitting the higher end of it.Side options can feel rather weak and uninteresting like fishing or small animal captures.The grind can be a pit when it comes to gathering monster resources overall a big time sink if you don't like the grind.Rather short in a Monster Hunter game senseBig boi review:Alright lets tear into this and start by diving into that learning curve a bit more since my Cons are pretty short and heres why. The curve is the hardest part about this game, as is with all games this hits you with a combat and knowledge curve. Figuring out how to use your weapon of choice against any and all monsters can be tough since each monster is different. This causes you to figure out paterns for the monsters attacks to see where you can fit in a slash or two yourself, and can be frustrating because it may seem your weapon just isn't fast enough to hit and keep up with your target. So you already have a tall glass to handle when it comes to learning the monsters attacks and your own but just to bust your knee caps some more lets add to it. The other shopping list you need to know is things like item combos, food selections, elemental strengths and weaknesses, weapon sharpness, armor skills, map knowledge, resources and their locations, ect. Added on top to this is the fact that this game is a grind, not in a level up sense but more in a ""Get the right things to build the thing"" way. If RNG isn't atleast sneezing your way than have fun running that monster fight a few more times, to infinity and beyond! This is the hardest part about the game but this is where I am going to turn it on it's head, ready? That's the whole point. Much like many sandbox survival games where in you are thrown into a world with little to no knowledge and you just start to throw yourself at things to see what happens. This is the same way except you can't build a tiny starting house into a castle of awesome, YOU ARE THE TINY STARTING HOUSE. It's going to start you small and kick you until you figure out what works with what THIS IS THAT TYPE OF GAME. I am putting heavy emphasis on this because I want to make sure you understand what you are in for! I like this kind of game it makes you feel like an underdog, a small speck on the world but you transform into Big Boi McGee king of all that is ass kickerie. This game isn't very story powerful either, though this is the best attempt they have had through the whole series. So in all honesty there is little to hold onto to keep going unless you are the type of player who likes the power grind. Even after all this is said the game tries it's best to tell you how pretty much everything works. Each time you run into a new feature it gives you everyones favorite thing, reading material. But it does it's job it shows you what that new feature is, how to use it on a basic sense and then just leaves you. This includes weapons, there is a whole training area with cliffs and dummy barrels and even a full combo list to help you get a feel for the weapon in every base environmental way. You will also notice that if you really start chewing into this meal that there really isn't allot of fat. Sure you can go a city block times a country mile of play time with this game but it is rather lacking. The monsters are only really a okay scoop instead of a double scoop of raisin bran or even a triple from the past games. As cruddy as this is it's nice to know that they are making new content including new areas and monsters for us to handle.Grumpy old hunter time:From a long time player spot this game is still fun but lacks so much content wise. The quality of life improvements are a grand thing but makes it 4 ply soft for an already skilled player coming back into this. I also have to recommend the PC version of this overall, yeah it had a rough start but I played this on xbox too and that had the same issues at the start as well. PC is also only a sliver behind in terms of content updates from the consoles that soon it's going to be word for word with it anyways. I mean if you have more friends playing it on a console compared to PC than by all means play with them but if you don't have friends who play this or just don't care either way than just swing for PC. The fact that there still isn't a G rank miffs me, for those who don't know G rank is the big daddy level of difficulty that normally comes with a good wallop of monsters and fun times.The verdict:I think anyone who really gives it a good ol try will enjoy this game, even if they aren't super into the grindy game type it might just have them turn coat about it. I highly recommend you get this game, but if anything in this review or others you may have read or watched still has you on the fence just wait till a sale if ya don't like it not a big loss. I give this game an easy 8 outa 10 even with my grumpy old hunter self not feeling a HUGE challenge anymore doesn't mean I don't get a kick outa this game still."

2280,⎛⎝ JR ⎠⎞,https://steamcommunity.com/id/schroedter/,2,,1,593.7,September,"2,",736,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is exactly the same great, gloriously addictive game on PC as it’s always been.Since the console launch there’s been a whole slew of updates and content additions, and PC players stand to benefit from these changes. Lots of the content is still yet to roll out on PC, but it's looking likely the PC version will catch up with the consoles eventually. It’s also the best place to be for higher frame rates and resolutions, particularly when the PS4 can dip below 30 frames per second on occasion. Visually though, there’s really not much to distinguish playing Monster Hunter World on a PS4 Pro compared to a top-end PC, aside from the frame rate. Ultimately in an action game like this though, frame rate is incredibly important, particularly when trying out last-second dodge rolls or attempting to time your counter-attacks. Performance isn't anything to write home about it but it's decent enough, although the taxing CPU demands could occasionally cause a few dips.Most importantly though, Monster Hunter has never truly had a home on PC before. It’s a series that has blossomed from underground sensation to monstrously huge hit, and yet only now has Capcom decided it’s worthy of coming to PC. Fortunately, the wait has been truly worth it. MHW is the single biggest shift in the series’ history, modernising the experience, adding plenty of quality-of-life changes, and finally breaking free from the shackles of handhelds.It's a fantastic game and a decent port, although the mouse and keyboard support currently leaves a lot to be desired. It feels as if mouse movement has been mapped to analogue stick movement and it's just awful to control. Make plugging in a console controller or remapping some of the default controls your first priority for a smoother experience.Arriving eight months late on PC, everything that can be said about Monster Hunter World already has been. Rest assured though, the wait was indeed worth it. Anyone looking for a deep action game they can potentially invest hundreds of hours into need look no further. This is Monster Hunter, back and better than it's ever been before."

Instead of trying to change everything to fit you adapt to the games controls it'll happen eventually. A lot of people want to change them but they never try to just adapt to them like any games control scheme I can understand wanting to have some things be much easier to do but your fingers will learn and it won't be such a stiffiling experience then especially when you develop muscle memory.2 - On release the port was meh it did it's job and has it's functionality boom done (wording it for past tense because they're going to fix the PC port I don't see why they wouldn't but will change if they don't but even then it's really noothing to get bent out of shape for). Furthermore no PC port is ever perfect and this game isn't any different. The game IS NOT A BAD GAME by any means it's a a fantastic game with a meh port but can steam read that? No so you get thousands of neg reviews that pretty much are boggled down to  - Lack of some visual options - Connection issuesPersonally not affected by Denuvo don't care about it, Visuals are pretty solid some textures don't look great but when 90% of what you do is fighting monsters you never really have time to notice or see the texture flaws especially since the camera itself isn't on top of your character and is decently far back for you not to notice but i'm assuming they'll be fixed if not like I said earlier you don't really notice or atleast I don't. Connection issues I've DC'd twice out of my 80 hours so far 1 DC per 40 hours pretty much, I played mostly solo and grouped with friends on occasion and popped some SOS flares every now and again.Personally as someone that's played previous MH titles this one sets itself a part is is a ton of fun to have, the game will be fixed it's only been 4 days since release at the time of making this review. In my opinion most of the neg reviews are people getting bent out of shape over multiplayer like they're not going to fix it.........well ofc they are going to fix it why wouldn't they. Would I reccommend this game? Well my play time speaks for itself. If you wouldn't enjoy jumping onto a dragons back stabing it's eyes in and then taking your massive Great Sword and slamming it and ripping it out of it's face causing it to fall out of the sky to your fellow hunters or maybe you enjoy a much more lucrative approach setting traps poisoning the monsters favourite meat with various types of ailments. What ever kind of playstyle you want to go for in this game, it has you covered."

2293,Helmic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Helmic/,3,,1,445.4,August,"16,",518,0,1,"It's an absolutely brilliant game, the most fun I've had in a game in years, with even its most complex and fiddly bits seeming to have real purpose in either driving long term satisfiaction in progression or pacing the game to space out the adrenaline-pumping highs with quiet or relaxed moments where you just need to sharpen your weapon, heal up, and then track down that boss monster again to continue the fight.It's also a game that gets some very critical things wrong in terms of usability, with multiplayer in particular showing the game's online heritage as a Nintendo exclusive.  To have a friend join you in a storyline mission that has cutscenes in it, you must first start the mission, progress far enough in that mission until you have seen all the cutscenes (which can take as long as 20 minutes to accomplish as you'll often be told to find something with limited direction before the relevant cutscene plays), and then you ahve to  and then recreate the mission again so that your friends can join.  Oh, and all your friends have to have seen the cutscene as well themselves, so they all have to be doing the same thing, no exceptions.  This means that playing with friends in anything other than postgame content almost prohibitively time consuming, and since the main campaign where all these shenanigans occur can easily last you 40-60 hours (I'm 90 hours in at the time of writing this review and I still haven't beaten the main campaign yet) a lot of people simply will never reach a point in the game where they can just play the damn game with friends.And that's assuming your connection keeps up.  For what seems to be a peer-to-peer game, everyone I play with suffers from constant disconnections despite clearly still being connected on Steam and on Discord.  Players who are disconnected are then forced to face a boss that's had its HP boosted quite a bit all by themselves. And if you fail the mission because of that disconnect, any resources you spent trying to boost your rewards like vouchers (you get only one a day and can only hold up to five) or investigations are destroyed.Oh, just to make things worse, those scarce vouchers and uses for your investigations are also used the moment you post a mission, whether or not you start it.  You often have to remake a mission because other players can't join it until its remade, so get used to having to choose between your friendships and your willingness to part with your last voucher.  It's needlessly vindictive and punishing for a game that's overly fond of crashing on many people's systems, there's no good reason that those vouchers couldn't just be spent the moment you get your rewards.But I still recommend the game.  It's not in as bad a state as the original Dark Souls at launch, and it's an utterly brilliant game.  It's hard to know what to gush about first: the sheer variety in playstyles afforded by the fourteen different weapon types that all almost play like unqiue genres of games, the exquistiely paced boss fights that alternate between quiet tracking and gathering and loud and bombastic combat, the loving detail put into everything that makes the forests sway in the wind and interact with your hunts or how a Tobi-Kadachi will leave those marks on the trees you find by using them to scratch itself in a lovingly rendered animation, or the massive variety in weapon and armor assets that all have their own niche uses that give you an excuse to collect them all and theorycraft new hyperspecialized builds meant to play a specific role against a single boss, or how item-only progression fixes a lot of problems with level-based progression in RPG's by removing problems like overlevelling or shoehorning you into a specific playstyle forever...It's so hard not to gush about the brilliance of the game, and that makes it so much more painful that the port doesnt' quite do it justice.  It's not even that bad a port, my game has only crashed once in 90 hours of play as I'm using a CPU with FMA3 support - an AMD FX 8350, a CPU that generally doesn't do very good in games but holds a steady 60 FPS at 1080p with a GTX 1070, I can only assume the game's been multithreaded competently.  There's rebinding options and graphic options and little touches that make it clear real effort was put into the PC release.But the parts where it does fail hurts the most, because Monster Hunter is very much a cooperative game at heart and a game with such brilliant interplay between a team and a monster that could easily combo anyone to death that makes one wrong move just doesn't deserve the disconnects, the crashes, the performance issues on different PC's, the horrible UX problems for playing together, the mean-spirited wasting of vouchers and investigations when it's the game that messed up.I still recommend the game.  I still want people to try it, even if it's only for that two hour refund window, because Capcom has promised to support this game and I think people can still love this game despite its serious flaws.  There's just been so much love put into this game that you can feel, the real appreciation for having all these systems interact to create what can only be called fantasy nature porn.  There's what seems to be dozens of lengthy animations of cats cooking you food in the most flamboyant way possible for what amounts to just a buff, thousands and thousands must have been spent just animating that alone.  There's too much effort here to just dismiss it entirely.If the game works on your machine, if you have friends patient enough to deal with the need to use what are effectively even more annoying Friend Codes in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Steam game, if you like Dark Souls-like combat systems, if this game seems interesting to you, this is probably a game you'll want to pay full price for.  But if you're unsure, wait a few weeks and see if these issues have been addressed."

However, you have one advantage that stand above them all: You're much SMARTER than them.To find victory and complete your hunt, you'll have to be patient, diligent, but above all else: You'll need to be VERY observant. Skill is optional if you can cleverly utilize your environment, such as knocking down large boulders or luring your prey into bigger, much nastier baddies.If these qualities are not your cup of tea, you will not like this game very much. Otherwise, you'll be addicted and won't stop playing it.The gameplay aside, the story has an innocent and carefree charm, where you play as an agent of a research team that simply wants to know how these monsters tick-- Even if they have to ask you to open up a few of them to find out exactly how. Then, on top of that, the charismatic personality that each monster has is another thing that will draw you into this game; from self-indulging, long-tongued birds and mud-loving puppy-dragons to literal fire-cats and a later ravenous dragon that can't stop itching itself.Even then, you can always just kick back and enjoy the enormous meals the inhabitants eat every day, or maybe catch a few water geckos to put into your personal home.If you're willing to allow yourself to get sucked into another world, you'll greatly enjoy this very aptly named game: Monster Hunter ""World""."

2314,Helel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pyrovore/,2,,1,588.5,December,"11,",137,0,1,"MHW is probably the best entry in the series so far. The quality of life improvements and updates to combat make the gameplay so much better than previous games. I love that I don't need to waste inventory space with whetstones, pickaxes, & bug nets. The new monsters are unique and fun to hunt and the equipment looks great. I'm very glad that they added armor transmog. I adore the hunt locales, they're all breathtaking. Compared to previous games, it's much easier to learn how to do everything, and I was able to learn how to use weapons I struggled with much faster and easier than before. It's definitely a great starting point for anyone new to monster hunter to get a taste for the series. That all being said, this is probably my least favorite Monster Hunter game I've played so far. While combat is lot faster and more fun, the non elder dragon hunts all felt very samey and boring pretty quickly. Besides a few amazing songs I overall found the soundtrack to be kinda meh. Hunting monsters for decorations was far more tedious than the talisman farming of past games. The addition of the clutch claw made most of the fights a lot easier and more formulaic.I'm totally stoked for MH Rise, and I hope they bring back the Mizutsune and/or the Lagiacrus."

2330,Clearly,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ClearlyTM/,3,,1,80.0,August,"29,",256,0,1,"Am not experiencing connectivity issues since the Aug. 23 patch, a very solid multiplayer experience. My internet speed is 14MB/s down, 5.5MB/s up. As of this review, I have 25 hours on the game, and have done an upwards of 100 multiplayer lobbies. So far, I have DC'd in the middle of just 1 of them. Only 1 of them and this is from a pool of 100 multiplayer lobbies. I would say they have fixed the connectivity issues, but I am just one opinion of many. Others may feel like this game is just as broken as it were when it first launched, but I say this is a very enjoyable game with friends and strangers alike. Aside from the connectivity being fixed, this game is jam packed with a variety of activities to do in the many zones avaliable (I'm just 25 hours in and I feel like I'm not close to beating the main questline yet). Missions range from killing small creatures, to zone bosses, to arena with bosses, to time attack, to open world exploration, to a lot more. As you play the game you unlock more missions that not only let you discover new materials for new armor/weapons, but some of these materials can be used to upgrade the quality of life things at the main town.Gameplay is fun and extremely engaging with both the environment and players (the game heavily rewards those who explore the world rather than those who rush through the game). Utilizing the environment to gain the upper hand, when defeating bosses will make the fight a lot easier. Using the SOS flare to get people into your quest/expeditions not only enhances your experience, but challenges you as well. Movement is fluid and feels very much like dark souls, where you would do 1 2 strikes and roll out of the way and do more 1 2 strikes again and then roll out of the way. If you're feeling confidient, you can do your hard hitting attacks that would leave you vulnerable to incoming attacks. There is such a thing as ""animation trap"", where if you do an attack or action, you would be stuck in that attack or action animation until the animation is done. This is very important because it forces the player to be smart with their actions, so its not just a mindless button mashing hack and slash game. The community is helpful and will try to cooperate with you. From my 100 multiplayer lobbies, I have not ran into a single troll. Those who join you to aid you will actually aid you.Lastly, controllers arent required, but would make your combos a lot easier to do. I've found little to no issues with keyboard and mouse, however keyboard and mouse do require you to be more precise with your inputs to achieve what you want to do."

At time of writing I have had absolutley no issues with crashes or frame dips.  Capcom have acknowledged the connection issues and are supposedly addressing them.

2347,Sailor Darkness,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrimsonChick/,No,,1,743.2,August,"17,",379,0,1,"Original review reflected state the game initially launched in. I no longer get nearly as many disconnects to the point I believe it may be fixed. I'll be changing my review to a thumbs up.The game is absolutely beautiful and even though you go through the same island hundreds of times it never gets old. There's always a sense of wonder/adventure and if you look hard enough you will find something new! The story of the game is kind of meh (maybe due to translation, maybe just trying to keep a lower ESRB rating) but the gameplay itself can help with that. You might go through one canyon one time and get obliterated by some monsters, so the next time you decide ""well maybe I'll try this cave opening and see where it goes, maybe I can go around"". I find myself talking to my Feyline companion a lot of the times when in uncharted areas or when theres a very powerful monster around. You sort of get the sense even though you're out on ""quests/investigations/expeditions"" you are the master as well as player of the story unfolding in the current zone. The Zones, animals, and even armor/weapons are for the most part beautiful. Some of the monsters seem to follow a theme which I suppose makes sense, but personally I wouldn't mind some more outlandish looking ones. The elder dragons in the late game make up for it though. The map of each zone feels very natural but at the same time is structured in a way that makes you think decide mid sprint which path is the best to take to get to where you need to go. It can be missed in the heat of a chase, but the scenery is so well done you truly feel like you're in a desert, forest, highland range, etc... The weapons and armor range from bland to so beautiful you want to stop everything and just farm for that partcular thing. They truly shine towards the late game where you have everything unlocked, so don't be disappointed if every weapon you are using looks like a plain metal/bone weapon with some locks of monster hair glued on there at first. :P That will change! Speaking of grinding, the last thing I want to mention is that this is the only game I've played that understands what kind of game it is - it understands its a grind and embraces it. In games notorious for grinding, which are still decent-great games, you feel the grind. You dread it. In this one, you crave it. You want to get back out on a hunt. Even if its for a monster you've killed 100+ times you want to go back and bash it's face in with a powerful weapon you just made as payback for the dozens of times he killed you when the two of you first met. Don't let that idea spoil the your expectations for the first kill of every monster though. It will be the toughest part of the game, and you never lose that sense of accomplishment all the way through. Even while you're leveled up and bullying the once terrifying monster, you think in the back of your mind that not too long ago the situation was reversed. The ways to go about encountering that monster are very versatile and you can set up your own quest and prepare (or jump right in) and gather party members to help, or even go solo... However, I prefer dropping into a player's quest who has shot an SOS flare. I like feeling like I'm helping out, and, truth be told, I'm a bit of a showoff so I like lower level players to look at my armor/ weapons and be amazed at how well and how cool I look lol. I'm not a fan of the X/10 ratings system or anything like that, but I will say if you like adventure, if you like character creation and customization, and you dont mind having to use your imagination for a story you can get lost in then this game will provide you with hours upon hours of enjoyment. (Friends to play with make the game interesting and play a totally different way, but it's in no way a requirement. You can have fun just playing solo if that's your thing.)Original review follows:--------Wait until they fix the multiplayer connection issues to buy. The best part is playing with your friends or shooting an SOS flare to have people come help you when the battle gets too intense. You cant do that if you get an error message that can't be fixed until you restart the game, and then your friends have to create a new lobby because it's bugged from your error code. I'm betting it's Denuvo because nearly all multiplayer and cpu usage bugs can be traced back to that POS program. I'm no game dev though so whatevs, could just be capcom dropped the ball. Other than all that bug BS it's a fantastic game. When this gets fixed it's worth a buy. In its current state, it's not."
2348,PrimusAvatar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/primusavatar/,2,,1,186.1,September,"22,",339,0,1,"After 250+ hours on PS4 and reaching my 100 hour mark on MH:W on PC, as well as having played previous entries in the series on different platforms - I think I'm finally qualified to voice an oppinion.What newcommers to the series might be expecting:You saw the trailers and thought that this is just a sunny version of Dark Souls or something. Even though they emphasized some common elements in the marketing materials this couldn't be more further from the truth. Both the setting and the gameplay are very different. MH:W is a game you can play solo or with firends, working together, not against each other, towards a common goal. Enemies come in all shapes, sizes, evolutions and with all kinds of fun abilities but there's more to this game than just whaking a lizard on its head.A cute and powerful Cat companion (the species is called ""Palicoes"") levels up beside you and ensures you're never facing those dangers alone even when you're not playing with other players. You can customize it, and up to 2 players can play together with their cats.Why is the cat impotrant in my review? I played with several firends and I've noticed that they weren't sold on the game until they relized that it's not that bleak of a setting and most of them were cat lovers, so there you have it :)Gameplay stuff:As you progress through the game, more and more gameplay features become available. 50 hours in on both PC and PS4 i was still unlocking new stuff. To me this is a big plus because it keeps the game fresh seemingly all the time. I won't spoil the engdame but I'll just say it's very fun.Is it grindy? Yes, but not as much as you'd expect. Some MMO's, ARPG's and F2P games are grindy in a very unfun way. This isn't. The difference is what you're woking towards and how ofthen you're rewarded in a meaningful way. This game always showers you with gameplay-changing rewards and still manages to stay interesting well into the deep endgame. They achieved this by having 14 weapon tech trees, dozens of armor sets and dozens of ways to make of of those aforementioned things work in very different ways. This means that even if you didnt get a drop of that thing you wanted you'll commonly get other fun stuff you havent experienced yet.Those 14 weapons are easy to use but hard to master, each of them changes the way you play in vastly different ways.Visually:As a game engine developer I can tell that the engine itself doesn't feature almost any of the modern featues you'd expect from AAA projects, but so did Breath of the Wild, and both team's artists managed to visualise those games in such ways that they seem a heck of a lot better than the engineers probably expected. :) The level design is georgeous, extremly well constructed and visual deficiencies are very well hidden.Animation:While cinematic animations on humans are subpar, the monster animations and combat movements are among the best that anyone could offer at this point. Only by playing the game yourself will you actually feel the vast difference.Sound:Apart from some weird choices (horse sounds on purple wolf/panther monsters) the combat sounds are very well balanced and interesting. The soundtrack is amazing and I listen to it very often."

If u r not a fan of that, don't buy this game. The story is plain and simple and feels like it was made onlz for sake of having in game. I didn't like the characters at all, all are forced. There are some bugs now and then, but my biggest issue was terrible hitbox on many weapons/mosnters. But still one playthrough of it was enjoyable, so if u don't mind grind, give it a try in some sale.Pros: -Customization of character is pretty solid and complex-Variety of monsters, armors and weapons with ton of movesets.-Coop, players in base making it slightly more alive.-Interesting biomes/maps with more to do then just killing big monsters-small tasks like gardening, research, etc.-Great for lovers of grindy games.Cons:-There are some minor bugs or texture glitches (at least I experienced them)-HITBOXES ARE BROKEN. Not only those of monsters but yours as well. Many time you will be glad you managed to hit monster even tho it shouldn't but it will also happen vice versa. Monsters many times were not even near touching me but I got hit. It was infuriating. This is not a bug, this is just lazy. It took a lot of fun from many fights for me.- PC is getting major events in great delay compared to consolesEven tho there's ton of armors, also in ng+ I dislike a lot of them so I didn't find grinding after finishing story for the first time appealing. (this is rather my opinion only, ur might differ)In the end I would give this game 7/10. It's not bad but it's not that amazing as I hoped it to be. Like I said minor bugs and broken hitboxes were too annoying and the grind felt unrewarding in ng+. It's worth getting in some sale. I got it in 50% for 30 €."

The launch of this is highly disappointing after waiting so long for it. We were promised a good port for the wait, we were delivered crap. The gameplay itself is amazing, I LOVE monster hunter games. Played nearly every one thats been out. Keyboard controls : I honestly don't understand the issue people have with keyboard controls, it took a little to get used to, but they're fine imho. I'd argue better than any of the keyboard controls for the souls series.Optimization : This game is hit or miss, you either got lucky and have a cpu/gpu the game likes, or you don't. I'm running an i7-6700k and a 1080TI and barely pull over 100 FPS with a few options disabled. Considering my setup, I honestly find this disappointing, there's no reason I shouldn't get 144 FPS on my 1080p monitor, but i can get passed that as really I stay over 60 and thats all that matters.The networking... my god.. the networking. ""Disconnected"" is all you'll see your steam do, for some reason it's steam thats getting caused to dc over and over until finally you're dropped out of online sessions. Have yet to find a fix for this, tried changing the region in steam itself, did nothing. I've maybe had one session of staying online for more than one quest with people. Pretty rediculous.I love the game, but I can fully understand people not being happy with this port. Even more so if you're not a fan of MH, because if you're not a fan of MH in general you aren't pushing the unhappiness back with ""FINALLY A PC VERSION.""For the love of god capcom, fix it. This could be HUGE for MH if you fix it in a timely fashion, starting with the disconnects!!!"

It's an extremely fun game for folks new to the series that eases you in to the life before trying to murder you.Details: The game staggered out the door with pretty debilitating connectivity issues that prevented people from playing together.  Most of the reviews were made during this time, so I feel, at a glance, they don't represent the game well.  Capcom has patched since, and tho there are still a few connectivity issues, I haven't had any now in almost 20 hours of gameplay since the fix went live.If you've never played Monster Hunter before (like me), the idea is very simple.  You hunt monsters and use their loot to  make better armor and weapons so that you can go out  and hunter meaner monsters for better loot and armor.  It's a simple template, but ohhhhh so satisfying.There is a plethora of armor, weapons, augments, and skill gems, which are very diverse - huge 2 handed swords, daggers, sword n board, huge slow firing guns, agile guns, the bow of course, and the unique weapons like the insect glaive.  My point is that this game can cater to almost any playstyle.The fights themselves are intense. You can spend 10-30 minutes just on one hunt and not breathe for at least half of that time.  Each new monster seems challenging, tho going back to them once you've been at it a while  just makes you shake your head at the thought that these cute little things were ever scary.Single Player is definitely a thing.  The monsters aren't quite as aggressive and are dialed back a bit. You can bring your trusty Palico with you  - a cat pretty much, that can buff/help you in a few ways.  It's a nice way to play if you have to be offline or if you just enjoy the solo challenge.  It's definitely more forgiving than previous Monster Hunters when it comes to solo play.Multi-Player is where it's at for me.  You can have up to 4 players on a hunt.  If you have just 2 players, your Palico's can join you.  There is just something really great about throwing down against these huge monsters with 3 other people that is so satisfying.The game still has some performance quirks to work out, especially for folks wanting to get the most out of their PCs.  I am not one to crucify a game because it isn't a virtual reality masterpiece.  It is a beautiful game on my 970 and runs at 60fps.. and that is enough for me.That's pretty much it.  If you read this far, thank you, and I really hope you enjoy Monster Hunter: World if you decide to give it a shot - I know I did!"

2366,Revalopod,https://steamcommunity.com/id/revcat/,267,23,1,21.7,August,"10,","2,549",36,1,"Monster Hunter: World is an incredible action RPG with a breathtaking world to explore, featuring compelling combat against massive magnificent monsters. It consists of a simple core loop: kill monsters to get gear and then kill more monsters to get better gear. Exploring the world is a huge joy in and of itself, with its highly detailed environment and roaming inhabitants. The combat is fast and frenetic, and killing monsters is rewarding and fun. The audio is very good, with satisfying damage sounds, and the music is epic. Unfortunately the story and characters feel quite underwhelming compared to the rest of the game. - Monster Hunter: World has some incredibly impressive looking visuals. The environments are fantastically lush and vibrant which makes them a pleasure to explore. Everywhere you go there’s impressive scenery to behold, but there’s also a plethora of small details such as little insects that really help make this world feel alive. The big monsters are a huge enjoyment to fight thanks in part to their fluid animations and highly detailed textures. The monsters are also visually coherent with the environment, which helps immerse you into the fantastical world. - The music is epic and well orchestrated, and sounds quite good. But the best part of the audio is the sounds: the sound effects offer great feedback during combat and the ambience and creature sounds are great. - After quite an extensive tutorial, you will get the opportunity to explore the massive world at leisure. What I really like about the world is how dense and detailed it is; it does a great job at making you feel tiny and insignificant. Scattered throughout this world are numerous native creatures, including some large monsters that require you to track them down by finding clues. The fauna isn’t the only thing you can hunt; there’s also plenty of plants and ores scattered about that are essential to crafting or upgrading gear. The collection of items is swift and satisfying and rarely slows you down, so it’s desirable to harvest everything in sight.A great feature about Monster Hunter: World is that the monsters aren’t just a living loot container waiting to be harvested. They actually interact with the environment and can even duel other monsters. Observing one large monster viciously scrabble against an even larger monster is always exciting. Killing the monsters yourself feels rewarding, as combat takes quite a bit of skill to master. The combat doesn’t always feel fluid, with some moves feeling sluggish to respond, but it is always fast and frenetic and highly enjoyable. Every corpse can be harvested for parts, and you can then use these parts to craft or upgrade gear. The main hub area, Astera, is fairly large and is where you’ll be spending time initiating quests, crafting gear and other preparations. Here you can also cook food, release pets into your room, and find squads. The character customisations is quite good, and you can also customise your own little Palico companion. You can choose from a huge assortment of unique weapons, which include dual wielded blades, sword and shield, or a bowgun to name a few. Each weapon has quite a large upgrade tree, which is fun to progress through. From monster parts you can craft new armour, and these usually posses stats consistent with the monster its made from. While exploring the world, you have access to numerous useful tools, and can craft and consume potions on the fly. Your melee weapon loses sharpness during combat, so you need to frequently sharpen it. Sometimes it felt this gear management detracted from the gameplay experience, but only slightly. Overall, the gameplay is hugely enjoyable. - You are a hunter who is part of the Fifth Fleet, and your job is to support the Research Commission in unraveling the mysterious surrounding  New World. Your main focus is discovering why the Elder Dragons migrate to New World every decade. You are accompanied by a Palico, which is a little catlike creature, and you also receive help and guidance from several other NPCs. The story is interesting but not particularly great, and the characters are quite basic.  - Monster Hunter: World is a very demanding game that is taxing on even the strongest PCs. Even a GTX 1070 struggles to maintain 60FPS on the highest settings. - The campaign will last quite a long time, but there’s so much more replayability besides that. I could easily see myself exceeding a hundred hours in this game Yes, Monster Hunter: World is a great looking and incredibly fun game, with plenty of content.Monster Hunter: World is a fantastic action RPG with an incredible world to explore and immerse yourself in.I give this game a 9/10"
2367,golw,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990133765/,4,,0,73.4,August,"17,",346,0,1,"The boss fights can be really cinematic, and are tremendous fun the first time or two, but become fairly repetitive after that. The story, setting, characters and anything outside of raw mechanics is easily forgotten, and uncomfortably juvenile. The fluff of this game is the kind that reminds me of a childhood playing video games but not in a friendly nostalgic way, more of a ""I can't believe I ever thought this wasn't stupid"" kind of way.Playing this game, I see an absolute mountain of potential. The core gameplay of hunting a monster is great. Finding the clues, identifying creatures, following tracks, locating nests, surveying the environment, locating hazards, laying traps, and generally figuring out the best way to kill this creature before engaging in exciting and very long, arduous battles; its all amazing. Where the game falls short is that it isn't a low budget indie game directed by a single team with a single vision, because this game is a huge mess of the most embarassing and anime cliches that do nothing to benefit the game and everything to detract from it. If you've got $60 to spare, and really enjoy MMO style grind, I would reccomend the game as a fun play once you get through the absurdly lengthy tutorial portion. However, if you plan to play this with friends, I wouldn't suggest it unless you and your friends are all very patient. The non-gameplay parts of the game are so mind numbingly stupid I can't comprehend how a company as big as CAPCOM allowed it to happen. It's so bad that I feel they need to issue a public apology to anyone who bought the game, and anyone who has been a fan of their products. That this is a console port is not an acceptable excuse for how pisspoor the interface is. Even when you finally figure out how to play with your friends, the execution is so clunky, that it still fails to work about half the time.If you're anything like me, you'll play the game for a week and enjoy parts of it, and generally kind of have fun playing it. You'll get a lot of hours out of it during that one week; and after that, you'll feel that there's really nothing worth replaying it for, because even though you may have new armors and new weapons to grind, they don't actually do anything new, or change the game at all."

The game feels a lot more streamlined than previous iterations and is a large step forward. I played about 75% of the time solo, and had equally as much fun on multiplayer. The upcoming expansion pack will be a must buy for me, and we'll have a good few months to review it on the consoles first to truly evaluate it.There were previously demos to give you a taste of the game, which I think they should've added to this as well. The game will need a bit of time for one to understand the nuances; and once you have that part down, you'll truly enjoy the game. Mastering the fight against any particular monster gives you the rush of satisfaction and this feeling stays all the way till end-game. If you can get over the technical aspect of the cons, this game will not disappoint."

Aside from challenges it can be relaxing and enjoyable experience especially when helping lower level sos calls or just chilling in guiding lands (Iceborne endgame content)Playing in a full party of 4 is the best way to experience the game for me but solo hunts are fun too.I highly recommend this to anyone who loves challenging games that requires precision, timing and patience. Battles with each monster is different so plan the quest, research the monster you're hunting, take the right gear/equipment, and skills. Happy hunting!"

It runs solidly no crashes and no stuttering or frame rate drops. There are some issues with the connectivity of multiplayer which is really annoying because this game shines with multiplayer. As usual there is a lot of people who just jump on the bandwagon of the new shiny hype game.  This game is hard it's frustrating and fun at the same time, but you need to understand it is also grindy. The controls are not janky it's skill you need to time your hits to counter hard hitting fast monsters.  People lack this understanding and complain if you can push yourself over that learning hurdle you'll find a fantastic community with heaps of content and as you get better more difficult monsters to fight.

Turns out, it makes a very fun game.The game is visually spectacular, and its soundtrack is lively and colourful, but don't let all that dazzle distract you - this game entirely revolves around its gameplay - the moment-to-moment, giant monster fighting. It has a combat system that's easy to learn but hard to master, allowing newbies to just jump in and play the game with friends but rewarding veterans who take their time to study and prepare.The game is hard, but fair. You'll end up failing once in a while, and even that's the best case scenario. However, the game leaves around many clues on how you can always improve, or get better, which makes it a fun game.One of this game's coolest features is its extensive lineup of monsters, as they are called. In reality, they are just fantasy dinosaurs. They act very realistically, with fight-or-flight tactics, preferred territories and prey, etc. A vast part of the gameplay is tracking them, studying their habits, weaknesses and abilities, movement, and understanding how to overpower them.The world is also vast and beautiful, with many secrets to uncover and things to find.The game's story is simple and weak, but not a lot of gametime is dedicated to it so it's no biggie. The biggest problem with the game is the difficulty curve. There isn't a very good tutorial, and the game is very complex and deep. Without proper research, players may end up making things harder for themselves or not even know about some features the game has to offer.I'd recommend this game to anybody who likes difficult action-adventure games, or for someone looking for a game with real meat to sink their teeth into. If you're looking for an epic, intruiging story, or can't stand a difficult experience, steer clear."

Severe networking issues that remain unfixed, some crippling performance issues for players at the low end of the hardware range for the game, and a general lack of developer communication are really hurting the launch.That said, disregarding the state of the port, the game's improved on (or simply fixed) many of the small quality of life issues that made previous titles less enjoyable. Items can be set to autocraft upon picking up their materials during missions, hitboxes on almost every monster are now realistic instead of large boxes around limbs, heads, and feet that hit you from metres away. The dodge iframe window for the player seems to be smaller, but this is somewhat less of an issue than it would be if the aforementioned hitbox issues hadn't been fixed. Tranqs now throw at the player's feet rather than through the air, and affect the area around their point of impact, making captures significantly easier. Plates and gems are possible to meld with Wyverian prints.The lack of G rank content is something of a downer, though we may see it in the future. I was also expecting a much wider range of monsters (many of the older monsters appear to be missing from the game, though I've yet to clear the hunter rank grind to confirm this). There's much to be said for or against the game, and ultimately the only reason this is getting a thumbs up is because there's no middle option.If you're running a good rig, give the game a go. If you're running something on the lower end of the hardware range, consider waiting a few weeks for the developers to either iron out the problems or show they're not going to."

Why not just join from the start and have all players go through the cutscenes together even if the cutscene is of the host only or your character only?"

Between laziness, and not really wanting to use the social side of steam for anything other than personal friends, it just wasn't something I saw worth doing.However, I love monster hunter. World got me into the game, and introduced me to a wonderful series. I am now playing through MHGU to experience the old world hunting style, and anxiously await Rise for when it comes out. World is not a perfect game. I have screamed at, called bull on it (looking at you MR Kulve timer) and struggled through every fight available, from LR Great Jagras to Fatalis. I dislike the clutch claw, I dislike the cut scenes being forced single player, but that doesn't matter. All in all I love Monster hunter. When I heard that people were hating on this game because of a movie made by another group, a movie I haven't seen even if I am planning too, then I felt I had to do my part to maintain the positive image that this beautiful game deserves.Over 500 hours in, and I have to say that it was worth every minute of struggle, rage, and tears that led to a glorious triumph. Extreme Behemoth, Ancient Leshen, Raging Brachydios, Alatreaon, Fatalis, the Arch-tempered and so many more.Monster Hunter is a 10/10 game that will forever live on in my heart as a true treasure."

I randomly stumbled upon MH:W on the store page and thought to myself : ""Hey, why not give it a shot, maybe you will play it for day or two"".Looks like I was wrong.... Why is it so fun to hit big monsters with big sticks?Its honestly one of the best games I've played in the last couple of years. Once you get over the relatively small learning curve and start to get good at the game it just feels so incredibly satisfying. The sound design of breaking parts of a monster, the moment when you topple it and it flails around helplessly or just succeeding on a grapple attack with the Iceborne grapple makes you feel like such a badass.The design of the monsters themselves is just gorgeous. From an overgrown fat gecko, to a giant T-Rex that looks like a giant pickle, to an evil traditional dragon, some of them more deadly than others. The pseudo realistic way they are portrayed makes them stand out from ""normal"" fantasy creations and makes it so much more satisfying to actually learn their weak spots. No monsters feels the same (Rathalos, Azure Rathalos, and so on  somewhat do, but manage to feel different in their own unique fighting styles) making every hunt unique in itself. Once you jump into multiplayer with friends or strangers, it starts to just feel like animal cruelty against the monsters. If you have a group that actually knows what they are doing it, the difficulty gets kind of easy but it never stops being satisfying, even if its just 4 dudes whacking on a permanently toppled monster.This game made me forever want more monsters to hunt and makes me hope that we will get another Monster Hunter title for the PC in the future.Also.. ♥♥♥♥ the Handler..."

2403,Vincent Vanille,https://steamcommunity.com/id/largeyike/,2,,1,248.3,September,"7,",218,0,1,"This is a tough game for me to make a review on, I've dropped this game twice out of frustration or apathy, and I've picked it up three times in a row over the span of two years, constantly fighting with this game. As all of my mutuals enjoyed it, I didn't seem to, and they talked about how fun it was, yet I didn't. I just struggled with it, as someone who never played a MH game, and more importantly someone who was never too fond of farming all that much it seemed like a gem of a game I just wouldn't be able to enjoy.But I can now definitively say after almost 175 hours logged that Monster Hunter World is an amazing game.My review won't be glossing over technical issues too much because I have a low/mid-end rig, and so any complaints I could be making would be a toss-up between poor optimization, or just hardware limitations, and you could find complaints about netcode and other issues on thousands of other reviews, and I think they're valid because me and my friends struggled at ends for hours just to do a full hunt together in multiplayer.This review is coming from the standpoint of solo hunts from Jagras to Nergigante, and the bits of multiplayer I've logged in with friends.The most crucial thing to mention when it comes to MHW is weapon choice is vital to your enjoyment of the game. To get into it, you need to find the thing that fits you even down to combos or movement. Going into the training area in Astera gives you access to all of this. In my attempts where I dropped the game, I had been playing longsword, and then sword and shield. Both were sort of fun, but didn't give me what I so desperately wanted in the game, it made my movements feel so rigid and rough, and only served to make the gameplay feel sluggish to me. On my third attempt at trying the game though I sat down, and ended up finding Insect Glaive, this weapon gave me what I wanted, and turned a sluggish, boring, and nearly agonizing experience playing chase with a monster that'd fly to the other end of the map once damaged into a fun, engaging, and exciting experience. Everyone has their weapon preference, and it's up to you to find what fits you most.The graphics are something that I haven't been able to fully enjoy because of rig issues, but from gameplay videos it's stayed quite consistent that while facial animations aren't the greatest. All of the little stylish things in Monster Hunter such as the palicoes and their food, or the monster designs managed to be stellar all throughout the base game and Iceborne.Ecosystems in this game look beautiful as there's logical application to how the monsters would function within them, watching them fight for their lands, and seeing how monsters function in these landmasses is what makes the experience so immersive and captivating which has led me to enjoy this game on my run through for hours on end.In the later game a big appeal is going through and farming out these things called gems which can be used to augment armors and builds so you can have the perks you want, this allows it so no matter what you do in MHW, you'll always manage to find a way to make your build work out with whatever you like. Meaning MHW Fashion isn't impossible in the least, and even with transmog armor options, it means you can have your set customized down to colors.The one gripe I could possibly have with this game other than what was glossed over above, and it's something that comes down to people's personal preferences which is why I address this, is MHW losing the aesthetic of prior Monster Hunter games. Looking at the old games you can get a sense of this sort of high fantasy larger than life sort of look, which rigid and bold colors for landscapes and armors, and behemoths to fight that looked more fantasy than ever, but MHW grayscaled it a bit, and made their monsters more applicable to what you'd see as what people would hypothesize dinosaurs and dragons to have looked like, and while that's not bad. It's just not everyone's taste, and I'd at least like to acknowledge that.Overall, this game is a blast, and as someone who had a really hard time getting into it. I'd just like to say it was worth it, and I'm glad I stuck it out for this game."

I've always known about the MH series, but never really gave it a shot, and I didn't even pick up MHW when it was initially launched. Foolish me. One day almost on a whim I figured ""Hm, I suppose I will try this game"" and now I'm pretty much hooked on the entire franchise across the board, with zealot level of fanboyism.Where do I even begin really? I suppose I will start with how the game works. The games premise is simple. You're a hunter heading to the New World on the 5th fleet and your task is to hunt the monsters there all in the name of science and exploration and all that fun stuff. The story is a little on the shallow side but it gets you through the motions and unlocks new monsters appropriately for you to fight, tied in with some honestly gorgeous cutscenes (sadly unskippable.)The meat and bones of the game, and the entire series really, are the monsters and the ensuing battles you have with them. I have a hard time putting together the words for exactly how to describe how perfectly Capcom has put the whole system together. Every single monster I fight feels so alive and filled with personality, that no other game I've played is really even on par with. The movements, the sounds, the fluidity is just sublime. Pair all of that up with a fantastic soundtrack and you will find yourself completely consumed by each encounter.Combat is not as easy as just mashing buttons and winning, so I found that initially I had a tricky time figuring out how to fight effectively, but once I got the hang of it I couldn't stop. Combat itself is a bit heavier (think dark souls) and surgical. Actions taken or not taken will have heavy consequences, and each monster has unique movements and attack patterns for you to learn and recognize. Expect to fail often at first, but when you do succeed and you hear that victory theme, it is very rewarding and fulfilling.Lets talk about the graphics. This game is absolutely gorgeous, with each map loaded to the brim with beautiful foliage and fauna for you to gawk at as you run through looking for your mark. Map sizes are big and exploring them is enjoyable, but not so big as to needlessly draw hunts out. As stated earlier, when it comes to monster design, the people at Capcom have set the bar into an entirely new realm. Every single monster in the game is beautifully crafted and watching them move around or interact with the world is an absolute joy to behold, no game I can think of has pulled off design quite like this in my opinion. The hunter you create and play as is also expertly detailed and animated, with a pretty powerful character creation tool backing it up, most players will be able to make a character to fit their specifications quite nicely.Sound and music design is a powerful ally to MHW's graphics as well. I've fought an Anjanath hundreds of times and still get chills when I hear it enrage. Every monster has a wide assortment of loud roars, aggressive snarls and snaps, and defeated whimpers, which add so much life to each and every one of them. Each map, and many of the monsters (although not all of them) have their own unique theme for when you fight them, and each of those themes is very good. They went with a more orchestral vibe in MHW though which is a little different from their previous titles. Personally I love it, but the classic themes are hard not to enjoy as well so it's a toss up here, but either way the music is very good.If you're looking for a fair amount of endgame to grind on as well, then MHW has you covered, although the gem droprate is pretty abysmal for a few of them (attack gem). However, a lot of the endgame issues have been addressed in the Iceborne expansion so I wouldn't worry about it too much (PC release is right around the corner)At the end of the day, I really can't give this game enough praise, it has completely changed how I look at action combat and monster/boss designs, and will likely remain at the top of my list for a very long time. Looking forward to many more years of hunting monsters, and can't wait for the, hopefully, entire monster roster to join us in the New World."

It is mediocre if you put it in a larger scale with all those new fancy looking 3A titles, but it's the BEST for a monster hunter game. And that pretty much wraps up 80% of why this game is good. A monster hunter game with good graphics..... just WOW.1.Combat    The combat system is always the core element for monster hunter, just like its prequels this one deliveries top-notch combat system. It is simple, easy to get a hang on, but very hard to master. For beginner there are easier weapons to choose from and later you will find those ""easy"" weapon also has depth that requires a lot of practice to master. Take my personally fav weapon for example, lance is not played by a lot because of its relatively simpler movement set: poke, charge and counter. These three movement covers 99% of lance combat however it takes timeless effort to master when to poke, how many times should you poke, when to counter, etc. 10/10(though i miss the hunter arts and style)2.Story    you are sapphire star and now you have to collect some mushroom for our chef. 0/10Yep, that's it, this game is all about hunting monsters and nothing else. One more thing I would like to address is the monster design. Other than the older ones(shown in prequels) the new ones honestly seem to be a little dull. I dont blame the dev because they intended to deliver a more ""realistic"" feeling in this game, unlike previous ones it feels more like a magic world. This is still a very decent MH game(now that the connection problem is solved) and if you can find some friends to play with I think you will have a great time and since this one is the easiest of all MH games it's a good starting point if youve never played MH. 8.8/10"

I didn't know the first thing about the beady eyed rock-wielding Kululaku or the raging Anjanath. But then one day I come stumbling into a sprawling hunter's camp, surrounded by strutting hunters who were wearing the spoils of their hunts, a spiked Nergigante helmet or the glistening blue scales of a Legiana breastplate. And suddenly, the spark to hunt was ignited. The hunter's outpost isn't without its downsides, however. There is an annoying lady, the 'Handler', yapping at me and waving her hands in an excited fashion. I try to ignore her, but she is following me, telling me about footprints that have been tracked to the west of the Wildspire Waste, perhaps I should head out there to collect samples and sniff them some? Oh! And the hunkering Zorah Magdaros is on the move! This landmass of an elder dragon, I wonder what we could do to slow its--I am nodding in agreement, anything to get her away from me. But the next thing I know, she has slammed a book in my face and I am being smothered by its musty pages. This is where you need to go! Lawd woman, I don't need glasses! Get that book out of my face! Yes, I'll see to it that the Great Jagras is turned into a green leather jacket on my next hunt! The Vaal Hazak is stalking the Rotten Vale being all emo and dark? What, you say his cloak makes a super cool looking armour!? He's on the list!And so, twin blades in hand, wearing the generic free weapon-smith donated armour, I head out into the world. I am off to hunt me some monsters!"

There are plenty of updates and events although some of them are after they're released for the console version. Overall it's a great title so long as you're familiar with the genre and don't mind repeatedly hunting monsters. Happy Hunting!"

The game has improved immensely since then and I am incredibly happy to have gotten the game.The world itself is visually gorgeous and immersive. You feel like you're out exploring a living world.The combat is fluid and smooth, it's rewarding when you learn a monsters patterns and behaviour. You can feel yourself improving as a hunter over time.There's so many weapons, so many skills and so many types of builds to play around with. For a theorycrafter like me, the game never gets old.The average new player will get 100-150 hours out of the main story. That alone is worth the cost of the game.From there, once you reach the endgame, the game turns into grinding for the sake of grinding. You need to be the type of person who enjoys hunting and enjoys the challenge of the endgame monsters, and enjoy hunting them over and over.However even if you do not enjoy that aspect, as said, the game's storyline for itself is worth the cost, anything after that feels like free entertainment.Pros:Visually stunningImmersiveMany weapon types, one for any type of personSmooth controls (I play with a controller)Fluid and lifelike combatSeveral hundreds of hours of entertainmentModdableChallenging but not unfairGreat multiplayer experience with friendsCons:High CPU usageLow variety in visual weapon designGets grindy after the storySlow content releases (This has been improving though)Jewel RNG is bullsh*tRare connection issuesPersonal score: A solid 8/10The game is great and a ton of fun, but can get grindy and repetitive outside of events.Luckily capcom has been stepping up their game and that has been improving lately.The game is more fun with friends, but completely viable to play solo. Most hunts are even faster solo, if you're a good hunter.For any fans of Dark Souls, who enjoys the type of evasive combat where you punish openings, I will 100% recommend this game.For any other our there, pick up on sale, maybe you'll find a new gem."

It makes great quality of life changes that makes hunting less of a hassle, there is a large amount of fantastic challenging monsters to hunt with more being added with free DLC, graphics are the best in the series, and the multiplayer makes the experience 10x more enjoyable!There might be some hiccups in the game occasionally but the developers are constantly fixing stuff for the community.

2466,Gustaw,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gustawkonrad/,2,,1,456.4,November,"27,",260,0,1,"First of all I want to mention I played monster hunter before World back in the PSP era of Freedom Unite so I may be biased towards certain aspects of the game.TL:DR A Great game in most aspects exept the story however, it is plagued with annoying bugs which stay in game for too long timeStory:As a rather new thing in Monster Hunter World or MHW for short a more proper story has been added. Unfortunately the story is really bland and for the most part feels like a chore rather than anything interesting. I heard some people saying it gives a nice direction of what needs to be done next and serves as a very extended tutorial but it seems rather far-fetched.Gameplay:This is where the game shines, player has many different weapons to choose from and each of them feels unique in it's own right from simple sword and shield up to a strange supporting weapon that is hunting horn allowing anyone to find something to suit their taste. The armor and later decorations provide different skills that boost the player abilities or protect them from enemy actions which makes it possible to costumize builds to their liking. The combat may sometimes feel a little bit clunky so to speak with attacks not hitting how they should and the monsters sometimes seem to cheat on hitboxes but it's not that big of an issue overall.The most important thing however are the monsters. Each of them requires a different approach how to fight them, personally I like to think about each monster as a boss battle, and while some of them are easier and some are harder it still seems that unless you are heavily overgeared they can best you if you don't take them seriously. The only downside I find in MHW compared to other monster hunter games is that comparably there are much less monsters to fight (for example in MHW there are 31 monsters while in Freedom Unite there were 62).The other great part are large maps with many interactable objects, hidden paths and areas you sometimes find even after countless hours of gameplay, it's possible to use enviroment to your advantage when fighting the monster but just as well it may become a disadvatage, good example is poison flowers which create a pool of poison that can apply the status to both player and the monster.The thing that is rather poorly made is the equipement management. It wasn't changed much compared to previous titles, and it feels clunky. so taking too many items can sometimes make it rather confusing when you try to select that antidote. Tt is remedied somehow by the quickwheel that allows for easy access to most important items if you set it correctly beforehand. Compared to previous title monster tracking is also much easier thanks to the scoutflies showing the way and not needing to rely on using paintball to mark monster every so often.Multiplayer:The game features a multiplayer aspect and I highly recommend to make use of it. Hunting monsters feel like an adventure with a group of friends and for the most part if you're struggling by yourself with a certain monster, it may prove to be a better idea to try fighting it with a group. The main problem of multiplayer comes from the story due to the fact that each player needs to watch the unskippable cutscenes individually, before they can access the same mission together. It is annoying and if you want to progress at the same time with others prepare for some waiting till someone finishes that cutscene, or finds that spot where the cutscene is triggered etc. Once story is completed the problem is solved so in worst case scenario it's possible to put up with a story and rush it before playing with friends.Graphics:While it isn't the prettiest game ever made in history it does have it's own style and overall looks great. It is easiest to see it while observing the maps and how much detail was put into making them. That seems to be especially true for a certain map that is unlocked throughout the story that is really unique as though it really care from a different world.Audio:The soundtrack isn't exactly the most memorable type but it seems good and fits the game well. Monsters have different tracks attached to them so the track does not seem repetitive and the transitions between them sound natural without any annoying stuttering or whatnot. Other than that the sound effects are all on point and the voiceover for character is okayish (exept for handler because she's annoying af regardless of which language is used).Technical:Lastly the main problem that is PC port and how Capcom handles it. Well to no surprise the requirements are rather high but that's rather understandable, the problem is the number of bugs that plagues this game to this day. For example early on there was a problem with game randomly disconnecting from the server which for some players made it nearly impossible to play with their friends. Currently the game may randomly freeze even stopping other programs from functioning correctly it happens mostly when viewing the workshop but it's nonetheless annoying. The bugs are slowly being fixed but those things shouldn't happen in the first place.Overall:If you can look past the bugs or some clunky gameplay elements the game provides a great way to spend time regardless if you want to just make one or two missions a day or spend next week playing it all the time as even after completing the story there are lots of things to do and new free for all players content constantly being added to the game."

Period.The game offers a wonderfully engaging gameplay loop with many different monsters to hunt, providing a variety of experiences that a Monster Hunter title should have.Sporting a roster of 14 weapon types, there's something for everyone. From the speedy dual swords to the powerhouse greatsword, you can do anything if you're willing to take the time to learn your weapon's intricacies and master positioning. It takes time, of course, but with MHW, time is not an issue. The only limited thing in the game are the time-sensitive events, that are around for a short while before being switched up for a new set of event quests.Like exploring? Welcome to the EXTREMELY open zones of Monster Hunter: World. When on an expedition for research, or hunting a specific monster, there are no loading screens out in the selected zones. The sprawling landscapes are home to several ecosystems and a staggering number of creatures. Without giving too much away, all I can really say is that the zones are massive.My favourite thing this time around would have to be the Monster Turf Wars. There's nothing quite as satisfying as watching two huge creatures duke it out over territory. The engagements are vicious, and often end with one monster SORELY regretting its decision to pick a fight with whichever other monster whose territory it waltzed into.Between the combat mechanics, the vast array of creatures and the ability to customize your setup to suit your weapon and playstyle, Monster Hunter: World presents you with the opportunity to feel like a badass in your own right.When other people tell you that MHW is the ""easiest"" title in the series because they solo'ed the ""story"", pay them no mind. Yes, you finished the ""single player"" aspect of the game. Now, go on and try your hand at the new challenges and then tell me just how ""easy"" it is. If your reasoning is that MH: Generations on the Switch will be harder because ""insert vague reason here"", remember that they actively made this title more ACCESSIBLE to new players, not easier. There's a big difference between dumbing the game down and allowing newer players to the series to ease themselves into the difficulty curve. And dumb it down they have not.9/10 - Sure the game's a little demanding, but it is BEAUTIFUL and no one can say otherwise.9/10 - Between monster roars, battle music and the sound of weapons cleaving through flesh, the game's got GREAT audio.10/10 - Easily the best gameplay of the MH series so far. So much to do, many ways to approach a situation and visceral combat make this a fantastic title.10/10 - They got this just right. Preparation and knowledge are half the battle. With the new ""internal monster wiki"" at your disposal, you can set yourself up for success ahead of time and go into a fight prepared for the worst situations! However, the monsters are not slouches. Even if you've brought everything to make a monster's life a living hell, it can also return the favour tenfold. Never underestimate any of these creatures, as they will chew you up and spit you out without the slightest hesitation.9/10 - The controls are fluid. Be it mouse and keyboard, or gamepad. Your attacks flow together seamlessly and dodging feels responsive. Knowing when to use your big attacks that lock you into animations is the biggest obstacle, but once you figure it out, you'll be pretty good!10/10 - There's a lot there, even after you ""finish"" the main story of the game. After completing practically all of the available content, I can say for certain that it's got a 10/10 rating from me.9.5/10 - With this game being the way it is, after Capcom has rectified the majority of connection issues, it deserves to stand as a titan of a game. It is, without a doubt, the best Monster Hunter I have ever played. And I have played all of them up until 4 Ultimate (I skipped that one onward until MH:W released on PC).Bravo Capcom, bravo.I can wholeheartedly say that I recommend this game. HANDS DOWN THE BEST MH to date!EDIT: Updated my review to change ""Content"" to a 10/10 since the addition of Iceborne."
2495,Kaptein Koenk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainDelugo/,3,,1,197.3,August,"26,",359,0,1,"With Monster Hunter: World being one of the few games I was honestly hyped for when it would release on PC I was greatly looking forward to the PC release. With the release already happening on consoles, I knew I had good content and gameplay to look forward to when I would get my hands on my PC copy.I disagree with most reviews on Steam - while the game definitely has it's issues and the port is nowhere near perfect, the game still delivers. With the occasional connection error (which has now been patched effectively) frustration would arise, having all your friends watch cutscenes separately before you can co-op story missions is a pain but this issue was already known on the consoles too and can be worked around relatively well.Apart from these minor issues, the game delivers everything you hope for. A slamming orchestral soundtrack blasting as you and friends, each equipped with one of the 14 different weapon types (which all deliver you a whole separate game experience), as you track and hunt enormous monsters within the New World. Having zero respawns left and coordinating with your friends as you work together tactically to mount and knock down the monster, just to have your friend with the big-ass hammer pound the monster on it's head, it's moments like these which make this game such a beauty to play.If you can get a few hours into Monster Hunter: World, you'll be sucked in a universe where each monster kill will get more satisfying than the previous one. I highly recommend this game."

I've heard of people having fps/graphics issues even on great rigs and while that will certainly detract from the experience I can't comment on it because i haven't really seen these issues as of yet. Connectivity issues seem much less frequent since the last patch if not gone altogether (again that's just my experience, some people have claimed to still have issues but it doesn't seem like nearly as many). Honestly these are the biggest issues i can see with this game and I myself have barely dealt with them, that doesn't mean they don't exist however so people complaining about it is totally valid and I can see where those come from.That said if you can get the game running stable and play with friends or even randoms this is a truly enjoyable experience. It isn't as hard as previous MH titles and there aren't as many to hunt as you could in other games but this is also a title attracting a lot of new players to the MH franchise so honsestly I don't see those as horrible points. If you are new to MH this is a great game to start with, don't be discouraged if a monster seems to take you a long time to kill or even if you fail to do it a few times. You'll find that it's all about picking the right weapon for you ( 14 to choose from and they all feel great for their own reasons!) learning a monsters moves and how to work around them. What might start as an encounter you fail several times will with practice turn into something you totally tear down, and it will feel great and get you hooked I promise you."

2505,Sammy Killer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SammyKiller/,2,,1,194.5,August,"18,",273,0,1,"Alright, this will be a long one but bare with me.First of all, I played this game for 554 hours on PS4, HR 215 and numerous solo/CO-OP time attack runs, I can kill Tempered Nergigante solo in 2 minutes and 30 seconds avg with a Greatsword build. I know a thing or two about this game.So when the PC version finally released, I wanted to see what 4K 60FPS would look like, I bought the game and played with the following specs:8700K at 5ghz1080ti at 1950mhz with temp target set to 70C16gb ram500gb SSDPS4 PadI play with the following graphical settings:4K resolution, All settings maxed out, Volume scale OFF, AA OFF, Graphics settings: Variable (Prioritize Resolution)So, the game itself looks spectacular on PC, it runs at a solid 60 at all times with a 1080ti on the prioritize resolution setting, I find that the High graphics setting does nothing for the game on both a big 4K tv and a 32"" 4K monitor. the LOD graphics setting is important as it changes the way the game looks as a whole, Disabling Volumetric fog is a MUST, having it on hogs performance and makes the game look terrible and washed out. The game runs super well, Having played for 10 hours in a row testing for any instability, I didn't see anything that would detriment gameplay when it comes to the core mechanics Vs the PS4 version, if anything, running at 60fps all the time makes the game super enjoyable and exciting. The online functions need some work, randomly disconnecting from games with people but I mostly play Solo, as I do better that way and people usually just get in the way. Things that the PC version would need tweaked:-The ability to choose in what monitor the game should be displayed, having multiple monitors, it will default to the main monitor.- Being able to chat with other players without having to open a chat menu, something like a traditional MMO where you press Enter and type a message would be fantastic.- The ability to make Squads, having a Squad session would be great for friends to jump in and out quickly of your games when working on farming items.- An in-game FPS counter or technical data, the game won't even support steam's FPS counter.Aside from some issues, the port feels great compared to the PS4 version provided you have the hardware to back it up. I'm a bit sad people are reviewing the game so negatively as this is one of those games where the real enjoyment comes after investing 50 hours on it, if you can't invest that amount of time I wouldn't be able to recommend it to you, as only playing it for the story or to see the monsters but not grinding for gear and honing your skills and challenging yourself to do better can only take you so far.Overall a very enjoyable experience so far, Highly recommend the game if you are looking for a challenge or like grinding for items in a Destiny 2 esque-way."

Combat is very methodical and punishing if you aren't learning the monster- Performs acceptably. From my experience playing on PS4, getting a around 60-70 FPS at max settings 2560x1440 on a 1080Ti. Turned down the volumetric fog from Highest to High to gain another 10 ish FPS without significant impact on the graphics- Great load times vs my time playing on PS4, SSD or no. The PS4 load times were a constant (minor) source of frustrationNeutral:- Maybe not as optimized as possible, but personally I think the performance is adequate- Pretty CPU-intensive. I have an i7-6700K @ 4.4GHz and I'll get about 60-70% load on max settings. Manages to use more than 4 CPU threads, unlike many games. All 8 threads of my 6700K get involved-  Oh, the sweet lord Raw Input has arrived, looking forward to giving m+k a go now that raw input is available.- The best UX in any Monster Hunter game (not saying much since the UX is still pretty painful at times)Cons:- Missing some graphical options I wish were there (Primarily disabling depth-of-field and motion blur)- - A Patch has been put out for the networking issues. I personally haven't had any disconnects since the patch, and I haven't heard of any issues from friends who play the game, so everything seems far more stable, and any networking bugs that remain appear to be fairly minor.- Disconnecting during a multiplayer match just leaves you in your hunt, but suddenly solo. No re-loading or anything, your monster is at the same %HP it was before your disconnect, but you're suddenly not in a group and fighting the multiplayer-HP version of the boss with your Palibro. You don't get kicked out of the hunt or anything, but it definitely sucks that the monster doesn't drop back down to the same %HP but with the Solo HP maximum. Generally not a big deal, but it sucks to restart your hunt if you D/C off the bat. Hopefully a minor inconvenience now with the new networking patch.Would I recommend this game? Yeah, I would. Monster Hunting is a good time, and I think anyone who thinks they might like Monster Hunter will enjoy this game. Hopefully the networking issues are resolved quickly, since they're definitely the biggest problem."
2518,Dark Ranger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRanger57/,3,,1,230.7,August,"12,",746,0,1,"I'm one of the lucky ones who hasn't had any problems with performance. However, I am not lucky enough to be able to dodge the bullet that is this game's wacky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers. It is borderline impossible playing this game multiplayer most of the time because of how spotty the servers are. It's a huge shame considering how co-op focused this game is.  If you're on the fence about buying this, I'd definitely wait until the performance and server issues are fixed. However, I've been having a blast with this game solo. This is my first real experience with Monster Hunter and I've not been disappointed thus far. There's a lot of depth to this game. Yes, it can be very confusing. Yes, it's grindy, as Monster Hunter has always been, but the experience you get from actually participating in hunts pretty much negates the tediousness of any of these factors. It all comes down to the monster hunting, obviously. It's split into a couple of phases. First, you have the prep phase. This occurs in the town hub where you pick up the quest, upgrade your weapons, buy supplies, eat food for certain buffs, etc.Once that's done, you depart on your quest and move to the hunting phase. The hunts themselves are paced really well in order to give you plenty of action while also allowing you to recuperate and regroup as the hunt moves from section to section. During this phase you usually have a time limit of 50 minutes, but it can be lower depending on quest modifiers. Once your prey has been hunted, you enter the final phase of the hunt, the looting phase. You have 60 seconds to carve up the monster for any loot you can find, as well as picking up anything else you might want from the environment. After the timer is up, you're teleported back to HQ to repeat the process. The most rewarding thing about this whole process is once you start to learn monster patterns and behaviors, you can start applying that knowledge to both prep accordingly and exploit patterns and behaviors of the monster. Eventually you start taking down the monsters faster and more effeciently. It's an RPG where you, the player, start to feel like a more experienced hunter as your character progressees.The game allows you to pick from 14 different weapons as well, each accomodating to a different playstyle with unique combos and upgrade trees. I hear the game's combat often compared to Dark Souls, but I feel like it's a little Dark Souls mixed with a fighting game. Using the right combos at the right time is key. Add the player's wide arsenal with the diversity of the many monsters in the game, and you have a very challenging and engaging combat system that's up to the task of keeping you interested well past the 100 hour mark. It's also important to note that while this game is great solo, it truly shines when you're playing co-op with a team. Difficulty scales with how many players are in your party, so coordinating with your friends to take down a monster as effeciently as possible adds even more depth to this already endless pit of a game. However, this game does some very strange things with multiplayer. If you and your friends are on the same quest in the story, the game simply won't let you depart on that quest together, telling you that you're not far enough in the story to join them. Good luck even getting into a session with your friends, though, considering how trash the servers are right now.  Overall, I'd recommend this game. As I said, if you're on the fence, just wait until all the server and performance issues are sorted out. This is a game that really shines when you're teaming up with your friends, but as of right now that's not very reliable."

As each Quest I took with my fellow comrades, little by little, I started to see what we have become into.We had plundered into a New World and started to exterminate one by one the creatures that live there in that once-undisturbed ecosystem, cooking their flesh in our meals, and using their skin and hides as our clothing and armor.And we keep continuing this cycle forever.Maybe even until they have gone endangered.The day that it made me finally realize was when I saw another group of hunters were fighting a Rathalos and a Rathian protecting its newly-born and right when both were killed, so was the new-born as well. Just for the sake of upgrading their gear.Not only us have lives to protect, but so do the Large Monsters of the New World too."

PERIOD.- Game is still fun solo, good to warm up before going in with people who are more experienced in the MH world. - Dang, I really enjoy the graphics, the enivornment and how each monster type deals with each other within its own ecosystem. Is the game bad upon launch? Nope, I've dealt wit worst newly launched games and they were poorly ported, more so than others would deem so in this game. It wasn't bricked upon launch. (coughs, Batman:AK is an example)I'm giving this game a chance because I actually like the Monster Hunter franchise and the game devs poured a lot of heart and soul into this. I can understand this would be maybe their first or 2nd time porting their game into the PC and with with working online functions. I know for sure there will be a hotfix patch soon to iron out the issues. But if you're still weary about the game, you can wait for a week or a month. I still say this game is a great buy.

It's the people who want to be mad who are reviewing it.Now onto the port. The port isn't great. For the 6 months we had to wait for it, it could have been better. But the DS1 port was god ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ awful and people still found ways to play it. The loading times are crazy fast, the graphics are super nice (although you need to disable a few things for optimization and that sucks) the systems that made sense on console have been changed to make sense on PC instead, so they definitely thought about ""does this feature make sense on steam? How should we change it?""The game is a typical Monster Hunter. You fight monsters so you can farm it for a set that allows you to fight another monster, which is just a stepping stone to a third monster, ad infinitum. The combat is fluid and rewarding of skill and mastery, and those who learn the ins and outs of their weapons and the monsters will be rewarded. I personally feel some weapons came out worse than previous games with their changes in mechanics or moves (Sword and Shield, Dual Blades) but most got much, much better when compared to the previous games with what was added to their arsenal. What makes this game such a definitive version over MHG on the 3DS or MGU on the Switch is the absolute colossal amount of Quality of Life changes. Gathering is faster, so many of the crafting recipes were streamlined so you weren't farming for hours to make an ends game worth of one tool you needed. Things you needed for every hunt are always on your hunter at all times, and don't take up inventory space. The new Charm systems, the Armor and Weapon upgrade system, and the new Armor Skills systems are all such a huge improvement over the old ones. The maps are sprawling and large, without the loading screens that plagued the game in between zones of the same map in the old games. This is both a plus and a minus, but they changed the potion drinking mechanic to account for that minus. It is clear Capcom put lots of thought and attention into this game. But it isn't perfect. In the old games, it was impossible to do the main village quests with other people. Those were always solo offline only. The quest pool was separated, and lots of things in the game were locked behind your solo progression in the game, even things you needed for online play. They changed it, and even though it is better than it was, it's not as good as it should be. People who are complaining about the ""difficulty"" of playing with friends are blowing it so far out of proportion, maybe they should seek a different game if figuring out how to play with friends is that hard. Also, currently the servers are dying, and you need to re-host your game server occasionally if a friend gets dropped or you need to add a new one. Otherwise, the game was amazing on the PS4, and it's even more so on the PC."

I only am writing this review for the first time to the disagreement of the other reviews having problems with it so far.I don't know what's up with their internet or PC but the game works fine. Not Perfect because Yes even I had trouble coming to the Error 50382-MW1 but I assure you it does work if you put just a tad bit effort in like creating a new session or whatever.This is by no means a bad game because It's Monster Hunter that originally was supposed to played on PS4 not PCI don't know if you truly expected a PC Port to be 100% Perfect from a company that already puts so much effort into a beloved series and has NEVER done a PC release like this. I'm completely baffled by the amount of ignorance and hatred it gets that gets sent because of it.Give it time and it will work. There will be hiccups sure. But it has worked for me. They've never placed Monster Hunter on a PC so you gotta give em respect for atleast trying to do their research hence the long 7 months it took for it to release. And I have never lost faith in a Monster Hunter game. It's my all time favorite Series since Freedom Unite and I HIGHLY recommend this game to you and friends.Seriously if a friend can play it and connect to sessions on a potato of a laptop and internet. I'm very sure there's not much excuse here. All I'm asking is that you can wait a bit longer or play the game cause it deserves to be played and respected as a GOOD game.

It's environments is beautiful that is full of life (predator, herbivore, food chain and stuff). For me, it's shines the brightest on the first level (jungle area) because of how beautiful and pumped up the music was. Other area lack that greatness from the first area, especially the music.I also think the endgame after completing all quest is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Enemies just deal a lot of damage and the only way to counter it is to get a rare random item to ""limit break"" your equipment. You can even get that item for the weapon you are not using which felt like a grind.Early game to endgame grind is pretty stable, not too much or too little. Anyway, I think it's a pretty good game.

Then get this game.  If you dislike learning and applying knowledge, this is the worst game for you.  Lots of people like comparing every other hard game to Dark Souls.  This is similar to Dark Souls only in that you must learn and apply what you've learned.  Sure it's hard, but not in the same way.  There isn't much tutorial and this is a pretty hardcore game.  Every mission is a boss monster you have to kill.  Every boss monster gives you loot with which to upgrade your gear.  You start in ""low rank"" where mistakes wont get you killed, before moving to ""high rank"" where it will.  Low Rank is the ""tutorial"".Each ""hunt"" takes on average 10-18 min to or ranging between 2-50 min based on player skill and equipment. If you've never played a monster hunter game before, this one is the most accessible one.That doesn't mean it's very accessible.  The required knowledge is kind of like a wall.  Not kidding.  Be ready to not know what your doing, and find out 30 hours into the game that you should've put an armortalon in your inventory the entire time.If you HAVE played monster hunter before, this is the easiest monster hunter yet!  You don't pose after using items!  Your character acts like they want to live! You can dodge backwards!  No more paintballs, you have scoutflies!You really don't need to learn very much.  One fighting style per weapon, maybe one new move.The slinger is new, but that's rather intuitive.  Also, MH World weapons are designed to not look as cool as lower res MH weapons for some reason.  Also, Tremors now makes you stumble for half an hour.Co-Op (up to 4 people per quest) was spotty for me on release, it seems to have been fixed or something because it's fine now.  I heard some news about your save file possibly corrupting if you ALT-F4 while it's saving, so back up your saves. (didn't happen to me).  On the topic of Co-Op this is a super friendly Co-Op game, unless you die 3 times in a row.  There are multiple ways to fail a quest, but only one of them really ever happens.  Someone who is not prepared for the quest comes in and uses up all the teams lives.  Don't be afraid to play safe.  Overall, this is the:Best Looking, Smoothest Character and Weapon Usage, Shortest, Easiest, Most Accessible, Least Rage Inducing, Least Grindy, Least Endgame Content, Most Realistically Toned, Overall Best, No Tutorial As Usual, Meh Music As Usual, Copy Pasta Recolor Monsters As Usual, Least Healthy MonstersMonHun game out there.10/10 for meDefinitely not for everyone.Can't stress it enough.  If you like learning mechanics and applying what you know, this is your game, and visa versa."

We used to take pride on having the best platform to run our games and having the knowhow to keep it that way. To be fair, Monster Hunter World far less friendly or appealing to 'casual' players, but at this point it's gone far beyond personal taste. Anyone who can't take more than five minutes to learn a mechanic in a game shouldn't be reviewing PC games.Now, players can't even be bothered to figure out how to use a multiplayer lobby, or even read a guide, before they write negative reviews and drive titles into the ground because they don't provide the child grade accessibility and instant gratification of games like PUBG or CSGO. In such cases, these games are designed with accessibility in mind to make it easier for you (and children) to spend real money on their loot crates and other microtransactions.If you are reading this review, and you are a competent PC gamer, you have almost nothing to fear from this port of Monster Hunter World. If you can rollback your drivers, are within recommended spec, and know how to optimize your graphics options beyond ""low-medium-high"", you can easily dial in a smooth experience. The server issues have been almost completely resolved, with no more disconnects during missions. With proper setup I've managed 40-60 fps on high settings with my modest GTX 970/i5 rig at 1440p. The biggest issue I had was not being able to start the game within the first days of launch because Denuvo servers were not responding, but that's been fixed for a while."

The port isn't perfect (mostly network issues), but it is so much fun and sounds like it runs better than the console versions. I'm playing on a Nvidia GTX 1060 6gb with an i5 4590 and it's running at a stable 60 fps for me with minor adjustments to the settings. If you're a fan of games with a ton of replay value, can enjoy possibly replaying different things or trying to hunt down specific monsters for particular upgrades that you really want, and limitless co-op options, along with the pace of this games combat and preparation systems, this is fantastic. There is nothing else that comes close to this for me on PC. Toukiden and Dark Souls kind of scratch a similar itch, but there's something different about Monster Hunter that those games have never been able to reach for me.It's got a pretty interesting story so far and the game looks absolutely beautiful to me. The changes that have been made to make the game more accessible are really neat too. Things like no longer having to equip a map, not having to worry about using paintballs to tag monsters so you can track them between zones, the fact that each zone is one big world, and even the concept of these larger online lobbies is awesome. They've put a lot of work into making this game and this port great, and I think it shows. I'm only using a 16:9 monitor, so I can't speak for ultra widescreen or super high refresh rates, but I really do think this is truly special and worth a look if it sounds interesting.I am a gigantic Monster Hunter fan, but the only current gen console I have is a Switch. I bought the japanese version of MHXX on Switch, thinking it was the only new Monster Hunter game that was going to happen. Shortly afterwards, they announced MHW with a PS4, Xbox One, and later PC release date. I've been waiting all year for this moment, constantly checking the release date, and I am so happy this game is on PC, running as well as it is, and even though it currently has a mixed score, there are consistently over 200,000 players online. That is insane, and it's like I'm watching my baby go out into the wild and getting the opportunity to see how well it's being embraced by old players and newcomers alike.I'm looking forward to see what kinds of patches they do in the future, but besides the network issues, this is so cool.

I am now switching my review to a positive as a result. However there is still a glaring issue with the game's optimization. Namely utilizing a large amount of the CPU for no apparent reason, and having weird graphic hiccups on some monsters with extra special effects (namely the one elder dragon with the wind).The game is amazing on PC. Controls take a little bit getting used to, or you can always plug in a controller. However I do NOT recommend the game in its current state due to the fact the multiplayer constantly cuts out even in the middle of a expedition/hunt. Which leaves you soloing a boss that you may not have the gear for or the experience for. I will change my review to a positive when they fix this issue. You can still have fun. Everything else is as a Monster Hunter. Everything else is somewhat positive. But I have lost many hunts, and hours of time from online dropping out."

However the state that this game is in makes it far from worth the £50 price tag associated with it. Let me list a few of the initial things that have really annoyed me with this game.Pros - - Great concept with fresh idea's and something I really want to try out- Good amount of content and continued updates and support- Cool features and I like the Palico'sCons - -(YOU CAN'T EVEN DISSABLE MOTION BLUR OR THE CUSTARDY MOUSE SMOOTHING WITH CONSOLE AUOTAIM ENABLED BY DEFAULT ON PCCCC?- Unintuitive and horribly clunky controls (and this is coming from an avid Arma player)- Akward and broken networking and matchmaking. (for the price tag this game boasts it should have consistend solid multiplayer and the social hub should at least be expanded to the whole of Astera.) - Dodgy quest recognition in multiplayer (I had to repeat a quest TWICE because it never recognized the first completion of it as I did it with friends???!!?)- Invisible walls literally everywhere and generaly a restrictive environment (Purely to make up for a lack of good world design)- A one hour long tutorial that rips the camera from your hand every 30 seconds to point it at something you don't necessarily want to look at).- Bad performance considering the mediocre graphics the game provides.- Some classes are so badly ported that 50% of your actions cannot be cancelled and result in you just watching as your character gets slapped about and killed.- To give an example of how convoluted this game can be. If you want to play a quest with a friend. You must first join their server which may fail a few times, You must then do the quest yourself just untill you finish all the cutscenes. After that you must abandon your quest and join theirs after they have watched all the cutscenes (this make may fail to connect a few times too), After that you both ready up and hope for the best.TL:DR - This game has some good ideas and would be amazing if it were a £20 game. But for a £50 game it is clunky, unfinished, uses outdated mechanics like invisible walls, has horrible networking and matchmaking, has poor performance for a mediocre looking game, and is ported poorly."

(Which isn't a problem, since I also love GenU right now as well, but y'know, it's nice)- Quality of life changes are great.        - Now, you don't stand in one place consuming things, and then flexing, which is great for versatility.        - Whetstones are infinite        - The map is all interconnected! Now you wont go flying into a loading screen if you get hit near a loading zone for the next area!         - Gunlance, at least in my opinion, got some major buffing, which is awesome.- The environments are gorgeously crafted, and i love exploring. Monsters are almsot treated as actual living things!- No weapon or playstyle is dicernably bad compared to any other one - Basically endless gameplay!

(Iceborn) Hell yeah!Now for some cons, however- Weapon and armor design is not super unique and varied compared to earlier entries, there are some exceptions, though.- Story multiplayer is weird, you've seen it before... You gotta watch the cutscene first before you can make a mutiplayer story quest.. yadda yadda- The game requires a pretty hefty cpu if you want it to run smooth(er)- Some bugs here and there, though not many... at least from what i've seen. I can't say what it'll be like for others. Capcom seems pretty on top of patches, though- SOS flares are a gamble, it's either very helpful hunters, or dudes with no armor and a hunting horn only playing music in a corner, it really depends- RNG, which gets pretty frustrating sometimes- Monster variation. Don't get me wrong, I love the monsters right now, But it's all just reptiles and stuff. We need like Nerscylla, or the leviathan skeleton or something.- I wish you could just craft your decorations insteadOverall MHW is a very solid entry, and i'm super happy that Capcom went with the next gen market with this game! Great hunts, great maps, great hunters! Grab some friends (or not, you can solo, too) and get out there! Guide our way, Sapphire Star!"

As I hate oversized weapons and near all of Anime culture and art.However MHW was a pleasant surprise I’ll get into later.What is making write this review now is how much Capcom has listened to the community and fixed the major gripes with this game that really made it unenjoyable to play, such as being able to remove the virtual joystick for camera controls, and be able to remove effects such as motion blur. Without those changes, I could not give this a positive review.As for the gameplay, I love it. Smooth flowing, but really punishing if you mess up, but gives you the chance to retreat, heal and reassess. Bar a few difficulty spikes and the low rank (start of the game) being somewhat easy and VERY short, its solid.High rank (mid game) is where the fun and buildcraft starts. Where skills, weapon and then what monster you’re fighting really start to matter. Along with player skill.I massively enjoy the grinding and perfecting mentality of the game, coupled with the somewhat basic building system for your equipment. It’s a shame you’re often stuck with bad looking armour though, but there are a few ways around that.The story continues through high rank despite being much more lacking till you get towards the end, where it picks up again.After the story, some more options open up to you allowing you to progress and develop your armour and weapons. Some of these fights can be quite hard as a group and really shows how Capcom missed the mark with their scaling difficulty (solo is easier).Overall well worth the price, even if the massive lack of monsters really make the game feel hollow after a while. I would have much preferred to have more non elder dragons worthy of my time and energy, along with more of those in game have tempered versions."
2588,Mogelfur,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052953648/,3,,1,407.3,August,"24,",364,0,1,"Keep in mind that currently I am mostly playing Singleplayer and have done so since Monster Hunter Tri, 4U and so on for the 3DS console system.This game is a monster hunter game which eliminated a lot of hassles normaly (and silently endured) encountered in the other games. You don't have to carefully handpick needed objects before the start of the quest since you always bring your Box with you to a quest, buffing by eating a cooked meal is also possible on the fly and you don't have to stand still to consume items. So far, so easy.Monsters are still challenging, although I fear that the game itself might have become less complex. Which is okay in my opinion, since the quality of the game itself is still quite high. The game conveys a much higher sense of a breathing and living ecosystem than, for example, ARK. Ever watched a scaled wyvern-like huge reptile taking a bath and giving its best impression of a pidgeon in a small pond? Now you have the chance to do so.Controls for uninitiated are usually difficult to learn and to master and if patience is not your virtue, you might not get a kick out of this game. Especially since Multiplayer is still very wonky. However, I frequently make similar experiences with my 3DS system, so I don't care that much about MP disconnects and inconveniences on this matter. In my opinion this is critique on high levels.Recommended!"

Yes it's not well optimized and yes my cpu usage is high but it's not so bad that it deserves a bad recommendation.Why you might ask? Because the game is amazing. There are so many different and challenging monsters to hunt. The 14 weapons all play so differently from each other that you could play the game through 14 times and it wouldn't feel like you were redoing it. And because of this the grind takes a very long time to feel like a grind. I'm at 123.4 hours and I'm just now starting to feel it but I have so many different weapons to explore that I am okay with it.The world is beautiful and feels truly lived in. The soundtrack is pleasant and appropriate.Yes, the game has problems and for that I would never give it a 10/10. The port has problems. The mouse controls aren't optimal however I find them acceptable never feeling like I NEED the controller. I have used M&K for all 123 hours. If the port was perfect though.

2598,A Fancy Fridge Magnet,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960522414/,2,,1,"1,493.8",October,"29,",935,0,1,"This is my first Monster Hunter game, and I absolutely love it. I played half of the story missions completely solo (well, I had my palico with me), and while my progress was slow at first, I always felt like I was learning and becoming better at combat. The combat is generally slow and methodical, as many weapons tend to have slow but powerful attacks. You absolutely cannot button mash in this game and be successful.There are many types of weapons, and learning how to use all of your weapon's moves is important, but it's even more important to learn each and every monster's moveset and attacks. Proper positioning and dodging is crucial against tougher enemies. It sometimes took me many, many tries to be able to defeat a new monster for the first time.. but once you have a lot of experience, you can kill the monster in minutes while laughing in its face. It's a very satisfying experience.This is a game where you will fight the same monsters many, many times to get their materials in order to build better armor and weapons. You don't want to be greedy with materials or money, since farming them becomes MUCH easier with better gear. You can even craft and learn to use items to make fights more manageable, but unlike most games, the grind for materials and resources is effortless and not tedious at all. The armor sets are beautiful, and it feels great to farm a monster for its weapons/armor set. There's no real end-all-be-all build like most games have. Your playstyle dictates what gear would be best for you, and not the other way around.Playing online with friends or even strangers makes the game so much better. You can then rely on teammates to help you out, and comboing with others is a lot of fun. The community is extremely nice and everyone is always looking to farm monsters.I have a handful if nitpicks about the game, but nothing that ruins the experience. The biggest, and only real complaint, is that the ENDGAME grind is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because it's almost completely tied to RNG... even worse... multiple levels of RNG. You upgrade your gear with decorations (jewels) that give you special skills, but some that are very powerful and unlock the true potential of weapons are locked behind extreme RNG... to the point where 450 hrs in the game doesn't even get you one of every decoration. And some of the skills require multiple of the same jewel to unlock the true power. As an example, to augment your weapon you might need TWO of a rare item. The item drop rate itself is low, but you also need to get one for the TYPE of weapon you're using, and also the RARITY level of the weapon. It's absolutely painful, and in a lot of ways you're better off using weapons that compliment the items you've acquired as opposed to trying to wait for a drop that may never come. This design also goes against the ideals of the game, where you're supposed to swap out a weapon for one that corresponds to the monster's elemental weakness, but your strongest weapon will always be the one you augment with rare items--meaning it's just better to use that than to think about elemental weaknesses. You absolutely don't need the upgrades to be successful, but they can definitely enhance your play... you just are at the mercy of RNG.The PC version of this game on release had some problems (namely major server issues), but the game is very stable and gets patched frequently with new content and features. This game absolutely deserves at minimum an 85% review score, and I believe most players have not updated their scores to reflect the server patches. That's not to say the servers are flawless, because some days the servers are bad, but for the most part there's no issue."
2599,Tri-Dent,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198207896324/,5,,0,182.6,August,"18,",259,0,1,"I wish i could wholeheartly recommend this game - I cannot.This is mainly due to Capcoms inresponsiveness to their horrible multiplayer experience. You either fail to find or establish a connection to your friends lobbies, or you suddenly lose connection (yes, this does happen while questing - alot) and are unable to reconnect because the game keeps the slot that you left reserved for you but failes to recognise you the second time. This is especially frustraiting when playing with four players, since the propability for any form of connection error are near to 100%. This does not mean you are not able to play in muliplayer - it means that it is a very taxing and tedious experience. A second mayor problem concering the online multiplayer feature is capcoms lack of integration for storyrelevant cutscenes and multiplayer. Let´s say you are four players who are all building a new character. Now let´s say you want to play one of the requiered story quest together - all four of you are now requiered to start the quest in single player mode, play until you have watched the cutscene (and are informed that you can now use SOS flare) and then quite to post the quest again and have all players join. You might be inclined to think ""Hey let´s just wait till three of us are finished and joint the last of us when he has seen the cutscene"" and yes is you are a fan of gambling this might be an option for you , since it seems to be totaly random if you are able to connect to a quest where a cutscene was watched.Even if you play in singleplayer and are just sometimes in need of help (SOS Flare) you are in for a disappointment. Help is not guaranteed - if you fire your flare in the first 20sec you sometimes do not recieve any help. This is not due to a lack if players (almoste 300.000 when this review was written), no, this is mainly due to the flawed multiplayer feature. It happens more often that you recieve support but only in the last two minutes or so - to late for rewards or proper help. This would be acceptable if there where less players but three players joining at the same time in the last two minutes of a quest seems to be rather odd to me.Beside this there are obvious problems with the FPS. To get to stable FPS (on any PC) you actually had to revert your Driver - even then FPS sometimes drop below 10.All in all Monster Hunter World is a good game. The fights are fun, a new armor part or weapon upgrade gives you the feeling of ""pride and accomplishment"" (and that all without pay-to-win DLC)  and the characters are somewhat likable (except for the Handler). But still, the technical flaws reduce actuall playtime and therefor fun alot. Since these problems have neither been fixed (since release) nor addressed by capcom I do not recommend this game."

But that's besides the point.  If you know what a monster hunter game is, this is that, just with much smoother gameplay.  This lacks the jankiness of the original series' control scheme and movement, making for a much better experience overall.Out of any game I've ever seen, this one blows every one of them out of the water with how the wildlife and ecosystem is explained.  This is imaginative realism to the T, and it's constantly reinforced as you play the game.  Even old monsters are explained as to why they have the abilities they do, with a bit of far-fetched fantasy added in for the most powerful of all Monsters, the Elder Dragons."

You cannot even steer a bit during the combo while I feel like you should. You often find yourself hitting nothing but air with the monster ""behind"" you (but in front of the camera). You may call it difficulty, but it is artificial, non-intuitive and the margins on the input are way too long. This one is my opinion; other games (especially other monster hunters and fighter games) do have this too.. Allowing to do this while using an attack, while mid-air, or while stunned would save a lot of headaches of seeing that red-buff turn into white or orange just because you were doing an animation."

Would recommend this game to everyone who likes action combat and planned methodical fights. You could go all ""Leeroy Jenkins"" in this game but you won't make it past HR then. However at the state the game is in I won't recommend it. It is plagued by terrible port probelems, console content is flat out missing and Capcom decided to ""give us the same experience"" which basically means they want to inflate the games life span artificially by releasing the DLC in a timely fashion. The good? The core game. Very polished, very nice gameplay, best MH game to date. The bad? Endgame content is missing/Console DLC could've been shipped with the base game but they didn't. The port is so bad that it makes you wonder what they did in the 6 months. The ugly? Poor optimization, has problems from being a port, connection issues are beyond frequent if you play outside your closed session. This will drive you mad, if you are even able to play it.Only buy this game now if you know what youre getting into and if you are fine with technical problems / connection issues.Will turn this review to positive once the issues are fixed.Edit: They fixed my issues with a patch. Game runs smoothly now and I dont have any connection issues anymore. Capcom please hurry up with the extra content. I recommend this game now, has a solid 100 hours of playtime if you play fast."

As a veteran who's owned MH games from nearly every generation starting from the original PS2 title, I will say that this is, in my opinion, the best monster hunter game ever made.It maintains all of the challenge and fun of its forebearers while making the game more accessible by pruning out the fake difficulty and tedious features present in previous titles, cutting out hair-pulling RNG mechanics like the old charm system along with making collecting materials for potions and joining quests significantly quicker - letting you spend more time actually hunting monsters. The grind has been cut down with the introduction of material melding, allowing you to get materials like the infamous plates and gems without pouring several hours into killing or capturing the same thing over and over. A slew of new features have been added to enrich gameplay such as mantles and boosters, permenant tools with cooldowns that confer benefits at no material cost to you that can range from producing a healing field or camoflauging yourself with a ghillie suit, and much more. The new scoutfly mechanic is something I never knew I needed, it's just so convenient and gives the sensation of becoming a more skilled tracker as I upgrade them with every quest I embark upon. Both fun and much less irritating than paintballing. Never before in any MH title have we had such freedom with exploring. Every map is open ended, and you can climb and crawl around nearly anything and fast travel to unlocked camps all over the map provided you aren't in combat. I have been spoiled for any other MH title with the new pace of gamplay and convenience these features provide. You even have a canteen at the campsite and access to ALL of your equipment and items inside the camp tent. Remember those times you cried inside because you forgot to replenish your items or eat before embarking on a quest? No worries here!For those new to the franchise, this is a great way to get introduced to it. It's a challenging game with a wealth of different weapon classes with their own distinctive playstyles along with epic monstrous creatures to track and hunt, and this is the most accessible title thus far."

Although some of the greatest features are the ones that really make the game so good like how if your fighting one monster and another one comes along they don't always team up on you like other games. They often end up fighting each other and can be a real cool view. The environment is really pretty and the monster can be really challenging without buddies and if you don't have full knowledge on your weapon type. I hope this helps anyone new and interested in this game!

If co-op with random players is a key draw for you, you might consider waiting a week or two while they iron out the kinks.Basic Gameplay:Mostly this is a game where you hunt huge monsters for loot, craft gear with that loot, and repeat.  There are also many gatherable materials throughout the world which you will use to craft consumables, however you will have the opportunity to automatically gain 1-3 different types of plant or insect materials after each quest, so you typically won't need to grind for gathering spots too often.The overall monster hunt combat is an ARPG-style fight where you will seek to hit a monster's weak points while avoiding its attacks.  Combat is not quite as fast paced or fluid compared to ARPGs such as Nioh, but it's still quite fun.Pros: - There are a large number of weapon choices, each has a lot of depth to master, and the playstyles are very different, from the lancer carefully engaging from behind the shield to the insect glaive user doing aerial acrobatics and riding on the monster's back.  None of the weapon options are a bad choice, and you'll find something here to fit pretty much any playstyle. - Combat is challenging enough to entertain while being more accessible than the extremely hardcore ARPGs. - There's a lot of different consumables that can support different playstyles as well.  Except for elder dragons, any large monster in the game can be either killed or captured, for identical rewards. - The game can be played single-player (you can always have an NPC companion and can recruit up to two others during a mission), or with parties of up to four players.  Two-player is the hardest in terms of scaling, but I have played a lot of the game in that mode and it's definitely been doable.  You can play with specific other players or easily recuit (and be recruited) for random matchmaking. - Some of the fights can be pretty epic, even for the action RPG genre which is no stranger to over-the-top fights.Cons:  - The biggest cons so far are connectivity issues.  While I've had zero issue with friends whose online sessions I joined, playing with random players through the SOS system has resulted in about 10-15% of sessions disconnecting before the mission was complete.  This is likely to be something they fix soon. - Story is pretty minimal. It's there, but don't expect a masterpiece of storytelling.  At best the story is ""passable"".  There was never a point where I was excited to learn more about the lore or the world, though, which was disappointing as I usually like to get into game lore. - Combat isn't quite as fluid as other ARPGs like Nioh."

At first I thought the controls and weapon drawbacks were stupid but I realize they are in place to preserve balance. The game does an excellent job of the scale of the monsters and the destruction they cause. The voice acting is a little corny and the story is kinda weak, but it gets the job done. You don't really care about about the story anyway- it's all about the hunt. Internet connection issues plauged my online gameplay from the start and the in game voice chat sucks, but most of those issues have been fixed as of late. It's cool to solo (to learn how the weapons function and study the monsters' behavioral patterns) but better with friends for the bigger and harder hunts. Get some friends."

I was looking for things I could do with my partner. We were looking for something more exciting and engaging than hanging out at each other's islands in Animal Crossing. I'd played some Monster Hunter Tri (on the Wii) in the past, but hadn't really kept up with the series.What I found was a beautiful experience of playing together. As others have pointed out plenty of times, co-op through the story is a hassle because you need to get through the cut scenes before you can co-op a story mission. But outside of that, there were so many opportunities to just get into the game and punch monsters of every shape and size. We tried out different builds together, we tackled everything from Anajanaths to Kulve Taroth as a team. We had so many exciting and thrilling moments of exploring the world, working together, and just delighting in all the interactions we had over it.I'm just sad we weren't able to carry that same love and enthusiasm over to the next game in the series. Maybe one day there will be a MHW2 I can look forward to spending hundreds more hours in.10/10, this game changes lives and builds relationships."

2699,Chickenori,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chickenori/,2,,1,175.5,April,"4,",135,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a very fun game where you,  ; hunt monsters. The major gameplay loop has you hunt monsters, use their parts to create better armor and weapons so that you can hunt bigger and tougher monsters.  You have 14 different kinds weapons to pick from, making it perfect to experiment and find the ones that fit your play style. The combat is really solid and makes it very satisfying to master, though it may take some practice. After fighting a monster you can use parts carved from its body to forge new weapons and armor. You usually wont have enough to make it after fighting it once so you will need to grind for the gear you want, but that isnt a bad thing, as it makes it feel extremely rewarding when you finally get the gear you've been wanting. Getting new gear is a great reward that will keep you coming back. The world is very well built and fun to be in. Youll start in the research base Astera as part of the research commission, where you are tasked to solve the mystery of the elder crossing, a mysterious phenomenon where elder dragons are crossing the sea every decade to go to the new world. It an epic story and it makes your hunts feel as if you are contributing to something bigger every time you solve a mystery and report it to the commander. The New World itself if very beautiful and feels lives in by all the monsters in it. The ecosystems are all very well though out and you can use the environments to your advantage as you hunt. This is a very solid game with hundreds if not thousands of hours of content. Some of the fights are very tough and you'll want to bring a friend, but you can do it by yourself too. The graphics are probably the best in the series and it is a very complete game. And that's not even taking account the dlc witch adds a whole new games worth of content on top of it. While the game is not getting updates anymore and is no longer the most recent game in the series, it is an absolute masterpiece that is worth every penny. (and you can find it on sale often)I highly recommend it if it looks interesting to you, you will not regret it."

2702,obtv123™,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107986577/,2,,1,363.9,March,"4,",45,0,1,"Monster hunter, one of the most prominent RPG game series to have ever been made, have finally made its debut on PC platform for the very first time in the form of Monster Hunter: World (MHW), presenting us with an insanely high graphic quality, alongside an addictive game-play that retained the charm of older games in the series combined with a relatively big and complex open world maps to play in, wield cool massive weapons and dive right in to hunt gigantic beasts as the master hunter of the fifth fleet!MHW is a game about, well, hunting monsters, and for people not familiar with the Monster Hunter series, it is not what you would expect from most other RPGs where you go in and grind away at small monsters to level up your stats then face off against the boss, instead MHW makes the player square off against what most would consider a boss enemy one after the other, and then repeatedly grind said “bosses” to get their gear to improve your stats. The learning curve of MHW can certainly be challenging, the difficulty jumps can at times be overwhelming, it did take me over 3 tries and 8 deaths or so to make it past the Anjannath. Aside from mechanical difficulties of the game, there are many concepts you need to learn to play the game properly such as how exactly does the canteen work, what are all these slinger ammo, where to find these materials, etc. All of which could be tedious to learn if you dislike reading a lot of texts, as there are only text based tutorials available. Although difficult, learning the game is sure to be rewarding as it expands on the amount of things you could do, and fun things you could try.Every large monster in this game has their own unique and complex move-set with an iconic look to them, making nearly every fight memorable, and even if you have beaten them, you could take some more time to fight them again to learn their pattern and get better at the game. Aside from the variety of enemies, MHW also offers 14 weapons of choice, all of which are unique, playing each one feels like playing a completely different game, not to mention the skill cap of these weapons which are very high, therefore rewarding us for actually spending time with the weapon to master them. Combining the high skill level and variety of content, makes MHW one of the most re-playable games, being fresh and entertaining even after clocking in hundreds of hours.All in all, MHW’s main selling point is in its complexity, the deeper you go, the more you find, even idly sitting by to customize your build is fun as there are limitless amount of combinations you can come up with, and its rather organic and non-snappy controls offers a challenge unlike most other games. This very strength of MHW though is also probably its weakness that kept it from becoming a mainstream appeal, as the organic control could feel clunky at times, and the depth that MHW offers can certainly be overwhelming, though I certainly urge you to at least give this game a try, spend some time learning, and if you do like it, MHW will give you one of the most satisfying and exciting game-play experience a game can offer."

There might be some bugs, or whatever but everything ain't perfect. THIS SHTHDSF IS PERFECT AND I LOVE IT! Once you understand the mechanics of the game, things to collect, to achieve and expand stuff, it'll be so fun. This is where Side-quests are important and gives you back something. Lastly, I think once you finish the story, it'll just be focused on getting Higher Rank and Decorations for further upgrades like protection and damage etc. It's up to you if you wanna grind, and I tell ya, it's still fun. This MMORPG is underrated fr, but there are still a good amount of players that play, that when you can't finish the Monster... THROW UP AN S.O.S. FLARE! Players with the same HR (Hunter Rank) as you might drop in and adds some help, but MOST OF THE TIME, IT'S A BORED HIGH RANKED PLAYER THAT'LL HELP YA. Either way, community seems like a bunch of good people. There is so much DLC's too choose at and yeah, if you want more storyline and different things after MHW's New World, try out Icebourne. Buy at your own risk but I'll tell ya, I'm a supporter of Monster Hunter and DEFINITELY TRY THIS OUT!

As a story I can say that it is one of the best games I've played, good lore, and a great fighting system.Yes you can play with PS4 / XboX controller.

Game play dissolves to 'beat up big creature till it stops moving' but the different weapon choices and combat styles you can adapt makes it so much more enjoyable. Some people say this game can get difficult, but if you have two working eyes and hands and something called patience you shouldn't have too much of a problem. 10/10 Worth every digital penny."

2753,✪V1cisiouS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VicisiouS/,2,,1,639.1,June,"26,","2,290",1,1,"Starting of with the story, It's real fun to know new monsters as the story progresses but as we move on it really gets challenging as their ability enhances. Simply put, if you like the essence of grinding, then, you'll love the game in general. If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game. Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Prepare to spend good 10-15 mins to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible. Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom. If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others very easily without any hassle. No server issues anymore as well. Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co-op, but on sale."

The combat systems are in general the same across all the series, with little bonus mechanics added in/taken out of each installment. This game allows you the freedom of choice for weapons, and they all are absolutely amazing when played properly. Each one has specific playstyles, or even cater to specific groups of people. Of course, there are 'metas', like the Longsword and Bowguns, but that doesn't make the others any less viable. Of course, the MH franchise also has a great learning curve. I like to compare the combat to Dark Souls, as more people know/have heard of it, but with a lot more gradual, eased in learning curve. You're not just plopped into a 'tutorial' boss that'll mop the floor with you, you work your way up to those creatures, learning your weapon(s) along the way. It's really, REALLY well done for teaching people the combat system, and even the dodge mechanic. Even if it has way less i-frames than any dark souls, heh.Last but not least, unlike all the previous MH games, World actually feels ALIVE. Open world maps, creatures that fight against each other and not with each other like all the past games, even the use of scoutflies is great. As the old way of tracking didn't make all that much sense to me personally (paintballs). Even invasive creatures interrupting your fight feels more natural, as they usually have turf wars, some of which are absolutely awesome (rajang vs jho). So yes, I 100% think everyone should at least try MH, if it catches their eye."

In short, MHW is not an easy game, but I think it is easily the best one I’ve played. It rewards patience and practice, and conquering a difficult monster is one of the most satisfying feelings in the world--before you inevitably hunt said monster into extinction because you need more of its teeth and a piece of its frontal cranium to stick on your funky hammer that looks like a bastardized axe for your own amusement.TLDR: Demanding but highly satisfying learning curve for both weapons and monsters, diverse large maps to explore and environments to use to your advantage, attention to small details like capturing endemic life and thoughtful NPC interactions. I started out really badly, missing hits and getting whacked around constantly by even the earliest monsters. As an old Warframe player, the lack of mobility in MHW was quite jarring, shown by the countless times I’ve tried to dodge and failed miserably. After the initial battering, the next step is about perseverance, revisiting monsters to farm materials to get stronger armor and weapons. It’s an uphill battle, especially if you need to repeatedly do a monster that took 30 minutes and 2 faints the first time you tried. It’s about fighting the monster and yourself, as you really need to think one step ahead and pace yourself according to the enemy. The diverse range of weapons the MH franchise offers is no secret, giving players many different ways to fight the same monsters. In my opinion, every weapon is great and fun, and while it takes a lot of time to learn and master certain ones, it’s never a bad idea to have multiple main weapons to see you through different hunts. I love the insect glaive like nothing else, and I’ll die on this hill. (not literally) But for monsters that are more ferocious, I tend to approach them more cautiously with the lance or charge blade with their incredible mix of defensive and offensive capabilities, for example.This journey of constant learning and relearning forms the bulk of my MHW experience, and even as I’m gearing up for the final boss I’m still working out the moves of monsters I’ve already conquered, and learning new weapons. I found this process of self-improvement to be the most satisfying part of the game, and something I haven’t been able to find in any other franchise to date. There’s no better feeling than greeting a monster like an old friend before you kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of each other, with a fast-paced fight that makes you feel almost invincible as you dodge, weave or just walk out of the way of attacks that used to rend the flesh off your bones.MHW has seen me through some tough times as well, so the sense of achievement I attained from overcoming great beasts here has also kept me going in the real world.As the name implies, MHW emphasizes the world it has created, giving players several maps to explore. Besides being pretty, these locations provide diverse areas to fight monsters in. As you chase monsters from one area to the next, you’ll find no shortage of ledges, slopes, vine traps, loose boulders or even cannons to gain the upper hand in a battle. This is something that’s very much less present in older MH titles, something I realised after playing MHGU a month ago. While the same few maps can get old after hundreds of hours, I think that it was very thoughtful to have such features in the first place that spice up the fight more often than not. Moreso, I enjoyed the exploration itself, running around freely in expeditions to collect mushrooms, look for shortcuts or befriend the local cats--who can actually help out a lot in hunts. Befriending the Grimalkyne tribes in each map means they may set up vine traps to ensnare a monster, or even drop a whole firing squad to give you a chance to brutalize your quarry. I also enjoyed collecting the endemic life, though it is a much smaller part of the game. As an animal lover, I was stunned when I threw my net at a random bird on the beach and got to bring it home as a pet. Almost any creature you see in the wild is either a material or a potential pet to let loose in your room, and I have spent many hours hunting down fluffy birds to keep, or fishing for majestic fish in the frozen bowels of the arctic. This is not compulsory unless you’re going for 100% achievements, but I feel it’s a very nice touch to the game, making the world seem more alive. While nobody ever plays Monster Hunter for the story, I feel like MHW had a decent storyline, following abnormal behavior of a great dragon and pioneering exploration into the New World to uncover the secrets of the land. While not terribly emotional, I feel that it was linear enough to be clear, and gave story quests some meaning. I do feel that the NPCs were crafted with a lot of thought, seeing how different fleets were sent to the New World every 10 years, each with different specialties like engineering, resource management, research or hunting. This does shape NPCs’ attitudes and lines, especially if they hail from different fleets. Moreso, MHW gives presence to the player, as NPC voice lines change according to the recent quests players have completed, or if the player is about to square up against a tough foe. I remember the day I completed all the optional quests in MHW, and I was presented with a bonus quest to hunt 4 challenging monsters in a row. After my success, every NPC in the hub presented me with a short congratulatory message, and it differed significantly between everyone, from the novice hunters strolling around to the resident botanist, and even the sailors who helped out at port managed to get a word in. I recall walking to the highest point in Astera and speaking to the Admiral, who had quite the speech prepared. I screenshotted the whole conversation, and I still look at it from time to time when I'm feeling sappy. It’s a small detail, but I have heartfelt appreciation for the team that decided to implement it, giving some weight to my actions, and making MHW even more immersive. All the NPCs are now clamoring for me to face off against the final boss, so in a way I feel like their hopes and dreams are on my back too.It’s a long review, but I feel like I couldn’t have discounted my feelings for this game with less words. MHW remains my favorite game of all time, and has even encouraged me to delve further into the series with other titles like MHGU and MHR, and now I eagerly await the release of MHST2. If you have any doubts about buying this game, it’s never too late to start. It’s more fun with friends (though I insisted on doing mostly everything solo) so grab your buddies and don’t hesitate to call on pubs if you need help--some randoms are actually really good!Happy Hunting!Edit: I beat the final boss for the first time, and on a solo hunt! I finished the quest with 30s left on the clock, but it was really satisfying to get it done, and go through all the NPC dialogue at the end. There's a cool nod to characters from the previous generations as well, which is a nice touch!Second edit: The endgame grind can get droll, but it's still a blast to play, and a means to pass the time while we all wait for MHRise's PC release, and Sunbreak! I've managed to solo the final boss 15 times now, and while not perfect these hunts have given me some seriously hair raising thrills. I look forward to the challenges I'll find in other games of the series!"

I played Monster Hunter World before Iceborne was released on the PS4, I would guess my total hours in the game is closer to 800 if that counts for anything. I'm going to do something a little more unique with my review, I'm going to give tips that will save you both confusion and frustration before giving my actual review.#1. Make item loadouts. This will minimize time spent in item management menus, and more time actually slapping dinosaur pickles (that's not an innuendo).      a. If you go into your menu you will see an option to customize radial menu. Set up your radial menu for          access to quick crafting of items while on hunts. You  find yourself needing more megapotions,         more traps, more flashpods, more tranq bombs, etc. (There's an option for controllers to change how         you select items on the radial menu to be a click of the right joystick, which I highly recommend.)     b. If you go into the menus and go into your item pouch, if you hit Triangle (PS), Y (Xbox), or X (PC), you         can rearrange your item bar so you can organize your consumables as you cycle through them.     c. Anytime you make ANY changes to the item bar, or radial menu, or item pouch, SAVE THE LOADOUT         AGAIN OR IT WILL BE REVERTED WHEN YOU SELECT THAT LOADOUT AGAIN. Don't be this guy, who        did his item loadouts countless times because I didn't know this. #2. You can capture monsters. If they start to limp and run away, they are capturable. This will take either a pitfall or more commonly a shock trap and 2 tranq bombs. I recommend using the tranq bombs before the traps. Once you have used the tranq bombs just place a trap and boom, hunt complete. You get bonus rewards for capturing and also save time from having to fight the last 20% or so remaining hp of the monster. #3. Always carry flashpods. They can be made with flash bugs, and will briefly stun and blind a monster. This can give you and/or your teammates a safe opportunity to heal if you find yourself in an ""uh-oh"" situation. Additionally, any flying monsters, (with  few exceptions) will be knocked out of the sky and stunned should they be flashed while flying. This gives you and your teammates an opening to freely attack the monster, and prevents most flying monsters from doing their most annoying attacks, particularly for melee users.#4. Go into the training area as soon as you can and try every single weapon. If you find yourself liking a weapon watch a youtube video showcasing the weapon and all the things it can do. Many weapons have some special mechanics, that the game either doesn't explain at all or doesn't do it very well. Don't let these videos overwhelm you, and don't worry about memorizing every single mechanic right now, use it as a glimpse of what you'll be able to do eventually. Every weapon is a tool for you the hunter, and like a tool, each one has it's uses and it's strengths once you learn to use it properly. Find the tool of death and destruction that works for you. Should you get MHW? Well, I guess the thumb at the top has spoiled the answer, but yes, I believe the game with Iceborne expansion package is worth full price. The game has many fantastic parts to it, in my opinion, but I will not refuse to acknowledge some of the problems this game has. So lets just get it over with. Unskippable cutscenes. Probably my biggest gripe with this game my first and second time playing through it, but granted I played through the base game already on PS4 before, so it was probably particularly painful for me. It wouldn't be as bad if some of the cutscenes weren't Final Fantasy length, going on for 3 to 5 minutes at points. Another problem, is that there can be some very annoying mechanics, mainly in the early/mid game which can definitely hurt enjoyment of the title. The first thing that comes into my mind are stuns. Nothing has caused me more frustration then getting hit, taking a nice 3 seconds to stand up, being stunned another 3 to 4 seconds, then before I can recover from the stun, the monster recovers, turns and goes for another swing which has lead to countless deaths to not only me but others as well. However, while this will lead to a positive for the game, it the game much harder and more frustrating to new players, which can turn people off to this game before they get to the parts that really make the game great.If you're not careful, and to a point even if you are careful, your time in the game can quickly become primarily spent looking at item management menus or looking at the blacksmith comparing new armors and weapons to what you currently have. Monster Hunter is very much a game that's hard to learn and even harder to master. However, much like a game like Dark Souls, the difficulty is heavily influenced by the player's experience and knowledge. And with that, MHW is a very rewarding game to learn. I learned an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of brute force. The simple act of bringing flashpods to the first Rathalos fight can turn a 35min hunt into a 15min one.  Which brings me to talk about how knowledge overcomes many of the annoying parts of this game. Tired of being poisoned, stunned, interrupted from the monster roaring? Get some antidotes or equipment with poison resistance, get equipment with stun resistance, get equipment with earplugs. You know you can roll to dodge monster roars with the iframes it gives? It's challenging, but entirely possible and it's a step toward mastery. If ever you're fighting a monster and you find yourself thinking, ""this is really annoying"" there is always something you can do to either mitigate or negate it. It's all a matter of thinking about how you can, and inventing or adopting new hunting methods. Over time you'll learn more and more options through discovery on your own. Many special slinger ammo can interrupt a monster. You can cancel annoying attacks before the monster starts them. You can utilize environmental traps, or small ledges to do jump attacks and mount the monster. After 800+ hours I'm still learning little things I can do against monsters I've fought a hundred times. That to me is what makes this game awesome. There's no singular right way to play, you have freedom to do things as by the book or as unorthodox as you want. It's that same freedom that allows you to tailor your equipment and playstyle to counter anything you personally find annoying. There are countless strategies for each monster and each environment. All of this paired with interesting equipment options, tons of options to use on monsters in hunts, powerful hits that FEEL powerful through a computer screen, and that sense of satisfaction that comes from overcoming challenges that can sometimes feel like a mountain. I love this game, and while it's not for everyone, I think everyone should at least try it."

One of them even gifted it to me on console and I STILL hardly played it (kinda messed up lol I know oops). Fast forward to 2020, and I decided to give the game an honest try. As one might guess from the amount of hours I ultimately ended up putting into a PvE game, I've gotten more than my money's worth. I enjoyed this game so much that I even ended up posting speedruns for my favorite hunts online. I made a mistake by not playing it earlier. Monster Hunter: World is at its core a quest-based cooperative PvE experience where up to four players kill or capture various monsters. The durability of a monster scales with how many players are in the hunt, having one, two, and 3-4 player scaling. The game tells its story primarily through quests featuring a hunt with accompanying dialogue. To prepare for these hunts, players can upgrade their weapons as well as their armor through the collection of various monster materials they collect on the field. They also can prepare item pouches prior to setting out that can benefit them during a hunt. This is not the game for you if you're specifically looking for a game with a deep, insightful plot. While the story is not at all bad, it stands out in neither its delivery nor its quality. The main questline serves most importantly to the player as a way to keep them invested in the core gameplay loop: hunting monsters.  As the game progresses, knowledge of the monster you're hunting becomes more important. ""Should I use an elemental weapon, and if so, which element?"" ""How can I get this monster to slow down?"" ""Where's the weak spot?"" If you don't know the answers to these questions, you'll be making the hunt that much harder on yourself. There's a monster in the Iceborne expansion called ""Barioth"" who has a reputation for serving as a ""wall"" for players who are unprepared for him due to his swiftness. However, if you know or figure out that you need to break one or both of his front arms to decrease his speed and give yourself more windows to attack him, the hunt becomes significantly more manageable. Knowledge of the monster's moveset combined with familiarity with your weapon also is an important part of combat. Attacks such as the Sword and Shield's Perfect Rush, Longsword's Helmsplitter, Greatsword's True Charged Slash, and several other attacks initially seem difficult to effectively employ in combat unless the monster is trapped or toppled. However, as you grow more familiar with a monster's attacks, you'll begin to see more and more windows to land your strongest attacks that at first you struggled weaving into your gameplay. As you play through the game, you will discover new monsters, and every monster has its own unique set of armor players can craft. The base defense of armor can be upgraded through ""armor spheres."" Different armor sets also come with different ""skills"" preloaded to a certain level on the armor. You can increase the level of a skill, and therefore increase its effectiveness, by equipping ""decorations,"" usually called ""decos"" by players, to your armor pieces. Decorations are earned primarily by hunting ""tempered"" monsters, which are souped-up monsters that deal more damage and have more health. There are also various armor set bonuses that one can only benefit from by equipping a certain amount of armor pieces from a specific armor set. This system of armor progression combined with the fact that there are over 100 skills in the game allow a great amount of creativity with your builds. There are an equally numerous amount of weapons in the game. There are various crafting trees that allow players to produce a variety of weapons that are capable of a litany of effects, from statuses like paralysis and sleep to elements such as fire and ice. In short, making builds is an integral part of the game as the player progresses, growing more vast in scope as more monsters and their materials are introduced. There are also various sidequests in the game that unlock special tools, meal ingredients, garden slots, and more. Co-op, while it might not be the most efficient way to play the game, is without a doubt the most fun. The hectic-yet-controlled nature of multiplayer hunts make them memorable experiences, and I spent countless hours helping other players out with difficult hunts purely just for the fun of it. To play with other random people, you can either shoot an SOS flare ingame for other players to see, or find SOS flares to respond to yourself through either your quest handlers or the quest board. That being said, there are some hunts particularly in the endgame where having multiple players can make losing more likely. There are some hunts in the game, especially in Iceborne after the main quest, where the players are expected to understand certain mechanics that, if they don't know them, will almost certainly doom the team to losing. The most fitting examples of this are  However, even when I've played with random people and lost, I've still had fun; the gameplay is just that good and satisfying, and it feels all the better to be able to help someone out who was struggling on a tough fight. When I played through the base game's main storyline, I was underwhelmed with the difficulty. While it's by no means easy for everyone, I was expecting more as we reached the main questline's conclusion. Even if you end up having a difficult time in the base game, you can always craft the ""Defender's Set,"" an armor set designed to speed players through the base game so they can reach the Iceborne content. However, as tempting as that might be, I'd recommend against doing this; you may inadvertently skip over and miss a lot of important aspects of the gameplay due to being carried by the busted armor set, and Iceborne will rudely awaken you. Iceborne's content introduces ""Master Rank,"" a tier above the base game's ""Low Rank"" and ""High Rank Quests"" and having monsters just as strong to match. The typical monsters in Master Rank are on par statwise with arch-tempered level monsters in the base game while also introducing new monsters and a new region, while also having tempered variants and in some cases arch-tempered variants of those aforementioned monsters. Iceborne will certainly pose a unique challenge especially initially, and even players who were unchallenged by the base game will at least see the times it takes to complete each hunt become significantly longer. The endgame is a unique beast. I've fought Manus and the Nameless King in Dark Souls and DS3 respectively, and was able to beat those bosses blind pretty quickly; in comparison, it took me several hours to get my first win against the final DLC monster blind. There's something in this game for everyone regardless of their skill level.I could go on forever about this game, but I'm literally running out of space! :( Essentially,  get this game if you want:- a cooperative PvE experience- boss rush-style gameplay- skill-based combat- in-depth progression and build-crafting- progressive difficulty- a gorgeous New World to exploreYou won't regret it."

2795,LiliumDaemon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/liliumdaemon/,2,,1,137.8,March,"25,",91,0,1,"So, this game is pretty good. Nothing too special but definetly no trash. What I love most about it is the graphics and design of armour, weapons, especially the monsters, buildings, etc. they look stunningly beautiful! I also enjoy being able to explore the region on my own before actually fighting the monster and having to track the monster in advance is also something I really like. The game gives you a variety of weapons to use with different aspects and fighting techniques, you can choose whatever fits your fighting style best. Though the fighting itself feels realistically heavy no matter which weapon you use. You will have to calculate the duration of the cooldown after an attack when fighting a monster in order to have enough time to evade the monsters' attack afterwords (you can literally not move for a while after attacking no matter how much you press evade :D). Also using attack combos to deal more damage will force you to move in one and the same direction through that whole combination which leads to hitting the monster maybe once or twice and after that you moved through the monster just to set the most powerful slash of your combo in the air :D. You can't really change direction during a combo. So yeah, fighting can be reaaaaaaaaallly annoying due to little mobility. Also the hitbox of the monsters' attacks is not very realistic because it litterally hits you even when you are 4 meters above the monster in the air. Fighting is pain. But let's be honest, it probably would be like this (with the cooldown after an attack) in real life, too so it's just realistic fighting mechanics I guess. But the great looks make it worth for me :) Also the story isn't too bad and the characters are fun ^^"

Am I considered a MH Veteran? Maybe, I dunno. I just know this is ALOT of peoples first Monster Hunter and that's SUPER exciting. Welcome aboard. Thank you SO much for trying it out. Previously to World; MH had a secluded niche and small following that had a rough start in markets outside of Japan. Alot of the time the games weren't ever guranteed to make it to the US or EUR. World is the first installment to a series (thats nearly 20 years old) to have extremely positive sales so I'm hopeful for the future of this series even more than ever. Thank you.Honestly, I'll consider this my favorite franchise. Monster Hunter has been all I've been playing as of late. This one, even the older ones, are helping me fill-in the ""I must play rise"" illness I've contracted. I'll make bold claims. I don't need any other games. This is fun, oddly calming, and rewarding. The premence is simple. The gameplay is seemingly endless and challenging as it does get gradually harder and harder. You beat up dinosaurs and dragons with big weapons. Harvest their skins for even bigger weapons and then fight even bigger and stonger monsters for even more stuff. Thats really all it is. You can clock 100+ hours easily in these games, and yes, If you have friends to join you they can always join since Monster Hunter has always been about taking down hard Monster with friends since the beginning. MHWI has treated me fairly good. MHGU treated me good. MH4U treated me good. MH3U treated me good. And, MHFU has treated me good too. I can't wait for Rise; Will it be just as good? Probably. I dunno but I've already preordered it for switch. And gosh,Has it been a painful wait."

If you check my other reviews, you'll find that at the time of posting this I only have one other review. Outside of one of my favorite games of all time, it is rare for me to take the time to review steam games. However this game has had a long history on steam of mixed attention, and I want to shed my light on it. I would also like to stress that, at the time of writing this, I do not own and have not played the Iceborne DLC.In terms of gameplay, I cannot recommend this or any other Monster Hunter game enough. Monster Hunter consistently has the most content for the price imaginable of just about any game or franchise out there. This content is packed with deep gameplay that will fill any player with a sense of mastery and skill, and a myriad of playstyles to pursue. I grew up playing Monster Hunter games solo, so while I'm very glad I've had the joy of playing this game with several other friends, I honestly think you wouldn't be missing out to buy this game and just play an hour or so solo at any given time. I would go further to point out that this game has more solo play support than many of the Monster Hunters I played as a youth, including features I didn't discover until much later in my play time messing around on days my friends were busy and I wasn't. The majority of negative reviews are pointing to major tech malfunction making the game unplayable, and I can attest that this is occasionally the case. I personally was unable to play the game for several months due to a behavior between the software and my antivirus. Most of the stories I have heard are similar situations; a particular piece of software having core issues with MHW and preventing it from loading properly. In light of this, I would not recommend this game to anyone who will get frustrated about major tech issues or who cannot troubleshoot on their own. For me, I play a lot of games, so I was able to simply set the game aside until it was fixed, but I completely understand the frustration of people who spent $60+ on this game being unable to play it for time periods of that length. I will humbly state once more that I believe the challenging-but-fair gameplay of MHW is absolutely worth it for me, but you will have to decide if you are willing to run the risk of this type of tech frustration."

I remember being so amazed at all of the cool monsters and the awesome weapons that were totally too big for a person to actually use. I sucked at it and was super intimidated by monsters as weak as Great Jaggi, and it took me a few weeks to clear even the first few quests in the village. When I finally started to get the hang of it and learned the mechanics I was completely infatuated with it and couldn't put it down. Every fight felt like the toughest battle I'd had up to that point. I loved the game and became a massive fan of the series, which led me to purchase just about every console that the next game was coming out on. I've stuck with it from Freedom, Freedom 2, Freedom Unite, Tri, Portable 3rd, 3 Ultimate, 4 Ultimate, Generations, Generations Ultimate, World, Iceborne, and soon, to Rise. Needless to say, I'm biased af, but Monster Hunter World truly is a revolutionary entry in the franchise with so many new features and mechanics, new monsters, new story, and a new generation. This game made me feel like I did so many years ago. That feeling of stepping into something brand new with wonder and amazement, only this time I actually knew how to upgrade weapons! If you're a Monster Hunter fan, you probably don't need a positive review to make you buy the game, but to those who are jumping in for the first time, go for it! It's got plenty of content in the base game alone and Iceborne may as well be a sequel. 10/10 Would recommend."

2865,gant12000,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gant12000/,2,,1,"1,542.5",November,"25,",291,0,1,"Like many others, monster hunter world is my first foray into the world of monster hunter.  It is an incredibly successful series though, just not one I have really ever had a chance to play.  Most of this was due to the fact I just didn’t have the system it was available on, or some other excuse. That all changed with this installment though.  Finally it is on pc, so therefore my excuses didn’t hold up weight anymore. A friend even had to buy it for me to insist I played it. While I am not familiar with any other games in this franchise, I can say from a gaming background that this was one of the most frustratingly enjoyable glorious pieces of game I have ever sank time and effort into.  The mechanics were simple at first, to me.  Just hack and slash at the monster.  I cam into it thinking I could just attack and be fine.  Like a child with a stick pretending to be a knight, I attacked the enemies with reckless abandon.  For the newer player such as myself, this is where all the mistakes happen, and the joy of the game really is lost.  While you do in fact have giant over sized weapons, the game rewards players that think before they act, utilizing more defensive methods to open up the giant monsters in the game for attack.  If you are planning on just smacking around things, you will not get far and find the game quite frustrating like I did.  With a vast array of weapons that range from giant simple hammers, to large projectile weapons, every piece of equipment presents a completely unique strategy and element to fighting the monsters.  Some weapons will click with a player, while others will make them want to punch the nearest alligator in the face.  It is patience that makes this game shine.If you are a player that likes to feel a sense of accomplishment with using a piece of equipment over and over, a sense of victory when you finally beat that one level that just was driving you nuts.  This is the game for you.  If you are unfamiliar with the franchise, expect a learning curve.  If you have played other monster hunter games before, they why are you reading this review? You probably already have this game as well."

Die enough times to learn the attacks.You can also explore the map, collect materials and craft useful items. You can also hunt for rare small creatures.There are many many side quests. By this I mean optional quest and quest lines. You can ignore all of them if you wish.If you only focusing on main quest, the game is not that long.If you want to complete all quest, the game becomes 5 times longer.If you aim for all achievements, I dare to say it will reach 500 hours with the DLC of course.I suggest to get at least one frend (or 3) because it will make the game much better.

You get 14 weapons to choose from, each with lots of moves and some even have different play styles among them. Though the story is relatively bland, it's far from the key focus of the game. The repetitive grind-fest that Monster Hunter becomes late-game is ironically what makes Monster Hunter so great. For a real hunt, multiplayer is the way to go. This game is meant to be played in a group and trust me you won't realize the hours that have passed while you are hunting with your mates.Also, cool festival outfits xD"

2887,MistaKimchi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/beatchakwon/,2,,1,268.9,October,"8,",76,0,1,"Time commitment and the learning curve are the biggest wall to this game. Monster Hunter World isn't your typical RPG with linear progression and predictable power scaling. There is a deep depth to mechanics and game-play involved, like learning monsters' movesets, your weapon's mechanics, and item utilization. Monsters will seem impossible to kill at first because of a combination of your armor, weapon, and lack of knowledge. However, the reward comes with the satisfaction of learning a particular monster and using your weapon effectively. If you desire casual gameplay with flashy graphics, this game is not for you. Even after nearly 260 hours on this game, I am constantly improving and optimizing my hunts. There are the typical performance bugs at times, the plot and English voice acting are cringe, and certain weapons (looking at you bowguns) straight up just make the game a cakewalk, but you will still have a satisfying experience with this game. The Iceborne expansion is highly recommended, and even necessary in my opinion, to enjoy the full potential of this game. The value you get from the expansion puts all other DLCs to shame. The amount of work devs have put into this game years after release is refreshing to see.The entire game is essentially a grind. There is no tangible ""end-game"", so the satisfaction rests on yourself and knowing you are a better hunter than you were when you first started. For me, part of that satisfaction came from fighting monsters I faced when I first started and completely obliterating them."

I've been playing this game religiously ever since I bought it and I can't really describe how much I like it. Also, this game has the best DLC content I've ever paid for. Iceborne is worth every peny and if you ever find yourself in doubt about whether you should buy it or not, go for it and buy it ASAP, as it introduces a lot of new mechanics to the game.I'll finish this review saying that this is the pinacle of the third person action games and specially if you're a fan, you will not regret buying it. I'm more than 400 hours in and there is still content to be seen. Grab it on a sale if you wish, since it is constantly being sold for half the price. However, if you're impatient and don't want to wait, you won't regret buying it full price either!"

The game has a variety of monsters and creatures to fight and behold, the combat is really enjoyable - expected nothing less of the same company that has Devil May Cry under their wing.

A true masterpiece for the fifth generation of Monster Hunter. The amount of game details and graphics are incredible. I do have some issues with the game, notably centered around the Clutch Claw but most of it is fixed with the ""Iceborne Community Edition"" mod, which I recommend.Happy hunting!"

2913,Nova Hydrak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nova_Hydrak/,3,,1,872.5,August,"26,",122,0,1,"I can't recommend this game enough. If you like open world, mission based, grind for great loot, and multiplayer games, this game is for you for sure. I'll spare you with what the game is about, this game is really fun with a bunch of people to play with. If you don't have any friends, you can still fire a SOS flare which calls for players. So far from what I've seen, people in the MHW community are so nice and if you are just willing to ask for help, people will certainly help you (probably because they don't have anything else to do but help people and that gives them enjoyment and rewards for doing so as well!). The game is easy to make friends with.My negatives about the game:-Difficulty: (This is just in certain conditions.) This depends on the gear you have. The more grinding and better gear you make for yourself for the specific monster you're struggling on, will make the monster easier. I'll discuss why it's a bad thing in the multiplayer negatives.-Story: The story is pretty bad, not gonna lie. It consists of ""This monster is doing bad things to the ecosystem! Hunt it!"" then you as the player goes adventuring a bit and it just so happens in the most convenient timing, that the monster shows up. This isn't a big issue as probably less than 10% of the community cares about the story at all, you're free to not pay attention as none of it is important. Just get better gear and fight stronger monsters.-Multiplayer: Multiplayer is a big positive in this game, but I'll talk about the negative parts such as how the story missions are all cutscene locked. Meaning you cannot skip ANY cutscenes in the game, and other players are not allowed to join your mission until all cutscenes have been watched. This is super annoying and I have no idea why any game company would force their (pretty bad) story on the player. I recommend that you blast through the story ASAP so that the real game begins. The game has a pretty complex way of understanding how multiplayer works but, once you understand it isn't that bad.-Cheap hits: Dodging is crucial to the game, but your invincibility frames are very low, giving the game a form of Dark Souls difficulty feel of it. It mostly requires you to know what the monsters next move will be and dodge when that attack strikes, so there's a learning curve. There are difficulty spikes everywhere in the story and it can disencourage players from coming back (that happened to me after Rathalos), but if you keep trying, or find help from other players, you will pass it and become much stronger and more capable of doing it again.My positives about the game:-So much stuff to do!: There is a lot of things you can do in MHW, from customizing your room, to placing pets down, to making vanity armor, to capturing monsters, to arm wrestling with your friends! The coolest thing about MHW is the multiplayer Gathering Hub, where up to 16 players and their palicos can all be in one session at once and they can even pay for everyones meal or just emote and communicate freely.-Hunting: The main part of the game is hunting monsters, whether you kill or capture them, you're going to learn how to take them down the fastest way possible and learn all the techniques on what that monster is weak against, what it drops, and where its weakspots are. Before each hunt, be sure you prepare at the canteen and manage your items before taking off to fight it.-Weapons!: There are 14 weapon types in the game. Each one isn't just a different thing to swing at the enemy. No, each weapon acts as its own class. From Dual blades which are two fast swinging swords to a heavy bow gun which is essentially Heavy from TF2 to the greatsword which is ironically heavier than the hammer but pays out with its massive damage it puts out. It is all up to you on what classes you want to main in the game. You can play one weapon or play as all the weapons.I could go on and on about the game. It is 100% worth buying this game and the iceborne dlc (as it is pretty essential to also have at this point) if you want a new game to love and cherrish.May the Sapphire Star guide your way future hunters!PS: Be sure your PC can handle very large games. MHW is notorious for being a very hard game to run. Please do check your PC stats before spending money on it."

2917,Brendan||nabnerB (AFO),https://steamcommunity.com/id/Scrubs122/,2,,1,680.3,August,"11,",385,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World is the first monster hunter game I have ever played. I didn't grow up with Playstation or access to any of the other monster hunter titles. Being a born and breed PC player since I could trick my dad into letting me play Red Alert, I never even knew of monster hunter. I asked some friends who owned World on PS if it would be worth picking up on PC when it came out. They gave me a resounding NO. The port was terrible, it was laggy, featureless, and the servers were absolute garbage. I bought it anyway. Monster Hunter: World is a labor of LOVE. The devs poured their hearts into this game. Every pixel, every conversation, every armor crease was someones passion brought to life and it SHOWS. The detailing in this game from over the top enviroments that give you awe just to wander around in expeditions to mine rocks for 4 hours; to the way the world feels like it breaths with you while you hunt with tiny insects and animals scurrying about their lives while a fire-breathing T-Rex rains fire on them. Every monster feels like, albeit fantasy, a living thing. The pure adrenaline of a hunt is mesmerizing, addicting. You fight a monster and think ""Holy cow, that was so intense and took so much effort. That was the hardest monster ever."" Then y send something even crazier to fight. The ""grind"" and gameplay loop is rewarding as you don't need to sink your life into spending your hard earned money on in-game items and you can play at your own pace. Some events in game are ""limited"" but they almost always comeback on a rotating event schedule so you never have to choose between your life and your hunters life. This game offers as much or as little immersion as you choose. You can role-play one of your favorite characters form a show or novel or just be a complete Meme character and still enjoy the game. The weapon selection is massive with 14 unique and enjoyable weapons that cater to any playstyle from range combat with bows and bowguns to in your face style hammers and greatswords, tanks that spank with gunlances and sword and shields, and glorious nippon steel katanas. This game is a hidden gem in a never ending surge of unpolished and generic titles and one of the best investments I ever made. Iceborn is just more cake on top of your cake with some cake sprinkled on."

2923,lividjesmar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imsolivid/,2,,1,970.4,July,"31,",142,0,1,"At first, I was unsure about the game. It's not a game that's very friendly to newer players, luckily I had a friend who was able to walk me through things and I understood way better that way. The starting area and the skill trees, for example, are quite overwhelming when you're new and it's not the easiest to understand.Once you get out into the field, things will get MUCH better. I got Iceborne nearly right away, and the clutch claw has been a LIFESAVER for me so far. It's allowed me to get more hits in on monsters I can't get close to with my dual daggers.  Fighting monsters has a nice challenge to it that makes you feel powerful once you defeat them. When you fall in battle, you will understand what not to do. I highly recommend this game, it's slowly becoming one of my favorites because I just love the world surrounding it. There's so much to this game that even after 70ish hours of me playing this (as of this post) I feel like I've only touched the tip of the iceberg! If you're getting this game, you should definitely get Iceborne, as well. There's so much content that gets added after the main-game and more challenges.EDIT: Yup, like 500+ hours later, I very much enjoy this game and am looking forward to when MH Rise comes out. This is my all-time favorite game, there's just so much to do! I've learned several weapons by this point, my favorites being Insect Glaive and Light Bowgun. This is a game 100% worth trying and pushing through the hard parts, it's very rewarding in my opinion.ALSO, if you're having trouble running the game: My previous graphics card was a GTX 1650, and the game ran barely 60fps before, this is due to a bunch of unnecessary processes that CAPCOM implemented, and there are a few mods that help with this issue. On Nexusmods, search for Strackers Loader and Performance Booster and Plugin Extender, after getting those two mods it made ALL the difference and I had consistently very good frames."

I often get frustrated because the game play feels clunky and heavy compared to other game during that time but as I grew, I learned the mechanics and fell in love with the game. I stopped playing for a while until it came out on Switch and started playing again. When I found out about Monster Hunter World and saw the game play and new mechanics, I became a bit salty because it added a lot of new mechanics and made the game ""easy"" which by far is the polar opposite of the original series which gave it the branding that it has now. I did not play it at launch and continued playing the classic versions on the switch for a little while until I stopped playing again because my friends are now playing MHW. That was my story with this game. Now i got this game just 2 weeks ago and I am already at Master Rank TLDR; change is not easy to accept but thank God I threw away my purist attitude and gave this game a shot.Thank you to all developers who made this game and to those who have been working with the series since the classic ones :)11/10 would Recommend.EDIT:JAN 2023 -I've started playing this game again after finishing MH Rise. Somehow, it hits different. It feels more modern than Rise. I'm jumping back into a new game! Oh by the way, I'm playing it on my steam deck and it's like a dream come true! PORTABLE MH WORLD!"

When I first got the game, I couldn't stop playing it and was excited to get back into it every day. This was way before Iceborne was even announced and goes to show how good the base game was. The thought of a game with only bosses is a concept that will appeal to almost any souls-like fan.Getting straight into the combat and main gameplay, we have a variety of weapons to choose from. Each weapon feels unique and has a number of combos to be learned. This makes the game stay fresh if you are the type of person to try everything and makes mastering a particular weapon very satisfying. All the weapon types are viable, so there is no need to worry about a certain meta or weapon class that outshines the rest completely. They are comically large which might be off-putting to some, but I like how it displays them and gives every weapon an amount of impact. Besides the weapons, the main gameplay is a dodge and attack style, which is why I said that it might resonate with souls fans. You get healing and buffs to aid you in your fight against monsters. This game is certainly challenging and if you aren't paying attention, then you will fail your missions. Almost every mission has a total of three faints, which basically amounts to three lives or respawns before you fail the quest and have to start over.Now moving on to the main stars of the game: The monsters of course! There are quite a selection which helps keep the game alive and gives you something to always upgrade towards. The monsters act like real, living animals taken to the extreme where it is survival of the fittest and smartest. The world feels alive as you battle them and can even be used to your advantage. A new monster is added with almost every free title update which also helps expand the story and the reason why this monster is in the new world. Almost every monster has their own armour set and weapons that can be crafted which embraces their characteristics. With such a large amount of monsters, you are bound to find a favourite among all the other annoying ones.As for the story....does anyone really care. It is mediocre at best, but gets you to where you need to go. They could have just let you go wild and kill every different monster the new world has to offer, because that is basically the story summarized. There is a big bad monster at the end of both the base game and Iceborne that threathens the new world itself, which you go and kill. Not really a gripping tale. Just a hunter that has an insatiable thirst for blood. To add the cherry on top is the handler. I won't say too much about this character, just that almost nobody can stand her stupidity and annoying dialogue. Best character in the game is Grandma Kitty, who cooks great food for you with a smile. Most spoken to character is probably the smithy, as you will visit him a lot.The graphics looks good and still holds up after two years. More importantly is the soundtrack in my opinion since that is my little pleasure. A great soundtrack gets extra points in my book and does this game deliver, having me beg for more. Just like Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne, the OSTs for some of the elder dragons are simply fantastic. It really gets you in the mood and makes you feel like you are fighting something majestic yet powerful and deadly. That is just my opinion of course.All and all, Monster Hunter: World is a great game and its expansion, Iceborne, is a must buy if you like the original. It adds and expands the base game so much that you won't be disappointed. Even when I might get frustrated because of certain mechanics and monsters, I still come back for more. It is just such a well polished game that is great with friends. The developers are also great and keep releasing great updates to keep everything fresh. Plus there are mods on pc if you want something more out of the experience. Including a Giorno's theme for the hunting horn. Need I say anymore.10/10 would kill Great Jagras again."

The gameplay loop of killing bosses, getting new gear that resonates with that boss, and then taking on bigger and badder monsters is perfectly distilled and a joy to experience. For me it feels like the sweet spot between high difficulty games like dark souls, sekiro, etc and RPGs like Dragon's Dogma. Definitely worth a try!A little hard to play with friends though. Netcode is not great and early missions force all players to view cutscenes in separate mission instances before joining friends."

Outside of the gathering hub has really nice people that will help you with pretty much everything. There is a lady with a magic pot, there is a blacksmith, a cook for when you get hungry, people who study monsters and even have a place for the monsters to nap if you trap them, a pig that is kind of like a puppy because it gets so excited to see you and if you pet him and carry him around he will dig up treasure for you. There is a merchant that has various wares for sale and is always willing to fence any goods you don’t want. There is a botanist too, I think his name is Andre Argosy but that is not important. What is important is that you frequent him or the other people that have the same operation going because you can collect whatever you want to harvest and even purchase stuff from the pirate ship. It might just be a regular merchant ship but it seems to be pretty full of random things that could have easily been plundered from other boats. You also have a cat thing for a pal that helps you sometimes but you may have to whistle for him multiple times because he is handcuffed or something. Oh, and if you don’t like the way you look you can cover your armor up with more aesthetically pleasing attire. Worst part is the handler, she gets in the way and is pretends she is helpful. However, the arena gal in the gathering hub makes up for it because she is nice and cute. The main quest lady there I think has a crush on me and seems nervously excited when I interact her. I recommend playing this game with friends because some of the monsters and the quests/challenges are twice as strong as normal. Ultimately, if you decide to embark on slaying monsters there is a support group of townsfolk that will help you and hopefully if you don’t have any friends you can fire a SOS flare and get assistance from someone else from anywhere in the whole wide real world (hopefully Asia though)."

It has little to non story and lore and just comprise of mainly hunting monsters, get it's materials, craft a new hat(armor) and weapon, fight stronger monster, rinse and repeat till end game. In the end game, you may start to feel dull and start on trying out new weapon and playstyles . You may go through it earlier but this is how it worked for me. Playing alone could prove to be boring when it drags on hence having 3 other hunters in a party feels much more fun. If you feel like playing, i cant stress enough that it consist of HUNTING MONSTERS for 80% of the game. If you are still feeling like it, then i recommend buying iceborne also. Back then (pre-iceborne) having base game is enough as there are only 2 different ranks which is low rank and high rank. Post-iceborne, they introduced master rank which features much stronger weapons. If you like coop play and wanted randoms go into your quests, you're probably end up with Master rank players breezing your quest in 2 minutes instead of 10 minutes or more (usual hunt time per quest).  So, overall, if you like slaughtering epic monsters with 14 types of weapon and many more kind of play styles, then this game is for you. But if you are able to get bored by it, then i would not recommend as both monster hunter world and iceborne could be pricey. Maybe buy it during sales, that would be a far better bargain. Enjoy!"

This is one of the best action games I've ever played. Very deliberate combat, and yet you can play it for hours upon hours. Every weapon takes actual skill and practice to master, and every monster is a new challenge.My main complaints are that the amount of content is low for a Monster Hunter game (without Iceborne) and the decoration grind is stupid since certain weapons are dependent on decorations for their full potential. Just cheat them in and have fun. Iceborne fixes the content issue, adding tons and tons of new and fun fights, so it's definitely worth getting.UPDATE: Alatreon is the greatest thing ever (no sarcasm). I honestly am in awe of the developers of what a great job they did. The sheer level of salt this fight generates is amazing, and just speaks volumes to how bad some people are at adapting.Kudos to you, Capcom. And to those reading... Don't listen to immature people who are crying about being forced to adapt to a new scenario. Alatreon is quite possibly the best monster in the entire franchise and his fight is as close to perfection as it gets."

I started playing the Monster Hunter series back when the original Monster Hunter was on the Playstation 2. I loved it, even though I didn't realize I could change weapons halfway through the game and I played after they shut down the online portion of the game. This is one of the few ""grindy"" games I can get behind playing. The gameplay, combat, and mechanics are just THAT good. I've also always enjoyed the Dark Souls series and love stamina-based combat.The gameplay is great. That's a given. I can definitely recommend this game, HOWEVER there are things people have to be aware of:- Lots of computers have CPU issues with this game. It's very intensive on your computer, to say the least. Be aware of this and make sure your rig is prepared ahead of time.- Some lower end specs can run the game, but it'll have issues for sure. My Girlfriend plays this game on a pretty low end comp but has stuttering issues and the game freezes if someone carts.- Sometimes this game will have issues with the anti-cheat causing problems. There are a lot of potential fixes online if this happens, but nothing is guaranteed.- My game had an issue where my computer started freezing. I did a deep cleaning of my computer and replaced the thermal paste and it started working perfectly fine again. If you have freezing issues, try this. There are other issues with the game that you may encounter, but it's a dice roll. Some people have issues others don't, etc. If you have a strong gaming computer you're likely not going to have any issues. If you're more along the average computer specs, you may have issues."

Monster Hunter World is the best game to get into for anyone who is thinking about trying out a Monster Hunter game for the first time.  This is a great time to pick this game up, as well as the DLC Icebourn. The PC version of this game has bugs like any game which is not bad until they happen to you, but that like everything in life so it's not really a big deal. The game visually looks nice, since it was released on December 2017 but its visuals are nice. Its the most westernized version of a Japanese title so just google some photo or videos and check out the armor or weapon to see if your like them. The game is fun, the gameplay loop of hunting monsters to make more powerfull weapons and armor is tried and true. You can play with up to 4 friends or less. As well as play by your self, which is the way I prefer to play. I say that because there are hunts where they are designed to be played with 4 players, which is kind ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying when you've been playing the game solo the whole time. But unless your really give a ♥♥♥♥ about those hunts can be done on your own but are not designed  to. You can do them with random people but of makes those hunts harder cause there designed with communication in mind. A fun feature is to fire a SOS flair which random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people into your game, which is the funny ♥♥♥♥ sometimes all the way to absolutely enraging at other times. Its a fun game but is slowed paced so it could be hard to make a judgement about it in like two so if you buy it make sure you like rough idea of the game before you buy it. And that pretty much all I have to say except one last thing wigglers are the cutest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing in this game."

There are lots of monsters to fight, lots of weapons and equipment to acquire for both you and your cat friend. It's fun with friends, but you can still get help from random players (although some of them can be more useless than helpful).The base game has a nice start, allowing you to fight monsters willy nilly, but it can become grindy once you are introduced to special track quests. After those however, it's smooth sailing from there, and no more from the DLC.The difficulty of the game starts of easy, but progressively gets harder, and learning skilful dodge timings and proper weapon use will make the fights easier and rewarding. Each monster has a unique attack pattern and cool designs that also provide awesome looking weapons and armour.There are collaborations with other games such as Final Fantasy and Witcher, which spice up the gameplay, but you should expect a lot of repetitive grinding if you want a specific set of armour and weapons.Overall, I rate this an 8.5/10 game"

Stop forcing us to do things on our own for one thing. Some people are more casual gamers and do not want that. Also it would be nice to have tutorials for all the weapons. Yes, I know there is a basic one at the beginning, but I mean something like the clutch claw tutorial that's out now where you actually learn the key presses. Yes, you can see these on YouTube, but not for PC. If CapCom would think more about the casual PC gamer this game would become much more than it is now."

There are a huge variety in weapon selection to choose from, there are 14 different weapons all with different play styles. the RNG with the decorations for certain abilities was kind of rough in the start but they've added a few different ways to farm the decos that are very reliable if you have Iceborne. Also they've added like 7 new monsters in free title updates since the game came out. (it's going to be new monsters 10 by the end of April) But if this your first time playing a Monster Hunter game then be prepared for a bit of a learning curve, it will seem kind of overwhelming at first but once you get the hang of it it becomes an amazing game.

Since I bought it like a week ago I have played it literally every day and I keep on finding new stuff in the game (even 40 hours after I discover new items or ways to fight monsters) which makes the game more and more interesting in the long run. I think I actually might be addicted.Overall I would say, that if someone likes the idea of hunting ""big monsters"" while having lots of variety in weaponry or abilities that change the way you fight them, then this game will definately be worth your money. For anyone who is thinking about buying the game, I recommend to buy with Iceborne expansion. I made a mistake and bought Iceborn after I progressed quite in the story and I missed on the new stuff Iceborne adds. Like new weapon movesets and Clutch Claw which changes the way you hunt the monsters. So if you are deciding to buy the game, buy it with Iceborne.If I were to rate the game on the scale of 10, I would prolly give it 9.5. I feel like the only thing that this game lacks is better online matchmaking. The game has dozens of thousands people playing at the same time, yet sometimes it's really hard to find SOS signals or busy lobbies. Like the numbers just doesn't add up, or the game is very region locked for some reason. I believe it's the latter or the game just has poor matchmaking/lobby system.But in the end I recommend it very greatly. Get this game you won't regret it."
3068,Vy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SleepyVy/,2,,1,"1,409.1",February,"27,",170,0,1,"Its a game about hunting monsters. And I love the monsters and the hunt. First off, there are some complaints I have.The first four hours of the game sucks. A LOT. I would pay money to skip the first four hours. The story intro is quite bad, the game mechanics aren't properly explained which leads to people turning away from the game. The game fully ramps up a couple hours past the refund timer, which some people often get disappointed during. Lastly, there are some mechanics that aren't really necessary, its just there as a homage to older entries.Monsters start ramping up in difficulty and diversity after that. And by that time as well, you start to get a hold of the weapon you're using which I say is a good difficulty spike. Around here, you start to unlock sweet looking armaments which I would say further pushes players to grind for that sweet looking gear, and the gears aren't just all looks, they're plenty customizable (after a lot of grind). Your playstyle will dictate your gear, and there's plenty to choose from. From weapon choices to specific buffs, there's a lot of way to make head in this game, there's not many weapons that are considered ""unviable"", most of them have equal footing and have matchups they're good or bad against.TLDR: Pick it up if you watched a youtube video showcasing the first 2 hours and accepted the gameplay that comes afterwards. You really aren't losing too much. Story bad. Game good."

Loyal fan of the franchise since MH2, and I can easily say that this is my favorite to date. At first glance, this game can seem awfully repetitive, but let me assure you that once you start playing, your experience will be anything but. The monsters move frequently throughout their beautifully crafted ecosystems, giving you a variety of different spaces to fight them in. There are environmental traps to look out for, endemic life that can both help and hinder you, and of course; other monsters roaming out in the world that will happily interrupt your experience in the hopes of an easy meal. While the objective of your adventures will undoubtedly be similar, no two fights play out the same, as you never quite know what to expect; making the overall gameplay almost organic in nature and wonderfully replayable. All 14 of the unique weapons are a treat to use with deep fighting mechanics that will have you pushing to master their most powerful techniques.The monsters themselves are a sight to behold. Some of them are absolutely terrifying and relentless in their pursuit of destroying you. The end game monsters have the toughest A.I. I've ever had the chance to face in any game, and will challenge the skill and composure of even the very best of players. That being said, the thing I love most about them is their distinctly unique personalities. One of my favorite non-combative things to do in the game, is to follow the monsters around their habitats just to watch their behavior, diet, and interactions with the other monsters and endemic life. The amount of detail and thought that have been put into Monster Hunter World is breathtaking. Thank you so much for this game, Capcom. Can't wait to see what they've got lined up next."
3089,/Sneaky/TiKi/,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sneakytikix/,2,1,1,"1,592.3",February,"12,",478,1,1,"Absolutely in love with this game, and will continue to recommend this game to anyone.I have played and experienced EVERY MH game to date, but this particular game takes the cake for gameplay, QoL, and visuals.   It's story isn't anything special unlike Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate, which had a pretty great premise in comparison, but thats hardly the point of this game. You get in there crewed up by yourself or 3 other people with your weapons of choice, beating up large monsters till they fall.  Every monster in this game is treated like an unscripted boss battle, its just you, your weapon, wits and skill.Monster Hunter World greatly rewards players that attain precision skill for evading and guarding, learning the movesets of the monsters you hunt allows you to greatly punish them for attacks that they otherwise would have hit you with prior. I find that if you've ever seen a speedrun for this game is a great example of this.  Now this entry in the series is much easier game than past titles but it can still challenge you in various ways.  I play monster hunter for the high skill ceiling it offers if you choose to speedrun monster hunts,  but this game doesn't have to be played this way or by meta, you can make various skill setups to suit your needs during hunts and to just have an overall fun time.But while armor skills do help, I strongly urge that upon playing this game you spend some time really getting to learn the in-and-outs of your weapon you choose, it doesn't matter if you have the most damage possible if you dont know how to handle your weapon and positioning, and don't shell yourself into using just one weapon if you can, every weapon in this game are quite fun and i always encourage you try each one at least a few times.Feel free to poke me if you have questions.TL;DR Buy this game if you love darksouls-esque boss fighting as a game itself with co-op."

You might think ""Wait, shouldn't you not regret any of them?"" and no, because the game isn't perfect, but it is very very good!Pros:+The game looks great!    The game is generally great looking. I'm not a huge graphics afficiando, but it looks good.+The combat gameplay is fun!    The gameplay is fast-paced and skill oriented. I've heard some people describe it as souls-like, and that's not totally accurate (attacks don't consume stamina in most cases), but it's also not totally wrong. Like Dark Souls, when you break it down this is secretly a rhythm game. You have to think about how long your attack's animations take and what options it'll give you compared against what attacks a monster has. Dark Souls is the same way! However, this game's stamina management is largely not based on attacks, but instead is fuel for dodging. There's a few attacks that do consume stamina, and some weapons have to think about stamina management more than others.+There's a variety in play styles!    So, a lot of people pick up this game, grab a weapon, have a bad time, and decide the game isn't for them. However, each type of weapon is essentially a 'class' in another game with it's own whole set of abilities, mechanics, and sometimes even minor details that long-time users of the weapon will know how to get the most out of but won't be apparent to a new user. With my 587 hours, I can confidently say that I have 'mastery' of about two weapons. If you don't like a weapon, try another one! Greatsword too slow? Try out Dual Blades. DB Reach too short? Try Longsword! The game almost entirely changes, and sometimes you may find that one weapon type has an easier time with a certain monster than another. Some weapons are low or high mobility, and a lot of weapons may seem one way until you discover a technique that totally changes your playstyle. The Lance is renowned by many to be a slow weapon because your walk speed gets agonizingly slow, but once you realize that a Lance is never intended to 'walk' but instead Guard Advance, Charge, or Dodge in a direction you can discover that it's the second or third most mobile weapon in the game when used properly. Similarly, the 'support weapon' Hunting Horn has some of the most single-hit damage potential around.    Best of all, no weapon in this game is 'non viable'. If you find a weapon or playstyle that works, even if some people (myself included) will regard it as 'suboptimal', you CAN play and beat the game effectively with it. +A high skill ceiling, but a low skill floor!    This game has a huge amount of room to improve if you're willing to put a lot of time into the game. However, don't let that scare you off! I have plenty of friends who are 'casual' hunters who get by just fine. You don't have to put several hours into watching guide videos and researching builds and mechanics to be good at this game, but that option is there if you want it and there is ALWAYS room to improve your hunt.    As a quick word on that, some weapons are more complex than others. The Charge Blade and Heavy/Light Bowgun are a good deal more technical and require a lot of thought, while something like the Bow, Hammer, or Greatsword are actually quite simple. Don't be fooled though - there's plenty of room to refine gameplay even in 'simple' weapons. The Lance is considered a relatively 'simple' weapon and I still discover something once in a while.+A large and mostly friendly community!    This game has subreddits, a plethora of YouTube videos, and more! If you like engaging in fan communities or reading guides and whatnot, this game has that. It's not exactly an MMO, but it is very multiplayer friendly. I mostly play with friends, and you can also matchmake with randos or browse public open groups. It's a good time!    While you CAN cheat and mod this game, I have only very rarely heard of someone cheating. ~Gear isn't the be-all end-all in this game!    No matter how good your gear in this game, if you aren't learning from the gameplay you will get curb stomped. The biggest upgrade you ever get in this game is what you, the player, learn from your hunts. That's not to say gear doesn't matter, it just means that you're almost never going to find yourself totally unable to go on because you need to gear up. Cheating in gear won't make you win the game, and it'll only make hunts marginally easier by the time you hit High Rank. That being said, paradoxically this game's progression IS entirely in gear. Some players may love this, others may not. Just don't come in expecting level ups and player characteristics beyond appearance.~Mod support... kinda!    So, this game has a weird relationship with mods. There does appear to be an anticheat, but as far as I (and anyone else I've asked online!) nobody has actually been banned by it. Even obviously cheat-y mods like Trainers/instant kills/every items is buyable in the shop seem to be totally fine. This also includes some mods that do things like change appearances, make items on the ground easier to spot, etc. There's a Nexus Mods section for this game, though you should be aware that not everything there is going to be compatible with the latest patches.    No judgement if you decide to cheat, but remember to respect other player's wishes and keep things like insta-kill cheat or invulnerability to single player or with buds who are cool with it please!~This game can be a little grindy, and the central gameplay loop isn't for everyone!    I did say the game isn't perfect, and it's true. The game's central gameplay loop is to hunt monsters to get parts to hunt monsters and repeat. The game is about perfecting builds, improving as a player and a hunter. That being said, if you don't like that central gameplay loop, this isn't going to be a good time for you.    The game isn't too terribly grindy, though. Once in a while you'll struggle to make a monster drop a part, but usually that means you have to attack a specific part enough to break it for any real chance at rewards. There's also a lot of mechanics in place to give you alternate ways to get materials, or to make the grind a little less intensive. -The first 20-30 minutes of this game are rough!    Monster Hunter games almost have a tradition of having bad early games. You have a couple of really uninteresting quests you have to do early on, and that may turn some people off. Give it until you finish the Great Jagras hunt - if that wasn't fun for you, that's when you should decide how you feel about this game. Maybe try to re-fight the Jagras with a different weapon and see how you feel first though - they really do all play quite differently.-Nitpick: Weapon appearance variety isn't what it used to be!    Newcomers to the franchise might think there's a decent-ish variety to weapon appearance, but in past games every single weapon had a completely unique model with almost no reused/modified assets. MHW does. === FINAL SCORE ===Overall, if I had to give the game a number, I'd say it's a 9/10 for me, but on the whole is probably more a 7.5 or 8.5/10. But also numbers are totally meaningless , and the rest of the review is overall going to be a lot more comprehensive. I'd say if nothing else, it's worth trying this game out."

Simple but rewarding game loop, a huge world to explore, dozens of monsters to fight, and hundreds of armor pieces only scratch the surface of the things that can be done. The combat is tight and responsive, the weapon styles varied, the monsters a mix of challenging and annoying in the just the right doses to make a fun action packed time. Optimization is a little wobbly due to this being their first venture to PC, and the games are nearly as jam-packed with content as the handheld games which could use models from previous titles to reduce work load, but with their constant updates and most recently Iceborne being released, there is TONS of content to enjoy and hours to sink, and thats before even getting to the new lands and mechanics of the DLC.Overall MH:W is a great title, a fun piece of action you can sink dozens upon dozens of hours into and still not be done. Lots of content, and lots of fun."
3113,Civ_Es,https://steamcommunity.com/id/izgeraldz/,3,,1,164.7,January,"26,",62,0,1,"Highly recommend this game; at first I was hesitant to try a game with such a generic name, but honestly Monster Hunter World blew away my expectations. Graphically, the game designers did a great job at making the environments, every single detail being accounted for makes for a beautiful immersive surrounding. It's easy to just look at the sun set in the Ancient Forest, or watch the waterfalls in the Wildspire Waste. However, the environments pale in comparison to the gargantuan dragonkin that you're going to be facing off against.  Gameplay wise, the combat is engaging and rewarding, it pays off to be patient, and learn the monster's behaviors before going aggressive on your openings. Each weapon feels unique, and that gives a unique perspective of the game; using a large blunt weapon like a hammer, requires a drastically different playstyle, that using a long range weapon like a bow. On the other hand, the gameplay loop can get stale, no matter how diverse the weapon roster is, so it's up to you to enjoy the crafting progression, and set goals for yourself. Story wise, the game could be better, although it has vague approach to storytelling, the funny looking cast of characters contrasts against the severity that is a massive elder dragon threatening to disrupt the natural balance. The game contains a very loose, but clear message of being cognizant of the environment, and how everything is linked through the natural order from the lowliest herbivore to the massive apex wyverns that make home in this universe. Overall, I rate this game highlyGraphics: 4/5Gameplay: 5/5 (or 4/5 if you don't enjoy the crafting aspect of it)Story: 2/5"

The graphics are great, but its the living and breathing world that takes the show. Monsters and animals have their routines and go about their lives until a hunter slices them in half.The gameplay is very tight with lots of precise movement and attacks against monsters, whilst knowing their pattern to prevent getting hit. The main gameplay loop is very satisfying, hunting monsters, gathering loot and trying to craft better armour/weapons. Co-op is very fun and can get a little chaotic sometimes. Coordinating  attacks, planning traps, and saving your teammates in the heat of battle gives an adrenaline high. This PC port isn't without faults. The opimisation is quite poor, requiring some serious hardware to get 1080p 60fps (it is very CPU bound). The co-op structure for mainline quests is barbaric, requiring all players to start the mission and watch a cutscene before joining. Also, the PC game is months behind the console releases in terms of content. They said it would catch up, but don't believe their lies."
3123,Feyreth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Funkles_Wolf/,2,,1,194.2,January,"17,",138,0,1,"TL,DR at the bottom. :vBefore playing MHW I'd only ever experienced anything like it through Dauntless. I'd played that with friends and whilst it was fun we all slowly got bored because of how much of a grind it was to go against certain monsters early on; we basically hit a wall and didn't feel like it was worth playing on with.My experience with MHW as been mostly solo, and whilst man monsters definitely hit you hard and make it slow to progress, it never felt like you have to grind your ass off to beat them. To move on from the comparisons; the game feels alive. This was something that really stood out to me when I beat the first couple monsters like Great Jagras and Anjanath; they all behave differently and respond to things in their surroundings. Encountering the next monster is always pretty cool, and I enjoy learning how to fight them and how to read their attacks this way before going against them again later. The game itself looks amazing, even with mid/low settings it's quite wonderful to look around and explore the various regions. Playing with friends is also great, makes some tougher opponents easier, but not without them being entirely cheesed. I do have a few small gripes with the game, but nothing that really ruined the experience for me: menu's are a bit confusing to navigate at times, the default control layout for keyboard/mouse is a bit... Odd to say the least, and for some reason, no characters have names. Weird gripe to have, but I find it so bizarre that no one has an actual name; they're all called stuff like ""serious handler"" or ""easygoing fiver"". It's not something that would bother me normally but it does sorta take me out of it sometimes.TL,DR; the game's good, fun with friends, and palicos are adorable give me 20."

You can very easily throw 200-800 hours at this game and get so much fun out of it. The game-play is typical of a Monster Hunter game but improved so damn much due to all the quality of life changes they have introduced, such as the Slinger and just in general changes to the character controller and monster behaviors to further emphasise the fluidity of a modern game. The game is a masterpiece and certainly stands high in my favourite monster hunter list. All changes to all 14 weapon types are fantastic, and I haven't found anything in particular I dislike about the game. Perhaps I'm biased as I've been a fan of Monster Hunter since 2006 but I simply can't not recommend this game. The sheer amount of detail put into the assets, animations (ESPECIALLY the monsters) and shader-work is mind boggling, small things such as muscles jiggling when monsters step and fur moving aside when a monster moves or scarring appearing over the body to indicate damage, it's amazing and truly goes a long way to create an immersive experience. Honestly, the only thing I dislike is that some of the weapon designs are absolutely subpar at best in comparison to older games such as MH4U on the 3DS. In fact, the weapon designs are pretty inconsistent, with some taking the designs from the older games and some which are supposed to have cool designs simply appearing as a piece of bone with some feathers attached. Despite its faults, I fully recommend this game with all my heart. Of course, Monster Hunter is not for everyone but World is certainly more accessible (and arguably much easier) than most of the older games. Especially with Iceborne out, the game certainly has me hooked!"

The base game is a special experience especially if you have never seen these monsters before or if this is your first monster hunter game, like me. The turf wars between monsters is always exhilarating, and it gives a breath of life to the monsters and their environment.Iceborne is a great improvement and merely calling it a dlc feels like a disservice considering it feels like a whole new monster hunter game with how much was added. Iceborne to me really drives in the point that there is always a bigger fish. It is deceptive how much content there is to cover and once you finish one story plotline, something else will come up and there will be an even greater threat to the area that you must hunt. For instance, as of writing this review, I have finished what I thought would have been the final monster hunt/final quest only to be sucker punched by a ‘seething bazelgeuse’. I can only wonder at what other fresh hell awaits me further down this dlc, especially since they are adding in new supreme tier rip-your-heart-out monsters in free content drops.tldr, ♥♥♥♥♥ pretty damn good chief11/10 would get vaped on by deviljho again."

There's no hiding that these games require you to like the constant hunting of the same monster multiple times for parts, but the game play is exciting, active, and engaging enough to make every hunt worthwhile.  But many people have talked about that to death, so what makes Monster Hunter one of the greatest games of all time?With the Iceborne expansion, the game has risen to new, greater heights.  You have a new house that you can redecorate to your heart's content--decorations, wallpapers, furniture colors, a metric ton of tiny pets you can shove in your house, and a personal hot spring that you can press Y to splash water and Up on the D-pad to frolic in.  Fashion Hunters can rejoice, as the Master rank armor introduced in the new expansion hark back to older designs, looking bigger, fancier, and more daring as opposed to a majority of the sets the game began with, which were made with a bit of a same-y feel.  You too can hunt giant chickens that throw rocks while looking like a technicolor cowboy-ninja fusion.  There is a new camera feature where you get to take pictures of cats doing normal things, so you still get to enjoy the feeling of Instagram without leaving the game.  Or, meet up with other hunters in multiplayer, choose any of the new pose emotes and take a hundred selfies before you bother even picking a quest.And, as always, you get to pet your cute pet pig and dress him up like a bumble bee.10/10"

Monster Hunter: World brings a fair RNG system that isn't unfair, instead, it gives you a side goal to look out after while you're grinding for that new piece of armor. The armor system is very fun, and creating your own combinations of different armor pieces to allow your weapon to deal the most damage, or make your support palico kill monsters solo in 20 minutes. It's a fun and complex system that allows players to customize their hunter to their liking. The most recent expansion, Iceborne, brings with it a lot of content as well, and feels like a great, finished product that the developers put time and effort into.

MHW is an absolute joy to play with thousands of hours of content for a collector, and still a wealth of content for those looking for fun or a challenge. This being said for other veterans,  World is by no means the traditional Monster Hunter experience. If you are looking for how the original series plays, I suggest Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for phones if you are able to get a controller going, or for 3DS/switch's most latest entry has an amazing feeling with Monster hunter Generations/Ultimate. This being said, World is not a bad game. it is absolutely amazing, just a new style of monster hunter. The systems are very streamlined and much more focused on crazy nonstop action, and less on Strategy and focused thinking.  I would always recommend this game for people new to the series. I feel like as time had gone by it became more and more difficult to introduce people to this series, but World is an excellent starting point now.

Stellar combat has always been a hallmark of the series, but the devs have gone to great lengths to ensure that World's is the smoothest to date, and when you account for the plentiful (and much needed) Quality of Life changes made it becomes clear that this is also the easiest game in the series to dive into at anytime. Initially it was lacking in terms of content, (monsters, really) but at this point in time, even the base game does a good job keeping the average player's attention (meaning without the Iceborne expansion on PC), though it still struggles in the end game when key event quests aren't in rotation. Legacy skill transfers over well but isn't needed, however series newcomers will still find the finer details of the game challenging to grasp initially without guides, even though more info is available to the player through simple gameplay than in previous installments. Thankfully there are a large number of creators in the Monster Hunter community dedicated to showing newer players the ropes, in addition to helping the general community understand the meta, though that's not an excuse for fundamental information to be obscured (Give us the option to see a weapon's true damage, damn it). I would strongly recommend this game to anyone looking to get into the series."

The old monster also got some new moves, but when you know how to read the monsters, you´ll have an easy time.The handling of the weapons is good too. You have different playstyles with every weapon to keep the experience fresh (or you stick to your favorite weapon and finish the game with that type *caugh* gunlance *caugh*)The design of the weapons and armor is also very nice. You can also have an armorskin, but these are the armorsets from the events, but this isn´t something to pick on. Fashion is endgame anyway. I own this game since 6th Dec 19 and it has consumed my life. At 74 hours, i ""finshed"" the game (Credits). Of course i´ll kep playing, next month is the release of MHW: Iceborne (where Barrioth+Brachydios will be added) and i´m lokking forward playing it.If you are not sure if you want to play a RPG with an endless loop of gathering and upgrading and you don´´t want to pay this much money (where i think that this game is worth the full price) try Dauntless first. Its a very downgraded version of Monster Hunter, but if you want more realisitc graphics and don´t want to hit cuddly big teddies, come back to this game."

The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is what you'd always expect from the monster hunter franchise. Some nice new additions to the game mechanics-wise in this title, such as interactive and destructible terrain. The game feels like it's lacking content to me in contrast to previous titles like Monster Hunter X. There's a noticeably lesser amount of monsters to hunt, but it doesn't subtract from the enjoyment of the game in this instance since I feel like they were trying to go for a different approach with MHW. If you've come to play this for a story, don't expect too much as it's very baseline in that regard.

3243,Aacryon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aacryon/,2,,1,719.3,November,"24,","1,139",0,1,"In broad strokes, Monster Hunter: World is a perfect blend of challenging combat, gorgeous environments and deep mechanics and it rewards you on so many levels. The fluid combat is satisfying and the need to learn about, and prepare for, each encounter doesn't get in the way of this. Each monster you fight presents the player with a new puzzle to figure out - enhanced by the fact that you will normally need several encounters with each monster in order to learn everything about it. All discoveries about the life that inhabits the complex and dynamic environments are dutifully logged in a fantastic and well-presented journal which you can access at any time.To call the combat ""like dark souls"" does it a disservice to an extent. It’s what dark souls aspires to be - precise, meaningful moves of a fighting game combined with a sense of grace and fluidity creates something that is very visually pleasing and satisfying to master. Speaking critically for a second, the combat can become a bit of a cluster**** when there's four players and multiple monsters in the mix, but this really isn't a big issue.A word on playstyles and gear. Each weapon has a very ""easy to lean, hard to master"" ethos to it. You can play through the game with any weapon although you personally might enjoy a certain weapon's mechanics over another. Some are more for support than direct damage, but the game doesn't force you to constantly switch weapons even if some choices make some monsters a harder fight. You are expected to customise your gear BEFORE starting a quest, but you are able to change your gear on a quest (although not quickly or easily or in combat). I like to think of each weapon as a character in a fighting game, each has strengths, weaknesses and a unique move set which combine to give a completely different gaming experience. There is a heavy amount of customisation available and a huge number of options when it comes to both weapons and armour and skills.The game is a long-lived, complete experience which feels very polished and complete. It was very competently put together and even though the controls make it feel like it was designed with a controller in mind, the level of customisation lets you change things to suit your setup. Expect to finish the main campaign in around 50 hours, which obviously will vary hugely depending on a number of factors.If you don't like a challenge, you might quickly find yourself frustrated by the intimidating, unforgiving combat. The game is all about persevering, honing your skills and knowledge of the mechanics in order to beat the ever-increasing threats. There are no difficulty settings to be found, but you can always call for other players to help if you feel out of your depth.A word on the multiplayer. It's unconventional - just like dark souls. You can form a party or call for help during a mission if you feel like you need it. You can play through the whole game solo if you prefer. For the more experienced players you can answer S.O.S flares and join a player's game to help out. There is no PvP however.Is the game a grind? Expect to fight the same monsters quite a lot. Some of the monsters are just the same but in a different color with different A.I. If this bothers you, there might be enough content to make you feel like you've gotten your money's worth anyway. With over 20 unique monsters to battle. Take that with a slight pinch of salt however, because there are only about 4/5 monster skeletons, so many of the differences that make a monster unique are pretty superficial. However, it's not as bad as some RPG's that are truly shameless (I.E just changing the color and the numbers). There are about 5 environments, all of which are enormous, believable and satisfying to explore. The plot is virtually non-existent and since you're expected to repeat key plot missions, the sense of a plot moving forwards is undermined somewhat. So the story does take a back-seat.To wrap up then: An enormous amount of effort and love has gone into this game, and if you enjoy games like Dark Souls, The Witcher, Shadow of the Colossus or any of the previous monster hunter games you will find something to love here."

And.. I fell in love with it! Me and my three mates just grinded oru ares off because we didn't check the time often. It was and is so much fun, currently im waiting for the DLC Iceborn to get my hands on and to start it all again! Best part is always when one of your mates dies nearly at the end and kills the quest than. Thatst he moment in Teamspeak for a short silence... followed by ""You idiot, you wood head, go eat some glue etc."" We love those moments always good for a laugh.

When the 2 faced medic appears in the resting area all of the co-inhabitants of the resting area are thoroughly impressed and applaud. The 2 faced medic sniffles because he still has work to do and checks his papers. He then makes a clever joke about there being paper on his face which one sniper found to be quite shocking, but all the others are yet again thoroughly impressed. When the 2 faced medic switches persona's he is quite musical, and the snipers begin to jive to this groovy beat. However the shocked sniper from before refuses to take part of the festivities and is revealed to be an engineer infiltrator. He is punished by being turned into a snipers hat, all of the other snipers didn't think this could happen and that this was a fluke and are quite appalled at the 2 faced medic. The 2 faced medic then reasserts himself by stating ""my HEAD on my face"". One sniper off in the distance discovers how to fly, the 2 faced medic tells him not to do this. The 2 faced medic switches back to the funky side and starts to play another beat orchestrated by the hat. The not so groovy side of him tells the groovy side that the hat is stupid and then takes control of the body once more. Another engineer is fed up with this because he was just starting to get down with it and challenges the 2 faced medic. He is punished and turned into 2 snipers hats, all of the snipers couldn't believe he would actually challenge the 2 faced medic and mock him by laughing at him. One sniper is absolutely astonished that he has an unusual hat and a pyro is accidentally teleported to the resting area. The unusual sniper sees this and decides to watch on. The pyro is flabbergasted and drops his flame thrower, he then pulls out his trusty christian brutal sniper extinguisher unit to combat the 2 faced medic. After a long battle it is a draw and the medic has found an engineers hat and begins to show it off, telling everyone that he is contempt with this hat and is ""good to go"", many of the snipers look on in awe at this most auspicious of occasions. The restless 2 faced medic finally finding bliss ascends to the heavens where he meets the christmas heavy who tries to warn the ascending 2 faces medic of the inbound skinny fat, this was not on purpose as they both scream at the realization that they are going to collide. They collided creating a catastrophic explosion killing everyone. The End."

At first, I was very hesitant to play this game due to some pictures of UI I've seen and it looked very intimidating, almost MMO like at a quick glance. Despite some initial reservations I booted it up and started playing. I was immediately hooked on the world of Monster Hunter. While the story doesn't present anything too crazy and most of the characters are relatively generic, the set pieces and monsters in this game are top notch. The UI I was so worried about wasn't actually that bad once you got into the game. I learned that this was because Capcom tried simplifying a lot of aspects of this game compared to previous entries. With that being said, the crafting systems and the various different types of ammo, traps, and weapons can be disorienting without looking up an online guide of some kind.With all of this in mind though, I still recommend this game without a shadow of a doubt. The gameplay is extremely fun once you start an expedition and the grappling hook that comes with Iceborne is incredibly fun and I wonder why it wasn't in the base game. Killing the Anjanath for the first time had me popping off and I really felt accomplished. After spending upwards of 45 minutes on a mission it feels great to finally kill that boss monster you've been hunting.The Handler is as annoying as I was told8/10"

I played it for about 100+ hours on ps4 and it was my favorite game on my playstation 4 hands down. Mind you im an action rpg junkie and i appreciate depth in my combat and alot of control. Monster hunter world gives you WAY more than you can handle and after a long period of silly clumsy mistakes which can coincide with your playthrough of the campaign.As you can see I am nearing 300 hours and will hit that before iceborn releases which I assure you i will squeeze atleast another 120 hours out of.Here is a quick version graphics:8/10 (10/10) hd pack Sound:9/10 Even the load menu music is enthralling. think kingdom hearts/finalfantasy, maple story ,wow or any favorite game sound track. They went above and beyond.Veteran hunter can really know a monster just by its roar and maybe even its steps.Combat: 9/10 I can't say enough good things about how impactful, dynamic , and EFFECTIVE every move is in monster hunter. The animations the monsters being knocked back, stunned, poisened, trapped, mounted , flying, jumping, climbing, swimming, floating( yes different from plain flying ) all server to completely immerse you in the hunt. want to be an agile ninja got you covered. want to be an untouchable archer god filling the air with a hurricane of arrows gotcha covered. want to basically have a howitzer? covered.Obligatory huge FF7/beserk great sword? Dude we put rockets on it. want to be able to live in the sky like a circus clown insect glaive...Warning story:5/10 not the worst but truely not a selling point. Trying to multiplay through the story is exceedingly frustrating also. You are probably going to hate the handler. and get used to being the only hunter in Astera*.Multiplayer 7/10: Though monster hunter itself is a dam near perfect game, match making is be very bad.getting dropped mid hunt leaves the difficulty up and faints (deaths before the mission fore fails) are shared amongst the group. As you may have gleamed from other Accurate reviews playing with randoms is truely a random experience. If the internet conection stays stable though i wouldnt trade the experience for the world GO team up with some people or go watch team Darkstar or Rurikhan play with people.Longevity 8/10: The elder game and late game is simple and repetitive but this is what games are . if you like fighting boss monsters in other games more than ""trash' mobs or non elites and just wish you could have that be the focus while looking super bad ass and wearing your kills body parts get this game. If you think dark souls is to hard DO NOT get this game.I hope this game gets cross play at some point and if you need help feel free to ask if you see me online.this game and community are fantastic and more games should be as passionate and polished as this.if yyou even think anything in this game looks cool and you like a challange come join the 5th fleet you won't regret it! happy hunting!"

Even if you have to optimise this game for the PC it doesn't take that long.FPS Drops: Now FPS is kind of an issue in this game especially when you:Accept a quest and in the Depart screenWhen it's rainingJust after you kill a enemy and the quest is completeeffects - play a big part in why the FPS is so low in this game sometimes, and there needs to be an option to be able to remove the effects NOT all the way but remove some layers of the effects to reduce FPS drops for example like if 4 people are attacking at once the effects can get a bit hectic and cause low FPSAlso for some reason when you're in a game and going to disconnect the game drops half of its FPS.. And I dont know why.Other than those issues I think personally this is a very good game and would recommend it to anyone.The Online system is pretty weird and it should be easy to be able to play with your friends but other than that thank you for creating a brilliant game for me to play Im sure my playtime will definitely be in the 1000's"

I have seen multiple MH games before and always found those ugly or borderline ridiculous. Smoll pipl swingin' big Club-shaped swords at giant monsters.... Huh? Really? Then I tried MHGU demo and was completely and utterly repelled from ever picking it up... Until I've seen a friend of mine stream MHW. I found both  the graphics and gameplay engaging and decided to buy this game while on sale. The beginning was slow... Running around, looking for some mythical turtle... Oh well... Then the High Rank hit hard. That was something amazing, now I had to fire SOS and call for help, now I could not just rush through the fights solo like I used to and that was the point where I found it so much fun. interacting with other players, having those moments of terror when some of your teammates, let alone you, gets stunned while having aggro. Rushing to teammate or being rushed to to prevent fainting and then mass fainting, both stunned and the one rushing for help... Love it. Every second. And it does not ever feel unfair. You die - your fault (does not apply to Hunting Horn, keep up the great work, I am looking at you, Longsword...). And then out of nowhere the game decides you are no longer a baby and throws Pickle and Bomberjet at you. So not only do you get slam-jammed by a pickle, but also get blown to pieces (keep a big pile of sh*t in your inventory). After all that and the grind you become a literal Dovahkin, I mean, what can be more amazing, as trying to lay the hard hitting boi with the team full of Longswords (who all seem to have either mental disability or are Genji fanboys) ((I don't judge, I am myself a Long sword player, because it looks like Nodachi *excited weeb noises*)), you manage to defeat the boss with one attempt left, start carving and one comedian decides ""No loot for you today"" and interrupts you for the whole minute!

3298,Dod-Regnbue,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dod-Regnbue/,2,,1,"3,217.6",August,"27,",84,0,1,"I honestly love this game, and the series. I picked up Monster Hunter back in 2004 on the PS2 and I have never looked back. MH: World is (compared to the others in the series) very new player friendly, but it still can be quite jarring. Think, Dark Souls bosses on repeat. Although I wouldn't suggest aligning these two games, that is, essentially what it is.You are fighting bosses. Hard ones. Repeatedly. There are a lot of in game mechanics and builds that YOU need to figure out, also know what skills work with what, not everything is a blanket and works on everything. The game actually does very little to help players out, such as tutorial and hand holding (go here to find X thing), most missions are 50 minutes, so be prepared to spend 50 minutes finding and fighting the monsters. Once you have done it a few times, you remember locations and patterns, and have hopefully geared up a few times, these 50 minutes get whittled down to 5. There is a issue with multiplayer, particularly, in the early game. I have seen many posts in the reviews saying that the game is 1/3 solo, or you have to do so much solo before you can join friends. I played the main story completely Co-Op with my wife. Literally hit about 200 hours with just Multiplayer. There are 2 missions at the start you must complete before Multiplayer is unlocked from here, all you need to do is see the cut scene for each monster. So, enter a mission, see the monster cut scene, leave mission (leaving a mission does not penalise the player) re enter mission with your party. This is Capcoms null attempt to stop people getting carried and not experiencing the game, at best it is mildly frustrating. In total there are 14 different weapons types. From the quick and nimble Dual Blades, the hulking wallop of the Great Sword, or maybe range is your style, so pick up the Tactical Nuke Machine that is the Heavy Bowgun. So I am sure there is something for you to get a long with.  As for the story . . . Well if you want the complete picture, there are about 10 other games you will need to get and play through. But there are a few Lore Websites you can just look up. World is but a small part of a very large picture, and unless you really care for it, don't worry. Most Monster Hunter Veteran players refer to the story as the Tutorial, to further put it into perspective, the Story Finishes are Level 16 (or HR [Hunter Rank]). I am currently Level 870, and the Cap is Level 999. That is how little the Story has a part to play in each individual game.If you like Loot / Grind Games, with a challenge then this is for you. There is a HUGE expansion coming soon which will basically double the games size and things to do, with all new mechanics and Monsters to fight. So what are you waiting for Hunter? Join the Expedition!"

I think the amount of hours I've spent on this game speak for whether I'd recommend this game or not.While it had to endure a bit of a rough start due to connection issues, nowadays communication errors are few and far between. And if you're more of a solo player like me, that's even less of a problem.Otherwise in my eyes this game is the pinnacle of action games. While the game starts off a bit slow due to unskippable intro cutscenes (my only major gripe with this game) once you go out on your first few hunts as you learn what the game entails, it will just grab you with its talons and bite into your with its teeth and this is one monster that will not let go. So you'd better be ready to beat it over the head with the weapon of your choice (and with 14 options, there's bound to be something that suits your tastes) and beat this beastie into submission.Combat is Monster Hunter: World's main and pretty much only focus. And it does combat well. From basic movement to the distinct playstyles of each weapon, there's a flow that just feels incredibly satisfying once you understand it and go with it.And when you're not looking to beat up some big monster, instead go on an expedition and just observe the world. Observe the monsters as they patrol their habitats and hunt or scrounge for food. Or go and catch yourself some endemic life to get some pets for your room. Or even just collect some basic resources that can be found in the world to prepare yourself for your next big hunt.It is clear to me that the development team put a lot of time and effort into all of the game's aspects and it shows. Not much else to say but I wholeheartedly recommend this game.Happy hunting!"

It is clear it is a port, so if you intend to play with mouse and keyboard expect to see and feel the limitations. 7/10 on release, 9/10 as of this review.On release I would give MHW a 7/10. Gameplay, progression, flow and feel of combat, visual aesthetic, sound design are all top notch. Story was greatly lacking, hud, interfaces, social options, and menu interactions were also poorly implemented. But the rating I would give MHW now is a 9/10. As the game has progressed since it released, it has received constant and substantial love/development from Capcom. Optimizations, more pc controls & graphic options are added frequently, themed events and anniversaries are high quality. New content is patched in on the regular, whether its a massive expansion like the upcoming Iceborne DLC, or even if it's just a new monster variation there is always something around the corner to look forward to. If you enjoy epic worlds with tons of things to explore and environments to hunt in, MHW is a great addition to the Monster Hunter Franchise. Great for veterans and newcomers alike."

But, sadly I can't feels the MH4 and MHGU seris coz I didn't make to afford 3DS. So, when I heard CAPCOM planned developed MH on PC i tought it was Nation lock again like MHFrontier series & MHO, but I was totally wrong. It announced on TGS 2017 that they're announcing MHW!! For the first time, Ryozo Tsujimoto want to release MH series on PC except MHFrontier and MHO tough (I dont expect mobile Spin-off too) and this game got our MH Fans heart like it was a dream.So, they're make a realistic photorealism character unlike the previous series (such cartoonist), they're add some new mechanic like slinger, Open world (we're not have to waiting loadscreen if we move forward to another area), Scoutfly (similiar to paintball but little annoying), and many more.So if you a new player to this MH Series, I should recommend you to play this game coz this time, MHW doesn't feels like very difficult at all compared with previous series :)Vice versa, I do like all CAPCOM give us from this game coz they have not intend to put some pay to win mechanic (just like ol' times) and they're keeping put some old flagship monster on this game, feeling nostalgia haha and some many more that details will keep me love this game very much.Aaaannndddd I don't think if they put some facial animation for the cast character coz like the character lipsync is not synchronized with spoken language at alll. Overall, I love this game. And for everyone whom read my reviews, lemme say Thank You Very Much!NB*  Thanks CAPCOM for made my childhood was better until now. God Bless."

There are many weapon types to choose from so there has to be at least one that you will like.The MH community is steadily growing and welcomes newcommers. The game is awesome but there are some flaws with it.The endgame is kinda lacking, all you will do is grinding for rare decorations that you will probably never get. But making an budget build without rare decos is also an option and you will at least get some rare ones. The only issue I have with the deco and stream stone farming is, that the tempered investigations you have to grind get kind of repeatative after a while.Kulves rare drop weapons will also likely not be droped after like 30 sieges.Compared to older MH games in world there aren't a lot of large monsters to hunt, which is one of the reasons why farming decos become reapetative fast. But the monsters that are in world are pretty nice, just the tempered investigation system makes it a bit tedious. Iceborne will add a lot more monsters tho.Tho, those things kinda make the game unpleasant, I have to say that all in all Monster Hunter World is still amazing and one of the best games I have ever played.With the Icebornes DLC coming sometime next year for PC, those problems will be hopefully fixed. Capcom did say that the Iceborne expansion will rival/surpass (don't remember well) previous Ultimate versions of MH content-wise, which sounds great. Having played some older MH games, it seems that iceborne will be pretty sick.Have fun."

If you want something you gotta work for it but each time killing or hunting a monster it gets easier. Each fight you learn their patterns and tells and with a variety of weapons to choose from you can find a play style that will suit you well. With a DLC soon around the corners there is a good variety of monsters to keep things fresh and with so many weapons having a new approach to a encounter can make it more interesting. Though like previous monster hunters if you want something specific you gotta grind for it, but it's not as bad as previous installments with special quests that have increased rewards."

Compared to other MH games, it has new features that make our lives easier, like the scoutflies, wingdrakes and the slingshot. But is it easier than other MH games, like every single veteran complains? Well, it is at first, but when you reach the endgame it feels quite challenging. If you've never played MH, then by all means buy MHW. But if you've played before and you're considering if MHW is as good as the other MHs, here's my list of pros and cons:Pros:+ Absolutely beautiful graphics+ Gameplay feels more fluid than other MHs+ Doesn't have Hunting Styles bs+ Huge maps with no loading screens+ Scoutflies and other things that make your life easierCons:- Builds are not really challenging to build and the META doesn't really have more than 3~5 builds for each weapon- Weapon designs are pretty lazy- Iceborne is paid DLC"

Combining Dark Souls-esque combat with unique environments and monsters, Monster Hunter: World tells a great story about adventure and the troubles that can come with it. While the game can be repetitive in a sense, there are enough variations of monsters to keep things interesting well past the main story, which depending on how much you grind for gear, can take anywhere from 50-90 hours to complete. However, once the story is over the real fun begins. With weekly challenges and bounties, as well as multiple big events throughout the replayability of this game is second to none in recent years. As I mentioned prviously, the combat is in a sense similar to the Dark Souls game. By that I mean timing is everything. Overall one of the most fun games of this generation!"

I realize this is to promote the longevity of the game, to keep players.. well.. playing.Though (like in previous titles) there is not surefire way to really grind for parts.Grinding on RNG has been made more fun with expeditions, so you don't feel you're solely hunting a monster for decs instead of having to do mining trips like in previous titles. I just feel like after a certain point, fighting the same Pink Rathian over and over again, having farmed all its parts already, that the grind feels like as much of a chore as mining for charms like in older titles.The main difference being that in 4U/G/GU etc. there were 'exploits' so to speak to grind them a bit faster (not more reliably to get amazing charms) but when playing these older titles nowadays, doing a quick charm run feels far more rewarding that doing several purple investigations in World. This might just be my opinion, but I sure do think that when the Iceborne expansion comes out, with new monsters to fight, more difficulty to add, that it would be wise to implement a better form of RNG endgame.(note: wrote this in a bit of hitch and I know what I said has likely been said before in a better format and with better spelling/grammar etc. But hey; if you can, you must)"

I've played since day one on console and then got my hands on it for PC a few months later. And even when I had to completely restart from the ground up on a new platform, I enjoyed the playthrough just as much as I did the first time.Pros: - Smooth, enjoyable combat system once you get used to it; Each weapon having it's own unique playstyle, niches and moves - Awesome monster design; Each monster is designed to be both a plausible animal in the real world, as well as an awesome and engaging enemy as a boss fight, coming together to make each fight actually feel like you're hunting a giant animal - Immersive, and incredibly detailed maps and ecosystems; Even the little tiny animals that you originally thought was just for detail has some sort of use or unique place in it's environment - A lot of backstory and lore if you're into that kinda thing - Power creep is engaging and satisfying to climbCons: - Sometimes RNG in obtaining a certain part is BS- At first the combat system will feel wonky- In game tutorials and hints barely cover anything, so you best do your research when you need to- Tremors (Seriously who thought that was a good idea?)Overall I think this game is phenomenal and I would 100% recommend this to anyone who's looking for an MMO that's refreshing, posing a new way of taking on the genre.

There is also a good amount of attention to detail on one particular level to the story which is a nice touch.The Visuals:The environment, the monsters and the players are a pleasure to look at. BUT THAT FOOD THOUGH!!The Sound:The music is actually pretty good all around, and the monsters roars are superb.The Experience:I remember getting the DS version of Monster Hunter and just not liking it because of how clunky it felt. It also had some stupid things like the need to flex after you drank a potion. This game fixes a lot of that while also keeping true to what the hardcore fans really want from the game. You really do feel like a specialized hunter when playing this game as every item and statistic has meaningful weight in regards to fighting any given monster. The game looks, sounds and feels great.

Don't like the sword and shield?  Try one of the others, any really, they all play so differently than each other that there's something for nearly everyone in there - Light Bowgun and Heavy Bowgun are the only ones that feel like you're playing even close to the same weapon, and even those have some basic and noticeable differences.- Content.  Between getting your dream armor for looks, to getting that perfected set, for damage, there's a lot to do after the story.  Even when you feel finished, you might find yourself wanting to build a new set for a weapon you want to pick up.  After that, there are plenty of event quests that rotate on a regular schedule, and then on special festivals even more event quests come along.- Community.  For the most part the community is very helpful and friendly - I've yet to encounter a rude player, but then I've also not encountered everyone.- Connectivity.  I only include this because though having a good connection to the game is expected for most, this needs noting as part of the rumors that kept me away for a while was the terrible connections so many people were having to friends as well as to just the servers in general.And now on to theCons- Grind.  Though there is plenty of content to go through and getting that armor set or weapon or Warrior's or Hero's stone you've been after feels fantastic, getting there can sometimes feel like you set a stone wheel spinning and have placed your face directly onto the surface.  Fine if you don't mind a grind, especially ones that can be (slightly) mixed up from time to time to stop it from feeling too old, but not for those who hate having to grind for their armor.- Hunter Ranking.  This is on there because, even though up until about 140 (I think) you get rewards, eventually the HR level is...pointless.  About all it does after a certain point is show how many hours you've put into the game, there's nothing extra for reaching those upper levels of 900+ besides personal satisfaction, which kudos if that's your thing.- Events.  Events are the spice of life for this game - don't get me wrong.  From Extreme Behemoth to Kulve Taroth to Greatest Jagras, they're great!  But...they have a major downside.  Events are rotated in and out and even then some events are bound to certain festivals/times of year, which is a major bummer for people who want something from those.  And even for the ones that rotate in and out, if you fail to get everything you want from an event before it ends, it can easily be several months before you get another shot.  The only thing more infuriating than a grind is a grind you want to do but can't because it's locked away.All in all, I do have to recommend this game.  Even with it's faults, it's a great way to just go in, feel powerful, face wonderful monsters, and just generally have a good time.  So if you're interested, come in, join the community, get your butt kicked by something you love, or love to hate, and hunt yourself some monsters.Happy hunting!"

While the game might not be up to par difficulty wise compared to other monster hunter games it still manages to be challenging and fun. The game runs great on pc and the systems transfer nicely to pc. This game fixes so many issues that the monster hunter series has had since its creation and really opens it up for newer players.My only issue with this game is how tedious the endgame is. Once you finish the story mode which is a good 100 ish hours of gameplay your gameplay consists of just grinding out the same set of monsters that will give you the gem you want and hoping to god that you get it. the drop rates are pretty bad and you need multiple to make a good set. Then with these gems and your perfect gear you fight monsters that you've already fought thousands of times before that are just a little harder. Hopefully this issue is sorted out at the launch of the expansion but even now the base game is worth recommending just for how unbelievably fun it is.

I'm mostly disappointed to see that it still only has an overall ""mixed"" rating because this game is truly spectacular right now. I wasn't playing at launch so I never experienced any woes that might have come with it, but this game has exceeded my expectations, and I wish I had bought it sooner (shout-out to my friend that gifted it to me!). Anyways, onto the rest of the review.MH:W is the first MH game I have ever played, and I guess it's because I was never familiar with the series previously. But I finally understand its popularity. The excitement of going out to kill giant monsters with a sick weapon that fits your play style is really something. Normally, I wouldn't play this type of game. I tried out a similar free-to-play game called Dauntless, but I just couldn't get into it. This one, however, is much different and much better to me. One of the main things that pulled me in right away was actually the learning curve, and just wanting to become better at games like this. I won't lie when I say that it's one of the more difficult games in my library right now, but in a good way. I love that feeling of finally defeating a monster I've struggled with, or becoming proficient with a weapon I thought I wouldn't do good with. There is just so much satisfaction that can come from playing this game.To add to the excellent gameplay, the graphics are also nothing short of amazing, even on ""medium-ish"" settings on my mid-range PC. The high-resolution texture pack really adds to it of course, and the only thing it really affects is my VRAM usage. There is little to no FPS drop. All for free as well! I only wish there was a dedicated camera mode for taking better screenshots.Lastly, the community, along with the continued support from Capcom has been great, and I've only been playing for a little over a month now. The fact that I already get to look forward to a MAJOR expansion later this year really gives me hope for the future of the game. I almost can't believe I'm saying this, but to me MH:W would have been worth it for me even at full price. I'm very thankful this game was given to me, and I highly recommend you to try it out, even if you may be hesitating like I did."

3478,MinhNghiax,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MinhNghiaxx/,2,,1,190.2,February,"9,","1,328",0,1,"It’s been a year for Monster Hunter World since it first came out on PS4. After 800 hours on PS4, I can say this is the game that I love the most. To start off, I’m not a Japanese-games lover, so when I started I didn’t give it my full attention, which this game might be my next kind of “Try and Drop” game. But later, I got hooked on the action and it exceeded my expectation in every way. The game is basically you kill the monsters, get the materials, craft better gears, fight harder monsters, replay it until you master your weapons and dominate the monsters. The grinding is real, but the rewards are worth your time. When you finally figured out how to beat a monster that you’ve been struggling for a long time, that’s when you figured out how satisfying the game is.This game looks gorgeous, everything is perfect and detailed. Also, the performance is absolutely beast, I rarely seen any hiccups or lags either. Furthermore, the monsters are very detailed, it has footprints and different features like special animation, moves, patterns, auras etc. I have to say that this is the most polished Monster Hunter I've ever played. The game has plenty of weapons to choose from, so you won’t get bored in anytime soon. Each of them has different playstyle and requires time & dedication to master it. The combos are pretty amazing, some of them are based on the previous Monster Hunter game, but this time, they expanded it furthermore with much more useful & complex attack skills. Take Long Sword as an example, now we have a more detailed Fade Slash and we can also do a following up Spirit Blade to build up the gauge. Not just that, Helm Breaker is an absolute beast skill to use where it jumps up and ends with a high damage slash. In addition, there is a skill called “Foresight Slash”. It’s very hard to use and requires you to be in a mid-combo. After a while, you will figure out the monster’s patterns, it gives you a sense when the monster's going to roar or attack you, so that you can use Foresight to dodge it and gain spirit gauge faster. Not just LS, but the other weapons also has special/new moves that gives you advantage if you know how to use it correctly/timingly. For instance, Guard Point of Charge Blade, if you do it at the right time, it can knock the monster out with KO damage; just like LS’s Foresight Slash, it will dodge the attack and you won’t lose any health. Each weapon has an important role in some situation. There is no perfect weapon or the best weapon to choose, but in some cases, some weapons might give you an advantage over the others. For example: If I want to play safely, I would choose charge blade or gunlance, which give me a shield to straight up dodge the attack easier than using LS’s Foresight Slash; or if I want to play aggressively, then LS or Dual Blades would deal much higher damage; or if I want to attack the monster at a distance, then Bow would be a better choice.The weapons have different paths to upgrade depends on the monster and the elements. It has different element to choose from: Ice, Thunder, Dragon, Fire, Raw damage, etc. Most of the monster will have different weaknesses and if you choose the best one, it would extract the most damage out of it. For example, I mostly go with raw damage (no element), since I’m kind of lazy to change up everything, and raw damage is perfect for most of the situations. When you fight Elder Dragons, they have a special feature called “Elder Seal”, which is their special aura abilities that protect themselves and enable them to enrage some special moves. So, if you use a weapon that has Elder Seal from Medium to High, it will suppress the Elders’ special skills. For example: Nergigante has a special move called “Dive Bomb”, that it flies up and tries to kamikaze into you causing high amount of damage or maybe instant-kill. If you or your friends use High elder seal weapons, it will take a longer time  to regrowth its nails on the back (a sign to tell when it’s going to use the special ability) and the ability to do the “Dive Bomb”.  So, if your team doesn’t have any weapons with ES, you will see its nails go black faster and do dive bomb more frequently. That’s the reason why you must have the patience and time to understand the monsters:the patterns/features, where its roams, where its sleep, etc. On the other hand, the monsters are also very balanced, you might feel overwhelming at the beginning but after a while you will eventually get it.The armor system is pretty good, where you need to mix different monster’s armors to gain the best skills out of it. Each armor has different skills to go along with it, the upgrade will just be for the base armor stat, which help you withstand the damage from the monster’s attack, and nothing else. So, the best build is the one with great skills set, not with a high armor number. Some weapons require specific skills set to make it better, so you might want to grind for multiple monsters to build the best one that is suitable with your weapons. For example: Long Sword requires high affinity and damage to be able to get the best out of Helm Breaker skill, so Nergigante’s helm might be the best helm because it has 2 Maximum Might skill and 1 Attack skill. Maximum Might give you more affinity (Crit Chance) while your stamina is at full. But for dual blade, this skill is useless, when most of the attacks/combos require high usage of stamina, and barely be able to keep full stamina for a long time like Long Sword’s players. That’s the reason why you need to build a set for each weapon specifically. The other way to obtain skills is to use decoration and put it on the armor. The higher rarity the decorations are, the better skills it gives. Also, different decoration gems have different level (size) and only fit to the same size or bigger to be able to use it. The size ranging from 1 to 3 with 1 is the smallest and 3 is the largest. For example: Attack skill gem is only size 1, Critical Boost is size 2, Handicraft is size 3. The armors will have different gem slot with different sizes. Decorations are very hard to find, which the rarest will or might only appear in tempered threat-level 3 monsters fight, and of course, it won’t be easy; and the result is also based on RNG which you might have to replay a thousand times just to get a second Attack Gem. But as I said, the reward is very satisfying, and this is one of the reasons. To be able to build the perfect set with the perfect decorations, it will take you hundred of hours to complete it.-	Developers are constantly updating the contents. Ice Borne DLC is coming and I can’t wait for it.-	Other DLCs are just cosmetic and stickers to chat with the others. It’s an option and you don’t have to buy it. I just want to support the developers a cup of coffee for this awesome game and also be able to get something for myself.-	You/your friends must watch the cutscene to be able to join others.-	Snap Head during fight when the monster appears.-	People leaves mid-battle; the monster’s health is still scaled, and the others are not able to join.Fight the monsters. Failed. Try Again. Replay it. Get better gears. Try it again. Killed the monsters. Advance to higher monsters. Master the weapons. Build the best set. Try out different weapons. Find the best decorations. Dominate.I would gladly give this game 10/10 and this is my personal 2018 GOTY. It’s been a great year so far and with the Iceborne DLC is coming, I might be able to put in another 1000 hours in 2019."
3479,Nhan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nhantheguy/,2,,1,29.5,February,"4,",492,0,1,"I have over 600 hours on the PS4 and the PC version is slightly behind on updates.Its a pretty good game, reviews do not reflect the current state of the game.It had a rough release due to its poor port/optimisation however it's been fixed.MHW is not a game for everyone, its a straight forward game where you hunt monsters, get/upgrade gear and weapons. However with every monster or quest you complete, it always feels rewarding. There's no heavy RNG, just hard work, if you earned it then you earned it. You feel a great sense of progression and accomplishment after beating a hard monster.The end game is what you expect from a typical grind genre, its all about the gear, weapons and decorations (think of them as enchantments but they are reusable). The weapons each feel unique and fun to use and the armour abilities have great deep customisation.In the future there will be an update around autumn 2019, this will introduce G-Rank and an ice map which is a very huge content for players. G-Rank is a very hard difficulty where even having the best armour in the game, you can still get 1/2 shot to death. I guess a lot of us are masochists if we enjoy this sort of stuff...The game is definitely worth giving a go if you enjoy this genre or looking for a challenge. This is also a great co-op game for up to 4 players if you have friends to wack with. Its nice seeing free content given which keeps the game fresh."

3486,Distance Of Shadows,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DistanceOfShadows/,2,,1,524.7,January,"24,",607,0,1,"Started playing this game when it was first out on the PS4 and its awesome. Controls took a little bit of getting used to but after that it was so much fun. Its a beautiful game with an awesome eco system and once you have worked out how to use the weapons effieciently, combat has a good flow to it, especially with the Switch Axe, my main weapon of choice, flashy and great damage. Some cool things about the game:- Palico, your adorable cat companion who fights by your side is very useful especially when you get a certain gadget for it which helps harvest parts of the monsters- Monster Behaviours and Parts, I like how certain parts are breakable, others are extremely tough and you can sever tails. Its makes you think more about where your placing your attacks and what weapon you will be bringing, as well as learning when and where to block or dodge.- Weapons large variety of weapons with cool attacks. There will probably be at least one weapon you love. While some of the weapons look meh at low rarities, at rarity 7 and above they start looking awesome if they dont already.- Capturing monsters gives you more loot, so if you break and sever all the parts and capture it, its more effient than purely killing everything, also reduces some of the grind.- SOS, while I am a solo player. Trying to leave out spoilers but: The monster you face in the Collossal Task quest is easy but there are breakable hidden in plain sight parts that will increase the drop chance of the rarest drop from that monster. Firing an SOS really helps get that item for when your farming the monster and the SOS flare gets a lot of attention fast.- Turf Wars, its awesome to see the large monsters fighting for territory and as long as they dont both target you, it can work out in your favour.- Mounting, fun, looks badass and knocks the monster down if you dont get thrown off. (You have to do a certain amount of damage before you can mount again, worth knowing if you play with an Insect Glaive)- No fall damage, hitchin a rides on wind drakes, mantels that lets you glide or do other stuff is funThere are a few cons:- Handler/NPC Partner (She's funny how she gets into trouble but a lot of players think shes annoying)- Combat is tougher with others which can be a con for using an sos flare and the money/Zenny is divided between players, also if someone faints it reduces the overall money so if you need more coins. (Although when your at a certain lvl there are easy quests/bounties that do give a lot of zenny. One about killing Coral highland Shamos and one about getting fossils from the place you unlock after the Coral Highlands.)- If someone gets knocked out the whole team pays for it. If you play with others and someone on your team isnt doing well and keeps going down the team will fail the mission which is a bit harsh, especially when helping lower lvls or if someone hasnt really played against that monster much.Things to note:- I've spent countless hours on the PS4 but only just started playing on PC, the PS4 controller works completely fine on the PC Steam version but the control prompts are Xbox. There is a Dual Shock mod on Nexus mods if any of you prefer a PS4 controller, no install, just replace a folder with the folder you get from Nexus. Also note that the share button is actually the touch pad symbol and the touch pad is the R3 button.- There aren't actually that many monsters, some monsters sub catagories of other monsters so basically a different colour and maybe a different or additional element. However, the tempered versions and events do give good rewards, plus if you want full sets of armour or fully upgrading your weapon it can be very grindy so you may be too busy to notice this until you reach the end game ranks. They do also add in more monsters every now and then, like in the Witcher event quest and the Final Fantasy Cross over. Heard there will be some Monsters from the previous games may be making an entrance at some point too so over time the not many monsters statement may slowly change over time.- If Poogie, the cute pig in Aestera that you can pet, dress and cuddle, is happy enough, it can find items for you around Astera if you put it on the floor when its bouncing in your arms. You can find all sorts around the tradeyard and somewhere there is a meal voucher if you want to eat for free ;)I brought the Deluxe version on the PS4 when it first came out and then recently got it on PC so definitley recommending this game.Edit: Removed Graphics con as they recently did a graphics update for PC which is awesome :)"

Some may hate that, but in reality it makes the game way more accessible to the mass.Now I have to add that the initial release was a mess. Clearly the game is not really made for PC but we have seen a lot of improvements. I could not run the game smooth at 60FPS with a beefy PC well that changed with up to 20FPS+ on 1080p. I personally dislike the Keyboard/Mouse controls and strongly suggest using a Gamepad but it is still playable with those. But expect to adjust key bindings to your liking (at least that is what I would do).Recently we got a update that added 21:9 support and behold it is not so cheap as Fallout 76s 21:9 solution.If you are into that you can even tweak the config to display any res you want, that is what I am doing it will add bars depending on your selected ratio tho.I think the UI is horrible (especially for decorations) and there could be better solutions. The radial menu is a bit touchy (I am surprised they did not make it full screen transparent), your menus save with your item management (which is annoying) and several parts of the game UI could really need some kind of search bar. You tend to lose the overview. I would say this is one of the few points the next game could improve a lot upon. Then we have Multiplayer. First off I have to mention that it is weird that you only can see players in the gathering hub. That there is no ""Friends only"" join option for Steam is weird (maybe I missed it) which then requires you to use the session ID. It is a bit of a hassle this way but acceptable. Also the requirement to open a session to play the game is strange, but it is offline playable if you so desire. Keep in mind event quests and such things update frequently.Beyond all that there is this terrible issue the game has. It scales to 4 players once you are 2 or more players. If you are 2 everyone gets his palico. If you are 3 no one gets a palico and you play for 4 players. The balance is clearly not in check. I wish they would at least add the quest hosts palico for 3 players (or let the players decide).Be aware that almost all female Armors look rather stupid, same goes for layered armors. So you should check Transmog from Nexusmods, because late game very likely forces you to mix-up armors which tends to look horrible.The game gets frequent updates and a huge DLC is being worked on. You basically can ignore all the DLCs they offer right now as nobody cares about animations and stuff. I suggest the base game version. The devs clearly have their own idea how things should look and be like and you notice that a lot. I am okay with it but some people may dislike it and the game has a surprising depth to it regarding weapons and skills."

The sheer amount of stuff in this game is mind blowing, and it seems that every mechanic has been incredibly well thought-out and polished. Most of my playtime has been solo but this game is also a riot if you have friends to play with. Getting started is a little bit slow and learning new monsters can be incredibly frustrating, but it is immensely satisfying once you finally learn a monster's attacks and down it, only to go back to the base and spend all of those hard-earned bones, hides, and other miscellaneous pieces on a sick new piece of armor or weapon upgrade.Easily worth the full $60 pricetag, and I would recommend this to anyone who might like a mash-up of games like Diablo and Dark Souls with a sprinkling of fighting games.

I usually buy a monster hunter game, finish HR in a week, and finish G-rank the other week and ditch it, but this game has ruined that cycle.I thought it was going to be your average yearly Monster Hunter game, with many returning monsters and a new flagship monster and that's it, but this game is very different.As most of the monsters in the base game are completely new, not to mention the graphics that clearly outmatched the rest of the MH games.The gameplay has never felt so smooth in all of the other MH games as well, which just adds to all the positive things to say about this game.

There’s a decent amount of different weapons to choose from which all play differently than the other weapons (with minor exceptions because I think the bow guns more or less play the same).

3517,ChaserTech,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChaserTech/,2,,1,772.2,December,"27,",284,0,1,"As an avid Monster Hunter fan, this game is by far the best co-op game I've ever played, hands down.I started off playing Monster Hunter Tri back on the Nintendo Wii and eventually became hooked to the game. On top of that, I've also played 3U, 4U, and Mon Hun Generations. Throughout the series, I have loved playing this with friends of mine and World has improved almost every aspect of Monster Hunter as a whole.While flawed, the story is a definite step up compared to the previous games. The cinematic cutscenes of monsters returns in this game (seeing how it was absent from Mon Hun Generations). Not only that but you feel more involved with the game's plot because the surrounding characters acknowledge the player throughout the story. With the addition of voice acting, while kinda subpar, is a nice addition. And even if you don't want actual voice acting, you can change the voices to the old MonHun grunts from previous games.The visual artstyle of World is stunning. I nearly spent hours just walking around the world in order to check out very minor details. Every area that you come across is filled to the brim with life. Creatures such as birds, fish, insects, frogs will all be placed along the landscape as you venture in the world. Also the design of each worldspace has been carefully handcrafted to feel as if it's a actual ecosystem. However aside from that, World doesn't perform very well even on high end PCs. I found myself going through framerate issues a lot. When fighting monsters, ANYTHING that uses any particale effect will drain your fps. Lightning, fire, water, you name it. Not only that but World has insane CPU usage compared to other games as well.To put it in perspective, I have the following:Even with this, my rig barely manages to get 60fps unless I turn off volumetric fog as well as some AA options. I find this to be the biggest issue I've had with this game.Networking issues can be iffy depending on your netcode and the people you connect to. I never had any issues AFTER the patches for MHW were released shortly after launch.BEFORE launch, the netcode was downright terrible and was arguably one of the worst experience I had when it comes to online matchmaking.Now since the patches were released, the connection issues I previously had diminished to a point where they are almost nonexistent. There are still some hiccups here and there but it's leagues better compared to before the patches that were released.If you're a returning veteran to the series, jumping into Monster Hunter will feel a whole lot better in comparison to the previous games. The controls feel very responsive and is easy to get into even for newcomers. All of the 14 previous weapons return in Monster Hunter World, with upgrades that make them even more enjoyable to play with.Monsters (even though there's no G Rank) are pretty difficult endgame and the additional content that gets added with World continues to breathe life into the game. So players have an incentive to continue playing, especially with events and rewards that give the players extra points and armor spheres.Most of the improvements with MH:W comes from the quality of life changes that have been included. Stuff such as:There's a lot more that they have added and changed that I didn't list because there's just too much to talk about.The monsters that return to World have been upgraded with new animations, moves, and AI behavior. And the new monsters that are introduced to the series are all uniquely designed, with their own moveset separate to the previously existing ones. Monsters also engage in turf wars under specific situations which can turn the tide of the battle. And as I previously stated, you are able to use scout flies to track the monster since it replaces the paintball system. However, to track them, you collect footprints, hair, mud, scales, and etc. This can be brought to the research center to level up your progress in studying a specific monster. Doing all of this makes the monster easier to track, enabling you to immediately pinpoint it's location within the map the moment you start a quest.Pros:Improves on previous elements of the series and adds new mechanics/gameplayGreat visuals and stunning world designSolid Co-Op gameplay (post patches)Cons:Performance issues tied to framerate and high cpu-usageGreat co-op experience, especially with friends. I highly recommend buying this game if you have people to play with. If not, playing solo is still really enjoyable."

3520,ard,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041931158/,3,,1,431.1,December,"26,",234,0,1,"As a long-time fan of the Monster Hunter series (I've been following since near after the release of MH3 Ultimate in North America), I felt utterly compelled to write a review after my recent experiences with the game.This is more aimed at veteran Monster Hunter fans, but I feel like there is still a lot to take away from this review as a newcomer, so I'll try my best at explaining some stuff.--------AS A MONSTER HUNTER FAN--------    If you're like me and have taken an extreme liking to the atmosphere and general charisma that Monster Hunter titles have historically had, then you  somewhat disappointed. I won't beat around the bush; the game is a little 'grittier' than the previous titles, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But if you've grown to love the ""So tasty!~"", your lances that look like sharks, your dual blades that look like a fork and knife, your hammers that look like blimps, then I can tell you that there isn't very much of that. Capcom, from what I can tell, has chosen to opt-out of the wackyness in favor of a more accessible, familiar realistic art direction that honestly is pretty good, but is certainly not what you're used to. Just be warned. , I personally think the new art direction does wonders for the monsters they've chosen to add, in particular. The monsters almost look and behave like they could exist in the real world. in that regard, this game is a HUGE step up from the previous titles. Not to mention the overwhelming attention Capcom has put into this game's environments. Gone are the segmented puzzle-piece-like maps of old. Instead each map is one great big sandbox, each with it's own theme and structural style. The environments truly make this game feel like a  instead of a weird stitched together mess. You have areas like Ancient Forest and Rotten Vale which are visual spectacles (even on the lowest settings) and focused on emphasizing verticality and height, and you have areas like Elder's Recess and Wildspire Waste which are more focused on large open plains and craggly rocky paths that make you really feel like you're there. My point is, each map is easily identifiable, memorable, and very distinct and unique from the rest. Not to mention extremely gorgeous in their own right.My favourite change in the entire series has to be with the environmental interactions that Capcom has introduced in this game. Maps in the previous games were basically just a stage with props; essentially, just a background for where you fight. Monster Hunter: WORLD, however, decided to really bring the idea of ""WORLD"" home. The environment is so alive, there's so much to do besides killing monsters with big swords. There are lots of clever traps and goodies scattered throughout each and every map, that learning a map is almost like learning the patterns of a monster. Some maps have boulder traps that let you drop a big boulder onto the monster if you position them properly. Others have vine traps that let you pin the monster down for a ton of free hits if you pay attention and play well. Are you a heavy weapon that struggles to do any aerial hits, yet you long to slap monsters with a gigantic sword in the air? There are cleverly placed beetles throughout the maps that you can use your slinger on (basically a multi-purpose arm attatchment every hunter now has) to launch into the air and reposition for some aerial damage.  It's so rewarding and fresh compared to the previous games that, honestly, I can't ever see myself going back to the segmented boring map style. There is nothing like learning the ins and outs of a particular map and just absolutely decimating a monster with that knowledge. It just adds yet another layer of skilled play that is just incredibly rewarding and fun. The next best thing they've done in terms of gameplay is flesh out each weapon's gameplay styles and movesets, and it's honestly the direction I hope they keep going with in the future. If you've played MH before, none of the weapons should feel foreign whatsoever; Their core moveset is more or less identical to the previous iterations. However, it feels as though this time Capcom took inspiration from the Hunter Arts / Styles (a mechanic from a previous Monster Hunter title, Generations / Generations Ultimate that let you perform big flashy finishing moves or change the way a weapon is played) and simply wove those ideas into each weapon. Essentially it feels as though every weapon has a unique ""special move."" For instance, Long sword now has a counter-attack built into it's moveset (which was previously a ""Hunter art""), and a special ""Spirit Helm Breaker"" special move that changes how you look at your spirit gauge. Bow now has a ""Dragon Piercer"" special move that changes the way you think about how you position yourself when monsters are vulnerable (On a slight tangent, the ranged weapons have been incredibly streamlined and have never been easier to get into and play). That isn't to say the weapons weren't varied in previous titles, but they quite honestly feel more set apart from each other than they have been in the previous 4 games I've played. And some weapons felt woefully complicated, even as a somewhat veteran player, in the previous games. That is more or less completely gone in this game, and I am incredibly thankful for it.So if you've played a ton of Monster Hunter before and are worried that you'll get bored of the weapons, I wouldn't worry at all. Every weapon feels  to play in this game, so familiar yet new, that I think you can fall in love with your favourite weapon all over again, no matter how many hundreds of hours you've sunk into it.This one's kind of a big deal if you're a Monster Hunter fan like myself. I touched on the monsters a bit earlier in my visual direction section, but I feel like they're such an important topic that they need a paragraph of their own.Monsters set the tone of the game. They make or break the environment. They determine the look / feel of your weapons and armor. They're what you're going to be seeing all the time, seeing as you're a Monster Hunter. So they'd better be good right?I can tell you that the choice of monsters in this game is, while wonderful and interesting, pretty lacking as well. There are just not a lot of monsters in the game compared to previous titles, and I don't feel as though they're quite varied enough in terms of body type and their fantasies. Previous titles had tons of crazy outlandish monsters that were just so unique and cool that you had to fall in love with them. Monsters like Zinogre, a thunder wolf that channels lightning (he literally strikes himself with it from the sky) to charge up and essentially go full super-saiyan, are so fantastic and mystical, which I feel is the kind of thing lacking in this particular title. Granted, their choices of Elder Dragons like Teosta, Kushala Daora, and the brand new Elder Dragon Val Hazaak are more or less in line with the fantasy vibe I was outlining earlier. But those are Elder Dragons. They are  to fit this bill. But even the previous games had some engaging, fantasy-yet-believable regular old monsters: Brachydios with his explosive saliva that he coats his almost boxing glove-like hands to punch and blast you with, Qurupeco with the ability to mimic other monsters' cries and just call on any monster it wants. Those are just a few examples I could name off the top of my head. Bazelgeuse definitely stands out and fills this void though.I'm actually at the character limit surprisingly (I have a lot to say lol) so I'm unable to talk about the rest of the game. I think I hit the key points however. But as a fan of MH overall, I cannot recommend this game enough. Please give it a try, it's absolutely worth your time. Thanks for reading."

In my personal experience, I've only ever had two crashes, and those were some time ago. One, when I was fighting a kushala doara in the rain. The compounding weather and special effects resulted in a ""graphics device crash."" I closed the game, updated my drivers, and have fought numerous Kushala's in the rain since. So it would seem the issue is resolved. My pc isn't exactly a NASA quantum computer, but my 1050 and my intel processor can run world at around 30 frames on lower settings pretty well. I have ambient occlusion on with the rest of my things on low, (because it gives the game more tonal variance) and the game still looks amazing. But anyway, capcom aren't masters at pc game development, and sometimes it shows. Overall not that big of an issue for me though, and should only be getting better from now on. I still would have rather gotten the game premature than have waited any longer for the release.Actual game:I have been hunting monsters for a few games now, one was an actual entry and the other was generations, a kind of passover project to buy time for the development of the collossus of a game that nobody would have even imagined the series could become; Monster Hunter World.    Every single monster hunter game i've played has had seemingly endless playtime value, I managed to get up to 200 hours in 3 ultimate and 500 hours in generations. I'm still mastering world past the 300 hours mark at the moment. A large reason for the replayability of the monster hunters is how many different weapon classes there are; fourteen wildly different weapons to learn, with different playstyles for every one of them. I could go into all the different items you'll use or weapon types and subtypes, but this is not supposed to be a game guide, lol. Just know it's more than you'll probably ever get around to.Environment:Every monster hunter game i've played has featured beautiful environments that functioned as the perfect sandbox to create almost whatever battle you wanted. World has taken this, and quadrupled it. I'm not sure if theres a single other game out there with map design that can rival monster hunter world. Just one expedition into the ancient forest and you will understand, the game feels real. The environments seem organic, yet they're perfect arenas. Openworld isn't quite correct, because you'll really only go someplace when you have a quest there, but it is an option to just go out to whatever area you want, find a random monster wandering around minding his own business, and end its life, or even capture it! Expeditions are not the economical decision, but if you're a savage that enjoys that kind of thing, you'll have a field day with this game. Even I find myself doing them every once in a while.Quests/Storyline: The premise of the game is that you're a settler/researcher who has chosen to come to a newly discovered land in search of adventure. You will find it. The story, while seemingly tedious, is an important tutorial for the actual game, which you'll get around to after clashing twice with an enormous volcano tortoise, (a fight that can be fun, can be tedious, but you don't need to do it too much anyway) and slaying a colossol newborn dragon that could potentially destroy civilization. While not exactly the most engaging thing ever to a veteran like me, the fights were cinematic and intense. The monsters included can be challenging for newcomers. The story is really a tutorial, but don't get me wrong; There is noticable effort put into the plot. Some characters you may like. As a cynicist, i found a lot of them annoying, but still, characters like the chef or the admiral i had to have respect for. I mean, I'm pretty sure the admiral fights monsters bare handed. anyways~Endgame:What you'll be spending most of your time playing if you choose to truly give the game a chance.When you finish the storyline, you'll probably have 1, maybe two equipment sets. That's cute. at 300 hours, I have around 50 sets, about which half i actually use. There are so many different playstyles this game has to offer, and every one of them makes the experience feel new in an undeniable way. You'll make a set for dishing out damage, a set for paralyzing, a set to take damage, a set to recover health, a set to evade, a set to heal your teammates, a set to buff your teammates, sets just for collecting materials, and sets i'm not thinking of, the possibilities seem endless, and most of these you'll have different ones for different weapons, and you'll end up with unique blends of armor skills to suit your playstyle. And when you have it all built, you'll find yourself teaching others while waiting for the ENORMOUS EXPANSION COMING NEXT FALL. That is if you manage to get through all the event quests and new monsters that the game throws at you.Gameplay:disclaimer, if you're playing with default settings, of course you're doing it wrong.  I prefer my camera as far back as possible, of course auto-sheathe off, and some other bs i'm sure you can figure out.Also, there are a number of mods that enhance the game, make navigation easier at home base, change textures around, put light pillars off of items, adjust decoration drop rates to reasonable numbers, reduce the bloom of the scoutflies, things that are just no-brainers. As far as I know, there haven't been any bans to date. I would highly recommend modding.Many people try to play Monster hunter like other games, mistaking the point to be to collect as many pieces of equipment as possible, but this is wrong. If you play it like this, you will never truly experience the satisfaction the series has to offer. Monster hunter is about developing your skills as the player: knowledge, and instinct. If you open your mind and pay attention to the virtual world immersing you, you'll discover that what you're actually playing is not a free for all monster bash, but rather a fast paced turn based game with some obvious and some not so obvious shortcuts. If you refuse to bend, you'll break. But once you learn to dance, the world becomes yours. Monster hunter is first and foremost an action game, but it allows you to come at it in nearly any way you could imagine. It's a game that will test you as the player, rather than just your gear; that diablos tyrannis is no use to you if you get swept up in the monster's rythm and miss all your big moves. Conclusion/TL;DR:If i were to ask of anything from the game, (besides better optimization) it would be more monsters, and the developers are working their butts off to bring us just that. So all we really have the right to do is to say thanks and wait patiently for more, because it's been coming and still is. I'm just grateful that theres no pay to play aspects in the game whatsoever, even as the series has gone to the big leagues, all dlc is truly cosmetic. Yes, I would absolutely recommend the game. If you like an honest challenge that comes in a gorgeous package, theres really not a whole not of competition. Monster hunter is the trailblazer of it's genre, as well as the best in class. Like a slightly more forgiving nature themed darksouls or something. Just have fun! phew, that ♥♥♥♥ was long~"

To be honest it was a little overwhelming in the beginning, but after giving it a try I quickly learned that it was quite easy to get into, specially the class 'light bow gun' since it doesn't have any crazy combos. A lot of crafting and grinding but it amazes me how fun it is even though it can be a little repetitive just to get that special item. Great game for cooping with friends. The only downside is that if you are playing the campaign, the cutscenes won't allow people to join you, only after you gone through it. I hope capcom will fix this in the future.Over all it's a great game, why don't give it a try? ;)"

If you've ever enjoyed any games of the monster-hunter genre that this series has basically created, do yourself a favour and play this game.  Even if you haven't, you should still give it a go with the free trial that's available at the time of this review, or if not, just look up videos of gameplay on youtube.  The combat is immensely satisfying, every move is weighted appropriately, and there's no greater satisfaction than just becoming better at the game, beating monsters you couldn't previously, and crafting new gear and weapons.  The online community is great and active as well, which is a HUGE plus."

I bought it because my friend never stop telling me how wonderful this game is, and it's on sale (black friday sale). Well I am happy that I was wrong. It's a well crafted game, with a lot attention to details, for example: if you spent some time following a non aggresive monster, you will find that it's doing it's thing just like real animal doing (sleeping, searching some food, even it will take a dump (kinda gross). fought another animal, fleeing when badly hurts and so on). I also read how buggy this game was when it launch on PC, so far I never had a glitch or crash. Several connection problem when playing with my friends, but I guess it's normal because internet connections in this side of the world are just like that (Indonesia). This game is very unique, I can't describe it though, it's not a usual action RPG such as Grim Dawn, it's not a JRPG either. The story is very weak though."

I bought this game during VGA 2018 Sales. It's Totally Worth if you're Monster Hunter Vet or liking repetitive grinding hell of Material, Challenging Boss Hunts, this is your type of game. I Played almost 2,200+ hours, this game is my most addicted of all time. From the base World until the Iceborne DLC, for me it's very innovative with motivated to grind with new addition monster plus you will get FREE CONTENT UPDATE in these 2 years until 2020. Hey after this, the collaboration of MONSTER HUNTER MOVIE.  The Base World Pros :- The Day & Night Cycle. - The new feature ""Expedition Mode"" free roaming with no time limited while not taking any quest at all. - The Co-Op always be priorities in the series with huge changes known as the 'Fire SOS flare' calling all hunters to help your quest to slay the monster. - Using the environmental protection against the monster is a huge step up since it just a barrel wasteland from the previous game. - Most of the tutorial is well translated and the weapons with new adapting skill and learning new curved. - The tracking monster system saved up your time and feels like a hunter you supposed to be but the monster can tracking you back in return and yes that's scary part. - The clashing monster is very well nice in pace to make a time to recovery, usually they are always gang bang you up. - The damage number is good to know and the combat gameplay is satisfactory on monster.   The Base World Cons : - Lacking the Old monster to fight with like Nargacuga, Zinogre, Lagiacrus and Rajang. - There's no sea exploration in the WORLD and that's bummed me up. - The camera sometimes clumsy when it comes tight corridor places. - The story is lacking with no development character at all but the MH is always no go about the story.   The Iceborne DLC Pros :- New frost locale plus new massive locale aftermath of story. - Additional of Clutch Claw in new skill against Monster. - New Move Skill for each 14 weapons.- New Seasonal Decoration, Outfit & Mission Event.- New Free Monster Content is Safi'Jiiva as Siege of Master Rank, Rajang, Furious Rajang, Raging Brachydios, Frostfang Barioth & Alatreon. - Giving New Room & New Music Player for listening while relax.- Resident Evil 2 Remaster Collaboration.- The Final Update Monster Content is Fatalis, the Original MH1 Boss Online.  The Iceborne Cons : - Terrible optimization during first launch. - Lacking deeper customization colors on armor set pieces. - The grind of jewel decoration is still 11:EH. - Lots of problem on hardware plus you need a mod to fix the multi thread cores if stutter.- The camera still clunky and not fix at all but get used to it. Gameplay : 8/10Graphics : 8/10Performance : 7/10Controls : 8/10Story : 2/10Multiplayer / Community : 8.5/10 Sounds & Music : 8/10 For Recommendation about this game? YES!

3542,Debs,https://steamcommunity.com/id/debspinto/,2,1,1,241.2,December,"2,",109,0,1,"- This game is marvelous and it must be approached on its own terms. -This is my first Monster Hunter game. When I first started playing I liked it, but it didn't feel ""smooth"". The combat felt weird, the quests seemed a little obvious. I was pretty satisfied, but that was it.Upon reaching High Rank and getting my ass kicked by one or another monster, everything changed. Even the things that didn't change at all.Let me explain.MHW is a game that you'll only fully enjoy if you dive in with intention to learn. It has a formula of its own and it's useless to try and play it as your previous ""a little bit similar"" game. Weapons are so different you have a whole new gameplay style when you change it; the use of skills and the way to make your build are also very unique; new game mechanics keep on appearing very late in the game, so it takes a while to have that feeling of ""I finally get this whole thing"".The best way to enjoy Monster Hunter World is letting the game present to you it's way of doing things. It might seem a little bit too much information in the beggining and maybe you're used to a more fast paced, roll-strongattack-roll combat with quick addrenaline rushes. But if you're the kind of peson who likes games to be very refined, with beautiful animation, very elaborate and complete combat system, endless itens and a great learning curve with mastery as your ultimate prize: Monster Hunter World is the right game for you."

I cannot recommend it enough to people. The only bad things I can see in this game are: 1) The crazy, useless girl aka The Handler which is always talking and never helping ( Somewhat like navi from Ocarina Of Time) and 2) Relatively high requirements for high settings 60fps. If you like action ,get this game, it is well-worth the 60$ and if you ever find it on sale, DO NOT EVEN HESITATE GET IT. Also have fun.Update: I am now on 342 hours.

Except when you reach to the stage where you farm decorations, augmentations which are end game stuffs, a real pain in the ass trust me i've been with it for more than 100 hours just to get my charge blade build completed... Grinding for items/materials other than the ""end game stuffs"" in MHW is always a chill farming process, not as tedious as some other games i play for example: Warframe has its RNGesus beats the heck out of you;  Borderlands 2 requires you to get save editor so you can get a gun with the exact attachments you want unless you wanna spend hundreds of hours to get what you want.

It's definitively worth to try if you like grindy games and hunting monsters. The real game starts after completing the main story which might take more or less time depending on your playstyle. It might not have the amount of monsters of other MH games but it has way richer environment and the monsters also have things to do when you're not around and don't only exist for you to kill them.

Pros: - You can finally play the game and see it in full detail (unlike, for example, on the 3DS). In case your rig isn't able to handle the graphics, there's plenty of options that can be changed to give you a smoother experience. Early optimization issuess have also been addressed (for example, lightning weapons killing FPS has been fixed).- Devs have addressed issues in multiplayer matchmaking and the like. It's very easy to team up with people and play now compared to on release.- Controls are significantly better compared to the old days of using the crazy claw hand like you had to on the PSP. I particularly enjoy using my Steam controller for this game, and keyboard/mouse has been improved for ranged weapon players who would prefer not to have to fumble with a joystick.- Some quality of life changes have been added to MHW compared to previous MH titles. You can save loadouts, gathering has been sped up, your inventory now comes with fishing/etc so you don't need to put them into your inventory each time, and you can use the camp during hunts/quests to fix any equipment mistakes or otherwise instead of trekking all the way back to the lobby/town. There's likely more examples of how MHW has improved over prior MH games, but this is a small list of examples off the top of my head.- Console updates are being honored on the PC. We're receiving events, updates, and patches just like everyone else. Because of the devs attention to this port, there's a lot of fun content, though this is a newer pro for me since the addition of Lunastra, Kulve Taroth, etc has changed the game up and allowed me to do different things instead of just grinding the same tempered elder dragons for end game.Things that can be improved, I suppose:- The mix and match of armors to get the best stats leaves a lot to be desired when you look at your crazily dressed characters. Fortunately, MHW is rolling out layered armor settings now to help you hide your hideous appearance. - Sometimes, the grind bothers me based on items' chance to drop, but when has an MH title not had grinding?"
3574,ChilloutNitro,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067456249/,2,,1,238.4,November,"25,",146,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a game where more or less every fight is a boss fight. Each and every single monster is more unique than ever before with several new additions to the roster and plenty of the old favourites. The environments and monster designs are far more distinct and beautiful than ever before due to the transition from portable consoles to the more powerful consoles and the pc. The various armour and weapons also look outstanding.The game retains the cooperative experience the series is known for with fights that may be difficult and long to solo becoming shorter and easier with allies, however this relies on you and them not falling to the foe. While the game is focused on the multiplayer experience, you can still find enjoyment without friends as you can still tackle monsters solo or find people online with similar goals using the sos flare. The game also retains it's focus on the craftable armour and weapons which can allow for a wide variance in playstyles (especially with the new way skills are handled) from sets focused on status effects, pure damage sets, support sets and whatever you own personal style is. This allows people who enjoy minmaxing to get the most out of the game.The gameplay just feels right, it has the movement options, the satisfying combat and and so much more. Movement in a Monster Hunter game has never been as good as in this one: you can evade out of most moves, healing while on the move and the grapple can get you around some areas somewhat quicker. When it comes to the combat, each of the 14 weapons feel satisfying use with each hit carrying the weight you would expect. Furthermore there is basically a weapon type for everyone with each one being unique from one another. Returning from Monster Hunter 4 onward is mounting monsters from air attacks which can lead to powerful beat downs once a monster is knocked down. Finally, When it comes to combat, the game is fair and rewarding (with some exceptions). When you miss or get greedy and get hit, it is your fault rather than an unfair quirk or attack. On the flip side when you cause a monster to flinch before it's attack or knock it down, you are rewarded for your hard work with an opportunity to let loose your most powerful attacks into a monster which becomes more satisfying with a team coming together to pummel it. My only complaints when it comes to the gameplay are that the grapple is criminally under used and the odd actually unfair moves some of the far later monsters have.Simply put, Monster Hunter World is an amazing game and a great follow up from the previous games. The game is the most accessible yet without compromising the core gameplay of the series. There are many quality of life improvements that really help. The graphics are gorgeous. The cooperative play is satisfying and rewarding.If you don't like longer fights in games against sort of damage sponge enemies then this game may not be for you. Also if you came to a monster hunter game expecting a story then you may be a bit lost, it exists and is better than the plot of most of the games in the series but it's not majorly impactful. Otherwise I strongly recommend giving the game a shot as it is a rewarding experience with many appealing aspects.I give it a 'Rocket Powered Greatsword/10'."

It's responsive and I love the environments that are in this game. My hours on this game are short, but rest assured this game is beautiful as well as fun. Find friends. Start a community. It's out there in this game."
3576,Raiju,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raijuaes/,2,,1,695.3,November,"25,",265,0,1,"For those who enjoyed the classic Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter World is a step backwards in terms of content and difficultly. However for those new to the series, it's a really good place to start getting into the game. I've played since the original Monster Hunter on the PS2 and still had a really good time despite my concerns.World introduces a ton of quality of life features that really make the game much easier to play. Things which stand out are definetly the radial menu, pod system, and decorations. I do somewhat miss the old system of skills where it was much less fire and forget and had much greater capability for customization. Due to the homogenization most people wear the same piece of armor for most sets which get's pretty old real quick. There's a lot of power creep happening too with the new updates.Onto the gameplay. The weapons are all back with some new toys. However the lack of variety in play styles seems to be a pretty big issue. Previously in older MH games it was pretty common for each weapon to have about 3 different play styles. Most weapons in this game really have one optimal way to be played. 90% of them involve slapping on healing augment rocksteady and healing to just tank through the monster. Since monsters have much less health now the kills times are much shorter and it's pretty simple to just outtank them. Weapons like SnS, CB, and Bow definetly seem much more flow diagram heavy than the rest. However DS are now fun as hell and GL, Lance, Hammer, and GS have had much more flavor added to them. Mantles are good but probably too strong.Some of my favorite new additions to the series are Bazelgeus and Vaal Hazaak while certain old monster have had some new life breathed into them. I know people generally ahte Bazel but I kinda appreciate the chaos he brings which feels more reminiscent of the old series. Vaal Hazak could probably be much faster and have a less annoying fog but is interesting flavorwise and pretty cool designwise. Monsters do tend to target each other more now rather than focusing on you which brings the annoyance factor down by a lot. With the recent Kulve Taroth update, I feel like Capcom has finally figured out how to do siege monsters compared to the jhen and lao of past games. At least if you try to 1 phase it. Gogmazios is still probably the most difficult/fun to do though. The first time I 1 phased KT was probably one of the highlights of playing mhw. Playing online solo is pretty disappointing as the HP is scaled way too low. As usual 2 person MH is the max difficulty/enjoyment while 4 person is just a chain disable fiesta. Monsters are also much slower and signature moves like supernova are just laughable compared to before.Overall although Generations is the game with much more content and more replayability I'm still enjoying MHW a lot and hope that they will announce an expansion soon as the lack of content is the biggest problem at the moment. I will definetly be playing as long as they keep having updates for it but considering I've been here for so long I'm probably just a sucker for the series."

The addition of Radial Menu (or KB Shortcuts) is sleek. You don't have to panic run and search for pots. + Camera view has been a pain since PSP days on Portable 2nd G, MH3, etc since 1 analog is only present. Using a controller with 2 analogs now or a mouse for camera movement is heaveeeeeen. + Addition of side quests like bounties (weekly, etc) makes it unexhaustive.+ Increasing the cultivation slot to three was very nice. I think it was only one or two before on previous installments. + Some noob walls ahead. Game is very easy to learn but very hard to master. Utmost patience is very needed+ More plus if you play with friends! Panic, shouting, and bashing over discord!- Consecutive Item usage and fast switching of controls (e.g. sheathing a weapon then using an item) is quite slow. You have to wait first some milli sec/s before you can do the succeeding desired actionAudio & Visuals+ JP Audio plus Eng SUB, perfection.+ Different sets of audio setting. I love the more realistice preset (wider) but it kind of lowers the sound output drastically. Separation is quite nice though especially on a wider soundstaged headphones.- Voice is not synced with the animation. It's like someone's chewing with open mouth then you hear some words.~ Ultrawide is supported via Mod~ Visuals are good. We've seen better, admit it. And Capcom too is aware of this. Just that the framework chosen is already old. Images are compressed and colors are slightly washed out (can be fixed using some Mod). But on the bright side, some scenes are just breathaking (Hi Credits).+ Effects are awesome. Lightning and flare effects are the bomb. Fighting elder drags have never been more awesome. Sometimes you can just lie down and watch Teostra do its thang; kill your FPS. Optimization- Bad. Upon bumping into some threads, could see that one issue is the CPU Utilization (which can be fixed by K's mod) and probably the framework itself. At somepoint, you'll just hit 60FPS-ish from 100 on some scenes (1080Ti @ 1440p, Max, volume rendering and the other ??? setting is off)+ On the bright side, community is there to help. Some issues can be fixed. Some are not. But, it is very playable even on an entry level gaming setups.Story ~ Story is a bit short but that story is just a tutorial to get you on-boarded on the game. ~ around 50 hours of game time to complete the main story lineSupport+ MHW:PC was off on a rough start. But devs have been patching things every now and then. Monthly? Bi-monthly? Enough to feel that they really do care about its players and wanted them to stay immersed. Initial launch, you can't even play multiplayer properly because of the DC issue. But it was addressed as needed. And they have been constantly picking up feedbacks from the community to continuously improve performance, controls (like the mouse acceleration, key binding shortcuts, etc). They are no superheroes like CD Projekt Red. Still, they try to do it right.+ Community is starting a bit ok given that it just got released recently. Good mods (prettier handler, eyes, HD texture which is a fix on the compressed GFX, etc). Just do hope that Capcom won't ban it."

All of the weapons are fun and feel unique, and despite individual hunts only taking 5-10 minutes once you get into the swing of the game, I find myself easily spending hours and hours on end playing because ""just playing one more won't take me very long!""Before you buy it, it's worth looking online at some gameplay from the weapons so you can see whether or not the actual combat looks entertaining to you. If the combat isn't that fun, then this probably isn't for you. The story doesn't have a ton of depth. This isn't a game where you explore much. There are some fun odds and ends you can do in your downtime like hunt for pets and fish, but this is Monster Hunter. You hunt monsters. If that's not your thing, then this probably won't be very fun."

Could it be better? Of course, but we have to draw a line somewhere, and overall I'm just happy that this game is even available on PC.I think the thing I enjoy most about this game is the playstyle reminds me of good MMO games, but it can be played all Singleplayer, or Multiplayer or with friends.The core gameplay loop is: Find new monster, hunt said monster, harvest monster for it's parts to make yourself stronger, rinse and repeat. Sounds dull in writing, but it is very good. MHW does it better than other games with a similar model, and the continued free updates are a cherry on top.I've heard from Monster Hunter veterans the game has been.. altered, to appeal to a wider audience. I can't speak to the truth of that, as this is my first real Monster Hunter game that I've played for more than a couple of hours. So maybe, this game is for a more casual audience, but that's fine, because the changes made me stick with it, compared to previous MH games.The game is worth it at full price. I was hesitant at first because I don't buy many full-priced games, but it's more than a port. They have made PC specific improvements, and it will get most of the content updates that console players have already got, for free. I much prefer the pay once + optional purchases to support ongoing updates, over Game + DLC + DLC for DLC + Microtransactions that some games use right now.Buy the game, play it with friends, have a good time. Even if you stop playing eventually, the new events + monsters that show up for free will keep you coming back on occasion."

3646,NotNelkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nelkey/,2,,1,276.1,November,"22,",271,1,1,"Late review, wanted to do this for a while so decided to still write it!MH3Ultimate was the first Monster Hunter game I played and I instantly fell in love with it and having over 500+ hours in I still can't let go of this beauty. Finaly being able to defeat the Zinogre felt like a life time achievement, grinding dozens of ours to get that one special item you need to finish a armour set or make that awesome looking badass hammer to crush more skulls with or teaming up with other players to hunt the most dangerous monsters out there! It still gives me a rush everytime I start up the game!Unfortunately, I can't say the same about Monster Hunter: World. Don't get me wrong, it's a good game but doesn't give me the same feeling as the previous games. After being hyped up for it and reading very good reviews I decided to pre-order the game earlier this year. I played it non-stop and was completely addicted once more and had an amazing experience playing. Still, I felt like something was missing.After some intense monster fights I reached the endgame, time to fight the elder dragons! Nergigante is one the best monsters ever created! It doesn't give you a chance to rest at all and after finaly killing it I felt relieved and drained from the fight. The other elder dragons also have a amazing fight but here does come my one of multiple problems with the game. Xeno'jiiva. Yes, the last elder dragon in the main story. After seeing its cutscene I was so hyped up for the battle...! But then the battle starts and it becomes a very boring and straight forward battle with the monster. Easy to avoid, does a lot of the same attacks in a row and overall doesn't do anything special. It looks majestic though being the biggest monster in the main story if not the enitre game! The music for the fight is also very very very good and it adds a nice feeling to the fight. Of course, I don't have anything bad to say about his armour, its the most beautiful armour in the game.After this brief introduction, let's sum up the Pros and other Cons!Pros:* The game looks stunning! Unfortunately my PC isn't able to run the game on maximum settings so I had to push it down to medium/low. Even on these settings the game looks pretty neat! And since the game seems to be a heavy thing to run, thats good new for the people who have budget PCs!* The combat in this game is amazing. Very smooth movements, amazing weapon combos. Honestly, I don't have any complains about it* Sherlock, of course the monsters are great. It's a Monster Hunter game! Once again, CAPCOM did an amazing job on the design of them! My personal favorite design is in fact the Xeno'jiiva eventho the battle sucks, it gets saved by the design of the majestic beast!* The multiple areas are pretty fricking good! Again, nothing bad to say about the design at all! Ancient Forest can be a maze in the beginning but after a few hunts you can locate yourself pretty nicely through the forest.* I will seperate the Weapon and Armour designs in this review. The differents armour sets looks absolutely beautiful. You can instantly recognize what armour set belongs to what monster. Well done CAPCOM once again.* I really loved building multiple builds from multiple monster armour pieces. After being able to get a 95% crit on weak parts I was satisfied with my build! That's not my only build of course, I have multiple builds in my box and all of them are endgame viable! Figuring out if I need to sure Alpha or a Beta piece pulled me in more!* The crafting is amazing as always. Nothing to add, just awesome!* The multiplayer is great. Starting a hunt, sending out an SOS flare and people start joining instantly! I've had a few connection issues in the first week of release but never had any problems with it after. Good job once again CAPCOM!Cons:* Oof... oof... oof... Weapon Designs... Yea, that doesn't sound good does it? Well, it shound't sound good. I was very disappointed with the designs. Many of them looks the exact same for the majority of the game. They finally change when you reach the second to last or last rarity of a path. This is something the previous MH games did right. I hope they will add more variety to the next games.* The monster may look amazing but there aren't a lot of monsters. Only having 31 large monsters on release wasn't enough. Of course they added the beloved Deviljho and are about to add more to the game it, still the game felt over very fast because of this.* The game looks awesome but game performance is something else. It's not very good all of the time. The Kushala Daora fight is suck a fricking pain in the ass when it drops all of his tornados and the FPS goes to ♥♥♥♥. This frustratred me a lot. Also having some frame drops here and there were annoying sometimes.* To me, the game is to easy. I am used to this hardcore experience, needing to bring everything with me on hunts, even whetstones! MHWorld just gives them to you and they can't run out! No need to bring pickaxes, no need to bring nets to catch bugs. These kind of features took away the hardcore experience for me.* MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD is a good game. Not flawless but it's a good PC entry for the series! If you are looking to get into the series, MH World is a good choice but it doens't reflect entirely what the series is about. Is it worth to buy the game at full price? For me it for sure was! If you are not sure, wait for a discount and buy it! This was my first review on a game on Steam. Hopefully it helped you to with your decision to buy the game or not."
3647,Dogbowl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zombiekitty72/,2,,1,964.3,November,"22,",224,0,1,"In Monster Hunter: World, you smack giant monsters over the head with giant weapons until they stop moving. Then you carve up their corpses to make better armor and weapons to make them stop moving faster. And it's amazingly fun. I've been with this series since Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and a PC release is what I had always dreamed for.Positive aspects (in my opinion):- The graphics are absolutely gorgeous. It takes a pretty hefty rig to get a stable 60 fps, but it's worth it.- There are 14 different weapon archetypes to choose from. These include 3 ranged and 11 melee options. Each weapon type is greatly varied from the last, so looking a tutorial for the type you want to use, or at least practicing with it is a must. Once you learn how to use a weapon, it becomes amazingly fun and satisfying to use.- Armors give different skills, so building up an effective set is important. Skills can be mixed and matched to find a set that is effective and fun, but also one that looks good.- The monsters (both new and old) are fun to fight. Learning their attacks and openings is required to be effective in killing them, but once you do, it's very satisfying to fight them.- You can hunt with friends or randoms via SOS flare. Connection issues occur on occasion but they have been mostly fixed at the time of writing.- Worth a mention, you can fish and capture pets to place in your personal quarters. There's a round fluffy bird and it's adorable.Negative aspects (in my opinion):- Previous games had much more monster variety than World. More monsters are being added to this game, but the variety still doesn't come close to that of previous games.- The weapons for any given archetype all look very similar. They basically used a couple different base models and put different monster parts on them to differentiate them. This is a purely aesthetic thing, but again, previous games had much more variety in this department.TL:DR; most of the negatives of this game stem from lack of variety. But that issue is mitigated by how immensely fun it is to just beat up the monsters."

If you are looking for a game to grind with friends, then you have come to the right place. Get together with three other friends to form a group for a HUNT! Some people say it gets old fast after you reach end-game since the principle of this game is endless grinding on the same monsters. If that is the case, then it is time to switch it up to a new weapon type. Do not stay with one weapon forever because you will get tired of it after 100 hours plus.

With every patch they are fixing and bringing in new/old content in to the PC version of the game which gives players more things to do (plus the updates are free). It will also give players a reason to come back to Monster Hunter World every once in awhile for those new/old monster or event kind of updates that the devs have been putting out for the game. Hopefully devs will continue to support this game and bring newer/older content to the PC version but we will just have to wait and see. With all that in mind I'd still recommend this game to anyone looking for a monster hunting co-op experience but with 60 dollar price tag I'd recommend you get the game on sale, it is bound to be on some steam sales in the future."

Cats!+  Decent graphical fidelity on max without any hiccups (GTX 1080)-- Connectivity issues, I solo´d 75 % of the game since it would keep disconnecting when     playing with friends. Somewhat repaired with recent patches, though it´s still not great. I     just want to easily connect with others and hack things to fine paste-  A bit inaccessible to newcomers, had to search the web to understand some things-  Inconsistent camera controls/angles. Can screw you over in a bad way-  Playing with a controller, the controls feels a bit clunky especially switching from    running/drawing weapon-  The late game becomes a grind fest to get the rare drops for the best weaponry/armor. Be     prepared to fight the same monster 10 timesAll in all I found great enjoyment in this game despite these flaws.

Was quite upset that we had to wait 6+ months for its release on PC. However, after playing it for more than 3-4 weeks now, I can say it's Well-worth the wait and the money. What I appreciated the most, is the depth of detail and complexity in this game. It tells you a lot during tutorials but there is much more that you can to discover by observing the environment. The beautiful thing is, you are not forced discover everything but when/if you do, it feels amazing. Plus, it helps you a lot.From zones to monsters to 14 different weapons, you can clearly see many things are well-thought in this game. Not to mention the fact that each weapon offers unique and different gameplay experience. (Unlike 90% of the games I've played). They feel that unique and deep. I'm not used to saying so many positive things about a game. I don't know, maybe it hits all the right spots for my taste. Maybe you won't like this game as much as I did. Regardless, at the very least, definitely worth a try in my opinion. Especially nowadays that many people make games not out of passion but for money.

It is a time consuming game, I play it when I have spare time (or when I’m supposed to be doing other things <.<) The combat definitely has a different feel than most games and you have to experience it to know that feeling.

But the progression system in this game sucks.  In the old games you used to have to level up your hunter rank to unlock new things so it gave you goals and objectives to achieve.  In this, half the armors in this game you just skip over since you progress so fast basically making them worthless.  Then on top of it there really is no point in getting better armor since the difficulty of the game is sub par.  So basically you get this better armor for nothing since there is no end game objectives/goals.  You can also restock your items in camp just making the game to easy."

It's renowned for its endgame grind, where you go on ever more complex and challenging hunts across diverse, tangled open worlds in search of rare items needed to craft an armor set that’ll no doubt crown you the min-max champion of the world. But Monster Hunter’s essence and greatest strength are its tense, desperate, and tragic fights with beautiful beasts that can go on for the better part of an hour.It is also about the gleeful colonization 'new' lands and the slaughter of native species. Monster Hunter is a grotesque fantasy, but if you can stomach the merciless, repeated slaughter of god's beautiful dragon children, you'll find an excellent, endless action game that tests reflex and intellect in equal measure.Unlike the story, murdering World's dozens of intricately designed monsters has a point. There’s no leveling up and skill point allocation in Monster Hunter, so crafting armor and weapons is the only way to permanently buff your stats. Gear crafted from monsters reflects their strengths and weaknesses, so if you’re having trouble with a thick-skinned fire type, you’d best go take down the thicker, hotter Ratholos for fire-resistant armor, and maybe seek out a poisonous monster for a weapon that does a bit more damage over time. Clear affinities between behavior, aesthetic, and the hard numbers that govern monster stats make deciding which monster to hunt next and which gear you’ll need to ruin them relatively easy to determine, though a few endgame fights might require some careful menu digging.All 30-something monsters (with more on the way via free updates) have distinct personalities brought to life through realistic animation, observable behaviors, and detailed models. My favorite, the Paolumu, is a fuzzy pink and white bat creature that balloons like a blowfish when threatened. The Kulu-Ya-Ku is a big dodo bird that uses big rocks as its first line of defense. The Anjanath, a fire-breathing, chicken-winged T-Rex, would be the final boss in most games. Hitting one until it stops moving for the first time is an immense, sad accomplishment. And then a Rathian plunges from the sky and captures an Anjanath in its claws, flailing your former final boss monster around like a ragged teddy bear. Somehow, they get bigger yet, with creatures that resemble fallen, very grumpy gods.  Gods or dodos, hunts work the same throughout the entire game. You ‘post’ a quest in Astera, the busy hub area, eat a quick meal to buff your stats, and if you’re playing with friends, you and up to three others embark to a particular biome. From there, you’ll wander an intricate environment in search of your monster. Scoutflies, sentient compass bugs, will point you to nearby crafting materials and monster tracks, always nudging you towards an inevitable fight. Problem is, biomes are populated with monsters besides your target, and they’ll probably interrupt your fight. Letting them duke it out while you hide can work in your favor, sure, but staying out of the way isn’t easy. Environmental hazards complicate hunts further. Do you try to lure an Anjanath beneath a massive boulder strung up by vines above? Loosing it with your slingshot could flatten you too.Monsters have no visible health bar, but they’ll appear tired and increasingly scarred the weaker they get. At certain intervals, they’ll make a break for it and try to find a place to sleep or prey of their own to eat in order to build HP and stamina, turning hunts into frenzied chases. Knowing your environment, where the monster might be headed, and the fastest way to get there only comes with experience. That’s OK because World’s combat is strongest when it feels like a struggle. Swings with the greatsword take literal seconds of animation, the hammer requires getting too close for comfort, and even the mobile ranged weapons feel like unwieldy, clunky machines. I’m partial to the switch axe, a weapon that stores elemental damage in axe form and releases it in explosive bursts after transforming into a glowing sword the size of a teenager.It still looks tiny to a burrowing sand wyvern or electric flying squirrel lizard. Big sword or not, you can and will get poisoned, paralyzed, burned, stunlocked, put to sleep and become subject to every attack your quarry can muster while you're helpless. Swings and shots from your friends can interrupt your own, and your every attempt to exhaust your movement abilities will also exhaust your character. For example, if you jump while sprinting to dodge an attack, your character will always leap forward and fall flat on their face. Remember: this is not your house, and you are very small. Combat isn’t fun in the way it is in Dark Souls or Devil May Cry, which reward constant, fluid combos and perfect timing, but it is always tense, and often hilarious. And when you can walk the line and land a rare, righteous combo directly on a Rathain's scaly dome, the feeling is euphoric.But so much gets in the way of that crunchy feedback loop. If the intent of crafting and gear management (the usual downtime activity between hunts) is to make you feel as if you've cultivated food, curated your looks, and performed the proper research required to take down whatever big boy is next on the list, then abstract menu interactions aren’t the most inventive or satisfying way to go about it. When the hunting portion of Monster Hunter is so vividly rendered by massive, believable creatures and lush environments, digging through menus to turn herbs into potions and potions into mega potions lacks the same ceremony. It's fine, in the end, because the menu interactions are streamlined enough that they're not impossible to parse and rarely tedious. Still, for as busy and complex as the crafting and item management appears, it’s painless in practice, simplifying the series’ formerly complex systems to such a degree that they don't even resemble the systems they're simplifying. Why not reinvent them at this point? Monster Hunter: World also opens by bashing you over the head with text-heavy tutorials. You'll learn how to craft dozens of items immediately, most of which won't matter until a dozen hours in. Nearly every character in the Astora hub spews text about economies and changing item types, placing the fantasy of preparation on equal footing with filing taxes. Vital tips are glossed over too, like how you can use piercing pods to prevent monsters from running away, or how to craft some of the most essential items. I appreciate withholding information from the perspective of a role-playing hunter, where only battle-hardened vets will have obtained the most arcane knowledge. But the bulk of World's inner workings are only accessible through wikis and hearsay, the assumption being that you'll figure some stuff out on your own, or collapse and turn to Google.In the early hours, all you need to know is how to swing and dodge. It’s only when high rank missions are unlocked that you’ll need to do some research.  Source: PC Gamer"

I repurchased the game on pc after owning it on ps4 since launch, while not being able to skip the cutscenes can be a little bit of a slog the game doesnt really start until after you complete the story either way and youre farming monsters. Every weapon is viable and well balanced with different weapons spiking for damage at different points or allowing for more sustained damage.To those complaining about poor optimization, I think its time to upgrade for you fellas. I'm running the game on a 3rd gen i5 8 gigs of ddr3 ram and a 1060 3gb version and the game runs flawlessly.I highly suggest using a controller, the keyboard and mouse controls arent bad but the controller controls have everything you need with ease of access. If youre a fan of the series or someone looking to try something new I suggest taking the dive and picking this up you wont regret it. Happy hunting!"

3688,Santiago,https://steamcommunity.com/id/senorsantiago/,3,,1,180.7,October,"15,","1,093",0,1,"That’s the predominant loop of gameplay in ’s . Take down the big, bad monster and harvest every part. Use that to craft better gear, kill a stronger creature and harvest better stuff, et cetera. This simple formula gets carried by the interesting diversity of weapon mechanics and character builds on offer.I haven’t played many games like this. I tend to steer clear of clumsy ports from console to PC and/or games that heavily show eastern roots. MH:W exhibits both of those things in a variety of ways. The dialogue, story, character appearance, emotes, combat, and more are rife with non-western influence despite what I estimate to be a decent effort at localization. Even the little hop animation your character does when grabbing a transport during area transition cutscenes sneaks in a K-Pop-esque move! This influence is neither good nor bad, just worth pointing out.As for it being a console port, the game unquestionably favors controller input over mouse and keyboard, but thankfully you can get accustomed to and partially remap the (undeniably awkward) control scheme so that it better fits M+KB.The game feels polished despite so obviously being a port. Very few bugs or glitches encountered from day one. The issues seem to be more at the design level than the technical. In terms of art and visuals it’s a beautiful looking environment with lush landscapes and exotic critters, great and small. The soundtrack does its job well, but the right music doesn’t always cue up at the right time.The UI and many, many menus a player must navigate are not user friendly or accessible at first. It all takes time and exposure to become proficient with. Even then, I don’t think it’ll ever feel fluid on M+KB. I’ve yet to experiment with controller. The camera is a bit stiff, kind of fights you, and doesn’t stop on a dime. System settings can mitigate this a bit, so be sure to look through  settings and optimize from the start.Multiplayer and grouping are a huge pain. Rarely have I seen a multiplayer system more poorly designed and implemented than this, which is baffling when it could have been so much better. Total lack of explanation of systems, so you’re more or less on your own figuring it out. Frequent disconnections, inability to connect or reconnect to other player lobbies, pointless restrictions on which missions can be played together, hassles over the simplest multiplayer activity such as getting into the same instance of an area to free roam. No shared space in the main hub where you can see other players outside of one small portion of town, in which a very limited range of things can actually be done. Pitifully small number of actions you can actually do to interact with others or express yourself, socially speaking. Just baffling!When you do manage to get a good multiplayer session going however, it’s an absolute blast to play with friends. Many situations will scale difficulty based on the number of players present, which is critical to keep in mind. Some missions also can only be performed solo or with a max of two players. The normal cap is four players. It’s nice to roll with a group because it will feel like damage output is comparatively lacking when solo. It just goes faster in a group (as long as everyone is contributing).The single most impressive aspect of  and the biggest draw for me is the sheer number and variety of weapons (playstyles) in the game. 14 distinct weapon types that each dramatically alter your style of play and approach to combat. I recommend not getting pigeon holed into one, but rather becoming proficient in several.There’s an equally interesting variety of dangerous monsters. Each of them has unique strengths and weaknesses. Sort of like the witcher Geralt of Rivia, you as a monster hunter must bring the right tools to every new encounter. That’s the core of the fun here: learning your weapons and discovering what build works well against which critter. That said, you can essentially build an all-purpose general monster slaying character and never change a thing; but that’d limit your potential (and the fun) significantly, not to mention leave you with little to work towards in endgame.You’ve got to hand it to the devs; with such different control schemes for weapons, this game forces the development of player proficiency – actual player skill. The downside I suppose is that it’s a bit annoying and overwhelming to learn so much at the outset. This is why I stuck with three or four fairly different weapons.The key to creating a build is not just weapon choice, but (arguably more so) skill choice. Skills are attached to specific weapons, trinkets, armor pieces, and jewels (that can be socketed into your gear). Certain armor lines also have set bonuses that provide totally game changing properties. You can render a particularly tough fight with a tempered elder dragon into an almost trivial affair if you bring precisely the right build! However, crafting the gear/skills to complete said build ironically often requires killing that very same creature it’s effective against. Have fun with that!There’s plenty of RPG goodness to sink your teeth into when creating builds. Make a lightning fast, high elemental damage dual blades. Or a tanky, virtually cc-immune lance that can block every attack in the game. Or anything in between. Your strategy can take into account raw damage and defense, element type, resistances, status ailments, movement speed, dodging, blocking, healing, support, mounting and aerial capability, crowd control, item use, ranged and melee effectiveness, unique mechanics from set bonuses, and of course the attacks and mechanics of individual monsters. If you wanted to go off the deep end, you could create a build for every single encounter in the game…That’d take a while.Came in not knowing what to expect. Definitely wasn’t sure about this one starting out, but I ended up having a really enjoyable experience. I highly recommend this be played with friends; still fun solo but I believe the experience is diminished somewhat without the group dynamic. In the next installment I hope the cute but weirdly human-like animal companion at least is a choice between dog and cat…But those cat armors are truly the stuff of legend.-TIP: Proceed directly through the main story missions rather than farming or dallying too long on other content. The game flows better that way. You want to unlock high tier armor lines in good time so you know what to work towards. Doesn’t hurt to complete optional quests as they come up along the way.-TIP: Armor upgrade spheres come often and easily (from bounties), so for Pete’s sake use them on whatever you’re wearing. Or you’ll be squishy, very squishy.-TIP: If you find yourself short on currency due to crafting/upgrading weapons and armor, go to your item box and sell superfluous crafting materials for a fast source of income.-TIP: Optimize your entire game right off the bat rather than doing it halfway through the game and having to readjust. There are settings that improve just about every aspect of this game for PC users, and the developers continue to work post-launch towards PC optimization. For item hotbars, the F1 through F4 setting works better on M+KB than the radial menu."

3690,Smarticle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Smartestwar4/,2,,1,"1,043.3",October,"12,",79,0,1,"is one of my most favorite RPG games that I've ever played. This is my first entrance into the Monster Hunter series and suffice as to say, it delivers on a whole lot. This is by no means a perfect game, in fact there are some glaring flaws in terms of gameplay and control optimization, but once when you settle down and get used to everything, there's fun to be had. There's a ton to learn and even more as the game progresses. I feel like the 60 bucks that I spent on this game was well worth the amount of content that I was given. Not to mention the fact that Capcom keeps adding more monsters and other content into the game for FREE! There's a lot I want to talk about on every angle of this game on why it's so great that it overwhelms its flaws, however, there's way too much to talk about that when I wrote an original review, I went past the word limit for the review box. I highly recommend this game, however, be warned that this game requires a lot of patience, willingness to learn, and a sound mind. This game isn't easy but it's nowhere near Dark Souls. Speaking of Dark Souls, some Dark Souls players might be familiar with the flow of the combat in this game.  The game WILL punish you and will test your mental stability.As for most games, this game is indeed fun with friends, however, there's issues when it comes to social interaction in the game and I believe it still needs some fixing. When entering an instance, the entire hub area is only instanced for yourself while a small room in that hub area serves as a hub for social interaction which makes no sense in a game that should feel more open and robust with life through friends and other gamers alike. There are guild cards which just tells you stats of other people but doesn’t have anything to do with guilds and there feels like less encouragement to actually interact or socialize to make the game a little livelier. However, it’s fun to play with random people who know what they’re doing sometimes and that’s the general quirk of multiplayer for all games, but this one, it gives a unique experience.Anyway, this game gave me one of the greatest experiences and there’s a whole lot to do. To this day there hasn’t been any loot box nor intrusive microtransactions in the game. The furthest microtransactions go for the game are just mere store costume cosmetics but that’s pretty much it. The updates filled with large content that are coming to the game is FREE. Again, I personally felt like the $60 I spent on this game was most definitely well spent, and I spent nearly 200 hours on this game, and I feel like I haven’t learned about everything this game has to offer. That said, this game is phenomenal and can't wait to see what Iceborne has to offer."

Granted this game has put a lot of effort to make it enjoyable, levels are fun to traverse and there are plenty of ways to gather what you need, but in the end it's still a long grind.All I can say to people who might want to play this is - Do some research, it's a complex game, and just give it a try. and rest assured there will be more than enough gameplay to cover the cost."

This is one of those games where you need to learn how to dodge to survive, you need to conserve your potions wisely, need to learn how to interact with your environment because it will turn your dire situations into less giant dragon chasing u through the jungle to devour you. There are limits to how much you can carry, limits to certain items that can be brought and that's fine by me. The game has astounding visuals and graphics it's quite hard to put down once you start playing. Although, once you finish the storyline you'll end up mostly just hunting monsters to craft end game tier gear and grinding tempered monsters for gems to put in your armor and weps. It's a fun game overall and a nice change of pace of MMO's that usually have typically boss' that have obvious attack patterns.

The combat is impressive, in depth, and takes a while to master each of the 14 weapons (what would otherwise be entirely different classes in other games in the same genre). Visual and stat customization have a bit of depth to them, where you can specialise into full on DPS, niche forms of combat like jump attacks or mounting, or support builds with the option to do a bit of each without hurting your overall enjoyment. The monsters are varied, with just enough in common with each other that you can pick up tells quickly, but there is always the risk of getting caught in a lucky hit and going down anyways.

The monsters are fun and mostly unique, making them interesting and I forget I am grinding for their parts half the time as I just enjoy the hunts.  Story is interesting, nothing special but enough to keep you going and add some wonder I guess.  the world itself is pretty, and I have spent time just wandering around to see how each area shifts as you walk around.

If you have this is the perfect game for you! This RPG experience is something I have always dreamt about but never knew was available until recently. With giant monsters to slay to cute kittens as companions, this game is my dream come true.Your first experience with this game is on a boat running from a goliath beast, taller than most of the New York City skyline. After you wake up from probably the worst head injury in the history of ever, you awake on the monster! After your epic getaway from the beast, you finally get on the mainland and get a taste of what's to come. And after that quick description of the game here is what I think of it. The graphics are beautiful. From the amount of flora and wildlife to the huge creatures themselves the game feels like it was painted by Picasso himself.From great to bad now. One of the biggest issues with the game at the moment is doing quests with others and connecting with friends. Seeing as how most games connectivity with others is fast and simple, this game really falls short. It should take points with other games and make an actual party system for you and your friends to join quickly in the hub. And on another note, make joining people before they see a cutscene possible. Combat is as fun as it gets. With combos that feel natural and weapons that can switch from a giant ax to a sword, combat has never felt as good in any game. Crafting is cool and unique. With dozens of materials, you can use to make potions and mega potions. With later on in the game, you can grow materials you need for more complex items which max out your health and stamina.Weapons and armor are varied widely. And with the equipment saving feature it allows you to transition between weapons, armor, and your pouch inventory. Also to add to that, there are whole lists of different weapons and armor with awesome skills, it makes every armor piece and weapon feel different and useful. I'd say this game is GOTY contender for sure. And despite the flaw with the multiplayer, it's definitely worth a buy, especially on sale."

3718,"hey, ik zeg je iets",https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109889765/,2,,1,193.6,September,"15,",67,2,1,"Note: I am not good at writing reviews, but I wanted to review this game because it's overall is mixed partially due to an error (which rarely occurs for me nowadays) and I think that one is a bit unjustified. And the other main reason being unable to fully play multiplayer, as you as a person first need to see the cutscene of a boss before being able to play with friends. And this one, yeah, it's annoying but it's still (in my opinion) very doable as your friends can immediately join the quest after you've watched the cutscene.This is one of the first games where I bought it on release and didn't look at any content before buying. I went in blind because a couple of friends I know did as well. And to say the least, the game thus far hasn't been disappointing at all.Graphic wise I think the game is gorgeous. It visually just looks so appealing to both the people that have and have never touched a Monster Hunter game before (like me). With very diverse landscapes that don't get tiring very quickly. I've been to the Ancient Forest plenty of times but still every time I go there no matter for what I still think it looks great, same goes for all of the other areas that MHW has to offer. The gameplay although sometimes a bit repetitive when it comes killing a boss (e.g. having to grind the same boss for a specific weapon/piece of gear) or looking for tracks (e.g. Pink Rathian or Nergigante) it is still very diverse in my opinion. There's plenty of bosses currently and there's still bosses that are going to be added in the game of course, seeing Deviljho already added pretty soon after the release. So I don't see why other bosses won't follow soon. But even killing the same boss is always different because there's always different scenarios that can play out (e.g. different monsters that interfere in your fight *cough Bazelgeuse*, turf wars, etc.). Also once you've got your hands on a certain set of gear that you want to use and start griding for tempered monsters (which you start doing a lot once you kill Xeno'Jiiva) you will always be killing different tempered monsters (at least that's what I found myself doing) instead of constantly the same monster. That's because all tempered investigations have the same purpose: Grinding augmentations and decorations. Speaking of gear, the weapons make the bosses even more diverse as there's plenty of viable weapons in the game that are in my opinion a lot of fun and all play differently. Even though I haven't tried much apart from the Great Sword, Insect Glaive, Bow, Charge Blade and Dual Blades myself, I've watched a lot of people play the weapons and it looks very interesting to say the least.TL:DR, I could go on forever but I hope this review says enough. The game is great in my opinion and to see a game like this with still approx. 100k+ players every day is really satisfying (as not a lot of games have that nowadays). I'd recommend you buy it even if you've never played a MH game before (that is of course, if you don't mind the first two things mentioned which to me are just minor annoyances). Even if the concept just sounds interesting to you, I'd recommend it and say that in whatever way possible you should try out/buy the game."

I pre-ordered the PC version a week or 2 before the actual launch. Funny thing is, MHW PC was my first game on Steam, first game I ever pre-ordered and first game I played on Steam.My experience is so far AWESOME. Even though this is my first ever Monster Hunter game, I was able to quickly catch up with most basic and repetitious stuffs. I played fine all alone till Anjanath came out of nowhere to faint me twice and that's the moment I tried playing online.Connection wasn't stable in the early days and today I rarely see any issues in online play. I love this game and that must be why I was doing late nights ever since August 9th slaying monsters. Playing solo is hard for monsters after Anjanath the first time, but once you catch up with their pattern, it's not a big deal. You can ENJOY a lot when you play online with friends and random people. I mean when you slay big monsters in just 2-3 mins, that's amazing and fast.When you use Dual Blades, it becomes SO FAST!!BTW, one thing I dislike is the font used in options. When you compare that with other games, you feel something is missing. ;)"

That's true, it's there when many more things are added, the double crafting, more challenging monsters, more armors, etc... The only negative thing i see: low ranks should not be mixed with high ranges, this makes players without experiences sometimes make the whole team lose the hunt.MHW is one of those titles that gave me a pleasant surprise, I had no idea that I would enjoy a game so much.

Even as you're nearing towards the endgame builds with decoration farming and such, there always is more to learn with the wide array of weapons to choose from. Each weapon I've tried out has such a different feel to it and I can notice my playstyle changing based on what type of weapon I have on.Overall a really fun game.

3729,Augell,https://steamcommunity.com/id/augell/,2,,1,882.1,September,"9,",591,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World is one of my most played games on steam and I absolutely love it. I've played a couple of the other games in the series on 3DS, and from getting into the series from playing those games mostly singleplayer, I quickly got interested in this game due to it having better online functionalities and being on PC which is my primary platform for games.The part that got me hooked on the series is the crafting of weapons and armor. Crafting new weapons and armor from the parts of the monster you've recently hunted, to be able to face even stronger monsters, to then repeat the process is a very satisfying gameplay loop. Being a bit of a completionist I've found myself trying to get every piece of every armor set, and every weapon of my main weapon type, and I love it.The gameplay of Monster Hunter is a lot like the Dark Souls games. going back and forth between the two always gets me confused with the controls, since there are so many simlilariteies. You play with a third person perspective and fight monsters while dodging attacks and trying to get into position to fight back. Sticking to a weapon throughout the game will make you really feel like you've become an expert with it after a while, and knowing how to make use of your weapon and it's moveset is a necessity for the lategame.The game has some connection problems and demands a lot from your computer to play without any lag. I've found that alt-tabbing out of the game while in a session has a chance of disconnecting me if I do it too often, so be careful with that. Other than that I haven't had any huge issues with technical problems. The game has also got a lot of updates since it's release and is now a very good and polished experience, especially with the Iceborne expansion.I'd recommend this game to anyone who's up for a challenge and doesn't mind a bit of grinding for materials. The story is decent, but I wouldn't use it as a main selling point. The best parts of this game is the monster hunting parts and the process of crafting and upgrading your equipment."

Hunt Monsters. While at times it is a bit too obviously a console port with its incredibly awkward default keybindings or it not making use of the keyboard having, y´know, lots of keys, and making you first press one key to bring up your hotkeyd items bar and then another key to actually use something on it instead of having just one step for this or actually having changing bindings for the same actio thoughrout the game, left click for interacting with things in town and right click outside of town, what?None of these things take away from the fact that it is great to finally be able to play a monster hunter game with my mouse and keyboard instead of always being forced to have to deal with a controller. That said I would certainly hope that in the future more effort is put into making the PC version of the game at least feel like they tried changing it somewhat to adjust for it not being on a console.As for the gameplay, it is amazing to be able to fight the monsters on a big screen after several monster hunter games on the 3ds though after having played the ultimate versions of the previous games Monster Hunter World does feel a little bit lacking in the amount of monsters and would certainly be helped by having at least 5-10 more species or even just subspecies that are different enough to the current monsters. That said none of this takes away from the joy of fighting the monsters that are in the game currently.Sadly despite all the good things the one thing I really haven´t felt much enthusiasm with in this game is the multiplayer. When doing the main story quests all players need to play solo up till a cutscene for most quests before abandoning and joining on one if they want to play together which is clunky to the extreme, in addition to this sometimes joining mid quest doesn´t work with people in your session and we´ve also had frequent disconnections in the first weeks after launch though these have since reduced. SOS weirdly seemed to work better than joining mid quest on fellow session members though that can bring in random people which you might not want if you just are looking to play with some friends. Especially as it can happen that these random people will use cheats to for example instantly kill the monster to be hunted which kinda ruins the entire point of the game. So all this leaves multiplayer a bit of a mixed bag.All in all I would still recommend this game especially if you´re fine with playing single player part of the time as I have definitely thoroughly enjoyed it even with the rather low FPS my below minimum requirements PC managed to produce, but if you are mainly looking to play with friends do take into account that you may occasionaly have to deal with the game sometimes just being a bit of a pain for no reason."

Utterly splendid to look at, lots to do and a good learning curve that makes you proud when you start to notice your hunts transitioning from a messy struggle to a cool and calm takedown of mountainous monstrosities. The grind (that's part and parcel of what seems to be any MH game, not being a veteran myself) is actually completely glanced over because the core hunting element is just so much fun and diverse I imagine getting bored a struggle even downing the same monster for the umpteenth time. Not to mention the plethora of available munitions that each have a unique feel and approach.The main complaints are based on graphical settings and network issues, the latter having been sorted out in an earlier patch (and having some of the worst access in the world in South Africa, I can vouch for this unequivocally). The former I feel are snob and nitpicky complaints, I understand they had the time to foresee this but clearly none of you have ever played other Japanese titles i.e. Nier:Automata and the like that are games without comparison that suffer from similar small flaws but are just quashed by the quality of the game. And even worse, it's Capcom people, what in their track record made you think this would be the first-ever issue-lacking PC port from the cornucopian console company exactly?By all means, go live in that little warded off bubble society of ""perfect games"", impatience and unrealistic standards.

Most people who left these reviews didn't bother to edit them since the update. Other reviews claim the game deletes saves, which have been proven to be an issue with improperly maintained editions of Windows. If you're curious about whether you might be affected, there are a few threads in the discussion forum which can explain it better than me. My advice is to ignore any negative review focusing on these two.There are genuine issues, such as unavoidable frame drops from certain particle effects and poor textures in higher resolutions. Cutscenes will keep you from playing through the story missions simultaneously with friends without dropping hunts and requeueing after seeing the cutscene play. NPC's are incredibly verbose and sometimes take five or more lines of dialogue just to access a barrel right behind them to pick up four mushrooms.The problems that do exist in the game don't keep it from being great, or at least well beyond the score it has. There's enough content to keep you busy well past a 1:1 ratio of dollar to hour, which is my metric for purchases. You can easily go past that if you enjoy the endgame grind hunting tempered monsters. Content is guaranteed to keep coming, as Capcom has already announced that everything already available to consoles will eventually arrive on PC.If you do purchase the game, don't forget to pet Poogie after you come back from hunts."

But honestly, these are things that have either been fixed (the networking issues) or will be fixed in the future (continuing content updates, optimization patches, etc...)Honestly it's a good game. All the PCMR idiots scream about Denuvo, lack of 21:9 launch support (still missing at this point and this affects me, but I don't care because the bars don't bug me) and various other gripes, but IMO its just a vocal minority REEEEEEEEEing about stupid things that don't matter.

ARE U ***KING KIDDING ME?! I was never a 'console' person, and that naturally had me anticipating.I was playing solo exclusively when the game was released on steam (I had no idea the game was having connection issues), the game is stellar across the board, graphics is excellent, the music is pleasing, Coral Highlands look so enchanting, exactly what a Monster Hunter sequel should be. It was until approximately two weeks ago from the time of this review that I wanted to try the multiplayer aspect.I was disappointed by how much the multiplayer aspect failed, of this otherwise perfect game. I only managed to connect to an online session briefly ONCE, even though it was two to three weeks after release. The developers released a patch (on 23rd Aug, I believe) which supposedly should resolve the bulk of the connection issue, yet the problem persisted over at my end. It felt like capcom does not care if the game is broken. It felt like the connection issue was never gonna be resolved. It also felt like maybe the whole world is enjoying multiplayer, except where I am from.LO AND BEHOLD. I was so terribly wrong. From approximately 4 to 5 days ago, I can consistently connect to an online session, post quests with players joining me, join quests, respond to SOS flares, send SOS flares AND receive help from other players.

Now we have it, and it is glorious!For newcomers, this is basically a continous Boss battle after Boss battle, no fluff (well very little to make money on the side) and right into the action. 14 weapon categories that will make you feel like a badass every, single, time and best of all, they are all useful and have a different feel to them. I just love how it feels like you are playing an entirely new game with each weapon.This game also has an ncredible way to reward your victories and makes your toughest battles give you a huge sense of accomplishment.The controls are very tight and responsive, but I have to say it, better play with a controller since the KB+M control scheme is a little strange, which brings me in the negative side of things. There is not much you can do in regards to customizing your KB+M functions since there seems to be several functions linked to the same button (non combat and combat) which makes it very difficult to set up your key map in a way that helps with Ranged combat and melee.I also find the menu and chat menus very unituitive for a PC version/port, it' almost like they carbon copied the inability of a console or handheld device to be able to be used as a communications/computing device. If you expect Enter to bring the chat window, forget it, if you expect ""i"" to bring up yourt inventory, don't even think about it.The combat controls are also very challenging for a KB+M set up, most functions are so spread out throughout the keyboard that making a simple Y+B button combo in a controller becomes a R+N kind of thing, makes no sense. Why not a LMB+RMB? I am sure the next title, will take all these woes into consideration and maybe give us something a bit more KB+M friendly. Anyway, if you can get past the ""need for a controller"", you will have a blast, I promise you. I also think it was a great attempt by the MHW team at Capcom to this for the first time on PC.Happy hunting! >:)"

Online has been mostly fixed.It's also not Monster Hunter anymore, it's super easy, plot sucks ass, town hub is unnecessarily large, multiplayer is worse than in previous games, monsters aren't great, monster roster is really small, the game switched from a anime-esque style which worked perfectly and had excellent visual and audio feedbacks to a realistic and not very readable style, the areas are too large and mostly empty, scoutflies are a trash mechanic, weapons look like garbage, loot rates are criminally high, tempered and arch tempered monsters are just normal monsters but they deal too much damage to be actually fun, the two ""final"" bosses are garbage, the new skill and jewels system is really bad, etc etc...But it's still good. It's still Monster Hunter enough that it's enjoyable. There's patches / event rotations with its and bits of content being released regularly. And playing with friends is kinda cool. But it's not the same as the previous games.And if you've never played a Monster Hunter game before, start with this one, but also make sure you know what you're getting into, else you're going to regret it."

Now ignore the mixed review on the overall reviews. Most of the negative comments will be about the hitbox of Monsters and what not.Pros:-No micro-transaction-all new monster or maps would be available for free-interesting loop (for those grinders out there)-great overall map design, you could even get lost in it when you first play it (ancient forest and coral highlands)-Monsters with interesting and somewhat varing move sets-armour and weapon progression is interesting and worth the investment-you could literally play for hours without the game feeling repeatitive -breath of fresh air-great eco-system with monster turf wars and small monsters attacking big monsters when they are weak-14 different weapons styles each varying in their own unique wayCons:-only apply to a certain niche of people-Monster hitbox is questionable (you get to play around it once you figure the move sets of each monster)-small rosters of monster (including the ones that was released on the console)-UI is extremely fustrating-controls on fit for controllers and not mouse and keyboards-you have to change radial menu items every time you change loadout -poor optimization for the PC port (again temporary, will update if any changes were made)Overall, I would recommend the game, BUT when they fix issues like proper optimization for the port. Its worth your wallet, IF and only IF you don't mind the grinding, and the loop of hunting one monster multiple times to get one material, I'M LOOKING AT YOU VAAL HAZAK FANG+!!!!"

It is just sad to see the whole PC community is treated like trash with this mess of a ""Port"". The connection issues and performance problems are a damn joke and with every Teostra Supernova I am asking myself ""what has CAPCOM done within the 7 months since console release"" I wish I could just drop this game and start over again when the issues are fixed but I just cant... THE GAMEPLAY IS JUST TOO DAMN GOOD!!! So... I'm begging you CAPCOM please safe this game for me and the PC community...

Hopefully they fix all the armor and weapon textures for both the hunter and the palico.The game overall is great though, dont just take my dissapointment rant as final. I've played 300+ hours on PS4 cuz I couldnt be patient to wait for the PC version since January. Solid missions, combat, multiplayer, and overall enjoyment when it all is working properly, it actually is quite the looker too when the textures arent botched up.Please fix these issues Capcom, you made a solid, well loved game. This was your chance to leave a huge positive impression for the PC community and you dropped the ball. Once you fix multiplayer and texture issues. This game will be a 10 out of 10 on PC."

I have an i7-2600k that isn't overclocked, mostly because of my motherboard. I started off my mh journey in mh4 where I clocked in around 700~ hours. Then when mhgen came out I played it for around 300~, and I also played mh3 on the wii u for a little bit. This series really grew on me, and when I found out it was coming to pc, I was ecstatic. So far it is the best monster game that I have ever played, but not perfect. Some things I want changed is a optional tutorial, skipable cut scenes, and for the game to become more gpu friendly. Having to put all the stress on the cpu makes for a lot of problems for me. When I'm playing a game I might pull up a video just to kill time, which is pretty hard to do when my cpu is always close to 100%. None of these problems made my experience (so far) less enjoyable. I hope people can stop negative reviewing this game on the reason of not taking the time to learn the 14 unique weapons and mechanics. I love this series and if your new, take some time to see where this series came from and be grateful that CAPCOM did something as wonderful as this."
3780,Verd,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Verd_/,2,,1,333.9,August,"27,",247,0,1,"The Good:Combat feels very satisfying and weighty, and offers a play style for everyone via the fourteen different weapon classes that can be switched to freely between missions. Attacks can not be animation canceled so you have to be more calculated than in other action games which I feel is a nice change of pace. Overall the core gameplay loop of gathering materials, hunting monsters, and crafting/upgrading items and gear is quite fun. There's always something new to build toward or a new personal goal to meet. There's a lot of character in Monster Hunter World, from the weapon and armor designs that tell the story of what a given hunter has accomplished, to the silly animations when diving or cooking just to name a couple of my favorites. Overall the game is very charming in so many different ways. Hell, I can't stop humming that damn tune that plays at the HQ. Iceborne is mostly more of the same in the best way. The biggest addition for me personally is the expanded glamor system, which adds a whole new reason to play.The Bad:Cutscenes are unskippable even as of Iceborne and doing co-op in story missions is a moderate pain in the ass since each person has to watch the cutscene in their own mission, back out, then make a new mission. The cherry on top is that the story itself is completely throwaway. It's not terrible, but a story that evokes nothing is often times worse than something truly awful in its own way. Performance after Iceborne has dropped for me personally, getting a consistent 60fps at 1080p is somewhat difficult on an i5 6600k 3.9Ghz and a GTX 1070. The handler is still a dumb c**t, but she's bearable in Japanese.Verdict:Monster Hunter World has a few annoyances, but overall it's a blast to play. It will only get better as the free updates roll out. This is my first Monster Hunter game, and I've bought it three times. Once on PS4, once on PC for myself, and again on PC for a friend. I would not hesitate to do it all again."

The low framerate issues I had came from the newest Nvidia drivers so i reverted to 398.36 and the game works fine for me now. So I cant blame the game for that issue. The gameplay is really engaging is is plenty of fun playing with friends or alone.All the weapons are viable to use and every single on of them feels unique in their own way.The maps are amazingly beautiful to look at and to explore. Even just running around in expedition mode gathering resources if a fun experience for me because of this.I hope the monster hunter team will continue to improve the PC port of the game and will have a bright future for Bringing more monster hunter games to PC !Overall I rate the game  a 8/10

It's sooo big, you may actually get put off by it. The game is a 'JRPG' genre game so it's literally all about the grind, so if you loathe grinding. This game likely will not be your cup of tea. But if you do, oh boi, it's a dozzie. If you never touched this franchise before then you will likely fall in love. As a first time player for this franchise, I had no idea what I was getting into, only to realize how ridiculously complex this game is. Unforunately, most of the meat of the game cannot be seen in the first 2 hours. The tutorial (there is only the beginning mission and that takes an hour) alone barely scratches the basics. You should either commit or walk away from this 'MONSTER' of a game. That's my best advice for you if you are undecided.This game has great support for PC, it is receiving all the content the consoles have been getting over the past 6 months at an accelerated rate. So in a few months, we will be caught up to the console releases in content. Which is frankly fantastic. But once again, the grind is.. REAL. It's still pretty grindy, so watch out for that, if that is a turn-off."
3814,Jihl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chionna/,2,,1,258.6,August,"20,",93,0,1,My boyfriend bought me this game because I had never played any of the other games. At first I was kinda skeptical. Until I saw the Palico's . Then Actually getting into the game itself has been a blast. The Disconnects are a bit annoying but I think it has to do with Valve doing a update about the same time as the game being released . So I think the issues lie in that. I have had my steam go on and offline a lot even when I am not in game. I like the combat in the game. I play with a gaming mouse and keyboard. So I have not had any problems with delays. I have not had any graphical problems. I like the game and I plan on buying another copy for my son and his GF. I hope they get the connections sorted out with Valve. Now onto the hunt!

Hopefuly this game will get more positive reviews now instead of people mindlessly review-bombing something that doesnt deserve it. There's a reason this game has sold over 10 million copies and is Capcom's best selling title of all time. It's a damn good game, and a few PC-exclusive flaws are not going to change that for me. It was very close to my favourite game before, but it may be my favourite game of all time now that I can enjoy it at 60FPS.Monster Hunter has a bright future ahead. The risk they took by spending 5 years on this game in the background while carrying on the series portably to pay the bills really paid off, this is MH in the current gen, and it doesnt even matter that it lacks the content of previous ""G/Ultimate"" entries because everything that they made from scratch works together so utterly well that it alone makes the older games hard to return to. Of course, I will still get whatever the next portable entry of the series will be, but I can only hope it has even half of the amazing improvements World added.It may be seen as a downside by core fans to create a game with so many systems that are so intertwined, as it will make creating more content all the more difficult. making every new monster interact with the environment, and with each other, creating new zones with the depth and complexity of the ones we have now, and all of the monsters and endemic life filling them and making them feel alive. Gone are the days of plopping a monster in a bunch of different zones and saying ""this monster lives here, here and here"", but you know, I'm patient. And I'm already enjoying what I've been given immensely. For the money, it was 100% worth it, and I got it twice.Monster Hunter on PC is a bit broken but not enough to make it unapproachable. I can only recommend this game, and I can only commend capcom, and congratulate them on their 10 million copies sold. THeir dedication to making something more than just another port from consoles shines through in their options, even if sometimes broken, so I have faith in a fix for all these issues. If you think I'm being too nice to them, that's fine, if occasional disconnections, a broken setting or two, or feeling like you need to backup your save just in case of problems bothers you then feel free to wait a little while. For anyone who has gamed on PC for as many years as I, this is nothing, so go on, give it a shot."

I absolutely hate it. A game with a main focus of multiplayer with some past iterations requiring multiplayer for High Rank hunts with server issues being this bad for this long is embarrasing. I played this game on xbox since release and the only main issues with multiplayer occured during the first week but it was fixed. It's been longer than that here on this platform. Let me review the game and you should be able to determine why I have a negative review here.Monster Hunter: World content wise is an absolutely incredible game and taking into consideration all the past MH games this is the best MH game ever released. Many elements of the game are streamlined including the tracking, questing, and general hunting which in this case is one of the best things this series could have done to attract the western audience the way it has. The game is very gripping and can pull hours and hours away from you on the endless hunt and grind for better weapons and armor and eventually even more as you progress through the game. However an important element of the MH series is the multiplayer which has been absolutely terrible on PC. With little communication or information on the issues we have a measly 2 announcements from Capcom saying they are ""Working on it"" with valve. It's even beginning to screw with me because I enjoy doing end game content with friends and people online. Its how I've played every Monster Hunter prior. And to not be allowed to do that without major issues is beginning to turn me off from the PC version and making me want to head back to my HR250 character on xbox but I really don't want to do that. I want to play the version of the game that all my friends play on. I mean its a problem when 300000 people are playing and I can't find any body to play with. Terrible. Not to mention how lightning weapons cause massive frame drops. I maintain 100 fps on custom setting at 1440p with a GTX 1080 and i7-6700k. Why does my game drop to 20fps when my buddy is using a lightning focused weapon? This is another issue with the game that needs to be addressed. Also how the game has an issue with an endgame cutscene that has the chance of fully corrupting your save. No recovery available. You have to restart. Thankfully you can access your save game with ease and make backups. There are even scripts on reddit that autosave and backup for you. Please use those before you enter the final boss of the story. I dont want to see fellow hunters turned off by a corrupt save that makes you lose potentially 30+ hours of progress. Stay safe hunters.These are just some of the issues that cause me to give a negative review. Once fixed you can fully expect a 10/10 from me. But even I must be a critic of my favorite game series. Score until fixes: 4/10 Of course I will personally keep playing the game. I love this game. But for a potential buyer maybe wait out for a bit until these are fixed.EditGame is fixed. Mucho fun"

It's also very large and had to cut it to fit, and eventually gave that up and just put in a link.The benefit of playing a port months after the game initially hits consoles is that there are a host of guides available, which I recommend if you want to take this game moderate seriously (bit of an oxymoron there but bear with me). I don’t typically like games that require you to have extra study material to understand but to its credit, all I had to do was watch one video guide about the mechanics of my favored weapon, the Light Bowgun. After which I was probably fifty percent better every hunt after that. So I certainly recommend looking into that.The story begins with your highly customize-able character on a ship to a ‘new world’, previously undiscovered in other games of the franchise. Your ship gets waylaid by a mountainous “Elder Dragon” who came up from sea. His back is full of magma and volcanic spouts and you climb his back in order to escape. Once you’re in safety, you find out he’s one of many that have migrated to this place for mysterious reasons. Typically one every few hundred years, now it’s one every decade and that has caused some turmoil in the ecosystem. Your job is essentially research. Kill monsters, stabilize the ecosystem, and arm yourself while doing so.Eventually there is an extended epilogue. Once you discover that Elder’s goal and what it might mean, you enter a “High rank” hunt mechanic because the ecosystem has changed and you react accordingly. Monsters in these quests are tougher and more aggressive, and you continually work your way up.My immediate first impression of MHW was actually quite positive. There’s something I can do here that I never really could at Dauntless; actually solo monsters. Dauntless was fairly unforgiving, only giving you five (count them: five) potions per hunt. You burn through those without burning the monster down properly, and you were done. Mercifully here, you not only get dozens of varying degrees of usefulness, you can also craft more on the fly or withdraw some from your loot in various camps set up around the impressively large zones. While some monsters give me more trouble than others (most flying types can do a one-two knockout by rushing me, putting me in a twelve hour stun animation, then merely swipe at me for an instant death), I’ve been in awe at what I’ve actually been able to accomplish on my own.…And unfortunately, I am forced to do a handful of things on my own. Let me tap into some of the problems I have before diving back into the meat and mechanics of the game. Steam reviews are mixed for a couple of reasons. Bad controls and connectivity issues. The bad controls are a remnant of the fact that it was originally a PS4 game and the menus really show that. The UI itself is very controller friendly while the M/K is barely given a second thought. I had to rebind my weapon draw to left click like it is with melee because I’d find myself engaged in too many fights, frantically clicking only to find out I was actually just using my slinger and tossing useless rocks at the monster. In addition, the radial menu might as well not exist, as it is bound to your various F1-F4 keys. It’s very clunky and not at all the “quick” menu that it’s supposed to be. Frankly, I’m tired of hearing “just get a controller” from my friends. I don’t think I’ve touched a controller since 2008.There’s no direct party system, just player listings and hubs. You have to find a convoluted “Session ID” in the menus for your friends to copy and eventually join together. Someone posts a quest and everyone joins it. You won’t physically see anyone outside of a hunt unless you visit the gathering hub on top of the main town. The whole Session ID is just a pointless extra step that the likes of Capcom just love throwing in there. I am reminded of Black Desert Online. Despite being a different country, it still has the same idea behind its mechanics. One does not simply just craft or buy potions. First you have to press thirteen buttons just to get a stack of them. Then they might be put in your storage box, not personal pouch so you have to remember to take them out before your hunt. Then there’s the canteen mechanic, where you’re encourages you to eat to gain decent buffs before every hunt. Why not make that a single item you can use midhunt? Like Dauntless, pretty much every important thing in town is far apart and forces you into miniature loading screens. After every hunt you’re plopped on the bottom level but you still have to run up to the Blacksmith to fetch some upgrades. One does not simply make armor, too. In the higher levels you have to micromanage “decorations” to socket into your arms and armor to increase various passive skills. Why not just make those skills up-gradable like the armor itself? Indeed, one does not simply upgrade their armor! You have to collect “spheres” that you get from bounties and hunts in order to do so.Everything just has a pointless extra step, but I admit these are all nitpicks in what I do believe is a pretty damn good game. I have adjusted to the controls (even though it takes twelve clicks to get anywhere in the menu, but the combat is fine) and I can stomach the connectivity problems… for a time. Everything else is just a niggling annoyance that I have to deal with before I get to the real heart of the game: Expeditions and hunts.To its credit there’s a lot to do. Expeditions are the closest thing this game has to an “open world” setting. You will keep everything you acquire, gather materials and hunt the local monsters at your own leisure (though once you attack, they enter a sort of timer where they will flee the area if you fool around too much, but the mode itself will never kick you out). You can pick up quests on-site and continually remain in the zone you’ve chosen. Admittedly I haven’t explored expedition mode to a severe degree, as doing the various optional quests and bounties give me more than enough gameplay on their own. I never really need to piddle around the same zone for that long.I mentioned earlier that I was happy that I can actually solo a handful of monsters in this game as opposed to Dauntless. There’s a lot more to that, the “simplest of MH’s” claim be damned, I embrace convenience if it comes hand in hand with actual fun. You can farm the same monster a few times but I found that the game offers you a handful of armor sets that can be crafted from bones and minerals alone. You can pick up bones from piles around every map and mine at little alcoves and continually gain materials to sets that will be perfectly passable for a time. I wore the basic “bone” armor for a while before getting into the more specialized stuff. Revered is the Anjarath, the game’s T-Rex who has a fire breath attack that will absolutely one-shot you and serves as the game’s first difficulty wall. His armor, however, gives fire resistance so if you can stomach fighting him a couple times (ideally in multiplayer), then you can likely build yourself up to handle him properly. Fun fact; I’ve yet to solo him myself.Other monsters have given players trouble that have instead given me more fun. The Radobaan for example, a sort of mid-game encounter in a zone called the Rotten Vale. It is a place where many monsters go to die and their essence feeds the Coral Highlands above it. The Radobaan covers itself in the bones of dead creatures and is thus highly armored, and you must burn through that in order to do some raw damage. I know of players who find this armor annoying but his movements are highly telegraphed and he’s a fan of stumbling himself which gives me a lot of free shots at him. So far he’s honestly been one of my favorite monsters to fight.See full review:"

I run the game on a setup I would consider older by now and run the game fine at full 60fps. This took some experimenting with the settings and some research. The gameplay is great if you love farming monsters for new mats to make more gear. Some downsides would be all the cutscenes in the first part of the game before high rank.     Once in high rank it becomes less of a hassle getting through cutscenes. From playing on console we can expect some really good dlc to come as well for free. The core of the gameplay is a fun addicting cycle of farming monsters, investigations for decorations, and creating more builds for playstyles you prefer.The developers have done a great job fixing up the game and providing updates. They did slow down for a bit but now they're speeding up the update process again. We were given two new monsters in a month and more are to come. Definitely would recommend buying at this point in time.Notes: I play with an Xbox 360 Controller.

I will keep it as a sign that the company learned quickly from their mistakes and fixed the problems with their multiplayer system quickly. And now, I will gladly recommend this game to my friends for I can now fight alongside them. The game is very well done. What it lacks in monster diversity, it makes up for in amazing gameplay. I love the new features they added to this game such as the scoutflies and little changes to the weapons including my favorite, the Insect Glaive. The fights most of the time can seem rather easy, but there is always that mission or two that will leave me frustrated (in a good way) with how challenging it can be to slay my target.Old Review:I would have easily recommended this game to all my friends except for one issue: The Multiplayer system is absolute garbage. I played MH3U, MH4U, and MHGenerations and NONE OF THEM had as big of a connectivity issue as this game stripped right out of a horror film. I tried multiple times to play with friends and strangers, only to be told things such as ""You must wait for the player to view all cutscenes"", ""Failed to join quest"", or just having me join in the quest and get disconnected out of nowhere. I waited for this game for well over a year and given it took so long for them to release it for PC, they have no excuse for why their multiplayer system is so god awful. Also, the fact that my friends message me complaining about how I always appear to stop playing the game and get back on it (the pop-up notifications for steam) just makes this worse. Fix the system and you will get my recommendation."

3868,Shaoling,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970638897/,2,,1,124.7,August,"16,",867,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is an excellent game that is unfornuntely held back by some technical issues. Performance is lower than it should be, there are texture issues, the mouse input is less than steller, and there are frequent disconnects, but Capcom are working on fixing the mouse controls and the netowork issues, hopefully they'll deal with the performace issues as well. There are some workarounds for some of these issues, but they're bandaid solutions and only partially improve said issues, while we wait for offical fixes.However, despite these issues I would still highly recommed the game. As someone who is new to the series, it's certinaly a breath of fresh air and one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long time. If I had to think of something outside of the technical issues that I wish was done better, it would be the UI. It's overly convoluted and there are far to many menus and confirmation screens, in addition I wish that there were customizable hotkeys for the radial menus, instead of having to press F1-F4, then 1- 8 in order to use an item. Having to open what is essentially a menu panel to access the shortcuts/hotkeys defeats the point of having easily accessable hotkeys.The story is average at best so far, but story is certainly not the reason one plays Monster Hunter World.I played the 1st 20 hours with a gamepad, and have switched over to mouse and keyboard since. While there are issues with mouse input, it's still capable of doing the job, and I prefer it to the gamepad.It's not Arkham Knight level of disaster, but it's certainly not the "" beautifully"" implemented port that IGN is claiming. I fear that the overall ""mixed"" review status will deter many players from playing a game that is well worth playing.TLDR: The issues are not enough to ruin the experience, at least not for me, but if they ever get fixed it would lift this game up to honestly being one of the best games I've played in years. I'll update this with a full review once I've ""finished"" the game."
3869,.Stream,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zerberius/,2,,1,575.5,August,"16,",318,0,1,"Aside from the launch day issues. The game so far has been very enjoyable. But, it is relatively obvious that it's a port. I'm actually disappointed that after this long, they managed to fail to get it right.BUT.I stress this, majority of the problems that most other reviews say are fixable. I don't deny that the servers are having issues, but it's pretty much launch day populations. In time, once the population stables out, the issues will be fixed. In fact, I've already had little to no problems with connections.For the lack of events, I'm sure that these will come in the future. Eitherway, in most cases, These events are relatively difficult, so much so that new players who haven't grinded up the gear won't be able to do them easily. So there's little point complaining about it this early on.The one thing I can't defend, is the fact that this port is complete utter hype. I realize porting a game isn't as easy as it sounds, but the least they could do is make the M+KB controls a bit more intuitive. Simply chatting (Yes, there is in game chatting) is extremely unintuitive for PC users. Not just that, you'll notice on the first time that your mouse doesn't aim exactly like how a mouse would, but acts more like an emulation of it.But, tl;dr. The game is worth the buy. You will spend way more time in it if you actually enjoy hunting big monsters and the feeling of achievement after a hard-ish hunt. Though, if you only bought this because of friends, you may not enjoy the first week or so due to server issues, but I still would recommend it to everyone I know. (Given I'm a Dark Souls player.)"

This game definitely has the scalability for a variety of specs to have the game look like a 3DS, to insane levels of supersampling to cripple the best of hardware. The game is essentially series of boss fights among a variety of different monsters using large weapons and tools for up to 4 players in a quest. After fighting smaller monsters, gather their parts and create equipment from them to fight even bigger beasts to make better gear. It's a great gameplay loop for a game with very in-depth combat.The game's got some network problems of random disconnects however. The main story quests have such an unintuitive way to play in a co-op with a friend as all players need to start their quest alone and only after watching all the cutscenes are people able to join, or re-host for party play. It's almost better to avoid co-op play for the main story, and begin playing with others once that is done.The mouse has some unusual acceleration tied to it and no way to change to a raw input. Controllers are recommended as the game was originally a console release earlier this year.Overall the game is great and the hope is that Capcom will update and improve the port as opposed to other japanese developers that release a PC port and never patch the bugs or problems.Update: Since the PC launch Capcom has released tons of PC performance improvements and options along with HD textures for the enthusiasts out there. With Iceborne still being delayed, but not as long as the original, lets hope that the expansion is still optimized and that our updates catch up faster than it did in vanilla."

The game painstakingly (if not painfully) explains every new mechanic and aspect that is introduced to you as you progress, yet also gives plenty of breathing room for you to explore and experiment with gameplay mechanics on your own.For those who have played the previous MH titles, you'll find this one provides a much easier, streamlined and less grindy experience overall:- Mundane activities (collecting whetstones, paintballs, making tools, etc) have been removed or simplified. - Environments now regenerate resources after a set amount of time.- Instead of paintballs, players now track monsters using a mechanic that allocates points for specific actions against a particular kind of monster (which is still rather tedious). These points accumulate and provide permanent benefits to the player.I already own MHW on the PS4, but I decided to buy it again for the PC. One of the easily noticable differences is that the PC version is not capped at 30 fps. Heck, you can go above 100 if your PC is beefy enough.Another one is loading times. On the PS4, everything took at least 20-30 seconds to get through. That includes loading screens, joining an ongoing quest, finishing a quest.. even just moving in and out of the Gathering Hall took forever. I don't even need to wait 5 seconds on the PC; sometimes it's immediate!The game is also slowly catching up with its console counterparts in DLCs.One thing that's new with this PC port is the introduction of player-made mods. Be it changes that enhance gameplay, or cheating your way through, it's up to you decide whether or not you're willing to take it as it is."

From what I have read, the real meat of the game is after the main storyline, when you start taking on level 5 or level 6 monsters. I'm not there yet. What I have experienced so far I have enjoyed tremendously.Right from the beginning, the story pulls you in and makes you wonder more about these giant creatures that are flocking to the new world. Your mission is to essentially hunt an Elder Dragon, but also find out why the Dragon came to the new world in the first place.There's something about preparation and preparing to take down large monsters that makes this game enjoyable.

I own Monster Hunter: World on PS4 and now on PC and for my computer specs: i7 4790k, GeForce GTX 1080, 16GB of RAM and I'm running game from HDD. I don't have problems with keeping 60fps on Highest and streaming I should be able to run it 120fps but the port isn't well optimized on PC but still looks and plays better than on PS4 Pro.I will start with good things: It's fun and challenging in the late game.Great improvement to the formula of predecessors.Quite good looks (no Crisis on MAX but still looks good).Great for beginners because of improved tutorial and grind time reduction.Pro tips:If you create a session and invite friends or send session key, and I know that most Steam users don't have them but if you do this then you avoid matchmaking.I recommend controller but if you want to use Mouse and keyboard then set higher mouse speed in-game (35 is the magic number)Use voice chats: in-game, discord, team speak and avoid steam voice chat.And now for bad:My first complaint is forced steam groups and networking. What do I mean? Game on Consoles uses friends system (ps4/xbox network friends), in-game guild cards exchange system and hunter teams that you create. These three systems provide ways to play in multiplayer sessions but on PC Friends and hunter teams are replaced with steam Groups/Friends that work as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as you expect in addition to that we have steam overlay with crashes regularly, steam new networking Disconnects so frequently that if you have 10 to 15 friends you can see about 20 pop-ups in minute( I was playing with friend and Steam went so mental that it displayed his pop-up once each minute).The second thing that scrubs me the wrong way is Denuvo Anti-tamper it grinds CPU as hell.The third is matchmaking at the moment is broken and I don't know if it's Steam or Capcom fault but hopefully, they will fix it.In conclusion:I will recommend the game for solo players with an at least decent rig and If you have friends and don't have to use matchmaking then you will have a pleasant online time if not find some monster hunter steam groups join them and then find friends or go for Reddit to list of discord monster hunter groups. PS. DEATH to Denuvo!!!"

A group of friends played it religiously on the Nintendo DS/Wii-U and due to the size of the screen on the DS and the lack of a portable way to play the game at a friends house (usually only 1 TV, and/or Wii-U), and the controls (Wii-U controller sucks) I decided to wait until they released a game for PC. I did play for a time on the PS4 but again, waiting for PC release.Now that the game is on PC I have a new group of friends to play with and we all love the game at its core once everything is working/functioning correctly but there are issues going that need to be resolved to help damper the frustration that is caused due to online multiplayer.Here is a list of PRO's and CON's. This'll be my second time starting MHW but on PC. It's fun and the game gets progressively more interesting and innovative as the story goes on.

The monsters are all categorized and similar based on their type but unique in their own respect with strengths and weaknesses which make them fun and exciting to fight, they all have set patterns depending on damage dealt or other factors (large/tougher monster entering the area) but they're not choreographed so watching for queues and tells is still a major part that all hunters should be aware of.The progression of hunts, and the transition of maps with differing gatherables that are unique to that area as well as some of the monsters that can spawn, the need to go back to hunt previously hunted monsters, discover new monsters spawning in the locale that are fiercer also adds to the challenge that scales with your Hunter Rank (HR) and party size is refreshing to.Overall balance between weapons, armor, skills, etc is also nice with the trend of FOTM happening in the MMO scene this puts the players play style first and foremost and makes any build viable in the long run, while also not forcing players into specific roles but also lets them know (through monster dossier) what they excel out in terms of damage output on a monster. The game also has some other issues with connectivity, I'm unsure if the game uses P2P or has dedicated servers but connections during private sessions with consecutive missions with the same party (potential with randoms too) cause a disconnect after so many missions which results in a new session needing to be made which also brings back to the point of the removal of squads and squad sessions. This issue is currently being investigating but should be noted until it has been patched.The UI isn't cluttered but the menus are annoying to sort through while on PC, console it was ok because there's not much else you can do console wise but there should be a different setup for PC. Most games allow a menu system where each thing is its own icon that can be selected as soon as you go into it (Esc/Start) although not that great for quick-select during missions it is easier when in the main hubs or at a camp. I also think they should change the auto creation to effect your item box as well if the crafting list can only be use items that have been placed in your item box.There needs to be more options for those with disabilities, such as a color blind feature or anything that allows the colors to be tweaked for certain alerts/triggers that help hunters during missions that would otherwise be missed by those who are unable to visibly see those colors, or the colors aren't what others see which makes explanations such as the BBQ Split difficult to convey or when you Brace/Move while mounted on a monster."

However, if this is your first game of the series, I strongly recommend against getting it.  To begin with, the tutorials are bad.  There are huge swaths of the game they don't bother to explain to you, including large parts of how the weapons work, and how the monsters forecast their attacks.  The game greatly benefits from being played with a controller, however the controller integration with Steam is a dumpster fire.  Many, many times I was playing the game, and would pull up a menu only to get dumped into some sort of controller console.  It was a blank screen where nothing would respond to the controller, and their would be a single text box with a blinking cursor.  Additionally, frequently when trying to use menu selections to add another player, the controller would just stop working.  It wouldn't just require restarting the game, but exiting out of Steam altogether, and then starting Steam up again.    Speaking of multiplayer, after several hours of play (well past the refund period), the game starts throwing challenges at you that require multiple players.  Which would be fine, if the multiplayer sessionmaking wasn't total garbage.  Sessions are constantly disconnecting, and as mentioned earlier, a lot of the functionality designed to let you invite friends just contain game-breaking bugs.  It takes a long time to get into a session, and once you finally do, and it disconnects, there is no way to reconnect; you have to leave the quest and start over entirely from the beginning, having to re-create the lobby, and re-invite the members of your party.  And if you're running story missions, you have to run halfway through the mission and get through the cut scenes before you're allowed to invite your friends, which you have to do from a hard-to-navigate dropdown menu in the middle of a monster fight.  It seems like it might be a great game, but I put a ton of time into figuring out the basics to the point where I felt comfortable playing with other people, and then playing with other people was so plagued with errors and other mechanically problems that it's a miserable slog."

There is Random timeouts while in online but are very far and few between, mostly when i disconnected it is a problem on my end. Everything in the game seems very well balanced and has good barriers to prevent high level hunters from jacking up low levels into stupid high teirs. The level of Difficulty of monster, when hunted in the right order is very well done and dosent impose any major skill curves or jumps. (unless you have a natural spawn of a strong monster that you are not ready for and you deside to fight it) All in all i would have to give this game a confident and strong. 9.5/10 If anyone reading this wishes to talk about this game more indept please feel free to add me so we can talk and i can asnwer any questions you might have."

The world is beautiful as the life within it. You research the thick jungles for species you never met, you see them interact within their habitat and learn how they live, and how to track and hunt them. The exploration is good enough for me to be going on expeditions w/out even picking a mission, just to explore the habitats. Monsters are a blast to fight, and the more you upgrade/progress the bigger ones you hunt, which adds an ongoing excitementThe gear system is grindy, so be prepared for a long game that repeats itself, at least in a fun way. You basically hunt specific monsters from which you can extract materials for your gear, and after each mission you usually are able to upgrade your armor pieces and maybe even your weapon, but hunting monsters is your MO, so you don't have to go out of your way for mats for a big part of the game, however approaching end game will have you grinding a LOT.Combat is awesome as expected. You have a satisfying balance between swings and mobility, meaning the game has a fluid and strategic combat flow, not favoring mashing at all. Monsters have their own habits and approach, and you can exploit weaknesses (like breaking their legs) or use various tools (like paralyze shots) to take them down, all of which fun to do. They all have different ways to defend themselves as well, adding complexity in the way you approach and fight each one. The weapons are ridiculous and fun to use due to vastly different playstyles, so much so that it feels like a different game with many of them. The story is beyond me, as with previous MH games tbh. I get the main part, but I ultimately don't care, cause it's kind of poorly represented, and everything else is way better, keeping my mind completely off of it. That and the fact that it randomly disconnects are my only complaints so far, but tbh I been doing all my missions solo, and it's perfectly doable, so not really an issue for me, just a nuance That being said, I can definitely see many ppl not liking the type of combat, or even game it is in general, so be cautious. This is one of those games that you'll either love, or be completely indifferent about. Definitely recommended to ppl that already know the series and like the combat style"

The series has come a long way since then, with numerous incremental improvements and QoL changes to make the hunt feel more engaging and exciting. Unfortunately, sticking with the exact same formula does get stale, and after 12 years of playing these games, I even began to get bored. Monster Hunter World changes the game pretty fundamentally; sure, you're still running around slaying big badass monsters, but the tools the game provides you with are vastly different this time around. If you like the tactical combat of Dark Souls or Bloodborne, a progressive, farm-oriented loot system, and a game that oozes style and individuality at every turn, Monster Hunter World will resonate with you. They have managed to meld the Eastern core of the game with Western sensibilities and crafted an experience that everyone can enjoy in their own way. There are some issues surrounding connections and the multiplayer implementation could have been slightly more refined, but if you can look past some clerical errors (that should be resolved in a week or so - the uptake on this game has been staggering), then you'll be rewarded with a deep game that has hours upon hours of content and some of the greatest cooperative multiplayer action available.

I'm playing on the highest setting on constant 60 fps.Hardware is:-I7 6700k-GTX 1080 HOF with 8Gb GDDR5X-16 GB Ram-Win 10-M2 with 2 Gb/s read and write Constant 60 fps and basically no loading time at all. MHW is a resource eating monster(hehe get it?) though, CPU is at about 40 ~ 60% and GPU at ~80% yea getting pretty hot here.I've seen no lags at all (though I don't run the latest Nvidia driver since most of the time it doesn't work well ..) and also the issues other players get didn't for me (except buggy multiplayer but later more) like the crouching upon opening the chest. I tried playing with a controller works well but I prefer keyboard and mouse its more comfortable (at least melee weapons, ranged are rather badly set up at least the predefined keybindings).Now to the multiplayer disconnect problem. Sessions break apart sometimes but rather rarely you'll have to close and reopen the Session to play with others again. Sometimes you cant join a Quest the quest host will have to leave the quest and reopen it (once you're in you're in only the Session disconnect can mess it up now or you close the game ...).This problem is Indicated by Steam though if you're friends on steam with the people you play together and see the notification ""... is now playing MONSTER HUNTER WORLD"" pop up while your partner sets up the Quest (or is already in it) and you didn't join yet hell have to reopen the Quest or you won't be able to join (This is at least a workaround!!!).Tl;dr: It's a great game and at least I'm loving it! Though it has some multiplayer bugs that are rather nasty, there are workarounds!Good luck on your Hunt fellow Hunters!"
3939,Skrinkus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Salohcin894/,2,,1,201.9,August,"13,",627,0,1,"I built my computer a year ago specifically because this game was annoucned. That being said, this is a rough port. There are definitely some performance issues as many have stated, but I want to talk about gameplay. a Ryzen 5 1600, 8GB of RAM and an SSD. The CPU and RAM both have a mild OC on them. Everything I have played in the past year has run beautifully in 1080p, 60+ FPS. It's something thats become kind of the baseline for PC gamers, and so when a game has trouble hitting those even on high end, some red flags go off.The first thing you should do (read need) if you're playing on a ""mid range"" computer is turn off Volumetric Renderign and SH Diffuse. If you're still not hitting your desired FPS, you'll have to fiddle with the rest of the settings. I've been lucky in that I've been able to maintain 60 FPS on High settings for the most part, but in later areas I've hit 45 - 50 FPS. I say lucky, as I've found that people with very similar builds have been getting wildly different results.Textures are low resolution, and don't seem to scale up even when set to high. This is confirmed by comparing the Xbox One X  version and seeing that even on High, PC textures are way lower resolution than their counterpart. LOD level also seems to have this issue. The bread and butter of Monster Hunter, killing monsters with your hunting bros. It works... sometimes. Besides the clunky route you have to take with others to get into a quest together to progress (more on that later), the servers can decide to kick your friends out halfway through a fight. This means you're stuck soloing a monster that has been scaled to have 2.3x more HP. You also have issues with private sessions and not being able to directly invite people, ""failed to connect"" messages for SOS flares and assigned quests alike, and the need to quit the game entirely to reconnect. I put this here because some veterans of the series will be dissapointed both with the small monster roster and how quickly you can take down some of these monsters, especially in multiplayer. Monsters stagger way more, leaving opportunities to wail on them. Mantles provide get out of jail free cards, negating some nasty effects that could turn a fight in an exciting and nail biting way.All that being said, I'm personally okay with the difficulty as it means my friends who are new to the series won't drop the game immediately because they got steam rolled by a body slam, and I can experiment more with the weapons. First, you and your friend have to start the quest you want to do separately. Then you both have to get through all the cut scenes, even the ones at the end. Then one of you has to quit, come back to camp, hope they don't get kicked or a ""failed to connect"" message and join the other in their quest. It's just clunky and annoying if it doesn't work with the servers being on fire because it means you've wasted time fighting a monster and now both have to quit the game and reset.These asignment quests take the place of Village quests, so where you used to not be able to play them co-op at all, you can now play them with a friend which is a step up. Joining quests midway through is cool as well, whether it be with a friend or a random person via the SOS flare. When was story ever important in Monster Hunter? I do applaud Capcom for risking something new(ish), but please give me a skip button so i can get to the action if I choose or if I've already seen it before. Voice acting is iffy and most of the time the lips don't sync up. A minor gripe and personal gripe, but just go look at some of the older games. The wepons look awesome. These just have different monster parts taped on to them. This was probably because the devs had to do everythign from scratch, as well as trying to fit the aesthetic of the game. I understand, just a bit dissapointed.It's. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Monster Hunter. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it's finally here and it is awesome. The weapons feel and sound amazing to use, the monsters are fun to fight, the turf wars give amazing ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥"" moments and actually instill a sense of cautious admiration for the monster doing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up. No more gathering quests, more QOL changes than I can list, less grind but with the same feeling of accomplishment when you finally get that piece for the gloves for that armor set you've really wanted. Exploring the world feels rich and fullfilling, the world itself is beautiful and scary in the same stroke, and all the ways of traversing it feel fluid and natural. I couldn't have asked for a better foray onto PC, beyond the glaring issues of performance.""So what's the deal, are you reccomending this or not?""For me, personally the Pro's outweigh the Cons. I've been waiting 10+ years for a monster hunter like this. We're still in launch week and Capcom can still redeem themselves if they patch the issues. The accelrated release schedule for the DLC and event monsters actually bodes well, as it means they'll be forced to update the game and hopefully address the issues a lot of people are having. If not, well we can always hope the moding community pulls through, even with Denuvo.A really special game burried under some unfortunate performance issues. If you're a die hard monster hunter fan with a good rig, you'll be able to look past the flaws and cross your fingers that Capcom patches the issues.If you're new to the series, wait on this one. This is the best entry point to date, but wait for either community patches or for Capcom to fix the bugs so that your first Monster Hunter experience isn't marred by them."

The port is horrendous no way should a game this average looking be as taxing as it is.What did they do for 8 months? sit around twiddling there fingers? Was the port done in 2 months and you guys at Capcom just wanted to milk more sales on console?A quote from an article on eurogamer - - Network has been a bit iffy, but it's a new release I'll give them the benefit of that.- Co-op is poorly implemented for the quest story missions, I couldn't join a friend due to him being in a cut-scene but when the cut-scene was over I was just greeted with an error message..- Full-screen 1080p has black bars? What, why? Consoles run it at 1080p why is this a thing..I just hope they can do some patches that improve things in the weeks to come.update - 26/08/2018- Network is better however still not perfect, get multiple errors trying to create an online session and sometimes when playing co-op 1 or 2 persons might be disconnected. - Frame rate during certain bosses, most notable in Teostra fight with all the particle effects can drop fps from a smooth 60fps to 20-30fps. We need an option to lower particle effects, they seem to be a main problem of FPS drops.- Running Borderless Fullscreen removes the black bars, so the game doesn't run fullscreen correctly?- After killing Xeno'Jiiva to complete the story, the credits roll however for me the game didn't allow me to accept the fact the Hunter Rank has been uncapped.. Resulting in me having to re-watch the credits that are un-skippable.. Why?- SOS Search is a bit strange, searching without filters can result in maybe 1 or 2 missions, if you add filters you get a lot more results.- I've noticed some stuttering in Elder Recess after the network patch, that was not present before that."

For me, it pretty much combines all of the elements I like in games: Coop multiplayer, action combat, not too much hand-holding, pets and my favorite: Dress-up dolls. ;)I hear a lot of negativity here on Steam. My current experience is that it runs absolutely fine. The game is interesting, if not overwhelming when it comes to the amount of things you can do. I don't like to put that up as a negative though. I've already sunk in more hours into this game than may others on my Steam list. The menu system seems somewhat convoluted, but that isn't a problem of the port. It looks pretty much the same as it did on the console (from what I have seen of it) except maybe that the PC version has a couple of more dails to turn.I have to agree with most of the youtube reviewers that this is a pretty decent port that doesn't really suffer any faults other than the ones also present in the console versions. Though some detailed effects seem broken on PC such as the dynamic reflections: I don't see anything of the monsters reflected in the water, like on the Xbox. (check youtube if you want to know what I am talking about)If I have to put up any real negatives though, then it's the lack of ultra-wide monitor support. It will run just fine, but with two black bars on the side, as if you are playing on a 16:9 1440p screen. For competitive titles I can see how the extra FoV would give ' gameplay issues', but this is a coop game ... I don't really see why UW didn't get any love. 4k did.All in all, I would still recommend the game."

The game may be suffering from network problems (same as xbox one) and for people picking up the game is a huge issue not being able to take part in multiplayer hunts, but even with the xbox launch the network issues did get corrected in time.As for game performance i run an ancient yet rather high end machine from 2011.3960x at 4.632 gigs of ddr3 1866.Titan X maxwell (think 1070)Evo 850 pro ssd.Even though the core is 7 years old, i was able to run the game at 60ish fps on 1440p with most settings maxed out (volumetric lighting is a hog on resources, so turn it off) and I will agree with others that being a pc title, there is far too little configuration settings for various aspects such as graphics, sound, input, etc. But performance was less of an issue than i expected.As for the game itself, the experience on pc is still more enjoyable to me than on console due to framerate and load times. 2 seconds to load anything is great while also having high framrate with mostly max visual settings make this title more enjoyable compared to the console versions.The gameplay is what you might expect for a monster hunter veteran, But for the new players, monster hunter is a game that focuses on player position and timing to be effective in combat. Weapons are generally slow and ponderous and require commitment to make a hit. Learning the monsters movesets and tells will be the best way to be an effective hunter. Knowing when to attack or evade is just as important as upgrading your gear.The world is wonderfully detailed with amazing scenery and interesting locales to view. Each of the many maps have far reaching themes from jungle to volcanic craters and everything in between. Monster hunter world introduced many ways to interact with the environment which added a new dynamic to the hunt where depending on the location you may be able to take advantage of various map hazards to snare, damage or otherwise affect the target. As for the monster new and old lots of updates were made.The creatures still use the same skeleton rigging from older games but the animations are far more fluid and detailed giving a more life like appearence to the creatures that animate realistically. The monsters also have a life of their own, and they will go about there lives, foraging for food, water, fighting with other large monsters and a mutlitude of interesting interactions with the world itself. All things considered Monster Hunter World is a fantastic experience that is marred by some network issues that will be corrected in time."

Rediculous considering that the this game's textures are very muddy at some points. Also, connectivity seems to be a major problem currently since the servers weren't prepared for the amount of people entering the game at launch causing their servers to fry like eggs.The thing is, these are fixable problems. This game has the solid foundation that it can thrive in. I for one believe improvements to this game would come. The game itself is exceptional, with combat as its bread and butter.

This game does not look or run as good as Witcher 3, but I'm satisfied with the performance and overall quality. Before rolling my drivers back to 398.36 I was getting some stuttering, but I felt the game was still very playable. Best looking Monster Hunter yet. I've logged about 45 hours into Monster Hunter Ultimate 4 on 3ds, and probably about 80 on MHW for ps4. For me, the PC version is the best MH yet, but the PC version doesn't do anything to separate itself from its console counterparts.  If you're new to Monster Hunter I'd recommend this game as a must buy. I've had some issues matchmaking with friends but have been able to eventually get into games together with some perseverance. Once in an online session, very easy to join quests and complete SOSs with the wider audience. I plan to log a lot of hours into this game.

Fortunately for us (or at least me) Capcom have finally decided to give the game a major revision.The game feels more fluid than ever while keeping its ""Monster Hunter essence"", we got new monsters, a wide range of weapons with new movements and mechanics, a beatiful map to hunt in and the promise of future content and events to extend the already vast duration of the game.Of course, the game has its flaws. The multiplayer is not stable enough yet, the game could be better optimised, the game doesn't have many interesting weapon designs as its predecessors, and as a lot of people have already said, the port could be better.Overall, I give this game a solid 8.5, but the game has just been released, and I'm confident the next patches and content we get will rise the mark."

I'd played previous Monster Hunter games a little on the Wii and 3DS, but never kept at it for long because I'd abandoned the platforms. But I always enjoyed those titles. I went in to this with basic familiarity with the gameplay and not much more.It's exactly what I wanted. I'm definitely getting my $60 worth, which is a pricetag I haven't bothered to pay in a long time. It plays well, has good variety, the environments are wonderfully detailed and an absolute joy to run and hunt through. I'm learning about new weapons, new monsters, new environments, new equipment, new etc... They all have their place and seem well balanced.The only issues that are of concern with the gameplay itself are some tutorials. The game provides them at every new prompt, which gets annoying after a while despite their usefulness. But the weapons tutorial, arguably the most important, isn't as obvious and waits for you to come across it by chance. It is not encountered by following the logical course of action. Being somewhat familiar with it, I didn't find much of an issue, but newcomers will. You'll want to utilize the wiki to get the most out of it, regardless. It also has UI decisions that may work for console, but are not okay on PC.Other issues are technical. I was not expecting any sort of stellar port coming from console. I was right. There is a huge amount of variation in performance reported between users at roughly similar settings. Some settings make basically no difference, others make a huge difference. This goes both for FPS and looks, and sometimes they don't correlate. Other reviewers  (DigitalFoundry) have posted good analyses of the settings and comparison to console. Technology wise, it's a bad port.There are problems keeping a reliable connection to their servers. It'll drop partway through, but as long as I'm in a private session it's no problem. It'll only cause issues when I want to invite a friend, where I have to restart the game and create a new session. Friends who are also playing will constantly reappear every few minutes with a Steam notification telling me their playing, too. There are certainly server/connection issues, but I imagine they will get resolved. Capcom might not have been anticipating the instantaneous heavy traffic.But bottom line, it's fun. If you're looking for great gameplay and can forgive (at least a little) the poor performance, it's a good title."
3978,Justin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiKage08/,3,,1,362.0,August,"12,",191,0,1,"This game is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. I have played every release since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Wii U. This game has a few really good quality of life changes to it and a few new mechanics that enhances the gameplay. First of all, the sharpess meter on melee weapons show the amount of sharpness is left per level, which is a significant improvement. Now, you don't have to predict when your weapon might drop in sharpness - you can just see dwindle down. Next, the open world allows for much smoother gameplay. Before, you would have to suffer loading screens between sections of maps - even if they were small - but now you can just run wherever you want, whenever you want. This makes tracking and following monsters much easier.On the subject of tracking, I thought the new footprint and scoutfly system would be a ""watering down"" of the formula that has been so successful, for the sake of new players. However, it's very intuitive and convenient. If you wish to avoid using this, you just don't have to investigate footprints. A lot of the quality of life changes makes inventory management as well as other things much more simple and convenient. The whole experience is fun and action packed. Aside from a few technical issues the game has, it's one of the best games to come out this year.On the subject of performance, I haven't had many issues. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised, hearing how bad it was for others, when I loaded it up on my four year-old PC to have it run nearly flawlessly at max settings. Occassionally, I will get a frame rate dip down to the 50s, but most scenarios keep me in the ballpark of 58 to 61. My specs are as follows: GPU: EVGA GTX 980ti ClassifiedCPU: Intel Core i5-4670K at 3.4GHzRAM: 12 Gigabytes DDR3Hard Drive: Standard Hard DriveOperating System: Windows 10This game is: ★★★★★"

The UI is a bit clunky if you aren't used to Japanese games, and the online functionality is... well, to put it generously, it was designed for consoles and could honestly have been implemented way, way, way better for PC. Co-op is extremely fun (it's really what the game is meant for), but there's one glaringly stupid issue with it: story missions can only be done co-op once everyone in the party has seen the cutscenes on their own, solo. This makes absolutely no sense.The audio and visual design of the game is gorgeous, and the New World is a very interesting fantasty setting to explore. Astera is a neat town filled with neat people, and OH GOD the cooking animations are the best.Not a perfect game, but I'm loving it so far!"
3987,"Lucas, you're muted",https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036225956/,2,,1,50.3,August,"12,",118,0,1,"So the main complaint seems to be about the port. Keep in mind that the game itself got a 90 on metacritic. I'm close to 15 hours in and it is clear why. The combat feels great, the open world is beautiful, and there are not enough games like this on PC. TIPS: Turn off volumenteric fog, use a controller (I know this will turn people off from the game but form what I understand the kb/m controls are feeling clunky and on a controller this game does not feel this way). The co-op is to help people progress to where you are and to do expeditions (which are really important for gear and the ""grindy"" aspect of the game). Also, after you complete the story chapters the game will not kick you out during the story cutscenes. This is not a port thing it is how it was on console and how the creators intended it to be. They want you to have the story cutscenes when you're by yourself. Overall it is a unique, fun game but the PC port isn't ideal if you were hoping to use PC controls. I still play ds3 with a controller and either way this seems like a controller worthy game (for me). If that is not a problem, I highly recommend it. Also, this is currently the fastest selling game on steam of 2018. There is no chance that it will not get more work and be further optimized. I'm just glad I get the chance to play it even though I'm a PC gamer."

I would say wait 6 months for CAPCOM to fix the plethora of connection issues, garbage controls, and poor optimization, BUT they've already had 6 months to ""get it right"". Their idea of ""getting it right"" is taking raw mouse input, translating the raw input into input for a joystick emulator, and using the joystick emulated output to control the camera. The same multiplayer connection errors that have been present since PS/XB launch are STILL IN GAME. When navigating any menu's, you have to press Tab for some, Spacebar for others, Right click, Left click, stand on one foot and hop. There's no rhyme or reason to any of this.I can't play for more than and hour at a time without suffering from ERROR CODE: 83-MW1 and getting dropped to Offline Mode in the middle of a hunt. I can barely control my character because of the moronic implementation of ""joystick"" emulation. If I wanted to use a controller, which is pretty much a necessity with this garbage heap, I would have bought it on console.Simply put, CAPCOM wanted to dig their hands into PC gamers wallets without putting a whit of effort in. Unless there is some serious overhaul work on this game DO NOT BUY IT, it's a frustrating mess and a waste of $60."

Monster Hunter World caught me off guard as someone returning to the franchise, it's stunning visuals, audio design (Ambience and creature sounds/roars) and the shift in gameplay and machanics; I play world the exact same way I've played previous monster hunters and this way of playing the game works, but I now notice that thedre are alot more ways to play and more windows to try different things like with the environment and the large variety of weapons available out the gate at the start.

I am not a fan of handhelds and the Wii game was disappointing to me. Finally, after so long, I have the Monster Hunter game I wanted. This game is fantastic and I hope they add more creatures from the originals overtime (Fatalis, maybe? Tigrex?), but the ones here are visually impressive and the animations are really good. I am enjoying it so far.If you are a veteran to the series like myself, you may notice a few changes here and there, at first it makes it look a bit easier than the originals, but the game kept all of its wonderful challenge and progression ideas while making some quality of life adjustments. I was concerned with the lock on mechanic (I thought it could make the game too easy), turns out it is not that bad and contributes to a tighter and controlled fight, while still requiring you to make precise inputs of evade, defend or attack. I highly recommend it for you. I you like easier games (open world sandboxes, especially the recent ones), that don´t require quick decision making every second, while also not very challenging, I do not recomend this game for you. Hunts are demanding and need to be so it can provide the epicness when you fell a creature you been fighting / hunting for nearly 50 min.My opinion, this Monster Hunter is brilliant and for years I did not get this excited for a game.

There is so much in this game that meets your expectations when it comes to the story, mechanics and variety!About a year ago I was playing a lot of Monster Hunter Freedom Unite but on the iPad, this did mean that I had to play with the on-screen controls which I adapted to quickly. I had a break between then and now and when the news dropped about this game coming to PC I was ecstatic! Finally a port I could play on PC since I don't own a PSP to play the older games, or a 4DS to play the more recent ones.I have a slightly slower internet so I had to leave the download overnight from the day this game was finally released, this gave me an oppurtunity to check the early reviews that got out there for people who jumped aboard the band-wagon a lot sooner. I was suprised to see a lot of people complain about how the game seems to favor locked settings such as motion blur and controller support (Enable Xbox360/Playstation support in the Controller settings). By no means am I saying that motion blur is a good thing, it can get nauseating after a bit especially if it runs at a slower framerate. Ultrawide 21:9 was also an issue with many people as the resolution cannot to be set to meet the aspect ratio and I can understand why lots of people were dissapointed with this release, Denuvo Anti-Tamper had a play in this for many people as well. I feel terrible for the people who waited months for this amazing game only for their worlds to shatter with disbelief at how it did not meet their expectations, whether it be lacking better hardware or the features of the game itself. Hopefully you guys will be able to play this game once major fixes are put into action!I think I've rambled on enough, I'm just here to provide my honest opinion based on my experience playing this game with my hardware. My PC has a GTX 1060 3GB, 8GB of RAM and with a i3-7100 which may come as a suprise to some as that is most definetly a Dual-Core processor, meaning it struggles more to manage larger levels that are loaded much like the ones in this game. Playing this game is completely fine for me as long as it doesn't dip below 40-45 FPS as this is where I see the FPS that can make the experience the best it can be, going off what I knew from MHFU I loved the way this game played! The nostalgic feel of the aesthetic and the same core mechanics made this a definite step-up to the older games. So to conclude, this game is everything I wished it would be despite the hiccups that will hopefully be resolved (Best wishes to the development team at Capcom who will work this game to benefit everyone!). To everyone waiting for the fixes, hopefully you guys will all be able to play this masterpiece in it's fullest glory! And to everyone who has the game currently installed and are playing it just fine, I hope you find this message through all of this overflowed text and give support and encouragement to everyone else as I wish to give!"

Good- Combat is pretty decent and feels incredibly satisfying and rewarding when defeating monsters.- Progression (as ive seen so far) is pretty well done not too challenging but not too easy- Customization is excellent as far as weapons, clothing, character and equipment- Cats- Story as far as I've gone into is really interesting and well made.- No crashes as far as ive played which is pretty good for a first day first PC release company.- Great experience for both a previous Monster Hunter player as well as people who may be newer to the series or never played at all       Bad-M U L T I P L A Y E R. as expressed above multiplayer hardly ever works. The system is overlycomplex, kicks people who have not seen the same cutscene and forced rejoin, and constant connection disconnects every few minutes. I cannot give it a thumbs up until at least this is fixed. The only time it has worked for me and from what I have seen from other reviews is when you and your group are in the central hub, but expeditions and quests (main part of the game where you actually do things) hardly ever work.-Current PC optimization. Made for console instead of PC, no options for motion blur and screen tearing. (assume that these will be resolved in the near future). Fairly difficult for lower spec computers to run smoothly even at the lowest graphics settings sadly-Controls. Subjective for person to person but i feel that a majority will feel the same way. CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED - Mouse movements feel like a joystick and do not work smoothly. Multiple buttons for the same effect, cant use a radial menu while moving, awkward keybindings (however these can be mapped so ultimately its up to you, just the initial feel is awkward)- Lock on System. I assume this will be fixed shortly as well. The lock on system works well when fighting a single monster. Keeps you on target. However when fighting multiple enemies the target constantly changes with small movements. Deadzone needs to be fixed.Overall---It is a great game that people will definitely play and enjoy once it is optimized and better ported. I think as their first PC release it is actually pretty good despite my own and several other reviews. but until AT LEAST the multplayer issue is fixed I cannot reccomend this game. If you're looking for a good solo experience however I would reccomend this game to you. I'll change my review once the multiplayer issue is fixed--------------edit------------♥♥♥♥♥ been changed. games great now"

My controller worked fine from the off, but easy fixes are found in the forums/other reviews if people are experiencing problems. As for the motion blur I barely notice it - and I usually HATE motion blur in games. I also saw someone write a negative review purely for the fact that there is no lock-on feature. Welcome to Monster Hunter, I hope you enjoy your stay. (I am aware that a few of the previous releases had a camera lock on feature, but that simply pointed the camera towards the monster, not lock on to it.)I find the combat in this game fun, the running/climbing/dodging smooth, and have had no problems running it or connecting to friends, despite what others have said. Played a solid 2 hours online with no connection issues. Also, you NEED a beefy PC to run this game smoothly at 60fps. It is a taxing game, my rig was spinning the fans up to keep it cool (i7-7700, GTX 1080, 32GB RAM)All-in-all, fun game, haven't experience any issues as of yet. Would recommend, but people remember this is a polished up console port, Monster Hunter has lived on consoles (besides Frontier and Online) so keep in mind that a controller may give you a better experience than mouse and keyboard overall."

Crack offers a short but intense high to smokers. The Manual of Adolescent Substance Abuse Treatment calls it the most ""addictive"" (effective) form of cocaine.[1] Crack cocaine is commonly used as a recreational drug. Crack first saw widespread use in primarily impoverished inner city neighborhoods in New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington DC, Los Angeles, and Miami in late 1984 and 1985; its rapid increase in use and availability is sometimes termed as the ""crack epidemic"". Physical and chemical propertiesIn purer forms, crack rocks appear as off-white nuggets with jagged edges,[3] with a slightly higher density than candle wax. Purer forms of crack resemble a hard brittle plastic, in crystalline form[3] (snaps when broken). A crack rock acts as a local anesthetic (see: cocaine), numbing the tongue or mouth only where directly placed. Purer forms of crack will sink in water or melt at the edges when near a flame (crack vaporizes at 90 °C, 194 °F).[1] Crack cocaine as sold on the streets may be adulterated or ""cut"" with other substances mimicking the appearance of crack cocaine to increase bulk. Use of toxic adulterants such as levamisole[4] has been documented.[5]"

They trivialize the game a bit. Having a second stick for a camera instead of using the D-pad in mh3u was a blessing that was necessary but I feel they should have stopped there in terms of accessibility.But, at the same time, those changes make MHW the best entry point ever for new hunters. So if this results in attracting and keeping more players, good. Like most things in life, MH is amazing with friends.

Note that I am also running this game on the highest settings at 1080p, with VOLUMETRIC FOG turned off. I owned this on my PS4 Pro before, and it is better on PC in every way."

It still has a couple of performance issues, mind, but those will be worked out with time and, in my opinion, network issues are more disruptive than performance issues.Anyway, onto the actual gameplay:Do you like learning a monster's strengths and weaknesses and bringing the right tools to whittle down their defenses then kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of them with ridiculous weapons, then use bits of their corpse to make even more ridiculous weapons?If so, this ♥♥♥♥'s for you.

4076,MajinSephiroth,https://steamcommunity.com/id/majinsephiroth/,5,,1,523.7,August,"19,",481,0,1,"Let me start by saying I have been a fan of the series since the original titles, I've acquired and played every single version up until the 3DS. I've been wanting a PC port for the longest time and have gone to various titles in order to scratch the MH itch. In my humble opinion, this game has done an amazing job at creating the most remarkable experience for new and old players alike. New players to the series will never have to struggle with: - visiting their farm between every quest- having to be in the online guildhall in order to post quests for people to join - needing combo books to raise the crafting success chances- having to wait through gathering animations on different gathering points during missions- having to memorize where every gathering point is- carrying a map until you learn what area leads into another- loading screens between areasThe list goes on and on with everything this version has improved on over the past experiences. Graphically, the game is stunning, every map and environment feels like it is alive. The ecosystem interactions are great to see, frankly fun as well regardless how many times I watch a scripted event for territory struggles. While the game currently falls short on the networking bug that's been plaguing the community, I do not see it as the horrible experience people are talking about. Yes, it is annoying at times, but I'm still able to play with my friends regardless.Would I still be purchasing the game, knowing what I do now in regards to the bugs? Absolutely. The game itself is still the best in the series by a long shot. ***UPDATE*** Since my initial review, the game has undergone a ludicrous amount of bugfixes. I have yet to encounter any problems whatsoever with the game at this point. All aboard the hunting train!If you're new to the series and do not like a challenge, I will not recommend it to you. This game requires you to learn from your mistakes and not repeat them."

Once you get through the tutorials, the game really opens up in the cat customization options, and you can start making outfits for your cat to wear.

This game is one of the sloppiest PC ports I've seen in years. Performance wise, the only reason I'm playing it at fairly high framerates is because I have a beast of a PC built for VR. Other major new AAA titles I can run at ULTRA settings at buttery smooth framerates, but monster hunter world is just getting by.The primary problem with this game is that its' online component (which is required to enjoy the game and progress) is completely broken. You will basically be unable to stop the game from throwing Error codes in your face every few minutes as you try to play the game but lose progress and time constantly. Capcom has a history of bad PC ports with awful online network functionality, and the trend continues here. This may have been a great game on console, but Capcom lacks the capability to put out a decent PC product and appear not to have changed.Worst PC launch of 2018 for me. It's too bad the game's tutorial is so long that by the time most players discover how broken the game is, they will be long past the steam 2 hour refund period. Buyer beware."

Playing with your friends is borderline impossible, with the constant disconnects, game crashing and bugs this is a flop.I have over 800+ hours clocked in on the ps4 version and most of the multiplayer issues were resolved in a matter of a few days. What makes this so ungodly infuriating is that when you go into a hunt with your friends the difficulty is amped up to give a challenge. However, if a player disconnects towards the end or in the middle of the fight the difficulty remains ramped up and all the items and traps you've used to fight w/e it is you're fighting will go to waste if you quit out.So for now I will continue to play through single player, but if you're after the multiplayer aspect stay far far away from this for now.

Variety has been creeping back to the series over time, both with newer monsters alongside familiar faces. With the announcement of the final content patch however, it looks like we'll have to wait for the next MHW to see more.The game brought a number of quality of life updates, and the change to large seamless hunting grounds is a nice change. The seamless nature of the maps comes along with vastly larger areas to fight in - with some parts of a map spanning multiple levels. This in turn plays into the nature of combat changes in the game - much more mobile, and with a variety of ways to leverage verticality from pluging attacks, mounting, using the claw etc. Even simple slopes offer a change in fighting moves, offering context sensitive moves for every weapon.My one criticism of the game however, is the relatively short support life of Capcom's second foray into monster hunter on PC. Granted the game is multi-platform, and available on consoles; given the timing, I'm given to speculate whether this is due in part to the beginning of a new console life cycle. Comparatively, Monster Hunter Online, a Chinese exclusive MMO by Tencent in cooperation with Capcom, has had ongoing support and continuous content releases for about 7 years now. Why it is we can't see remotely the level of content support globally is unclear - but I would have a hard time seeing eye to eye with anyone who's had the privilege to exclusively access a Monster Hunter game for so long, and then decided to complain about Monster Hunter World this late into it's release.MHW is well worth the play through, and starting sooner than later will ensure you have an easier time experiencing co-operative play, essential for getting the most out of the Monster Hunter experience."

4117,Squire Zed,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SquireZed/,3,,1,14.0,August,"13,","4,622",0,1,"It's difficult to recommend or not recommend this game because there are both problems and benefits that need to be balanced. Ultimately, I recommend Monster Hunter: World, not because it's perfect, but because for the price I've bought a lot worse. Let me put this bluntly: For most people this game is probably not more than a 6/10, especially with the launch issues. Add in some esoteric or plain missing instructions (nothing new for the series- in fact, this is the most welcoming Monster Hunter I've played, so by far it improves over the PSP era Monster Hunter games in terms of explaining what's going on). However, for the right kind of person, this is definitely a golden opportunity.Pros:Beautiful world with massive exploration areas, giant monsters to hunt, and tons of gear to craft.Rewarding sense of progression and tons of things to do to get better gear, new tools, and most importantly fight bigger and scarrier monsters.Gameplay that rewards skillful combat, attentive gathering, and careful memorization of locations and monster habits.Most welcoming and helpful Monster Hunter- a lot of mindless tasks and mundane busywork has been taken out, though don't worry, there's still mountains of grind to keep you busy.Cons:Did I mention mountains of grind? This game will eat up spare time and spit out gear that you'll throw away in an hour or two anyway.As of this review, the network stability is lacking. Capcom really screwed the pooch on this one. After poor network performance at launch on PS4, you'd think that they would prepare better, but they did not. Granted, sales were much beyond what they probably expected, but there's this thing called pre-orders that let you estimate how many people bought the game. It's poor design, compounded by the lack of offline play options from the menu (though you can play fine, by yourself, if you get disconnected from the internet). Since multiplayer is a huge draw, not having it work at launch is going to mean refunds and disappointment. Shame, Capcom.Performance woes. I personally have no performance issues if I'm running only Monster Hunter: World, Discord, Steam, and a few other unobtrusive background programs (though I see it chug if I have internet browsers or other resource hogs open). The optimization isn't awful, but it uses dynamic resolution scaling which means sometimes the picture looks a bit blurry. You won't probably notice this in combat, but while trying to get a scenic view, you can definitely notice the softness of upscaled resolution. While I want to believe Capcom when they say that they tried their best to optimize the game, I would like to see some basic improvements like removing Denuvo (which tanks CPU performance, which this game is poor at). We know from FOX Engine that you can have your quality cake and your framerate cake at the same time, and while not everything can be buttery magic smoothness, why saddle an engine that apparently just cannot be optimized with DRM that particularly limits the one area it performs worse? It's questionable design. Even if you want DRM, I'm sure there are alternatives that don't screw paying customers too- particularly because the multiplayer is a key component and one that only works through the (non-functional) official servers. It's disappointing because this port could use every leg up in performance, and instead it gets shot in the foot. Even though I have no major performance issues, my computer works incredibly hard- harder than it should, when even the unpolished flop of Metal Gear Survive which was pushed out Konami's door like an unwanted infant runs like a charm maxed out (on the admittedly absurdly great FOX Engine). It's 2018- optimization is a thing.They use the word ""Slayed"" (which is not a word) when you kill a monster- it should be slain. The monster has been slain. Slayed is a terrible word and even though it might be technically grammatically correct if you hate your soul, it just hurts me to try to say or think about or process that word. Ugh.So, after all of that, I'm still recommending the game. Why? Because I legitimately enjoy it. I had a huge grin on my face when I leapt on a Kulu-ya-ku with a bow while my Palico cheered me on, killing it with an arrow thrust through its heart. I had an experience of true terror when I ran around a corner face to face with a Rathalos (which I then foolishly tried and failed to kill). I've hunted Rathians in clearings that get torn to pieces and sunlight filters through once obstructed cannopies as monsters thrash and charge and fight. Every time I boot up, I hear that catchy tune in the home town and I know that I'm going to go kill a monster. It's fun. It lives up to expectations. It runs better than expected (with the caveats above). So yeah, I'm going to recommend the game. If you've played a Monster Hunter game and liked it, this is for you. If you haven't, but want to try it, go ahead. But if you didn't like earlier Monster Hunters, or you have a weak rig, or you want to have a buttery smooth 4k experience, maybe go somewhere else."

People around me know I'm not a fan of over-exaggerated asian styled games, but Monster Hunter World brings something completely new (or old, in this case) to the gaming industry: a fantastic, vibrant, dynamic world where enemies are not just bosses to kill. Each monster is unique and requires specific tactics to be brought down. Fighting a Jagras will never be as hard as chasing a Pukei-Pukei in a lush environment where you are not the strongest, nor the biggest. And right when you think you have the upper hand, a Rathian might come out of nowhere and turn you into a hunter roast, just because you have equipped armor that gives you a -2 resistance to fire.Hunting alone might be fun, but joining a group of people and take down one of the meanest creatures is something to remember. And nothing is as fun as using monster parts to craft weapons and armor made with the same monster parts and hunt monsters that will give you even more parts.There is something truly outstanding in a game like this. Don't really know what it is, but I will support this project a lot.So, come on friends, take your seven meters long sword and join the Fifth!Also, there are weird-ass cats around you all the time."

Can spend hours trying to keep a single match (especially longer ones like zorah magdaros and multiple monster quests) to complete depending on who's connecting and when.

It really ruined the end game for me and my friends.Iceborne Update: Game still great, netcode still garbage, in fact even more than before. Capcom servers having issues? Disconnected. Someone with internet problems joins? Enjoy having 1 less spot in your party. I have two friends who can *never* play with each other. We can play with either of them separately for hours on end, zero issues, but the moment one of them joins the other it's like a nuke goes off. Doesn't matter who hosts the session, cause the moment these two beings connect the session completely dies, everyone disconnects, and you're stuck in offline mode till you restart the game. This has been a systematic issue for weeks, and we've tried every single recommendation online, from port forwarding to UDP to steam no friends ui to them hosting sessions, us hosting sessions, complete randoms hosting sessions, and literally dozens of other fixes or workarounds. I can't stress just how bad this game's internet issues are; this is legitimately the worst multiplayer gaming experience I have ever had the displeasure of playing in my entire life."

4139,Hanabi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hanashibi/,4,,1,265.1,July,"6,",766,0,1,"There is a lot that can be said about Monster Hunter: World, but I'll cover some basics first.One: This game is not an RPG, there is no choices or story changing moments with split paths, nor is it an open world romp like Farcry. You select missions and go into large zones that are populated by several monsters. At first this threw me off as I was expecting seamless transitions and a lot different than what I got. However for this difference it is not a bad game. it is very distinct, fun and memorable.Two: The Combat in this game is absolutely amazing the moves, the larger than life weapons, the feel of weight and impact. Every monster a lock, and your weapon, gear and playstyle the key. It moves both fast and with method, it pays for observational thinking.Three: The Artwork in the game is top notch, the zones are distinct and memorable, the creatures are fun and easy to enjoy visually. Never once do you feel like you're 'picking on the weak' this game does a good job of making you feel powerful without diminishing your enemies.Four: The DLC/Expansion aspect is really well done, there are some cosmetic extras you can buy, but everything meaningful has been thrown in the game, and the upcoming expansion pack promises more monsters, more weapons, more everything you'd want from the game rather than nickle and dime DLC.Five: Events, the REAL endgame of Monster Hunter world is here, the events can be as simple as refacing an old enemy, to having fun battles against 3 giant red dogs to a Devil May Cry theme trying to earn Dante's Coat, to ACTUALLY playing as Garalt of Rivia being thrown into the game vie a portal incident (This one made me want a full length RPG of Garalt exploring Monster Hunter's world.)Six: Difficulty. The game is hard, but its difficulty isn't savage depending on how you play, certain weapons have a better margin for error, but less bursts. Some monsters are absolutely savage to the extreme, others, not so much. It isn't one hit and you die in most cases unless you're enemy is hitting your weak element or you're facing some kind of super boss move. Most deaths come from a multitude of slip ups on your part, letting that monster jab you enough times to stun you right before its Haymaker, or hanging out with low health too long trying to whittle the monster. It is an easy game to pick up, easy to learn. But a LOT of your power is how you become skilled with your weapons while a smaller portion is your gear level. Things like elements, weaknesses, rather you cut, blast or pierce, all help define what monsters will be harder or conversely easier. If a complex system of measured combat is difficult to you, than this will be Dark Souls, but if you easily grasp concepts and are wary and keen, it won't be hell at all.So this is recommended. Does it have flaws? Yes. I wish it had more RPG elements, or that the protagonist wasn't just silent. Or at least I wish the game would recognize your being mute and poke humor at it. Or that everything was fully voiced. Or the UI system was more smooth and less of a pain in the ass. But NOTHING in its flaws outweighs what it does in its favor.If you know you won't like it, don't buy it. If you have doubts, and are interested, buy it. If you love these sort of games, buy it. If you love fantasy, buy it. If you're a boring person and are sad, buy it, it'll make you more interesting.BUY IT! BUY IT NOW! BUY IT ON DEAL! BUY IT FOR YOUR FRIENDS! IT GOES MULTIPLAYER UP TO FOUR PEOPLE WHICH IS PART OF THE FUN!"
4140,Ghostrunner,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006973800/,9,,1,504.3,August,"29,",263,0,1,"So here is a real honest review, after 207 hours of gameplay. First id like to say for those who dont want to read an essay, this game got an undeserved bad rep. I mean sure the game has issues but they arent ones that justify it being given a 45% total score. So let me just address the issues really quick, or at least the ones I know of that have impacted me. In the first week of release the multiplayer of this game was horrific, I mean seriously. You would queue up a quest with your friends, get about 5 minutes in and then be disconnected. The way the game works it also meant that even if your friends did disconnect, although the match wouldnt end and you would all be against the monster in your own solo missions, the monster would retain its multiplayer difficulty level and still does to this day. This means that when the multiplayer crashes, for the most part the mission is unplayable. Other issues I encountered was just how much CPU this game eats up. Like seriously, what is it doing? Its running at 97% CPU and sometimes during the handler cooking cutscene it makes my pc grind down to the point where it seems like its dying. These however are my only issues with the game, and the multiplayer has dramatically improved, however still not amazing its at least playable 90% of the time and im sure with consistent fixes it will become 100%. The CPU issue, im no computer scientist but im sure they can patch the game or do something to optimise it so it doesnt eat such an ungodly amount of CPU. Now to the positives, and they really are positive. This game is beyond refreshing to me, this game has and will continue to provide me with hours of amazing entertainment. The satisfaction levels on this game are the highest ive ever felt playing a game, whether its beating a boss by the skin of your teeth in the early game, to grinding and farming rare item drops to try and take on the tougher end game tempered bosses, the progression of this game is superb, you overcome mountains each day and consistently improve. The weapon choice is amazing, you can play the hard hitting mass damage greatsword with a slow and devastating play style, or you can go rapid damage dual blades, even using my personal favourite the insect glaive where you can do all sorts of acrobatics around the monster applying debuffs or explosive clouds. The combat truely is wonderful, there are so many different weapons and thanks to the jewels and skills there are so many ways to play these weapons which means you can play a bit of everything and mix things up so you never feel bored. In terms of monsters, yes i would like a greater variation many monsters are very similar and there are far too many damn flying monsters for my liking and yes I would love some more balancing as although there are so many armour sets, in the end game stage really only a handfull are actually viable, id love for them to be a bit more balanced and be able to run these obscure pieces without getting smashed because theyre so low defense. I think they really need to release the DLC asap to bring it to the same level as the console version as Im incredibly jealous of the console gamers having behemoth and kulve but the game hasnt been out long so i can only hope it does come out and soon enough. I think the reason this game got so badly recieved is because people just took it at face value, we had to wait 8 months for what is essentially a vanilla port that on release had a host of issues so people just took straight to steam to leave bad reviews, if people actually took a step back and played the game as it improved and gave it a chance then they would see that actually this game is incredible and without a doubt my favourite release in the last 5 years at least."

4145,DT_RicoRaynn,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006534473/,2,,1,368.4,September,"21,",274,0,1,"Ok, this is my first legit attempt to play a Monster Hunter game. I tried a gaem cube version way back when if I remeber right and it didn't hook me. So I'll try to break down what I experienced.ProsThe Early Game: It immediately throws you into the action. The tutorial is very well done, not bogging you down with boredom as it explains the games systems.The Graphics: Not much more to say then they are gorgeous. You can tell real care went into the enviroments. The level of detail is astounding and everything you look at is beautiful. The Weapons: A large variety of weaponary at your fingers allows for every hunter to play a bit different. Moving from a bowgun to a longsword instantly makes it a new game style.The Monsters: From the first moment you engage an Anju right outside your starting HUB you're trasfixed at how epic and powerful this battle feels. Each monster is unique and a enjoyable experience to battle. You honestly feel like a bad ass.Palicos: I'm a 16 year army infantry veteran with over 50 months deployed to combat zones. This little bastards made me smile and laugh more times then I can count. They're cute lite ♥♥♥♥♥.Gathering mechanics: alot of care went into trying to hide the 'grind' when it came to gathering mechanics. You can see that. While the grind is still there, the used clever methods to try and make it less noticable from sending out palico expeditions, to gathering on the run, to buying boat loads of crap when the ships come into harbor. ConsThe Controls: this may be the weirdest set of PC controls Ive ever encountered in a video game. Seriously, these things are so weird you have to wonder if the designer was high on bath salts and watching anime when he developed them. They aren't impossible to learn and by hour 3 it will be 2nd nature. Just be preparred to struggle if you take a break or play multiple games at a time. The Zones: while the zones are beautiful there are only 5 of them. Since you will be hunting in these until ad nauseum you will get bored with them.Melee Combat: Melee combat is definetly not for me. I've seen some amazing fighters in melee, but the half ass targetting system and the weird camera angles made melee combat feel clunky and slow imo. Random Monsters: It very common due to the pathing of monsters and the 'tunneling' of most areas that some random monster you have zero interest in will wander into your fight and try to screw everything up. Because of the AI its almost constant on each map and doesn't feel 'natural'. Just bring dookie balls and chase them away.The Armor: ok, some of the sets are incredible fantasy dreams that you're stoked to try and earn. Issue is, if you're trying to design a legit build for hunting, be preparred to look like you just raided and Five and Dime store while choosing accessories at a Salvation Army. Gems: This is probably the most annoying thing about the game. You will be overloaded with gems. Issue is, most of them will be the equivalent of all those pennies you leave in that jar at home. You'll horde them because they're worth something but never really do anything with them. To get the gems you really want involves a 'merge' system which is basically a casino system. So pray to RNG gods.The Network: This is attrocious. Disconnects, random drops, broken groups, grouping bugs. Its gotten a hell of a lot better since launch but it still struggles. Combined with a weird invite system and 'instancing' trying to get a group of friends together is a headache the first dozen times. The Grind: This game is a grind. No question about it. While they have gone out of their way to try and hide some of the systems in unique ways you will be putting in the time. With only 5 zones and about 30 monsters you're gonna burn out (I hit mine around the 80 hour mark). Overall this is a quality game and deserves the praise it has been receiving. I've had fantastic moments in it and any game you can play 80 hours of before hitting the burn out is worht the price. However, its akward controls and demmanding skill game play mean this will be alot like For Honor. It will be hard to jump back in if you take a break once in awhile (and perform at the level you used to)."

4149,Turboshook™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/turboshook/,2,,1,375.0,August,"11,",392,0,1,"Review to follow at a later date.EDIT:First things first. Yeah, controllers are not recognized by default yet. Yes, it is kind of annoying, but easily fixed by enabling the steam controller API. You can even disable big picture mode launching whenever steam detects a controller for good measure. There are also a handful of multiplayer connectivity issues and I can only imagine that they will be ironed out in the near future, this being release weekend and whatnot. The majority of the negative reviews for this game are because a) someone took one of the above points very personally b) there is not a certain graphical setting that they want, or c) they just don't like MH games or this particular style of combat. To entirely write off a game as massive as this within your first two or so hours of playing for any of those reasons seems foolish to me. A fully detailed review of my thoughts on this game so far would be too long for anyone to justify reading, so I will just leave my whole-hearted recommendation here for anyone who cares to read it.

Monster Hunter: World is one of those games.In the past, I've only ever dabbled in the Monster Hunter franchise. I own a game on the PSP, 2 on the 3DS, and I even picked up Generations Ultimate on my Switch, because I enjoyed World so much.I can say, without a doubt, the changes made in this title compared to the other games have made it not only more easy to get into, but incredibly fun and engaging. The difficulty curve makes the experience a gradual ramp up, rather than being thrown straight into the fire instead of the frying pan throughout (albeit with a few sudden stops in the form of the ""walls"" that are some of the early, more difficult monsters).The best part of the game, by far, is the visual fidelity. The sheer level of detail that this game has given its world and characters/creatures is astounding, to say the least, especially when considering how previous titles have looked in comparison. That, and the game actually has a story. Not the most complex story, but to have some context for what the player is doing (outside of a few, long text boxes rattling off) is much appreciated.Oh yeah, and the modding scene is progressively getting better and better, too.For all my praise, the game is not without its faults.Certain game mechanics could be better explained to players. The late-game grind for decorations, as well as the general grind for materials, can be incredibly draining at times.My main gripe would be the lack of monster and weapon variety. While there is a decent handful of monsters to hunt, after subsequent grinds for materials, it becomes more and more apparent just how few monsters there are than previous titles.The weapon variety is especially bad. Only a set few weapons have any visual difference beyond just tacking on a bit of monster parts onto the same 2 to 3 weapon models that we've seen time and time again. It can be very disheartening, as it takes away the feeling of progress, apart from just a bigger number in the stats.Despite all that, I still recommend this game to anyone looking for something fun and interesting, but a little challenging.Not sure why there are so many mixed reviews, but I'd blame that on server issues, which, speaking from personal experience, haven't been a real problem for quite some time.Definitely worth the buy. Happy hunting!"

Moreover, I've enjoyed every moment playing this game despite it being my very first Monster Hunter game ever.I'll be honest, it was  and different in the beginning but that feeling goes for most games that feel foreign to you, so be a little patient. Heck, it was even in the process of being refunded after I really wasn't feeling the game's combat, It felt really slow and clunky to me. That feeling died soon after, when a friend of mine convinced me to stick around for a bit since the Monster Hunter genre . Ever since then, I learned the  and here I am with over 1000 hours in the game. I would like to highlight that I  to be able to enjoy and learn how to play the game. I did however go around hopping one weapon to the other at the start, ranging from the Switchaxe, the Insect Glaive, Dual Blades and so on. I finally settled on the , which is a  and probably the  in the game IMO, which can still be used in the game's end game content. With that being said, learning how to play all the  a challenge since each of those weapons have their own and a couple of combos to learn. With enough practice you can learn all of the weapons. However, I strongly advise players to as you don't want to become a Jack of all trades in the very start of the game. Ideally, you would want to  using the weapon of your choosing. Mastering a weapon though is a hard feat, which will take hours upon hours of practice to be able to use a weapon to its full potential. In contrast, the story wasn't too appealing IMO, so if you're a player that's playing this game for the story sorry to break it to you but there's none. Monster hunter serves  for the monsters and endemic life if you're into that.Moving on, I had already put in around 400 ish hours into base game before I progressed into Iceborne, in which I would . Once you've gotten a feel for the game, you'll probably enjoy hunting the more faster paced monsters in Iceborne; Of course you can do whatever you want, that's my personal opinion on how to enjoy the Monster Hunter experience as a beginner player. Moving on to when I first started Iceborne, the game had become a  but VERY enjoyable with a variety of new monsters that hit like a truck (Even with the best armor from base game which if I recall correctly, was the Drachen armor set from the Final Fantasy crossover monster Behemoth; the new monsters made base game armor feel like tinfoil).

AT Elder dragons for multiplayer are still very hard to kill alone even when they are about to die because HP is still set for multiplayer and your lone damage becomes insufficient.I hope something can be done about this ""power"" like limiting it to half the time of the quest or the state of the monster.It's really annoying, frustrating and disappointing when you participated well in one quest for a long duration and the host just kicks you out for no valid reason. Please really do something about this. Thanks!"

I get no frame drops except during very specific hunts in certain areas, and that's with max settings besides the fog setting (volumetric something) being turned off/as low as possible. The pro controller works splendidly after turning on the pro controller setting in big picture.Excellent game. If you've wanted to try a Monster Hunter game, this is the one to try. It's very satisfying to learn each monster's patterns and succeed, as well as learning each of the 14 weapons while crafting your way up to some badass (or cute!) designs of weapons, armor, and Palico armor.For those that don't know, a Palico is a slightly anthropomorphized cat (walks on hind legs primarily, but other than that still very catlike) that acts as your companion, and is customizable much like your character. It can use some special gadgets to help you, like with heals or buffs or even one that gets more crafting materials for you.My biggest complaint is the lack of variety in weapon design in some of the weapon classes. Hunting Horn, Hammer, and a few others have very little variety in their crafting trees until you start unlocking the very end of the trees, where they are usually more varied. If you're a Fashion Hunter at heart in other games, then you might be disappointed with the weapons. Otherwise, great game that I highly recommend. This was the first $60 game that I haven't regretted buying in years, and I plan on picking up MHGU on the Switch as soon as I can."

4184,Rokurai,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990554892/,3,,1,126.7,August,"22,",159,0,1,"I see alot of reviews bashing this game for its online component(which is currently unstable, I grant you, but so was console in the first couple of weeks, and now it's sorted). However this does not properly reflect the game itself, and would be a bad way of reviewing any game or product, much like saying ""I don't like this car because the bluetooth functionality won't currently pair with my moble device."" With that in mind, I'll attempt to review my experience of the GAME part of this product so far. Full disclosure: I've played the Monster Huinter franchise since MH3 Ultimate came to the West. I have over 1600 hours logged across multiple save files in MH3U, MH4U, MHGen, MHXX, and MHW Console Ver(PS4). I obviously like this series. The gameplay is great:The controls are smooth and responsive, and I've had no problems getting the game to sync up instantly to PS4 and XBOne controllers I plug in. The only issue I've really seen so far is when utilizing more than five simoultaneous inputs from a keyboard, the game sometimes (or maybe my system?) prioritizes the older key press first, resulting in what feels like a stuck keypress. Capcom said they were working on mouse and keyboard fixes, so that should hopefully be resolved soon. The environments behave like they feel they should when interacted with, and the monsters feel appropriately ferocious and/or comical. The Capcom Desire Sensor(TM) makes a strong comeback, making sure you'll grind long and hard for that gear you really want that looks so sweet, but it's part of what makes it so satisfying to get that armor or weapon. And the ticket exchange system somewhat softens the blow by allowing you to get rare monster parts if you do a number of monster bounties every week. Overall a good balance between grind/reward and RNG avoidance.The graphics are great: I won't pretend that it'll run on a potato, but I will say that even on the lowest graphics, at 60fps this game still looks better than some full graphics-locked releases out there. At highest graphics, the environments are breathtaking, and the ambience the game sound and music create works very well with the visual effects. There are some minor visual clipping issues with large monsters that have died, but in all honesty it's surprising there aren't more, given the size and complexity of the maps. The story is great: While I realise most people are here to gather mushrooms and hit monsters in the face until they die, the plot of this game is actually quite engaging if you take your time to explore the world and interact with the NPCs(derpy and endearing as they are). They really tried to make the maps feel inter-connected, and explain why so many different environments are in such proximity to one another. They tried to make the ecosystem feel alive, and, in my opinion, they succeeded.The netcode needs to catch up:People are complaining about Capcom not responding to their complaints, but Capcom has already stated they know about the connection issues and are working on them. A few days into the game's full release, Capcom additionally acknowledged issues with they keyboard and mouse controlls posted on forums and Steam boards. This does not mean they stopped working on the netcode issue, it means that they monitor community feedback and are responsive. It took two weeks on PS4 before online play was stable, but it would have been nice to have the issues resolved on release this time around. I realise netcode for console and PC are different, so I'm willing to be patient, considering how outstanding this game is in every other aspect. Actual online mechanics concerns(not netcode related):My only gripe with the actual mechanics of how online works on the PC version vs. the console version is the decision to do away with Squads. Squads, for those who are unaware, were essentially like little guilds or groups of 50 players. You could be part of multiple squads at a time and you could always go to a private squad session for a squad you were in regardless of whether or not there were other people in the squad hall. The reason I miss this is that if your friends are otherwise preoccupied hitting a monster in the face, they cant really go into a menu to copy/paste a session ID so you can hop into their hunt to help them out without the necessity of an SOS flare opening the hunt to everyone online. If joining a private session from your steam friend's list didn't require a session ID(an easy fix) Even this minor gripe would be resolved. Future development:For the console, the developers add free new content to this game on a regular basis(and have stated that ONLY cosmetic changes will cost anything, if you should choose to indulge in them), with balance issues being addressed, known bugs being fixed, and new hunts and events being introduced. I see no reason to suspect anything different will be the case for the PC version, especially as it is several months behind the console release, and thus it would be simple to head off problems before they have a chance to develop into game-breaking bugs. All in all, I guess what I'm most concerned about is that the general negativity towards this one issue with the game could spiral out of control and scare people away from playing this game before the game has a chance to get off the ground properly. I mean, Just look at the review score currently, and get a sample size to see how many of those negative reviews boil down to ""online is broken, therefore game sucks."" Also, I won't go into reviewing any modding until Capcom makes their stance on graphics overhaul mods and the like clear."
4185,Gilwage,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gilwage/,2,,1,"1,823.3",October,"31,",348,0,1,"If you enjoy Souls-y combat, Elder Scrolls-y resource collection, gorgeous graphics, great character customisation, interesting and diverse playstyles, co-op, and just a bit (maybe a lot bit) of grinding, this is a title for you!Cons?A lot of complaints in the reviews are about the delayed release, the initially shoddy port from console and how long it took to fix. Perhaps my review would be different if I had pre-ordered - or owned the game when connection problems were still a major issue.Do the devs deserve your money? Maybe. You be the judge.Whether they do or don't, though, you probably deserve to ignore all of that and just enjoy a sweet game.Personally, my biggest issue with the game is pretty minor - keyboard controls were difficult. No problem if you've got a controller, though.Here's what's good.Although the quests often feel a bit like your average MMO quests in that they can seem pretty arbitrary and typically involve simply killing something or handing in some items, this game makes killing things and getting loot  rewarding. The act of physically carving up a dead monster rather than walking up to its corpse and pressing Loot All is really satisfying, and I'm certainly not tired of grabbing every plant, insect, bone and shiny rock that I pass.Another thing the game gets right is making every hunt feel like a big deal. Picking the right gear, having a good meal, heading out to the quest area and tracking a monster all serve to build anticipation for the big fight in a way that a lot of games just don't do. Even if I've previously taken down several specimens of the particular monster I'm hunting, I'm still excited to bring down another.The main thing, though? Combat - the heart of the game - is . Once you figure out which weapon you prefer and how to use it effectively (you might wanna Google it - the tutorials can be a little patchy and might not tell you everything. And practice! There's a training area), you're ready to have yourself a grand old time. Seeing a big monster reel from your attacks is always delightful.Part of why I think this is a great game may come from being new to the series. Some people have said that Monster Hunter veterans might not enjoy this game because of its differences to previous titles, and I'm in no position to refute that. If, like me, you're new to Monster Hunter, you're in luck! Veterans, maybe think about it a little longer before you buy.(Highly recommend playing with a controller - haven't tried KBM since recent update which improved it though)EDIT: At 1500 hours, I stand by the above written at 500 hours. And I want to add that the extra work that's been poured into new content, including Iceborne, has been amazing. Iceborne fixed a lot of the dependence on RNG for endgame weapon customisation and expanded immensely on how the game can be played. And the QoL improvements are fantastic."

4187,Finzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyfinzy/,2,,1,168.2,September,"1,",378,0,1,"I played this to hunter rank 50 on PS4 before so my review is gonna be heavily based on that (my PC impressions are at bottom). This is the first Monster Hunter game I've played and I generally really liked it. For anyone new to the series it's definitely the best one to pick up. The gameplay is basically kind of like boss fights all over the place with differently weighted weapons and so forth. Most movements are slow and you have to commit to the attacks and stuff you do. Every weapon offers a completely different and unique playstyle. First I played through using the Switchaxe and Bow and now on my second playthrough I'm using the Charge Blade and it's a lot of fun re-learning the game (checked other weapons too but those are my mains).The actual hunting feels very rewarding and for a game with SO much grinding it does a good job at not making it tedious because you're constantly chainsawing the ♥♥♥♥ out of those poor innocent monsters, forest animals, lizards, whatever crosses your path. You carve them up for a nice new set of armor. Or capture them so you can fight them again more conveniently. And each fight feels like a proper challenge worth your time. At least if you're playing solo or duo with a smaller group. Multiplayer can be a bit all over the place there so I would recommend people learn to hunt on their own as well. Both because grouping up doesn't always work and it helps you learn and appreciate the game more. There's also dumb restrictions in multiplayer, you have to have watched the story cutscenes before you are allowed to play with other players, wish IMHO should've been removed. I played through the PS4 version mostly duo with a friend and we still managed somehow but had to do a lot of abandoning quests to co-op through it, especially at the start of the game (later on it's a bit better and they let you group up more). Although duoing the game is pretty fun because you get 4x monster HP (and we kicked ass).The game definitely takes some learning and commitment but I would say it is the easiest approachable MH game for sure. There was even too much hand holding in the start of the game in my opinion, because I kept wanting to do harder stuff right out of the bat. And that would be most of my complaints core gameplay wise, throughout Low Rank and High Rank you have plenty of story stuff to do and it easily lasts probably at least 40 hours or more to get to the end of High Rank and start on Tempered monsters, depending on how quick you are (it was about 50+ hrs for me on PS4 iirc, but I took my time). And even after you 'beat' the game you basically just unlock a new tier of monsters and even entirely new ones, so you can keep playing for a very long time without seeing everything. I just wish the game let me fight harder monsters sooner, on PS4 I had fought Tempered Elder Dragons on a friend's investigation before even getting there way later.TL;DRSo how is it on PC? The port is not completely terrible, you have decent graphics options, and it runs okay at 1440p on high-ish settings on my 1070 GTX, although I did have to drop some stuff and expected a bit better performance (average something between 45-60 FPS). The multiplayer had some connection issues before but they have improved over some patches. One thing that really bugs me about the game is that the texture quality is really AWFUL in places. Some textures legit look PS2 quality for whatever reason on Full settings and I'm confused how that got past QA as a 'bug'. Even the PS4 version had better texture quality as far as I know so it should really be fixed...(and a fix is coming eventually, apparently?).At least compared to the PS4 version the game does load a million times faster, switching between quests takes about 5 seconds at best, and the FPS is better than that version at least. :P (which ran about 30 FPS).If you have the PC to run it and the gameplay sounds interesting I'd give it a shot. Otherwise the PS4 version may be better. I felt that it wasn't fair to judge the game purely based on its technical performance so my thumbs up is from the gameplay, which is great. There's some flaws in multiplayer they could fix in future titles for sure though, but it's not all bad."

Yes.for me it's 90/100want to but this game?buy it here:"

Here's what I did to fix it and I hope it helps you guys too. So it seems that the bad optimizations are part the game engine, and part the bad profiles on Nvidia's part for said game. So after installing a little program called Nvidia Inspector, running the profile inspector, locating the Monster Hunter World Profile and Deleting it, the game suddenly ran perfectly even in areas that would absolutely kill my FPS on medium settings. So now I am playing the game happily on maxed settings without any hitches or ever dropping frames which is GREAT!Some video settings are still broken mind you... Water Reflections still don't work right and texture setting is still broken (unless you download the High Res Texture DLC which is free and highly recommended for 1070 8GB Vram and up Card owners...), but at least the game is stable enough now and I don't have to make the game look ugly for it. It's a good thing too because this game is honestly great, It's everything I've ever liked in Monster Hunter games and More! Definitely a must buy if you're a fan...+Very Extensive Customization/Personalization where you can really differentiate your hunter/palico's base appearance as well as your Guild Card, your Gesture quotes, among other things...+14 Different weapons to choose from, all with their strenghts and weaknesses on top of a plethora of tools at your disposal.+Many MANY quests to undertake, and monsters to Slay or Capture+Very Extensive Crafting... +Frequently updated with new quests and Monster Hunts for free+A HUGE amount of Quality of Life changes (too many to list) from Previous Monster Hunter games that make this a very VERY welcoming experience that significantly lessens those dull moments and emphasizes on the stuff that Makes Monster Hunter an amazing game to play.+Monsters can now Infight which I absolutely LOVE btw (Kaiju battle anyone?)-Despite looking like a 10 year old game, MHW is a Mediocre and Needlessly Resource Heavy PC port... You'll have to do quite a bit of tweakning to get the game running well, especially on lower end specs, or use a mod or three (somewhat fixed between Nvidia Driver updates and recent QoL updates, Getting more frames than when game launched but can still cause issues on certain setups).-Keyboard and Mouse Controls may be hit or miss, even tho they are fully rebindable. Mouse Accel that you cannot turn off (Mouse Controls fixed as of 9/20/18 thanks to Type 2 mouse aim setting, but the way the Radial Menu handles on K+M can still use some work)...-Cannot rebind Controller at all (just like Dark Souls), well... technically you CAN swap some buttons around but it is so limited it may as well not exist. Default Controller layout may turn some people off...-Combat is most definitely not for everyone (slow, clunky and incredibly weighty)-Tutorial is a bit slow paced, but this may not be a bad thing since it's a bit more hands off than previous installments...If you want to know more about the PC version of Monster Hunter World, I highly recommend watching the Digital Foundry Analysis vid, both for comparison and troubleshooting purposes as it is highly insightful...I currently give MHW on PC a 9 out of 10, Highly Recommended to buy, especially on sale!"

The community in this game for my 9 online sessions has been wonderful. Nice people that help you out, tell you tips and more. I am sure it will be plagued by toxic people, but I have enjoyed the monster hunter since MH 3 on the 3ds and I played more Generations than most of my 3ds games. I am also a PC gamer who has played loads of games while playing on my 3ds and I have played lots of online/MMORPG games. I have over 1k hours on most of them that are not p2p and have played warframe to hell. Now I will actually talk more about this game.

I can play games that are heavy in CPU and GPU use, yet still not able to go the launch screen of this game anymore because it freezes my PC. Thank you CAPCOM for making this game on PC, but if you could make another patch for people who have bought this game for a big price point. I have tried every method the internet can offer, I have done my own fair share of troubleshooting computers,  I have looked through the forums of the support and more. I am a guy who cares not about graphics at all, I have put this game in the lowest possible settings, I have followed what the community told me to do to make my computer use less resources and I don't want to give up now.

4219,gamer of video,https://steamcommunity.com/id/purekun/,4,1,0,149.6,August,"10,",177,0,1,"TL;DR already - Game's good, negative review because c'mon really?Played a lot of 4U, quite a bit of XX, was hyped for MHW on PC because of solid framerate.MHW has done a lot of changes to the standard MH formula which have made the game more enjoyable to play (easier gathering, easier inventory management, less useless quests). The locations became full ecosystems which works well with the design of the game. Weapons feel smooth and are less clunky (eg greatsword allows for a roll back after a strike, making the fight more dynamic and results in fewer feelings of ""f*** this game"".However, the question here is if I recommend this game.No. Absolutely not, at least not in this current state. I run the game with a few years old i5 and a geforce 960 on 55-60fps. Usually 60fps but the game randomly stutters for a couple of frames. While playable, there's no reason why that should be the case. Most of the people I know can't run the game well, even with good rigs. Some run the game on 45 fps with everything on low. The optimization is just poorly done and people are accusing both denuvo as well as capcom for writing bad code and rendering things out of sight needlessly.If you're not sure, get the game and either refund or not but in this current state, the game cannot be recommended.When there's either a patch or a fanmade mod that fixes the framerate issues, I'll gladly update this review."

4238,fatsadboi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/averybigbigman/,16,3,0,316.6,August,"13,",191,3,1,"First and foremost, this is going to be my review as a longtime veteran, having played since 3 Ultimate and with ~1000 hours combined in every game since. As such, a large portion of this review is going to be a comparison with classic monster hunter. This is also my second time going through the game, having reached and played a large portion of the endgame on PS4. At its core, Monster Hunter: World is a huge quality of life update to classic Monster Hunter. However, the game does suffer from some major flaws - especially in the multiplayer department. Now, let’s start with what the game absolutely does right. The game is gorgeous - people have been dreaming of an HD Monhun for years and now that it’s finally here it really is breathtaking. Seamless, wide-open areas make the flow of the hunt more natural and the Monster AI itself has taken a huge step forward. Gathering has now become increasingly streamlined, cutting a large portion of busy work out of the game. Animations for both hunter and monster have been revamped and look smoother than they’ve ever been before. World is almost definitely the best single player experience that the Monster Hunter series has to offer. However, take one look at the co-op multiplayer and suddenly the game starts to break at the seams. First, let’s address the elephant in the room. The PC release has had consistent server issues ever since launch, making it near impossible to play with friends. Even without friends, often times you’ll drop into an SOS and disconnect before the end of the hunt. However, these issues can be patched eventually and I personally, will not be counting this as a huge downside to the game. What SHOULD and WILL be counted against the game is the failed structure that the game implements. Going from Monster Hunter Generations to World, Capcom decided to cut the old Monster Hunter formula and combine both the single player and multiplayer campaigns into one entity. It’s from this one decision that almost all major issues with the game arise. You’ve likely all heard the biggest complaint about playing through the story co-op by now - the cutscene requirement. Having to watch all cutscenes, leave, then join a friend who also has to have watched the cutscenes is completely obtuse and ruins any sort of pacing the game has going for it. It’s jarring, frustrating, and completely removes you from the experience. What’s even worse is that this was a non-issue in previous titles. The only reason it’s a problem now is that, like previously mentioned, the story and multiplayer are now combined. Capcom is trying to preserve the experience of going through a campaign seemingly by yourself but by not setting them into 2 different sets of quests they’re simply contradicting themselves and making it a hassle for almost all players.Another major problem that arises from combining single and multiplayer is often glossed over by other players and critics. Personally, I feel that this is because a large portion of the playerbase is inexperienced and thus will not be able to relate, but if you’ve put in a good chunk of time into any monster hunter game before suddenly there’s not much reason to play multiplayer anymore. Any hunt that you do multiplayer, especially during the campaign, could be done solo faster and more easily. In previous games, multiplayer difficulty was always higher than solo. This encouraged you to find other players to play with - now, often adding more players can prove detrimental. This, combined with the sheer difficulty of finding and joining any multiplayer hunts just removes any sort of motivation to play with other people. These issues were remedied slightly in some of the endgame quests on PS4 (Kulve Taroth), but PC has yet to see even a glimpse of those and likely will not for months. This leads into, in my opinion, the game’s biggest flaw. The game just feels lonely! People praise the SOS mechanic, but the culture behind it honestly bothers me. Players tend to simply disband after any given hunt. Gone is the simple camaraderie of playing with the same people for an entire session, exchanging guild cards and adding each other. This is made even worse by the fact that you can’t see other players from your session in Astera. It may have been slightly archaic, but having everybody in the same instance for multiplayer in the past games was really quite nice. You can say that you can simply return to the gathering hub after a quest, but in all my playtime I really have yet to see this happen even once with randoms. Having 16 players to a lobby is another huge issue - any one of these players could jump in to your hunt at any time and you’d have no idea who they were. In past games, it was 4 to a lobby, so you almost certainly knew that the people who were in your room were the people who you would be hunting with. There’s just this huge disconnect with the rest of the community, and it really is a shame. It makes it feel like you’re playing a single player game with cameos from other players rather than the excellent co-op of the previous games. Now, in light of all of this negativity it would seem as if I absolutely loathe the game. But in truth, I don’t. The core single player monster hunter experience is still intact. The game as a whole is a lot easier than previous entries which, as a veteran, displeases me, but it makes the game a great entry point for the series. I’d recommend the game to almost all new players of the series. It’s just that the more and more I play World, the more and more I miss classic Monster Hunter. The game has its moments - not having to cycle urgents 4 times for an entire party is an understated blessing, but at the same time this is just another small quality of life change. Monster Hunter: World manages to fix many of the quality of life problems that previous Monster Hunter games had. However, it fails to deliver on many of the core aspects of co-op Monster Hunter that were so central to the series as a whole. I’ll honestly keep playing it for a love of the series, but I have to say, it’s really just disappointing."
4239,Dongs.exe,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043143194/,4,,0,15.5,August,"20,",16,0,1,"The little I played of single player seemed to work, but others have stated to have lots of issues there too. I have been lucky this far.But if you want this game for multiplayer? Don't. Not until they fix many issues. Everyone probably knows of the server issues by now, but the biggest issue of multiplayer is built into the game itself. If you wanted to hunt new monsters and go through the story with friends, you pretty much can't unless you jump through so many hoops that it's ridiculous. Everyone has to have seen all the cutscenes in a story mission to be able to join it, including finding the monster for the first time cutscene. Have fun running over to a monster, waiting for all your friends to do the same and then quit and start the quest for real with all of you together! And then get disconnected from the servers. Might not sound like much, but it adds up - oh does it ever. Some quests are even so full of cutscenes that you pretty much can't play with your friends who are at the same point. Old Monster Hunter games had separate offline and online campaigns with offline being the story and cutscenes, and with online lacking those features that might cause desyncs or something. When this one tried to mix them together, I assume all of us thought they'd be online and playable with your friends so you could enjoy it together. Nope, pretty much the exact opposite and there no longer is any proper online questline or progression, just online grinding for parts - at least not at low rank, but I wouldn't know what happens after the story quest as everyone who bought this to play together quit because they don't care to hunt alone, and neither do I, honestly. This was something no one mentioned anywhere and would have affected whether or not we would have purchased the game, so take note!Fixing the server issues will not fix this issue. The story should have been offline if it's something you have to solo or SOS randoms - which you shouldn't, as every hunter adds health to the monster and if the random hunters are bad, your fights just get longer and tougher than if you did them alone. And if you do somehow find cool hunters you'd like to continue hunting with, you really can't as you're separated after the quest without going to the same hub. And speaking of the hub, there's only one part of it that is multiplayer friendly with other players actually showing up, and no one really goes there. A big part of the multiplayer experience in past games of the series has been screwing around before and after the quests together when you're not on a hunt, so there's not really much of that left in World.I remember when the tagline of this series was ""in the world of Monster Hunter, you're never alone"". Well, I sure am more alone now than ever, even with the janky multiplayer of the old games."

4245,Duckmom,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Duckmom/,2,,1,422.2,February,"7,",163,0,1,"Each of 14 weapon types makes combat feel like an entirely different game, from the grace and familiarity of a sword and shield, to the explosive pummel of an ammo-switching Bowgun, to the downright oddity of the Hunting Horn, a massive hammer that plays stat-buffing tunes.Monsters themselves come with a wealth of strengths and weaknesses and many, many materials to harvest, all of which can be used to create tens of possible items. You also have an adorable cat companion called a Palico which can be outfitted with its own gear, all offering different bonuses for your character. And when it all seems like you’ve got it sussed, along comes High-Rank, Monster Hunter’s “post-game” content, which changes some monsters, adds new ones, and essentially doubles the amount of gear to lust after.The deeper you look, the deeper it all seems to get - and that sheer level of complexity has historically been what stops Monster Hunter from offering mainstream appeal. But let’s get something out of the way: there’s been an assumption among the waiting audience over the past few months that - despite the protestations of Capcom itself - World would simplify the series’ more obscure ideas to help court a western audience. After just the first few hours, it becomes abundantly clear those concerns are unfounded.Monster Hunter has always been opaque, its menus pebble-dashed with byzantine statistics, and its combat purposefully designed to be methodical and challenging in a way that feels strange next to modern action games’ fluidity. Practically none of that has changed. This remains a game where learning is as important as doing, from potion recipes to intricate combos.World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience.“What’s changed in some ways is how they’re presented. Quality-of-life improvements have smoothed off a few rough edges, making crafting simpler, armour skills more abundant, and introducing quicker, more efficient looting. But many difficult-to-grasp aspects still remain (it’s still crazy to me that weapon tutorials are still so meagre), and few have been made with the first-time player in mind. Playing in a party alongside new hunters, I’ve been bombarded with questions ranging from the simple (“Where can I change my weapon again?”) to the slightly more specific (“Why does my glaive come with a huge insect buddy, and what does the dust it leaves behind after sucking the juices out of a lizard do?”). The bottom line is that World is decidedly not a my-first-Monster-Hunter experience - this is full-fat, waterfall-of-information Monster Hunter. In that respect, it’s the same as it ever was.Those coming in looking for an all-encompassing adventure story will find World a little lacking, too. The central plotline - of travelling to a new continent in the wake of a migrating Elder Dragon - is a neat one, and pleasantly naturalist in tone (well, as naturalist as you can be in a game about killing mythical creatures to make shoes), but it’s nothing more than a pretext for the near-endless hunts ahead.But as far as opportunities for new experiences go, World just never seems to stop providing them – and I love that feeling. 50 hours in, it’s still regularly throwing crafting possibilities, monsters, even entirely new systems at me and expecting me to put time into learning how they can benefit my character.One of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played.“But no matter how much I or any other fan tries to convince you, there’s a chance that a game that requires this much management alongside its maiming simply won’t be for you. I urge you to at least try. Find an experienced friend to guide you or sit down for a few video tutorials, because Monster Hunter: World is one of the most consistently exciting, satisfying, and gratifyingly absurd games I’ve played since, well, the last Monster Hunter game.A disclaimer: though I’ve completed the story quest, I’m absolutely nowhere near “finished.” Side quests are clogging up my menus, I haven’t touched the majority of the weapons, and even the end of the campaign opens up a second, much more difficult half. This isn’t an admission of guilt, it’s a demonstration of what kind of game we’re dealing with. Above and beyond anything else you can say about World, there is a lot of it. It’s still stupendously generous with content and, better, matches that with consistently making your time feel well-spent instead of wasting it on empty-feeling grinding."
4246,AOKCube,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067935639/,2,,1,669.4,December,"22,",123,0,1,"One of the best games I have ever played. Manages to strike a balance between hard farming while also allowing players to get a sense of accomplishment from finally learning a bosses moveset/fight. The act of farming itself is a challenge and engaging almost always, something which a lot of loot-focused games fail to keep steady. The Iceborne DLC adds to this, upping the difficulty significantly to allow for more experienced players to get a new challenge, while also adding balance changes to the weapons. Speaking of the weapons, no two weapons feel like copies of each other, with the closest comparison being able to be made is between the two bowguns, beyond that, each weapon is extremely different and has extremely different drawbacks and benefits. This is to the point where picking a different weapon and going through the game creates an entirely new experience. That being said, the game can be extremely punishing and will take patience to complete through, so it's not perfect for everyone, but if one is looking for a cool looking game with cool monsters while being both farmy and very challenging but never truly boring, this game is absolutely perfect for them. That being said, the game is not perfect and could use some improvements, the thing is this list is very small imo. The worst offender is the online multiplayer, something with the servers or connections or whatever ends with players getting disconnected a lot, which is disheartening. The only other thing is that for some of the harder monsters, it seems like difficulty is added through extra damage on attacks, way too much, not by making the monsters actually harder. Though for this I would really say the only offenders are the Arch Tempered new monsters like Nameille and Velkhana, so its not really a gripe, but I'd be worried if more monsters are added, even though world is sunset so this wont be happening. That's all I can think of in terms of direct fixes I'd want, which shows at least in my opinion how great it is."

It is so much fun playing with friends and random people, the community surrounding this game is great, helpful and a lot of fun. I would reccomend to play the base game first without the DLC, because some of the new features from Iceborne make aspects of the base game easier. Also don't use the defender gear, it is akin to cheating yourself out of  a great experience. Learning the game and building your own armour from slain monsters is more rewarding than picking the cheat armour when creating a new character. This is one of my most played games to this day, even though i definetly hold the Monster Hunter that started it all near and dear, (MH on Ps2 and later on MH Freedom on PSP) MH World might still be the best Monster Hunter game to this day. There is so much content in this game. From beautifully crafted areas to explore, photos to take, treassures to hunt, fishing for materials you can use to craft bombs or sharpen your weapons etc. Of course a large variety of complex monsters to hunt. Not only that, but learning how each one of them operate and what to use against them. If you want to sink countless hours in a rewarding game which takes effort and time to learn, then you should definetly buy this."

I couldn't enjoy the games on 3DS, so when World came out, I figured this was my best chance to enjoy the series. I hated it. It felt clunky and slow coming from games like Dark Souls and similar titles. The game was hard and felt almost unfair playing it the first time. I was told to just play deeper in the game and I'll learn to love it. I did't I put the game up and didn't touch it till I got it on PC 3 years later. Same story. Controls felt clunky and bad. This time however, I stuck with the game to play with friends due to guilt. After around 20 hours, I fell in LOVE with this game. It has such a charm and unique playstyle. Its rewarding and just eats away time. There are so many diverse weapons and sets you can make with armors. The game is stellar. I can't recommend this title enough.

These monsties are running rampant through what is rightfully now your land, and you're the New World's topmost monstie hunter. The DLC, in which you play as Iceborne, Monster Hunter World's colder brother, always sends chills down my spine. In it, you discover a land of your own namesake by following a flock of dragons several miles over the ocean. In doing this, you also discover that unlike his brother, Iceborne puts all his marbles on luck instead of intelligence."

Although, I did play sword and shield the first time around (I hope any sword and shield players take full offense to that.) I kind of forgot the game existed for a few months after that until a friend messaged me over discord asking if I have ever played Monster Hunter World, he eventually got me back into it. Something I will never take back is that I am glad he did, because this game is a f*cking masterpiece. At the time of this review I have used every weapon (except sword and shield) twice. I have made 4 characters all with over 100+ hours on them. This game offers so many paths with weapons and abilities that my 772 hours on this game is just scratching the surface of the potential you can get. This game is just fun plain and simple. If you love beating the absolute hell out of monsters then I can not recommend this more, if you like monsters fighting other monsters then this game is for you, there has been a countless amount of times where I have seen a walking pickle that breaths dragon blight inducing smoke throw a obese lizard into the side of the wall breaking everything in its body... (maybe a little gruesome) BUT IT HAPPENS! You like getting up and close? Slam a hammer into their face. You like staying back and supporting? we got you, riddle them with bullets or pelt them with arrows while you got a healing build on your armor. Maybe you are all about that ranged and close ranged action, oh yeah man we got you, go up with a gun and pump em full of shotgun rounds as your other teammates beat the living hell out of it with pointy sticks. There is never a dull moment in this game, and EVERYBODY no matter their play style will find a weapon they like in their runs. But that is just weapons! The story in this game is phenomenal (no spoilers). It is very rich and fulfilling once you finally kill your first elder dragon that seemed impossible to even scratch. No matter what you are looking for, maybe just a nice playthrough in a monster hunting game, or maybe you want to go into a huge raid party and take down a gigantic nuke spitting dragon. No matter what you do in this game, every second of it goes toward something. I can not recommend this game enough for everybody, if you want a good game then you need this in your library. Also if you like the base game then I assure you the DLC is very worth it.... Sword and Shield players suck balls"

I refuse to compare this to any other of the monster hunter games... cause of I haven't played any of them. Pros:The maps are large and has fixed gathering points for certain resources. Monsters travel around giving that true ""Open-world"" feel. It was neat that giant monsters would fight each other because one of them didn't like the color of their face and decided a little more blood-red. Truly eases you into the game with the tutorials and the like but you'll probably skip all that like I did. Piece of advice: GO INTO THE TRAINING AREA AND JUST PRACTICE A WEAPON TILL YOU FIND THE ONE YOU LIKE.Graphics are beautiful. Large monsters truly feel alive and breathing, which makes it all the more horrifying when you turn around and realize that the local T-Rex has finished deciding which BBQ sauce it wants to dip you in. By the way, it decided that mango habanero was the best choice.The music is godly. All soundtracks in the game seems great especially with monsters having its own theme... though, there was one song that I hate... Cons:The information dump is real. It does ease you into the game, yes. BUT, there is so much information and it's a daunting read. Jewels and Skills are so much more importantly than you first think. This makes up majority of the game in the end and eventually devolves into statistical analytics to see whose numbers are bigger.Beetlejuice... No other words.You will die. It's a real trial and error process where you need to know the monster's move set if you want to beat them with lower level weapons (or you can grind and upgrade to the max possible). Get ready to get comfortable with the ground, cause you'll be hugging it more than your favorite body pillow.Overall: 9/10 Really close to being a perfect game to me. The only downside is that some great features are locked behind the DLC. Regardless, one of the greatest games I've played."

There's 14 weapon categories, all which have their own upgrade tree with over 50 unique upgrades for each weapon. These don't just increase attack, but element types, things like decoration slots (which give boosts to certain things like defense overall, attack when a monster is aggravated, and many more), their own skills that have the same effects as decorations, and weapons like the bowguns, gunlance or greatbow have their own ammo types and effects unique to each tree and version of the weapon. Each monster has several types of armor unique to it, with its own skills and decoration slots available, and elemental resistances to go with them.It can sound like a lot to newcomers, but the game guides you to a point where you can understand the fundamentals, but you will have to get a bit more in depth to really bring out the strengths and weaknesses of builds."

They've been playing the series for most of their life, and convinced me to get World back when it released on console. Fast forward to today, and MHW:I is one of my favorite games to play. It has its frustrations like every other game, some the game's fault and others your own, but it has always been a wildly enjoyable time whenever I've played it. It's great on your own, and even better with other players and/or friends. (Most of) The monsters are fun and challenging to fight, (most of) their weapons and armor look and play great, along with the music and visuals. It's all so, so good.

If you're looking for a game that has excellent visuals, interesting and sometimes difficult boss fights, a plethora of room for experimentation, and a weapon/armor system that is very intuitive, MHW is a great option.There are 14 weapons for you to choose from, each with a very unique playstyle and role when it comes to a hunt.  To be honest, I'd say probably 9 of them feel VERY unique.  Lance and Gunlance vary in playstyle, but the overall feel is similar.  Same with most of the bows.  Minus the variance between Bow -> Great bow.  There are PLENTY of weapon options just within those 14 categories, and you unlock more as you progress onward to harder and harder monsters.The monsters themselves are amazing to look at, with their own movesets and elements associated to them.  You really have to play smart if you want to kill/capture some of the more difficult monsters, so there's always potential for growth, which I find very appealing.Honestly, the game is a bit grindy, but some people are into that, myself being one of them.  It's nice to set goals for yourself and strive to get the parts/materials you need to craft what you want.All in all, I would rate MHW 9/10.  Would be a 10 for me, but there are a few minor quality of life aspects that just aren't there.  Multiplayer is more of a hassle than it should be, but other than that, not many complaints.TL;DR - Amazing graphics, monsters, variation in weapon types, excellent progression mechanics, sort of grindyHope you enjoy this game as much as I do :D.Note: Iceborne is 100% worth the cost."

The game is all about hunting monsters to earn better gear but I also spent a lot of time enjoying the scenery and the environment.The story of this game for me is good but don't expect too much. The environments or locale in this game is quite unique and  I really appreciate the amount of detail and effort that was put in this game. The fights in this game are fun. The battles are challenging and it might take you some time to finish hunt especially if its the first time you encountered that monster. But after gearing up and facing it more and more, you learn the monster's moves and the fight gets easier. The moments where I can flawlessly dodge the monster's move or timely block its attack are the moments I enjoy the most.This game frequently gets updates. There is about new content every month. These update may come as a new monster or events. The events are fun especially if you play with other hunters. The game gets better and better with the frequent updates.Thank you for reading my review, I highly recommend this game to others.

I found that the game is much more in depth than I initially thought and I spent hours focusing on learning builds, how the canteen works, and other aspects I didn't even know existed. Even after 300+ hours I learn something new all the time. With the release of Iceborne, MHW is expanded even more so.

Since I pay attention so sound and aesthetics generally; - Soundtrack is pure gold, from city music to different monster themes.- Sound design is a bit curious sometimes(can hear animals which the sound is inspired from etc, such as chicken, horse, panther or a monkey), but it's generally really memorable and nicely done. - Aesthetics are great, maps and monsters are beautiful, armor sets are great, and despite some PC gamer's  reviewer's experience of having 'skimpy' and impractical outfits for FEMALES, mind you it is both ways. And both also have some very, very bulky armor depending on the set, of course. I, as a female myself, don't give a damn if I can see my character's form, or have some nice maybe not ideal for combat- armor, I just want to look good, and I can if I want to. - Combat feels great once you get the hang of it- If you like big monsters and you cannot lie, you can just capture them if you don't want to kill them. ALL OF THEM, *except elder dragons, but once you get them low, I doubt you want to capture them with what they've put you through*"

I've seen many gameplay from this series on the old platforms and it was drastically changed or upgraded and there is just so much to do. I've spent almost 400 hours in playing this game completion just felt like it is still too far away, now that the Iceborne is coming to be released. Thus, I would really suggest this to friends or to those who are still planning to buy the game, who love to play third person RPG games that is usually filled with combos and such. This game is absolutely ""exhilarating"".Update: With the Iceborne released, Capcom really did a great job to maintain their development over the last few months. Performance improvements also changed drastically when CPU usage was dropped down from 100% to 70%. DX12 is now stable and better on my AMD GPU unlike on the first release of Iceborne with frequent crashes. Combos added to the weaponry is another plus for me and another thing is they added challenges as a change of pace on the treasure hunting, endemic life hunting, and observer quests. There are still more goodies to come as Capcom is still adding more feature updates as well. All in all, I would really suggest this game! Been playing for about 800 hours now and it's still extremely ""exhilarating""."

Some loot is rare some is common etc. which is fine but sometimes it can take 12 times to get that common loot you want. If it takes me a long ass time to get rare loot that's okay especially since the loot system is based on what you attack. For example you get tail by cutting off the tail, this system is great! But the RNG throws that out the window and makes in annoying as hell.6/10 Character animation. Conversations are horrible in this game since the animation is.. unexplainable. Animations in hunts are incredible tho so that's great.9/10 Game for me really solid the flaws of the game don't drag it down to a 9 for me it's the crappy PC port that drags it down.

4446,Josh Reaver™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/joshreaver/,3,,1,979.9,May,"25,",551,0,1,"After 400+ hours of playing MHW I can absolutely recommend it! This game and its community is amazing! Coming into this entry I had tried to give other titles in the franchise a shot; they seemed interesting, however, I had two huge gripes with the earlier titles. First off, the constant loading screens in each area which slowed down the hunting experience. Secondly the systems they were on, (3DS was never comfortable for me to play for extended periods.) I can say in World these issues have been addressed!My heart was stolen right away when I hit the character creator and was able to make my Palico, (for the uninitiated it's a cat companion.) After choosing my weapon, (which there are 14 of,) I took off on my first hunt and noticed how good the gameplay felt. They updated the movesets from prior games so each weapon feels familiar to returning hunters, and still giving them new mechanics to learn. Never will I try to tell people that it doesn't have a huge learning curve, but, once learned the game is immensely rewarding.Most of all I have to stress how the world around you feels very alive in the New World. The graphics and audio design really immerse you in the biomes that surround you. Many of the monsters have a new feature called turf wars; if two monster encounter each other, while you are hunting them or not, they will engage in a very well animated fight causing huge damage to them in many cases! You will notice so many details that many developers would overlook in AAA gaming in this title and I have to applaud Capcom.The largest complaint I have is that this title does require a powerful computer and can be harsh on lower end hardware. Other than that I can say that late game is very grind heavy, however, it is still fun. Lastly is that event quests are timed, so you can do them during certain periods, which are announced on Capcoms website, or during the larger quarterly celebrations. Nevertheless, most of the complaints I have are very small and not with griping over.With Iceborne coming out this year, there isn't a better time to start preparing for the upcoming Master Rank, (this titles equivalent to G-Rank.) 1st fleet or 5th fleet you will not regret this purchase. I cannot tell you how much you are missing out on an amazing experience if you do not try this game. In my point of view this is one of the best games of the last decade if not all time."
4447,Woozie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silopjah/,3,,1,280.2,April,"6,",222,0,1,"Monster Hunter: World is an amazing game that will keep you busy for many hours. The game has a well-balanced mix of both intriguing adventure and fun gameplay, that you can share with up to 3 other players.All locations are unique and the ecosystem and design never fails to impress, and even after many hours of playtime there are still a lot of monsters and new small places to discover. The gameplay feels like a genuine RPG game with moderate grinding that does not feel like you have a second job, unlike some other games. There are 14(!) weapon categories, of which 9 are melee, 3 are ranged and 2 are a sort of hybrid (mostly melee though). Each category has countless of weapon types with different upgrade paths and element types. Each weapon category has its own special ability, and each category is overall relatively hard to master. The abundant amount of categories means that it is very hard to become bored of the gameplay, as there is always something new to try.The story is pretty good, however it is not a masterpiece, which is understandable, as the focus of the game is the gameplay. It builds very much on mystery, which keeps your interest if you are eager to discover new monsters and locations. The graphics of the game are not the best of this generation, however, it is still a beautiful game as the style fits very well. The UI is pretty and has acceptable funcionality. However, it is obvious that the game originally was designed for consoles, so it is not the most comfortable UI to use with keyboard and mouse. The same goes for keybindings, which can be awkward at times and sometimes illogical. It is possible to play with keyboard and mouse, but if you are unlike me and are comfortable with controllers it would be recommended to use. The audio and soundtrack is very good, and really enhances the experience, especially during large battles, giving an epic feeling.It is hard to find any flaws that impacts the experience in a major way, however, there are many that report gameplay breaking network issues when playing with others. I have experienced some issues, but they have not broken the game for me personally. Overall the game is incredibly fun, and the gameplay, theme, story, graphics and sound combined delivers a memorable experience that you want to keep playing, making Monster Hunter: World a game I can definitely recommend.----To add; the Iceborne expansion released in 2020 is a very nice addition to the game, and adds dozens of hours of content, for example a new base & map, new story, and many more additions that definitely are worth getting. Basically just improving an already great game. If you loved the base game, you should definitely get this expansion!"

This game really is a hit or miss and it depends entirely on what you want out of this game. This game truly is Boss Fight: The Game. 30-50 minute long missions, and all you do is fight large boss monsters, kill them, carve materials off them to craft stronger gear so you can be prepared to fight even tougher monsters. The controls might be a turn off to some people, if you see game-play footage and think that it might feel something like dark souls you'll be disappointed. Attacks lock you into the animation and make you stay committed to the attack you decide to do, not all attacks can be dodged, and not all attacks can be blocked. Weapons have a surprising amount of complexity and each feel unique and interesting to play. One of the few games I ever purchased full price and was worth it for me.One thing I should note is that many people do have connection issues, mostly disconnecting from sessions mid-mission which hasn't been full resolved at the time of writing this review.(I still experience this myself)"
4449,Fugazi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041692928/,2,,1,521.9,April,"10,",762,0,1,"Monster Hunter World brings an interesting twist to the franchise, modernising a series that have often controlled relativily stiff and introducing many new mechanics. Movement is more free and things like gathering have been simplified to a buttonpress when passing by. The maps are wide and open, cutting out a large portion of loading times that used to be a series staple. Very few quests are centered around killing small monsters, gathering or transporting items. Which overall lets you spend more time hunting large monsters.These changes are all welcome and help introduce more people to the game. That's all cool.I did notice some flaws compared to the older games though. Many of the newer monsters look kind of uninspired and there are a lot less of them overall. The armor sets don't look as crazy as they used to be and most of the weapon upgrades look pretty boring. Almost all weapons in each tree look exactly the same except for a few details, which in a way makes more sense, but it's still more boring than it used to be. There is also no longer a separated solo and online questline. Which makes for less content but let's people chose if they want help or not for each quest. Or just lets you complete everything with a friend.Overall I problably still prefer the classic mainline games. But Monster Hunter World is still a must-have."

I'm generally against the idea of drastic changes to formulas that work really well already. It seemed silly to change so much about the game's system when previous MH games have already been so enjoyable.Those initial feelings aside, World is a great game. As a Monster Hunter game compared to the rest of the series I'd say it isn't the best out of them all however, it's still a very good entry. At its core it stays true to the hunt big monster craft nonsense to hunt bigger monster and delivers pretty much what you would expect from a MH game. Certain changes to the core gameplay are welcome as well as questionable but, overall it delivers an experience that is both enjoyable to new players to the series as well as not simplified enough to deter veterans of MH. PC launch was truly abysmal but I think now, after some time to update and tweak things, it really has come into its own."

The hammer is for you, or you are more of a long range dude? The bow guns and bow are waiting.Personally I don't have a main weapon because all of them are fun and satisfying to use.The only bad thing I can say about it is the server connection, sometimes you can get kicked out of a quest for no reason.Can't wait to play the Iceborne expansion when it comes out on january 9th.That sums my review of Monster Hunter: World, my score for it is 9/10"

I'm wasn't a great fan of the series, but I was immensely in love with one entry that really caught my attention, that was Monster Hunter Freedom Unite for PSP. From that journey on I've waited for an experience like that to repeat itself.To feel free again, in a world you could actually live and feel like you can grow, learn and be awesome! Even better, a world where you could really play along with friends, using their skills and combining the gameplay, instead of just playing alone together.This game really did it! I was very worried it would be bad as most expectations always are. But it freaked me out the level of quality of this game! It's unbelievebly good!! Monster Hunter always had these minor setbacks of having unintuitive systems or controls, but now they REALLY put an effort into making a sit and play experience. Everthing just works, and you still get to enjoy the bliss that is surpassing real challenge! You begin really easy for all ages and backgrounds to get a grasp of it, and then it begins to gradually present you with difficulty, challenge and the wide-range of progress possibilities that really hooked me on the series before!It has Meaning! This game is awesome because it is meaningful! Not in the story, not in the cutscenes, but the gameplay itself. The story that no one is telling, the environment, the monster that you have to study, the plans you need to make to hunt! The strategies you can arrange with friends! The living ecosystem you experience, where everything feels alive, and monsters interact with each other, plants and resources laying around make sense, and you can intuitively discover where the herb you need would be just by looking at the environment.They tried a story/cutscene strategy on this game, that wasn't even necessary. I even consider it one of the mistakes of the game. The world is so awesome and alive and immersive that you don't need cutscenes, so they become a bit boring. Also they get in the way of playing a campaign co-op a bit. Because you must first watch the cutscene alone, then go the your friend's ""adventure"" to join and kill the same monster.In the end this is a masterpiece, if you have the chance and money, play it!You will not regret it!"

I remember seeing my friend playing an earlier installment in the series on his PSP years ago and wanting to get into it since. After nearly 500 hours, I think I'm qualified to say that this installment is fantastic for introducing you to the series. This is not to say, however, you need to invest 500 hours to learn how the game works! The vast majority of that time was not spent understanding all the core mechanics but just having fun running the item treadmill, farming crowns for achievments, doing Kulve Taroth sieges, and trying to become the best Long Swordsman I could be. You might want to spend your time across several of the 14 weapons if staying with one weapon is a stale experience for you.Also good news for PC users that didn't have consoles to dive into MonHun is that keyboard and mouse works just fine! If you don't have or would rather not play with a controller, there is no need to worry. Although, just a bit of a nitpick, I feel certain moves would be more accurate with an analog stick rather than WASD keys - I may have slightly whiffed on some Spirit Helm Breakers with my Long Sword due to the keyboard limitation of 45 degree increments for input. On the flip side, I'm certain ranged weapons like the Bow, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun are massively more accurate and responsive with the keyboard and mouse as opposed to a controller so you might prefer those weapons if you really dislike controllers.On the surface, Monster Hunter seems incredibly simple - it's a just a game where you hunt monsters. However, as you scratch the surface you'll find tons of little intricacies to the design of the levels, the monsters, monster movesets, your weapon's moveset, how parts of the environment work, how your items can be used in multiple ways, and even how to make full use of the Canteen for food buffs. This is a game well worth your time and money, especially as Capcom doles out more free content to the PC. Please don't be intimidated if you've never played a Monster Hunter game before - the single player campaign's (which you can play with others if you desire) difficulty builds up at a reasonable pace, doesn't expect too much from you in the beginning, and you're certain to find a weapon you're comfortable with.My personal game of the year for 2018 and has turned me into a Monster Hunter fan - I'll probably end up getting one of the portable games now so I can play more and not just spend my time reading wikis and forum discussions."

4490,FinallyLoading,https://steamcommunity.com/id/goodinternetonly/,3,,1,"1,194.2",November,"10,",44,0,1,"MHW is a great game, in specifics the music is great to listen to, the varities of weapons allows players to satiate their playstyles or combat against certain monsters, though I do warn you that using certain weapons will slow your pace to unbearable speeds, if used to more... faster paced games.Combat is simple two button type attack and combine both for special moves and more various options in the hunter notes, rolling is different from Dark Souls, thing is you're not completely invinsible while doing so, however there will be things to improve that later, you can evade by dropping to the ground by upequipping your weapon with a running start and roll button, this will dodge almost every attack while doing so but will leave you severely opened if used to openly as there is a large window of hurt waiting for you.Jump attacks allow mounts to force monsters to fall over allowing ample time to do heavy damage. Ledges and quick climb walls(walls with serration that allows footing to climb) and sliding are one of the ways to jump attack, though in sliding some weapons are much more effective form of DPS for certain weapons (Hammer heheh spin2win). Certain weapons like the Insect Glaive, Sword and Shield, and the Switch Axe can perform mounts without those terrains which can open up various playstyles.Yet I've want to say for the bad parts of the game is when going in the game your first time without any knowledge will give you a bad time, as there's a metric loads of things you can do initially, however when you do get in touch with all these new info you have to do certain optional quest that are important for unlocking more stuff in the game and I wish they separated as requests than optionals, though don't worry, there's not many and isn't really insane hard.Another rather annoying part is unskippable cutscenes, I admit it's good and it gives you things to understand the storyline of the game, but it gets really long, that's a thing you should brace for when you play this game, but it's a good cutscene so I'll let it ""sorta"" pass, though I have to say that they should allow skipping if using another character slot.Last is the fact that there's other things that the game doesn't tell you and the community knows is something to know so I hope you're in for watching guides of mechanics in the game.Conclusion, game's great and enjoyable though controls are questionable tbh as it's more favored to controllersUPDATE: IB EditionSuper Late on the update but I decided to add into the new things and last patches,First of all the Clutch Claw finally gets a skill to improve its annoying mechanic of tenderizing (albeit it's been at least a year since IB launch it has come from many complaints) but hey, it got a skill to improve it in October 1st 2020. SnS got a mega buff, HH got new things and GS, LS, CB can now use slinger burst mid combo which is really nice.Negatives are the fact 2 skills are nerfed(Wex & Max Might) but a new skill rose up to the table as Monsters are now enraged longer making Agitator really stronk.IB progression of completing the storyline will be a long haul as this means raising region lvs and MR to reach 99 to finally get access to most of augments and goodies you would normally get from Tempered investigations in base world. But at least the Augment system is much better as Base World's Augment system makes few choices of modification for higher rarity which in turn made Rarity 6 Gunlances better than rarity 8 for long due to extra augments. Although Higher Rarity Weapons have less slots, you can do more than slot 1 augment at least so that's a good improvement.However the more recent title release monsters are far more..... Difficult to deal with when you're fresh outta Story(which for some reason min MR req is that low). Especially Alatreon, despite its negative view of its Damage Check, I think Alatreon's moveset is quite forgiving yet painful if you do get hit. window of evasion is far easier than most monsters which makes it a really interesting hunt(only gripe for me is how it stays in the air for a longass time)Meta:Weapon choices? Not alot as Safi/Brachy/Kjarrs are prevalent HOWEVER, with new weapon reskin augments you can make it look like certain weapons making the aesthetics more appealing.Armor is the same scenario of few armors are useful, but a bit more flavor of choice unlike Base World's Master Touch/Spare Shot because everything else didn't offer much. Game can eventually get repetitive as after all it is about hunting monsters, and players tend to lean towards Siege, Kulve, and Alatreon. But so far it's a nice addition(albeit it's another 50$+ spent but I guess it's ok)"

The players throwing negative reviews though have valid issues about the game being CPU intensive or complaining alot about minor frame drops need to understand the game is being rebuilt especially for PC so obviously it wont be running perfectly smooth on LAUNCH DAY or maybe anytime soon but it will be fixed and even with the minor frame drops from above 60 when the diehards for Monster Hunter should already be used to 30 fps the game is still worth it to play.

Having stated that one problem that most people have so far with the game, the game is still playable, be it for veterans or for new players to the franchise looking for a challenge in hunting the very well designed monsters solo. But if you plan to play the game with friends or if you are just looking for that multiplayer experience while running through the game, I wouldnt recommend it at the moment until Capcom, MH:W devs, and steam fixes the connection issues. The only reason why I gave this game a thumbs up is because I myself played the game solo for most of the parts and had a ton of fun. Another thing that I was kinda disappointed of the game, is some of the monsters just feels copy and pasted, from movesets with slight changes and aesthetics that shares the same base model, hopefully future dlc's would include either old or new monsters that would fit well in the new worlds environment. Now lets talk about the maps, I have nothing but praise in how the devs just made the environment look so organic and alive, given that there are only 5 maps in the game currently, lets just hope that the devs adds more in the future. So I highly recommend buying the game, even though its multiplayer features isn't fixed yet, you can just wait and buy the game when it does get fixed which will be pretty soon since the devs have already addressed the issue and are already working on it."

During all of my hours in-game me and my brother have been disconnected maybe twice.

All the weapons Ive tried to far feels good (Switchaxe, longsword, dual blades, Heavy bowgun and insect glaive). Hits feels good and rewarding.Tracking is fun, grind is good.

For instance, an expanded upon version of the fourth gen mounting system, the slinger to traverse the land faster, and maps without load zones.I'll be entirely honest, i've been lucky as far as critical errors are concern. I've only had one crash through the course of low rank to high rank. My PC is mid to high teir and hasn't had any troubles running the game itself. FPS drops if at all are very infrequent and only happen in moments of high particle intensity. It is worth noting if your playing this game for a story, you probably should just not. Its got one, but really its just a vessel to show you a few monsters and get you into the meat of the game, like the real meat, the well-done meat. None of that rare ♥♥♥♥.Is this a fantastic port? No, however, it's a damn good monster hunter game, and a spectical to play. Beautiful maps, engaging combat, and more grinding than you could ever ask for.

Connectivity issues have been corrected, new content is forthcoming, and things are coming along smoothly. I'm sad it took the better part of a month after release to correct it, a month which saw all of my friends beating the game independent of each other, but at least we can finally join up and enjoy things now.Having that said, this is a gorgeous game with a widely-varied and well-balanced cadre of amazing weapons, all of which have their own play style and functions in combat. Items are meaningful and managing your resources mid-combat is both challenging and easy to do, with a control system that is tight and easy to understand. The game doesn't explain every mechanic to you, so at least some of the game is going to require experimentation and discovery, which can be daunting when you consider how much you have to hunt to get some items. However, going by the console release, there's only more amazing things on the horizon with MHW, and I'm sure you will love it. Just bear in mind that the ""tutorial"" is going to last you the entire length of your refund window, if you have any reservations. Just saying.______________________________________________________I'm going to preserve my (750+ helpful rating) previous review here, for posterity, and to encourage Capcom to think twice before releasing a game in this state again:I've purchased this game twice. I bought it for PS4, and fell in love with it. There were little disconnects here and there, but I assumed that was an issue with the stability of the console and my wi-fi internet. For months, I enthusiastically sold the game to my friends on the promise of that fun, and when they agreed to purchase it for the PC, I was ecstatic, because it meant I'd get to share it with them.I bought a second copy for PC, so I could join them on their adventure. We joked around about the unskippable cutscenes and the mandatory, slow tutorial. I listened as they plowed through the first missions, so they could get to the point where the game started letting them team up together and, when we all finally got together for our first group hunt, we endeavored to launch a mission as a squad.Oh, wait, squads don't exist on PC. You have to ♥♥♥♥ around with Steam Groups. Finally got that figured out? Bam, disconnect. Restart the mission. Bam, error code 503820-MW1, gotta rejoin a public session with my friends. Wait, now your friend hosting the session isn't showing on the ""friends' sessions"" list. Gotta restart the session. Someone still isn't seeing it, have them host instead. Their game crashed, everyone loads back in, finally groups up, and launches the mission. Bam, another disconnect. And another. And another. And another. And another.I'm 54 hours into this game over the last two weeks and I've finished less than a half-dozen hunts with my friends. Most of the time, everyone gets kicked out of the session, and you have to finish the battle alone against a monster that has scaled up to 140% extra health vs 4 players. Lag, disconnects on a wired connection, hosting issues, and networking problems galore have plagued me since buying this title on PC. I've disconnected more times in two weeks on PC than I ever did in 8 months of PS4 gameplay. Several of my friends have beaten the game by themselves, and are waiting for the game to be fixed so we can do something, ANYTHING, together. And to think... Capcom took an additional 8 months to release on PC because they wanted to ensure the game was ""optimized and delivered in it's best possible version.""Monster Hunter World is a brilliant game, when it works, but it is marred by constant and persistent stability issues, time-wasting unskippable cutscenes and credit sequences, occasionally unfair monster behavior (Pink Rathian perma-charging and Kirin lightning RDM, I'm looking RIGHT at you), and an absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of networking errors that have yet to be resolved after 8 months of preparation and two weeks of the game being released. Toss in Denuvo DRM (seriously, ♥♥♥♥ DRM), issues with Big Picture/Steam Overlay that almost require you to DISABLE TWO CORE COMPONENTS OF STEAM in the platform settings, and the fact that Capcom has only issued a blanket statement about ""investigating the issues"" with no follow-up over the last few weeks, and you have a recipe for an avalanche of continuing problems with no time frame for correction.I'll change this review later if it's fixed, *maybe*... but for now, give this game a pass. Capcom isn't taking it seriously, so why should you?"

4533,Chances,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChancesRat/,3,,1,417.8,August,"22,",288,0,1,"So as someone who's never played the Monster Hunter series, I went in blank slate with no idea what I was getting into. Highly recommended by friends, strongly not recommended by many in the reviews, I had to wonder if this game was worth the asking. After nearly 40 hours of play time, I'm going to say 'It's worth a buy.' Mind, a few notes and things to consider before you do.TL;DR - I would recommend this game to folks, there are technical issues this game is handling and is coming with patches, but if you can work past it or willing to wait, its worth it.Pros:+ Beautiful Graphics+ Great Soundtrack+ Solid Gameplay + Varied approaches to your hunts+ Many, Many choices on gear and setups+ Varied and complex regions to hunt inCons- Awkward keybinds for K/M, clearly normally meant for Controller (Being patched)- Connection issues (pending patch going to fix)- Finding friends to join the same session can be irksome- Some unexplained game mechanics- Jumbled inventory system- A few AI BugsFor those of you who's played Dark Souls, you'll feel right at home. Each monster is a challenge unto itself. They're large, wild, where you need to learn their behaviors, learn what weapons meet the challenge the best, and plan accordingly. But all the monsters have multiple directions to be approached, and a huge selection of moddable and craftable weapons to chose from to tackle the challenge. Mind, this is not your standard hack n' slash, you will need to learn how each weapon functions, as going in swinging with one could end with you ending up wide open for a Monster to send you flying against the cliff face for a mistimed swing. Greatswords are huge, slow swinging beasts that do large damage, but need to plan your swings, or the dual blades where you have to learn to dance around your prey to whittle it down. All viable, but all need planning. Mind, it has a steep, but fair learning curve, be prepared to take your hard knocks till you finally figure out how to tackle your challenge best.Story-wise, it is clear they made a story purely focused on convincing you to move forward with progression, but not much else. A poorly lip-synched, barely worth understanding tale of the 5th Fleet of Monster Hunters coming to the New World to solve the mystery of the Elder Dragon migration. However, in the end, it putters along barely giving you the sense of urgency as you realize you're short two monster fangs to craft up your armor ... story can wait, back to the hunt. It all is just a backseat item to the real meat of the game...Kill monster, carve monster, make their bits into gear, kill more monsters. The system is not much more difficult to understand than that, but in turn, you're given a huge selection of weapons and armor, foregoing the usual stats and levels. Weapons from the beastly greatswords, the defensive lance and shield, the tactical and nimble insect glaive, even to hard hitting ranged Bowguns. Up to 14 different weapons to choose, all with their own tech and crafting branches to make the right tool for the job. Armor as well plays a big role as each set comes with its own bonuses and upgrade options that'll let you tackle challenges while negating the risks in the field from monster and environmental hazard alike.Along for the ride is the game’s companions, the Palico, a feline anthropomorphic character you can gear up slightly. While seeming mostly cosmetic, the Palico is more that cuteness and advertisement for the game, geared with unique tools, the Palico can help in fights with some damage output, healing, and other utilities to assist in your adventure, as well as help you call in assistance from local wildlife, by taming smaller monster beasts, to even getting in touch with indigenous Feylines who you can recruit along for your hunts. While not a major part of your arsenal, the Palico is a fun and helpful companion to make up for the lack of teammates, up till you have 3 hunters on the team. Afterwards, your Palico will faithfully wait back at camp, as you can only have them out with one other hunter, and no more.The graphics of the game, while demanding, are immersive and breathtaking, from the details of the monsters themselves, down to the foliage around you creating the lush canopy of green in the Ancient Forest, to dust covered, jagged plains of the Wastes and many other environments which changes up the strategy of approach and gear when exploring these lands. But with these great environments comes an impressive soundtrack to accompany you from just generally exploring out into the wilds, to the wild drums of the hunt as you’re toe to toe with your quarry, often falling into subtle tones as the beast runs of while you make chase, only to pick up again in intensity as the fight resumes. Weapons also come with satisfying impact, as every bladeswing, strike, and shot brings a satisfying sound of contact, even missing your swing still gives way to the sound of just how heavy and powerful your weapon is as it hits the earth, letting you know you’re playing with big toys, not whiffle bats.The game does have a few issues to its performance for seamless gameplay. For one, if you prefer keyboard and mouse like me, you’ll find that the binding options are a bit awkward to handle, as one keybind could have multiple uses, and that Ranged / Melee / and Menu have separate keybinding setups, some of which change on you when in the field or in the trading hub. Another issue is finding your friends to connect to, setting up sessions is easy enough, but finding and getting into a friends session can be problematic. Steam friends list can alleviate this a bit, but the need to trade Session codes still feels a bit archaic in today’s multiplayer world. Another issue is the inventory system, which is clearly still designed for console players, but for PC, the translation is a bit jarring and jumbled, having to deal with odd commands from different keys just to swap and deploy items, though to alleviate this, it gives options for ‘restock’ which can resupply your consumables from your Item Box to your inventory as long as you have it available. Lastly, he game tutorials can come up lacking, ending up glossing over key elements that would have sometimes been considered very important for progression seem to have been forgotten to mention, or are mentioned at much later times after the element of the game really could have been useful earlier.The game does come with its share of flaws, as well. While Capcom has acknowledged these are issues they are looking into resolving, you do run into several issues regarding connections with companions, mouse input issues, and even a few performance issues. Patches are incoming, so if you prefer to avoid as much frustration as possible, give it a few weeks for those to patch out. The game is also not very friendly to lower end gaming PCs, often running with frames per seconds to agonizingly slow rates that can make the game difficult to play, so if you’re interested in MWH, consider upgrading your PC, or at least give some time or patches to optimize the system.All in all, Monster Hunter World is delivering on its promise to bring a beautiful, amazing world with fun, yet challenging mechanics and a good time hunting gargantuan monsters with an array of tools at your disposal.PC Details:nVidia 980 GTXi7 Processor16 GB DDR4 RAM"
4534,Wedran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wedran1054/,4,,0,165.7,August,"19,",288,1,1,"Firstly, it's a bad port, with mouse issues, massive performance and optimization issues, lack of graphical options, a lot of connection problems, and the fact that the game corrupts your save data if it ever crashes, it's pretty laughable after taking half a year longer to ""get the port right"". It also uses Denuvo Anti Tamper, known for causing performance issues, and being generally anti-consumer.Secondly, the game itself is by far the worst mainline Monster Hunter game. This stems from a couple of issues. Casualization disguised as quality of life changes, lack of monsters, the open world map design, and specifically catering to the western audience.Picking up herbs, mushrooms and honey with one click while being able to move is a QoL change, the radial menu is a QoL change, auto-crafting is a QoL change. World allows you to access the Canteen and your full item and equipment boxes in a hunt. You will never have a hunt where it comes down to the wire, your potions and items expended, the monster close to death, your heart racing because it's do or die. You can simply farcaster back to a camp, fully resupply again, and go back out. If you went into a hunt unprepared or in wrong gear, you can just change it whenever. A big part of Monster Hunter was learning the monster you were hunting and preparing for the hunt ahead, but now you can just bruteforce any hunt in the game by carrying a farcaster and going back to camp. That is not a QoL change, it's a change to the core of the game, making it easier.Moving while drinking a potion is again, a change to core gameplay, not a quality of life change, and again, it completely breaks the game because if you're burning a little bit of stamina, you can move pretty quickly, allowing you to dodge attacks while healing.Some weapons have become ridiculously overpowered and easy to use purely because they were made ""less clunky"". Prime example of this is the fact that the greatsword got the shoulder tackle move which you use to get out of a charged slash if you're about to get hit or miss your attack. The tackle gives you super armor, reduces the damage you take, and skips one step towards your big damage attack WHILE doing KO damage to the monster if you land a hit on the head and staggering some monsters out of attacks. You don't have to worry about proper positioning or openings to put out damage, since you can just mindlessly charge, and tackle if the monster takes a swing at you, and come out better for it. The Bow now has infinite Short Range coatings, because again, preparation and management of supplies doesn't matter in this game.There are no negative armor skills in the game. There are no point thresholds you have to pass to activate a skill anymore. You either do have a skill or you don't, meaning your armor has no actual downsides, other than resistances. You can make mixed sets that absolutely break the game with how ridiculous their skills are, and have no downside for it.The game allows you to craft charms, but the much more important decorations are pure RNG drops, meaning you might as well quit now, if you're obsessive about optimizing your sets and gear.The game has a serious lack of monsters, clocking in at only 34 large monsters (on console, with all of the DLC), and the monsters in the game are too easy. Now, I'm not good at Monster Hunter, I never was, but this game is a breeze. All the way from the first time you body the Great Jagras in under 8 minutes, to the literal final boss, who is about as difficult and complex as that Great Jagras with an inflated health pool. Even the monsters that return from previous MH games feel slower and less dangerous. Simply compare the Barroth or Diablos from World to their equivalents from older games if you don't believe me.The new monsters are either generic throwaway lizards, that are slow and have one actually threatening attack, fast and interesting to fight, but don't do enough damage and don't have enough health (Tobi-Kadachi and Odogaron), or just plain annoying, like the Bazelgeuse the devs constantly shove in your damn face as soon as you hit high-rank. Even the flagship Nergigante is just an overgrown Diablos that can't burrow, but has a big boy slam attack that he telegraphs for a full second before doing it.Hell, the monsters will take themselves out with environmental traps, status toads, standing under obvious traps practically begging you to hit them or by having some other monster driveby the monster you're fighting before it runs off. (I'll get to the driveby monsters in the map design section)Yes, I know I didn't count the ""Tempered"" or ""Arch Tempered"" monsters. That's because they're not real content. They're artificial difficulty disguised as content. They're the exact same monsters as their regular version, except they just do more damage. What even is the point? They aren't fun to fight. They're just annoying because it's the exact same monster you've already fought, but you just have to heal more, or get oneshot in the case of Arch Tempered monsters.Oh hey, map design. The Ancient Forest is a realm of nightmare and pain. Doubly so when fighting a Rathalos or Rathian. The maps are just bloated, The Ancient Forest is a mess of levels, tunnels, passages, climbable vines, inbetween levels, etc.. Combine this with Rathaloses and Rathians running from the top to the bottom of the big tree, or the middle, or anywhere on the map, and you'll just get confused. The big issue is the fact that the scoutflies don't always work like they're supposed to, or the monster moves to another part of the map while you're halfway climbing the tree and the scoutflies don't update fast enough. They disappear when you enter combat, but the game's definition of ""in combat"" is finnicky, so you'll be stuck without Scoutflies for up to a minute sometimes, and good luck finding your way around the forest withou them.Wildspire Wastes and the Coral Highlands are generally OK maps, but they have a lot of wasted space. The Rotten Vale has an entire level dedicated to a throwaway bootleg Uragaan fight, and the effluvium map hazard gets annoying after a while.The Elder's Recess is hell on earth. The map is way too small and interconnected for the amount of monsters it spawns at once, plus it spawns monsters that just love to go roam the map. If you're doing a non-elder dragon hunt, you'll get interrupted by some other monster three to five times per hunt. Here comes the bazelgeuse, and here's Azure Rathalos, then there's Uragaan, oh and here's Bazelgeuse again, and that's Rathalos, etc., repeat to infinity. I've had a Bazelgeuse run into a room with three other monsters and just chill in the middle of it for a good five minutes.To finish it all off, the game lacks the character of the previous entries. Most of the weapons in the same category look samey and almost all of the joke weapons like the Tigrex Tank, Felyoshka or the shark lance are gone, and I doubt they're ever coming back. The damn Handler is an ugly bint, and all of the cutscenes are unskippable. As it's own game, it's not awful, it's alright even. But seeing as you can emulate and play both MH Freedom Unite and MH Portable 3rd on PC, on any toaster, with no issues at all, AND play them online with your friends over PPSPP, I don't see the point of buying or playing this game."

English is not my mother language and therefore I haven't mastered it yet. Moreover, this is my first review. Let's just start.I have played  (PSP),  (Wii) and also  on Xbox. That gives me i.m.o. the possibility to evaluate wether this game is better or worse than other MH-Games. The gameplay starts a bit slow for my likings, but speeds up rather fast after 1-2h of playtime. Other then in older MH-Games, you miss the feeling of freedom, when choosing a quest. That is, because you can't choose. In MHW, you follow a linear questline to complete the Main Story. Side quests do exist, but there is actually no need to complete them. This does not mean, the story is boring. I saw flashing scenes and funny stuff. Exploring the world(s) of MHW has never felt that good. The whole enviroment looks lively and dynamic. In addition to that you can use the world its elements to defeat monsters. The 14 different weapon types have a decent balancing and offer huge differences in gameplay. (BTW. The hunting horn is NOT a support weapon)I've read many many review complaining about how bad this game is ported. Actually these people are a little bit whiney. I mean the game has just released and therefore it's just normal to not work perfect. I have never had any connection issues. I was neither kicked out of a lobby nor from a quest. Also the game was just released. Give them some time to react on the release-bugs and gather some more hours to judge the game. I saw people reviewing with less then 1h played. How can people think they know much about this game?Well, not much to say. The game gives information about what is needed to play this game.Just don't play on a potato.Okay. I have to say this game is not cheap. But for this game, i have waited so many years. I would pay 100€ without wasting a thought about that. I am of the opinion that they chose the right price for this masterpiece.All in all, I can say it is worth buying. You have many hours of story, even more hours of endgame and a gorgeous world to play in. 10/10. Best Monster Hunter Game.Thanks for reading!"

You don't stand still after every attack with the heavier weapons and you don't have to flex after drinking a potion, I know that some veterans do not like this, saying that it takes away from the challenge (and I see their point), but I just consider these things a quality of life improvement. That being said, this is probably the easiest game of the series.The game also loads extremely fast on PC so that's a plus.The multiplayer here works flawlessly for me and anytime I got a connection error it was because of my own internet. This game is almost certainly more fun with a friend, or three.I would highly recommend that you play this game, especially if you want to get into the Monster Hunter series, as this is by far the best starting point."

I waited until this game came out on PC to buy and play and it's been a blast. There are some issues with it, but the developers are addressing them and hopefully they fix it in an update soon. The biggest issue is with multiplayer at the  moment and from reading other reviews that seems to be the biggest reason why everyone as a negative review on it. I love playing this game with people, but I enjoy going solo as well so I am giving it a positive review based on the fact that they are going to fix the current issues. Another minor thing that isn't a game breaker, but is annoying, is that the voice acting is not in sync with the lips of the character models. This game kind of ""dumbs down"" some of the mechanics of the old games, but it isn't too bad. Some veteran players may not like it, but it is all in a matter of opinion.

Capcom took almost every stressful quality of prior games and just improved them either slightly or copiously. The main change is the semi-open world aspect, where the zones are no longer separated by load screens. I could go on all day about how this game is amazing. However, let's talk PC port now. Compared to consoles the PC port has exceeded all expectations with:More than triple faster loading times (And that's only between getting sent off to quests, the only noticeable loading times are after cutscenes!)A higher framerate at a higher resolutionIncreased graphicsThe freedom to use the keyboard and mouse or a controller based on user preference.

World is the most casual and easy to get into the seiries has ever been so now is a great time to try it out.Edit 7/14/2020:Now with Iceborne out, I can't recommend this game enough. Iceborne has brought back a lot of the classic Monster Hunter feeling while also providing a more substantive and challenging addition to the base game. The game is in the best state its ever been and I literally cannot tear myself away from it.If you're noticing the massive spike of negative reviews, a new monster was released that is very difficult. Due to some confusion about the mechanics of the fight many people think that you need extremely specific builds to beat it. This is not true and the monster can be beaten with a decently large variety of builds with some relative ease once you learn the fight enough."

I play it single player so I don't have any co-op issues and I use a mouse and keyboard and I gotta say, it's still playable M+KB even without raw mouse input but the thing that irks me is un-bindable keys. You have an item bar that you have to scroll through to get to items and they cannot be bound to specific keys. It makes it incredibly clunky and it detracts your attention from the fights.However I am still going to recommend it because It is still an incredibly rich and detailed world to explore and the monster fights are intense and exciting. I don't think any of the major port issues stop me from enjoying this title. It just needs a few hotfixes to get it up to standards."

Coming from someone fairly new to the series, 60 hours in on writing this but expecting an endless amount more. I'm not going to address any of the launch issues or bug it currently has with the new Steam UI because I expect it to be resolved sooner or later so I don't see much point in judging the game or the devs for it.The game in itself is absolutely great and a blast to play either solo or with friends. Fans of the genre will most likely enjoy it thoroughly and MH fans or veterans have probably already played it on PS4 to know what it's about. It runs well on PC, loading times are almost non-existent (though it can depend on your rig) and the general performance is just stellar. I haven't tried playing with Keyboard/Mouse but some people might prefer it as it may offer more ease for navigation or ranged weapons.Update-wise, the PC version is behind on console but will get them eventually as free updates in the same fashion as consoles did. Which is something to be commended in this day and age.There's actually so much fun stuff you can do in the game and the littlest of detail they have put in it makes the game so much more enjoyable and perfect for me. I doubt I could write it all down in one Steam review, and I won't bother trying. I've played the game for almost 60 hours so far and am nowhere close to being done with this game.I'm enjoying every little bit of it but it has to be said that to fully enjoy it, you have to appreciate the hunt, weighty combat and the grind of it all. Cause as much as I would praise this game and say that any cons are heavily outweighed by the pros, it's not for everyone. If you're looking for a rich story you might be better off elsewhere, but if you just want to hunt big bad monsters in rich and lively environments, then it's definitely worth a try. The game is more than worth it's pricetag for what it is.Autumn Sale Edit: 400+ hours in, still great."

They have to go to a specific NPC to join your game despite the invite.I found the menu system and the online play with friends so frustrating I found myself having to take a breather after every quest. It would say one of us haven't progressed the story far enough to join, despite both of us going through all of the previous quests fine, then starting the quest solo to find out there was a 6 second cutscene, but then being stuck in that quest so having to go back to town to then join the same quest you were just on but with your friend... who is still in the same online session as you the whole time...Yeah it makes as much sense as typing that whole thing out did.Thumbs down for just pure frustration.

There is one BIG Minus that literally almost made me not recommend this game, but if you have enough patience to get through the big minus then you should definately get this game.POSITIVES+The co op (When it works) is friggin amazing, the gameplay of MHW is the best I have ever seen, especially ranged weapons now.  Capcom learned from Dragons Dohma with the feel of the bow and mounting, and it feels amazing.+Watching monsters fight each other in the wild is the greatest thing I have ever seen, the trailer doesn't give justice to the ""oh ♥♥♥♥"" moment when you see a monster pick up another monster and slam him into the ground.NEGATIVES- (The BIG minus) As someone who primarily plays Monster Hunter games for the multiplayer co-op, I have to ask Capcom, why do you have to try and meld the singleplayer and multiplayer campaign together?  There would be no trouble if you were able to play story missions together from the beginning, but you have to launch and then quit after you've finished the cutscene just to relaunch the mission if you want to play with friends. <sidenote> Capcom should be able to at least know how to put multiple people in the cutscene, or instead just show the one player in the cutscene, when you're in the party together.  Capcom should know this, because they literally have monster intro cutscenes in previous games like MH4U, granted, it isn't as cinematic as MHW, but they could have at least done something like that, just so it could stop the frustration with the players. The relaunching wouldn't be a problem because you can join one of your friends in the middle of the battle if you want, but there is one big problem with the connections itself.- I don't know if it is just me, but me and my friends literally a few states away sometimes cannot even join each other's session, or even mid join the mission.  Most of the time whenever we try to midjoin the mission after the friend watched the cutscene, a pop-up shows up saying it failed to join the quest.  I know MH is usually peer-to-peer, but it has never been this bad, and I hope Capcom fixes this issue.- Expeditions, they're just gathering quests but it is so hard to go on a multiplayer expedition.I still haven't made it past HR 8, so these are my earliest impressions and my biggest problems, and I do hope that Capcom fixes the servers if there is anything to fix, otherwise I hope there's something we can do to make the connection better for most people."

Been playing Monster Hunter since the 2004 release of Monster Hunter on Playstation 2. I've followed the franchise on several devices like PSP, iOS, Nintendo Wii U/3DS, and XBOX. I've played each game and haven't missed any releases. This game is in a genre of its own.Monster Hunter World is the most ambitious game in the franchise, adding complexity and an open-world feel. The first few hours of the game is explained quite well for new players, but if you're not new then you already understand how this game unfolds. There are 34 monsters in the MH:World in the console version, the PC version may lack a few but it should have several patches to add in some of the new ones, along with future ones once the PC version catches up with it's console predecessor. Each Monster has it's own attack pattern so rememeber to take a step back when engaging with one and observe it's pattern. Don't get to greedy when fighting one and dodge always! Once killed a monster, you will sheath your weapon and start skinning them for materials, you will then take those mats and use them at Astera's smithy and will allow you to craft many sets of Armor that will help you with upcoming fights. There are 14 different weapon types most of them play differently but there will be a few that might play smiliar, there should be enough to fit anyone's playstyle. Overall this game is a glorifed progression griding game. It does it well, with its awe enviroements and badass fighting mechanics. Something I want to see added from Capcom is a DLC for a High Resolution texture pack similar to what FFXV did. Not taking away anything from the graphics because the game is beautiful, but I know Capcom can do more with some of today's best computer builds."

4606,Orbee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Orbee_RT/,8,,1,244.0,August,"11,",239,0,1,"I will own up and now and say I am a huge MH fan and have been through most of the games where things weren't so streamlined and where things looked uggo. I think MHW is falling flat, gameplay wise for people in two ways and for one reason. It's accessable. MH fans might feel jarred or put off by some of the more convienient and less restrictive flow of MHW. It feels less structured and rigid than previous titles, even those with a bit of story. I was certainly thinking, 'wow, that's easier. That makes it less MH' But then there were so many systems in place that at points I felt a bit overwhelmed by new ways of doing things. All done I assume to make it more accessable to people unfamiliar with the franchise.And I think this is where newer people might come unstuck. There's a lot to take in because of this and the first few hours was tutorial based things. I am not even sure I am out of it yet. It still has the MH feel of dropping you in and letting you go despite this, which is great but also bad because newer players might not really get to the meat of the game before dismissing it. It sort of feels midground.I have had a couple crashes and one issue with online but that has been it. The online is a little confusingly done but so much better than the way it used to be, once you get your head round it, it's not so bad. Room for improvement though.It also runs... Not as well as you would hope. I have a mid tier system and it runs well enough on mid settings for it still to be a pretty game. But its not a smooth 60 experience. But coming from those 3DS days, or even PSP, I don't care.But the game play... Oh it's there alright.There is so much more to do other than slash and smash your way through a roster of monsters and this game is oozing personality in lots of subtle ways. It's great. There is a lot of content in this game, if you are willing to put the time in and learn what it's about. The combat is great on KBM, I was planning on using a controller but I actually prefer KBM. MH games have a really great combat system, with lots of subtle things and it isn't for everyone admittedly but if you are a MH fan, this title stays true but innovates enough to be fresh.The quest system wasn't what I was used to either, it feels much more RPG or MMO styled, picking up quests that aren't story based from NPCs related to what they do in regards to rewards. But it's actually a really nice change and much more immersive than 'pick from this list'.My recommendation is with caution, if you love MH you can't miss this one. If you've played MH before and thought, meh, this one might be the one to get you hooked. If you don't know if you like MH, you like hack n slash or you are expecting a Dark Souls experience tm, do lots of research before buying because it isn't for everyone and with some of the less appealing points, such as optimisation, it might not be for you."

Joining on quests with your friends feels like trying to navigate through Nintendo's online system. You have to join your friend's lobby session, then, you have to join up in their actual quest. This is if you two are within a certain level of story progress, because you cannot join friends' quests if they are further up ahead than you are. That makes sense.. but you also do not get singleplayer progress, if you two are at the same stage in the story. This means you have to do each of the missions twice, one with each person as a host. The game also does not have a high tolerance for internet outages, and you will be dropped instantly, if there are any problems. This has required me to go to the main menu and re-enter the game. Other games will just lag in the lobby for a brief second or two, but this one can drop you entirely, for very brief issues. The online coop in this game is very fun, if you actually get everything working together.-The game will outright not run at all, if you have certain older GPUs or CPUs that are still capable of playing the game at a satisfactory level. This is not an issue for me, but the fact that this is happening due to the DRM (Denuvo) is completely unacceptable. Paying customers should not be punished due to anti-consumer practices.-Unbearably awful keyboard and mouse controls. I play with a PS4 controller, but I have tried out with KB/M, and you should not do that. The game has negative mouse acceleration that attempts to emulate a joystick deadzone. Why???? The UI feels very consolized, when you use KB/M, but it does offer hotkeys for quick use of items.This is an awesome, gorgeous game with some potentially ruinous issues."

Better come back later to continue your viscious and unhindered genocide until one of the thousands of corpses drops the item that the first culling obvisously had more than enough of. This game is like Pokemon Safari, but you're the poacher. Aside from the moral questions, the game runs pretty great on my better than average rig, Servers need improvement, and mouse acceleration is awkward and impossible to get used to."

4630,BojackFragman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bojackfragman/,2,,1,27.0,August,"17,",276,1,1,"I ended up giving this game a recommendation, even though a thumbs down would have been just as valid. There are some serious drawbacks to the game: For a game that's pretty centered on coop (though you can easily solo it) it has BY FAR the worst multiplayer-system I've ever encountered. Mindbogglingly ridiculous decisions by the devs that gets you thinking if they've experienced a single online multiplayer system in the last couple of decades. On top of that there's major issues with connectivity, which means yhou'll get kicked from the online server regularly (this will supposedly get fixed shortly). Other than that, there are some weird performance issues at times, that even seriously hampers a pretty beefy system as mine (6700K and GTX1080), so a lot of people could have issues.So, why the recommendation? Well, looking past the other issues I have to say that I'm simply hooked. It starts out a bit slow, and I found myself wondering ""What's the point"" in the first few hours, as it's just one big grind. Catch/kill this monster, upgrade your gear, catch/kill the next monster, rinse and repeat. But it's just such a lovely grind somehow, once you get into it (and I'm only just getting started). I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not playing, and find myself looking up different guides and constantly changing weapons, as the 14 different weapon types are massively different from each other. It'll keep you on your toes.Another reason for the recommendation is simply that the current standing (43 % upvoted when I'm writing this) is simply not representative for the quality of the game. Try it out - you can always refund if you simply can't get past the wonky online component."

Like, my dude's, you have 200+ hours from a $60 game you enjoyed, you have no ground to stand on, unless the game is truly being made worse overtime.The game is great, if you enjoyed focused grinding and the feeling of true progression in terms of personal ability then this is for you. There's few games that have given me more satisfaction than gradually improving and going from 20-30 minute kills on monsters to 7-10 minute kills. Monster designs are fun and interesting, environments are varied, difficulty is nice and balanced, story is just there and doesn't really add anything. Network issues have seemingly been fixed, I still get randomly dc'd every so often from my sessions but I'm 99% positive that's a steam issue. The only issue I have is how slow the game is to pick up at the start, it's not a game you can just pick up and decide if it's for you or not after a couple hours of gameplay.All in all, I give it a solid MattMercerIsMyWaifu/10"

Its extremely satisfying when you do mass amounts of damage and hit combos perfectly. It's a bit of a demanding game, however, its 2019 and PC parts are decently priced. You can properly make a computer that can run it and wont make you broke. Also, controls for PC could be a bit better, however, you can rebind keys and you'll get used to it over time. Besides these minor things though, I highly recommend this game. Extremely worth it."

Just considering the idea of getting it is reason enough, but if you have friends that would get it with you or already have it, that really would be a bigger reason to buy it, since starting off with friends you can talk with via voice will really help you get into the spirit of the game more.The only thing I would like to add to keep in mind, is that it's better to just get the Iceborne expansion from the get go since besides being a proper expansion that basically doubles the amount of content, also will let you do the latest free DLC updates that will end up adding new monsters and event missions. If you want some help I am up to help anyone that requires either actual coop help or just some answers to any stuff you might still not understand how they work like in the game."

Like my dead  memes?For real though, I truly believe Capcom has an understanding of action games like no other company out there. You are a cute anime girl Hunting Monsters. Having played the PS4 version, I can say they don't look that different but even then, the game looks gorgeous. Coloful and vast locations keep the game from getting stale. You'll even catch yourself staring in awe at the jaw-dropping vistas the game has to offer. This iteration of Monster Hunter tried to focus on realism a bit more than the rest. This can be seen in the weapon designs and some armors. If you are a fan of Generations like me, this could be regarded as something bad. Though that doesn't mean there aren't some kickass weapon and armor designs. (ODOGARON <3) This is where the game shines. Basically, you fight H U G E A S S  Monsters, carve their precious parts, forge armor and equipment. Rinse and Repeat. But the process of doing it is where the fun lies. Monsters have patterns, weakspots, weaknesess to certain elements and they can even get into fights with other bigger monsters if you lead them to their den. It does make you feel like a Monster Hunter since you gotta look for footprints, mucus, carvings, etc. until you find the Monster. Since there are no levels or classes, the game allows you to change your weapon and playstyle at anytime at your base camp. Having said this, there are ""roles"" (which are not enforced in any way, this is more of a community thing) which can help a veteran party of 4 get hunts done more quickly. For example: Swords are better at cutting, so my ""job"" is to cut the tail asap. While Hammers do a hell of a lot more stun damage, so their ""job"" is to hit the head of the monster to stun them quicker. You can still get by perfectly fine without this, but I thought it was a nice little fun thing to do. GREATSWORD BOIS REPRESENT!!!!Oh and I can say with certainty that it runs extremely fine. You should turn off Volumetric fog and Ambient Occlusion if you are having FPS drops. Currently the game is experiencing some network issues, from what I could gather, not being able to join quests and lobbies and getting disconnected is normal since the game just launched. The game it's not without its flaws though. The worst offender being having to wait for the host to watch the cutscenes before the game lets you join the quest. Sometimes you need to go into the desired quest yourself, watch the cutscene, leave and finally then join your friend's quest. I don't understand why they decided to do this in the most stupid, roundabout way ever. Is it that difficult to make it so both players watch the same cutscene at the same time? Jeez...Regardless of all this, I sincerely L O V E this game. Its Game of The Year material for sure.  The end game is one of the most thrilling experiences there are. We are also getting tons of new events and monsters in the near future so be sure to look forward to that!"

Also I hit like 80-100 FPS on a i7-7700k and a GTX 1080, so no complaints. Regarding the reported mouse-input issues: yeah it is true, but why do you guys don't use a gamepad in the first place? It's like playing a flight simulator that is intended to be played with a joystick with mouse and keyboard and then complaining about how bad it feels. The argument that the devs had 9 months to perfect the port is one of the most stupid things I ever heard. 9 month in software-development are nothing, so honestly regarding the time spent on the port the devs really did a good job!To the game itself:When a game manages to get you addicted to the grind and spending hours on number crunching, you really know you like a game.

I see more people talk about it in the MHW subreddit but it rarely appears as a post like once a blue moon.-sometimes randoms will just afk at camp to leech off you fighting the monsters(usually hard ones) but its like at that point why don't you mod things in then if you gonna leech off. This is based off from what I read from MHW subreddit but it happen to me only once during a behemoth run.-sometimes the servers are bad and you disconnect from session -RNG base drops, can be really bad you might not get that one decoration you need for a build from half hour to months.-Monster hunter games and including this one pretty much don't tell you a lot of the hidden mechanics so you either need to have friend who is a veteran from previous monster hunter titles or look things up online or someone in your session tells you a hidden mechanic you didn't know of. All these hidden mechanics or stuff are like quality of life improvements in the game for you. For example, there's a lot of people don't know that you can buy an powercharm and armorcharm from the shop after you reach Hunter Rank 6 I believe. And then you can craft them with a bazel talon to get the powertalon and armortalon once you defeat your first bazelguese in high rank.  All four items are stackable with each other in your item pouch. So this gives you a significant boost into your overall defense and attack which makes a difference in your damage output and how much damage you can take from a monster.-console gets new content first so if you don't want spoilers you need to stay away from youtube videos about mhw and websites containing mhw content"

So, I went ahead and tried the game. First time booting it up was a mess, because I had a crappy laptop. Well, once I got a better one, I started gaming! First impressions of the game weren't really good, but the farther I got, I started to understand certain things as my experience grew. Despite the timeless grinding at times, or not having the hunt in your favor, it feels immensely rewarding when you finally beat that monster. And then you start growing in power, getting better gear, beating monsters easily that you have struggled with before. I for myself have not beaten the game yet, but in currently in the process of doing so.

I cannot express how much I love this game so much.  Thank you CAPCOM, for being so generous with this franchise, and polishing it to this degree.  Thank you for 15 years of dedication, and passion for developing one of the greatest games ever made.I highly recommend getting the Master Edition of the game as it comes with the Base game, and the Iceborne Expansion, with a few extras as a thank you from CAPCOM.

If you dont like these types of games there is a good chance because of how well made this game is you will start to like it but you have to give the game time to suit your likings. The mixed reviews come from the unfairness towards lower end PCs which is completely understandable. A lot of people are not fortunate enough to have high end PCs to run this game but that should not mean they can not play at low settings at a playable fps.

I love the monster hunter franchise and i was ecstatic for the opportunity to play the game on my PC. We had to wait a long time for a ""playable"" port to come to PC. The miriad of connection issues and game crashes are hard to ignore and ruin the overall experience. I have played the game on both Playstation 4 and PC the issues on PC far out weigh those on PS4. I have read we will be getting a fix soon, but the problems shouldn't have been there to begin with, or at least a day one patch. Capcom has taken too long to respond and I cannot recommend the game if you plan to play with friends as you will have issues at every turn. If you plan on playing solo and might team up with friends later down the track then I will say its a fairly decent game and it runs pretty well, however we need a texture optimization for sure to hit higher framerates.Pros -The Game Looks Beautiful and Polished.Great Keyboard and Controller Interface.Great Customisability for Keyboard Users.Bow is Drastically Better On Mouse.Cons -Denuvo DRM Not Needed In 2018 Just Hurting Legitimate Buyers.Day One Connection Issues.Little To No Communication From Devs.Game Crashes At Random Intervals.Most Controls May Require Remapping.Port Forwarding Is A Must To Even Try Online Play.I will update this review when my grievances are patched.

There's a variety of weapons with fluid reactive combat and depth (minus the dual blades with 2 main ground moves). Even so, every weapon is fun and rewarding. While I personally do not like game music, MHW does have a pretty epic soundtrack and there are some gameplay elements that incorporate the BGM. The world design is vibrant and purposeful, which leads to some inconveniences. While every major NPC and structure has a functionality, it means there's no centralize hub to do everything you need to do. You'll still have to run around and manage your resources. (IMO it's kind of immensive but I can see how annoying that can get) One of the major hurdles of this game is the steep learning curve and awkward controls implemented to the mouse and keyboard. Short answers is, if you can look pass that and enjoy the combat, you'll get use to it. That's really what it comes down to, are you willing to learn something new?"

Not having to constantly keep my whetstones stocked would probably be the first thing that comes to mind.But at the same time Monster Hunter World suffers from a few issues. It is FAR from perfect. Normally that is to be expected, but the problem is that these issues are so large that after playing the game on both PC and PS4 collectively they stick out like a sore thumb.Monster Hunter as a series has always prided itself on its unique weapon and armour design. Each monster would give you unique weapons and armour that was custom tailored to fit the theme of that monster. Any fan of the older games would know this for sure, as usually every weapon was easily distinguishable and you could tell what weapon it was at a glance.Monster Hunter World does not do this. Most weapons are a very disappointing copy paste of the original Metal and Bone weapons with monster parts simply slapped on with a bit of super glue. Which means while in previous games if you hunted a monster you would get these really sick and cool looking weapons that were unique ONLY to that monster, Capcom in this game simply hands you an ugly brown stick and says ""Welcome to the Bone Zone.""The endgame in Monster Hunter World is also tragically...fairly nonexistant. How they managed that in a Monster Hunter game is beyond me. But I think it has to do that Monster Hunter feels very shallow compared to the previous games. The previous games had HUNDREDS of monsters ready for you to poke with a sharp stick. World doesnt have anywhere near that many.Finally, the one everyone knows, the Clutch Claw. The Clutch Claw was a neat concept and cool idea but was so horribly implemented that it just completely throws the entire pace of hunts off. Making the base game hunts too easy, while making the Iceborne hunts bearable.The game is fun, but in some areas it really lacks a lot of the charm that the previous games had. It's something you should pick up on a sale, not really at full price. On the brightside, if you are new to the series Monster Hunter World is the easiest out of the series and should help you ease into the games as a whole."

Maybe a bit light, but its there and its good!+ optional quests not only improve items, chefs kitchen/eating, weapons etc but aou now can also build camps and make it easier to travel and play on a map if you prepare and buold stuff up! You ahve to travel there before and find places where you CAn tho, wich is cool in my book bc its immersive, but might annoy people. - just look up a guide then.+ the grind actually got better, like in, you-can-get-quests-wich-higher-drop-chance-better ;) Its not too easy but also not too hard wich i apprichiate, having build Rathian set for what feels like the 100th time xD+ DLC / Patches are free as always ! i love you MH devs !- since so much had to be changed / fixed and of so many improvements (grafics, better story and tied-in monsters, open world, animations and movement quality) it does not have as man monster as other titles. You dont relly feel it tho, its not that much less then it might look on the paper. Its like with Tri / MH3U kinda - judging but what i saw myself and heared i would say you still got about 300h of content, so dont worry !- DLC from console does not seem to be implemented yet (?), but i guess its okay Or you can just slay monsters and help out others, just jump an and have some team action on hard monsters (they get harder with more players ofc, but its also way more fun and the teamplay is, not counting rare hiccups, really great). Go in, do your thing if thats what you like. If you have trouble you can still decide to call fo help anytime tho-!

Thought I would drop the review anyway.I have never played any MonHun games before but this is currently the best one out there for sure. I got into the game expecting just 'hunt monsters with friends and grind' but there were so many other aspects of the game that my mind was blown. The amount of content is massive and if you wanna learn multiple weapons and master them the playtime just keeps extending.The monsters are a joy to learn, map is so rich and fun to explore and I absolutely adore my palico. Sound effects are also very ambient. I get lost just exploring map sometimes. I am not big on games that are too grindy but no 2 hunt is the same to me here and the grind never gets boring. Plus having friends too play with just adds to the enjoyment. And when you can finally pull off a cool move with any weapon man that feels so satisfying.Game is easily in my top 10 favourite games of all time. Get the DLC as well on sale it's worth every bit."

Due to the pandemic last year, I found myself a ton of time staying home where I begin to play this game. I love it! I like the combat style with the astonishing graphics. The fun comes from: 1) playing with friends. 2) challenging quests. 3) fashion and treasures hunting. There are so many ways of playing the game other than slaying monsters here and there. So many tools in hunt that allow you to develop your own hunting scheme. Most importantly, the environmental creatures, taking photos, and treasure hunting are tons of fun (I think the developer really put some efforts in these, very thoughtful)! Although I feel like a review came from me on this game is going to be super biased,  I would still recommend it to others solely because I enjoyed it a lot. And of course, games come and go, but I never regret putting all those hours in and will keep coming back whenever. Please don't feel hesitate to try!!!"

From the very beginning of the game I fell in love with it, it's so different from what I'm used to playing that I just couldn't stop playing.The gameplay sounds very basic at first, you hunt and battle monsters, but once you get used to how combat works you'll notice how much depth there really is, the learning curve is very steep, which is why I can really only recommend you this game if you enjoy how the combat feels, but nevertheless I hope you give it a chance and stick to the game until after you've beaten the main story, that is where the real game starts. It can get grindy and I usually don't like grinding, but for me the game was just so much fun, that I never had the feeling I'm wasting my time, hoping that the RNG would be kind to me this time like in other modern games.The graphics are very impressive, the attention to detail is amazing, and with the free High Resolution Patch you can get the game to look a little bit more crispy. It runs fine on my system, you just have to tweak the settings to your liking. The story, while nothing game changing is fine and I think you can get invested in it if you're already enjoying the gameplay, only real problem this game has are unskippable cutscenes, but don't worry we're on PC, Mods got your back ;)tl;drTry out the gameplay, see for yourself which weapon suits your playstyle and try to optimize your hunts (never forget you can use a lot of different and very helpful items). Once you get the hang of it the game is going to be a lot of fun, I had a blast and I hope you do too! Happy Hunting!"

If you've played previous titles you will enjoy this game, and if you're new to the series the game is very good, if somewhat difficult to get the handle of. I enjoy the fact that the devs have added so many monsters from previous titles, and keep adding more with events and free (not counting the Iceborne expansion) dlc/updates. The one major issue I have with the game is that there are several weapons in the game that just look...lazy. Many (especially for hammers) weapons and their upgrades look like they are just copy pasted variations of bone weaponry. There are still many cool looking weapons within MHW, but it feels like weapons lack the variety they did in previous titles. Luckily on PC if you feel like it, there are several mods that can change how weapons look so the problem is alleviated, if not by the devs themselves. All in all I'd say the game is fun, difficult when taking on endgame content (as it should be) and very much worth the money. 9/10P.S. Capcom where is the ability to skip all the cutscenes and ability to play with friends through the main story without them needing to see all the cutscenes first, ree"

It surely lacks of major content such as monsters and environnement. Why would they add Ice biome in a DLC instead of adding it in game directly? The previous game already had a Ice biome with quests and such in the base game. The quests in general are way too easy compared to the other games too... There is also some awckward things such as not using a Cold Drink when you are in the Desert. The multiplayer is total crap, too many network issues that gets you disconnected in the middle of a quest and they were supposed to be fixed since a long time already. I'm honestly  disappointed.

The AI for the monsters is fairly nicely timed to give a good challenge. Fun but grindy and can get a bit repetative. Best played with friends assuming all your friends can connect. Graphics : 8/10very beautiful but also rather intensive if trying to run high graphcs while in multiplayer.Performance : 6/10So many connection errors. Some to the point some of the people I know can't even play. Not well optimized port and the few patches that have happened are slow in coming.Controls : 8/10Controls are pretty simple and easy to learn.Story : 3/10Don't play this game for story. Its very weak and doesn't have much to it. Whats there also doesn't hold up very well. NPCs are often annoying too. Multiplayer / Community : 8/10Where this game really shines is in multiplayer. Its so satisfying to go in with your friends and learn together and figure out how to take down some of the fastest and toughest monsters out in the world. Especially with a group of friends that are all about the same gear level and experience its a huge accomplishment feeling to finally get the next trouble monster killed.Overall : 7/10This game can lose steam quite a bit due to connection errors and other port bugs. Its also not nearly as updated as the console release is. But for a multiplayer game its fantastic. Its a great co-op challenge for you and your friends to go take on some nice challenging fights. The grind can be a bit intense. But it isn't impossible. This game' saving grace is its multiplayer aspects.

Played thousands of hours in previous MH games and even 200+ on the PS4 version of world.If you are one who enjoys the typical well executed RPG self-feeding loop, you get gear to improve in battle, and you battle to get gear. Then this game is for you. - The gear, this is MH, the game who provides this formula that so many love, in a way like no other. You will get satisfaction on every piece you craft, and you will feel its worth. There is no ""absolute best"" gear in this game. You are encouraged to craft many sets and adapt your gear to the situations.- The battle system is amazing, one of the best (IMO the best) action battle systems. This is NOT an hack and slash. If that is what you are looking for, look somewhere else. This is an action tactical battle system. Where every single input matters. Your performance in battle will be highly dependent on how skilled you are at reading the monsters, adapting to the situations, taking advantage of the environment, choosing the right gear, and ultimately how skilled you are with your weapon.- There are 14 weapon styles and every single one of them is and feels unique. They all have their own tricks and dept to them. Even if you play the same weapon for 100h+ you can still find new hidden or non-obvious tricks that can change your play style with that same weapon, potentially improving your performance.- There are details that the game will purposely not explain. This is part of MH culture, its gonna be a bit unusual to some people, but you are encouraged to explore the mechanics and figure them out by experience.- The difficulty of the game starts low, and will gradually increase as you progress. You will encounter new monsters regularly, and some of them are bound to give you more trouble then others. This is also related to the gear mechanics I mentioned earlier. Some weapons are more suited to handle certain monsters then others, but then again, its highly dependent on your skill.The story however is poor and non-interesting, so if that's your thing, you prob not gonna have a good time.I have experience in many RPG's of many styles, and (unless your the story guy) I absolutely recommend this game.You will have an incredible immersive combat experience. And satisfaction for crafting gear like no other."

I'm using a RTX 2070, i7 9700K  16 GB Ram running on a 860 EVO  on the latest drivers that Nvidia has out. My performance so far has been a steady 60 all through out with no performance dips. Multiplayer has been steady as well. I also tried the game on a GTX 1070 Max Q, i7 7700K, 32 GB RAM 256 SSD. Ran at 60 FPS at 1080p32 Hours of play time latter, the only issues I've had so far are Multiplayer disconnection issues. I will be mid hunt on someones SOS and then lose connection. The problem is becoming more frequent. Also, when ever I fire an SOS my self, it doesn't seem anyone can join me anymore.I say it's unfortunate mostly because Iceborne is very very fun and freshens up MH:W in a way that it needed to survive as a game as a service. I'm hopeful that this game will see similar expansions in this scale in the future rather than an iteration in title entries. Sustained progress is much more favorable in my opinion, instead of starting all over again in a new game. So I'm happy the team behind this game made the decision to expand upon what is already here.TL:DR Good game gets better."
4818,Rinera,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rinera/,2,,1,"1,018.6",August,"18,",335,0,1,"This game is... annoying. Annoying because it's extremely fun to play, BUT due to silly design choices and port related bugs it leaves a lot to be desired.Let's just get the port issues out of the way. Performance is not at acceptable levels, settings menu is incomplete, kb/m controls are horrible for UI management but ironically just fine for combat, and there's a lot of disconnection issues. There's other issues as well but you might or might not encounter them so too rare to actually be mentioned.If you only cared about those few things, there you have a quick summary. But if you want a more detailed look into the actual game, grab a metaphorical drink and read the rest! Or just go look at the scores while I grab a literal drink wondering why I even wrote this. Anywho...The overall game consists of doing basically 1 thing, hunting monsters. There's some story but not even the game cares about it. But at the same time the story is simplistically stupid enough that it fits with the actual gameplay. You are a hunter who is.. well.. a hunter. It just happens that dinosaurs are still around, even bigger and literally more magical, so hunting is a serious business organized almost like an army. And that's about as far as it goes, but that's not a bad thing at all as the game attempts to build all of its details around that.From big things like the overall story, to small things like player animations, it all fits right in. For a quick example, during the opening cutscene, your character weirdly focus a bit too much on a food platter without much context. That seems completely out of place at first, but as you get to play even further and see the way your character is animated and the way they react, that starting little detail made more sense. It was a very simple way of driving in the point that you are a fully-fledged hunter, not some kind of noble hero. You are not there to find yourself or save the world or whatever, just there to do your job.It's not just your character that acts like but the NPCs as well to a certain extent. Everyone seems to be excited to be in this place full of mystery and research opportunities. Buuuut that's a hugely missed opportunity. For all the detail that went to drive in the point, your character is at the end of the day just a silent protagonist who does what they are told, at most nodding, not even ever declining anything. The NPCs start acting all friendly towards you as the story moves on, but it never feels like you want to care about what they say, of course they would start acting friendly towards the supposedly top hunter in their little organization. A few dialogue options and small side missions would have made a whole lot difference.But why would a game like that need such a thing, right? Well the game literally teases you about it. It keeps talking about your supposed bond between you and your ""partner"" and how you 2 are doing a great job and whatnot! ... Well I am mentioning her existance right now because that matters so little she might as well not be your partner but could have been a different character every time she was on screen and the story would have been the same.Ou that's a lot of words about the part of a game barely anyone cares about. Anyway, combat. It's fun, the end. Barely any complaints about the combat itself, it's the best thing about this game. Your weapons feel nice and heavy, animation quality is amazing for almost everything you or the monsters do, and there's just enough fluff like the screen shaking etc to make certain aspects feel even more impactful. You can also turn that off if it annoys you so win-win. If I were to complain about anything combat related is that the special tools you get are just boring as hell. But luckily they never become the focus, just a side thing to use if you need a bit of help.But while the part of the combat you manually do is almost flawless, the armor building is ... problematic. Not the literal crafting but picking an armorset for your needs. The meshes and textures themselves look great, with little sound details like clinging metal depending on the set you are wearing. But you can't really have the set you want because of some arbitrary passive buff system. Certain gear gives certain buffs, things like higher resistance to certain things, higher defense, immunity to stuff, that kind of thing. But they are not given to gear in a logical fashion, but springled in an almost random way. For example, a belt making you withstand monster roars better than a headpiece. That makes it partically impossible to pick the look you want AND the buffs you want. On top of that silliness going on, ""boss"" specific armor more often than not gives you benefits fighting against... that boss and that boss only. So in order to have an easier time fighting a boss you need to first keep fighting that boss to get the gear that boss gives material for, but after you got all the gear you have no reason to fight that boss anymore. It's not impossible to make kind of a build you want without having to sacrifice too much on the looks, or you can just ignore those passive benefits all together and pick the set you want, but that would be purposely putting yourself at a disadvantage.AND FINALLY, co-op and general online play. The game was clearly made to be played co-op, but it does not allow you to go through the story in co-op, meaning that you will NOT be able to play with your friends or even other random people through matchmaking until you reach the end-game where you'd have mostly everything unlocked. It also cuts the money you get after each mission if it was done with other people, straight up punishing you for playing with them. And then there's the lobby system. IGNORING disconnections, 16 people per session is not enough to do anything, and the matchamaking prioritizes ping over your progression, so you can end up in a session with everyone being too low to join in hunts that you might want...There's hackers too, so going in a mission with randoms is a risk as they might just decide to ruin your fun.Sooooooo because the interactions with NPCs are basically ""skip dialogue and go the menu"", grinding for gear is frustrating due to the impossible min-maxing of looks and utility and because of all the port related issues that do not allow you to have as much fun as the game intended you to, like playing co-op when you get bored, the game is suffering right now. While the bugs might be fixed, design choices will not, meaning that the game will never be as much fun as it should have been. Still, I did put 100 hours into it and I'll put more, because what it does right is done so right that I want more of it, it just doesn't give me a good reason to keep doing it. I'd have voted ""meh"" but since (that doesn't exist) my overall frustration with the game was because I enjoyed it yet the issues wouldn't go away, I'd have to recommend it."

Don't believe the reviews saying they shoved this out as soon as they could. I'll be the first to admit that the PC controls are terrible. Yes, going through the story Co-op is a pain because they want to force the story on you. However, I don't see either of those as good reasons to not play this fantastic game. Honestly anyone expecting good PC controls has never touched this franchise. It isn't meant for a mouse and keyboard. That's coming from a guy who is primarily a PC gamer. The Co-op thing sucks, but the vast majority of this game is outside of the story and outside of that issue.

I logged 200 hours into the game and then realized that once the game came out for the PC that I would pick that up and not ever play the Xbox version again so I stopped and waited. WELL WORTH THE WAIT!!! The only issues I have had are the slight server instabilities which is nowhere near as bad as it was for the console release, at least this is playable with some communication disconnects. Yes the default key bindings for the KB&M can be a little wonky but there are enough control options and key binding menus (with seperate melee and ranged binding options) that anyone who takes the time to make them work for you will not have an issue. The game was designed and built for a controller but I started playing with the KB&M and after some tweaks will not go back now. Even without direct mouse input the game flows a lot better and easier with the speed and precision a mouse brings along with the customization that a KB allows. I am running a EVGA 1070 with an Intel I7 6400K and have only 1 time had a stutter in my FPS with a drop from 60fps to 48fps. I have purchased the game for myself and 5 of my friends ($300 total) and do not regret it for a second. This game will keep us occupied for hundreds of hours of play time.

Overall FANTASTIC game and definitely worth a purchaseMonster Hunter World is a FANTASTIC game. The countless hours I've spent on this game and series, in general, is staggering and I'm still not bored yet! The gameplay flow and pacing of the game make it easy to pick up and play grind out or just in short bursts. The graphics are beautiful and all the monsters feel fun even after killing them countless times. The PC port itself is pretty barebones with no DoF or Motion Blur options but there are still many options to configure to help the game look better or run better. The default PC controls are really wonky but every single thing can be rebound to your wishes. The game also has the option to use a controller natively including the PS4 controller. With the right HDD load, times are basically non-existent in this port which is a Godsend compared to the console versionsMultiplayer after day 2 is still pretty wonky with frequent disconnects and some lobby issues but I'm sure Capcom will be able to fix it eventually. One of the biggest flaws is that quests with cutscenes specifically story quests are technically supposed to be done solo, to play them multiplayer each player has to view the cutscene, back out and then its open to multiplayer. Its something really annoying but will eventually get fixed as later quests in the game don't have these cutscenes meaning you can do multiplayer from the very beginning. Overall this game is fantastic just with a few flaws that make the game kind of a mess to play in the early stages of the game. I HIGHLY recommend this game and or series to anyone looking into getting into it, and maybe you'll fall into the addiction of Monster Hunter that I and many others have already.Happy Hunting!"

This is my first Monster Hunter game so read the rest of the review with that in mind. There's definitely a learning curve to the game and with all the different types of weapons, it can take you 10+ hours just to figure out what play style suits you the most and that part is not the most fun to do I know. But once you're past that stage this game is extremely fun be it in solo or with a group. The monster types have huge variations with their movesets that'll require you to play a bit differently with each of them, and that's something I really enjoyed. Keep in mind though that the end game is full of grinding, so if you aren't a fan of that then there's not much to do after the main story and a few other side quests, but again even that might take upto 40 hours, so you'll get your money's worth. I'd highly recommend this game.P.S. The new Iceborne expansion is coming out that only adds to the already fantastic experience."

What a wonderful game! If you appreciate tight combat mechanics, extensive weapon selections, PERFECT gameplay loops, high quality graphics and cohesive styles then you'll most likely enjoy this game. Plenty of cosmetic and stat decisions to be made when picking your armor and equipment. I'd like to note that the game developers have done an amazing job keeping the PC version of this game near flawless. The initial stream of updates were slow and sparse but overtime they've added in nearly everything a PC player could want. I initially didn't suggest this game because of the general lack of PC specific features; I rescind that review due to the update allowing ultrawide support and the various other improvements that have been made since then.

4860,TheNightwingGrayson,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thenightwinggrayson/,3,1,1,91.5,August,"13,",203,0,1,"I'm splitting this into 2 sections, 1 for the game itself and 1 for the quality of the port. This is a review from a first time Monster Hunter. Long time fans should look elsewhere for a review. tl;dr Love the game, port has issues, if your PC meets requirements get it anyway, it's too funEdit 1: Locked the game at 60, used Radeon settings to override game settings and it's much more stable. (60 frames nearly all the time) Enabled some filters, not very high but you can notice less jaggedness, with no performance loss and far less stuttering.1) The Game   Monster Hunter World is incredibly fun. The monsters themselves are interesting visually and the environments are beautiful in their own right. There are a multitude of weapons to choose from and they all have a unique play style. If you prefer faster weapons there are dual swords, or sword and shield and if you prefer a big hammer or great sword they've got you covered as well. Try them all out and see which one clicks for you. This game is deliberately slow and methodical. You can't just spam the attack button over and over again until you win. You need to recognize what attack the monster is doing and either sprint or dodge roll out of the way. The game isn't ""clunky"" like some people might say, it just doesn't reward mindless mashing at least not later into the game. The main thing that might completely turn you off about Monster Hunter is that it is a VERY grindy game. You will be hunting monsters over and over again for parts to craft armor and weapons. That's the foundation of the game. If you don't like grinding, regardless of whether or not the fight is fun, then you won't enjoy Monster Hunter. I can enjoy a bit of a grind, especially when there's so many big monsters to fight.2) The Port   OK, so here's a touchy subject. The port is NOT great. It's absolutely not the worst and I wouldn't even say it's bad, it's just not above average. The development team clearly needed/needs more time to fine tune things. This is their first attempt at a PC version and it shows. Some features are missing, like control over motion blur and depth of field. The game's looks don't reflect how it runs. I'm only playing at 1080p, with a mix of med/high settings (mostly medium) with some things just turned off completely like filters and volume rendering (obviously) and I get drops to mid 40s (once into the 30s) in some situations. There is such a wide swing in performance. One minute I'll be running through Ancient forest framerate anywhere from 60s to 80s (smooth) and the next an Anjanath will be charging in to fight, attack my palico and the game jolts down to 45 instantly before recovering.     I get that this is Monster Hunter's first proper appearance on PC, as well as home consoles in a long time, and that it's still better than it's ever been, performance-wise, but that doesn't excuse how unpolished parts of this port are. I really hope the dev team (and Nvidia and AMD with future drivers) can continue to improve things because this game is ridiculously fun, I think I may even love Monster Hunter, but this isn't the port this game deserves. It deserves better and it's a disservice to this game to just be ""fine"" with how it is. The thing is, even with how wonky the port is I still recommend it. It's just too fun not to recommend. If you have a PC that can run it (I have a Ryzen 1700x and RX 480) then give it a shot if it appeals to you."

Some say that the game is really grindy, but I mean in the 3 games that I've played, that is kind of necessary. It would be silly to be able to make every armor piece of weapon after killing something 2 or 3 times. The ""grind"" makes things feel more special and you more accomplished in a way.(Assuming this is the final monster hunter, no clue if it is) It would be amazing to see if they could somehow incorporate the monsters from every game that they are missing currently.

The game honestly feels like the Phantom Pain of Monster Hunter. Everything the series should be, at its best.  I highly recommend this game, my only complain that still stands is that it simply isn't that well optimized. You can still manage to get mostly 60 FPS but for how good the graphics are theres no reason your hardware needs to be as good as it is. I'm hoping this will be fixed in the future, but we'll see."

So needless to say, I've had plenty of time to get bored of the game.But it never really happened.- Graphics are nice, just detailed enough to catch your eye without distracting you too much.- The gameplay is fantastic, as it has always been.- The weapons feel great. Each has a unique playstyle.- Each monster you hunt feels unique (with a few exceptions, like the variants)- Unlike the other MH games, the environment here is completely open, with no loading time in between zones. This makes the gameplay feel smoother, and also makes it more tense (since you can't just bail out of a zone to heal in combat)- A ton of quality of life changes. Namely auto-crafting, being able to move while drinking potions, no more blademaster/gunner armor sets, etc...- Layered Armor ! (Vanity armor, basically)- The game can get very repetitive, especially end-game content.- Even though the monsters are very well made, there's not a whole lot of them. As of now, there are 31 in MH:W, as opposed to 71 in MHGen.- The weapons and armor lack the great designs we've seen in the past, and feel bland and common (with a few exceptions)- Layered Armor isn't Transmogrification. Which means there are only few sets, as opposed to unlocking every armor you craft as layered armor. (but there is a mod to fix that, I believe)- The game isn't for everyone. Some people can find the gameplay clunky at first, since there is no way to cancel an attack, but you pretty much have to treat this game's fighting as Dark Souls. Observe your enemy, commit to an attack, back off, rinse and repeat. (Unless you play some of the faster weapons, in which case you completely skip the ""observe"" part and go all out, dodging out of reaction time and prediction.)The game is also a constant grind to get better gear. But thankfully, just like Dark Souls, the game isn't bound to ""Meta"", and is only limited by your own skill. You hunt anything with any weapon (as long as you do enough damage, since there's a time limit to your hunts). Your playstyle is never NOT going to work, but there are varying degrees of success, obviously. But you're never forced into anything. (unless it's Behemoth ... ♥♥♥♥ me, that thing is strong)And if the game starts being boring ? Just hunt with friends. They fixed the servers, it's fine now. Hunting in this game is much more fun with pals, trust me. I've beaten the end-game, but I still find reasons to come back. Because my friends make this game feel more fun. Anyway, I highly recommend this game, if ""thriving for improvement"" is your thing. If you feel like you're having a hard time, remember: This is the easiest Monster Hunter game. Have fun ! : The game's fun, even more fun with friends, combat feels good, weapons feel good, monsters are well made, (but it's quality > quantity), weapon designs got bland, lots of QoL changes. Definetly worth the price, even more so if it's on sale."
4905,Random | Wholesome Degenerate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mylifeisrandom/,3,,1,400.4,December,"7,",151,0,1,"When the game first arrived for PC, it wasn't at its best. It was plagued by numerous issues concerning lacking visuals, bugged visuals in cutscenes, constant connection issues, and more. Now, while the odd issue pops up every now and again with content releasing for the first time on the PC version, it has gone above and beyond in regaining consumer trust in my opinion.I was always going to play it. I don't own a PS4 and Nintendo seemed to have every other MonHun title on its platforms which I haven't owned since the Wii U. Where as I had thought we'd see simultaneous Wii U and 3DS releases, we got the one in MH3U and everything else went to the 3DS. With Monster Hunter World, we have a modern adaptation of a game series I've been in love with since 2004. With beautiful locations, monsters, and a ton of quality-of-life improvements, Monster Hunter World is the best in the series I've played so far. Keep in mind, I've only managed the first on PS2, the PSP games following it, and MH3 and MH3U on the Wii and Wii U. Were I blessed with a Switch I would definitely be spending equal time in Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.The only real downside here is the emphasis on mixed sets which without layered armor tend to look goofy, and the poorly implemented RNG method of obtaining decorations. In prior games, at least as I observed, you'd choose a baseline set with points towards skills you like and them you'd slot in decorations and use charms to empower the existing skills are add new complimentary or utility skills. All while looking great in a full set of matching gear. There were mixed sets in that era as well, but nowhere near as prevalent and meta as they are in MHW. Though the constant updates offering varied layered armor sets allow you to look good and perform well. The decoration system is unfortunately the one black mark on the game. I'm sure it will come in a future G or Ultimate expansion to the game, but Tempered and Arch Tempered monsters as a replacement for a full-fledged G Rank series of quests with new monsters and subspecies is... well, par for the course actually. MonHun has been adding expansions to base games and selling them anew since the first in 2004, so it's not too surprising, just still disappointing. Having to rely on RNG for decorations is an absolute bore, though.That said, those are the only negative aspects I can think of for an otherwise unforgettable experience. Aside from Azure Rathalos of course being a constant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but that's what Flashpods are for. The combat is varied and skill-based, with a different tempo and method to defeating each beast based on your class of weapon. Movelists have been expanded since my time, adding over the top special moves that will knock monsters over, sever their tails, and break their horns! The core gameplay of slaying progressively stronger, larger, and more fearsome monsters while using the body parts of your slain foes to craft and improve weapons and armor is as addictive and rewarding as ever. New investigation quests allow for extra reward slots of varied rarity to close the gap in your hunt for rare parts. Each map is a near labyrinth of ups and downs, twists and turns, with hidden alcoves and tunnels only you can access. These maps are filled to the brim with collectables and pets for your room back at base. Literally stuffed full of useful items for crafting tools, weapons, and armor. Monsters clash with each other like never before in turf wars to decide who's the biggest and baddest. It's all just so damn cool to see coming from the prior era of Monster Hunter.As my play time will show, I love this game so very much. Breached HR100 and there's still so much to do. So many weapons, armors, and decorations to collect. So many sets to build and improve for my favorite weapon types. So many upcoming monsters and AT variants with layered sets, event quests, and more. The fun won't end for a long while, so I hope you'll give this game another chance if it turned you away during the initial release. You won't regret it."

The game runs fine on my pc even at high graphics. People are complaining about mouse acceleration but this isn't a first person shooter that requires the most precise mouse movement in the world. People are complaining about multiplayer drops but it rarely happens to me, when it does I can just reconnect. Honestly the pc version of this game is a lot better than I thought it would be, especially since it is the first monster hunter on pc. If you want the game but bad reviews are hindering you get it anyways because I haven't found anything majorly wrong with it.

Stop writing negative reviews regarding a problem that the Capcom team is working on fixing. All online games have connectivity issues at one point or another and you are supposed to be writing a review on the game itself. 2) All of you ""bad port"" people? You have no idea what you're talking about. Some people are having no problems with framerate or playability with this game and their specs and some people are having some problems. It all is dependent on your HARDWARE. If you bought crappy off-brand hardware of course you're gonna have problems.And now to the review: Back when the Nintendo Wii was still putting out games, my two brothers and I pooled together our savings and bought Monster Hunter 3 Tri. Thus began a love for this series with all three of us. Capcom has been a little sketchy with universal releases and once Monster Hunter: WORLD was announced, we were all stoked. We bought the game once it released on the PC (even though I was worried I wasn't going to be able to run it on my lower-end computer) and have been going through the game together.My specs: Processor - AMD FX-6300 RAM - 8 GB of RAM Video - GTX 750 ti 2GB Story - This game has a way more in-depth story than any of the previous games and it is very enjoyable to play and read the dialogue.Graphics - I can run on mid settings with a solid 30fps (good enough for me). The look of this game is beautiful even on these settings. My youngest brother can have uncapped framerates on his 1060.Connectivity - I have only had one issue with connectivity when playing with my brothers. We reloaded the game and it was fixed. Also, for those who are having this issue, Capcom is fixing it so PLEASE stop giving the game a negative review due to ONE issue with the game.Playability - Overall, a great port (if it is one). But, I kind of doubt it is a port because it took them 7 months to bring it to the PC?Overall, this is a great game and I am looking forward to future DLC. Don't listen to those negative reviews."

4929,Silvermann,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silverman/,2,,1,"1,637.9",November,"22,",749,0,1,"Can't believe I will ever see Monster Hunter coming to PC, but here it is.Monster Hunter: World is the latest installment, and marks the beginning of a new generation, of the popular franchise. With reaching the global audience in mind, Capcom made numerous decisions that appeals to the Western market by streamlining some mechanics in the previous games, along with updated graphics. While it has no doubt drew more audience towards it, it also annoyed many long-time fans who thought the change was too much. I am not going to cover all of those, as readers can easily find those information online.In this game, you play as a hunter, and your job is to aid the research of all kinds of monsters in this world by killing it or capturing it alive. The story involves you and your fellow hunters in going to an uncharted landmass and study the mysterious phenomon happening over there. Story is pretty simple. It is just there to give you a reason to be there, and serves as a tutorial for the players. Once the story is over, you are left on your own device to continue your research in this world, or move on to a different game if you think you are finished.When it comes to combat, I hear a lot of people compare it with the Souls games, and I think this is the sad reality of Souls coming to PC earlier than Monster Hunters. Personally, I do not think they are alike, since the focus is different. Souls is about you overcoming one obstacle after another by progressing through the world that is very hostile to you. This is not the case for Monster Hunter World, since there are many collectibles and traps on the map that you can utilize to tip the battle to your favor. Also it is usually monsters that would be the one running away instead of you. The combat is very action-packed, but you are not at such a disadvantaged position like you would be in a Souls game.Graphic is good enough to me. I think it does a pretty good job in presenting different parts of the world, and I like what I see.Content wise, I think it is enough for me. I understand there are people who are used to Monster Hunter games with almost 100 monsters, do bear in mind that the first game and the third game also started with a similar roster because of them being on a new platform. I am getting hundreds of hours from this game already, and I am content. Do I want more stuff? Absolutely.Is the game worth it, then? I would say yes. This is a good entrypoint for new players of the series, and those who likes to beat on big monsters and take their loot would appreciate the charm of the game."

4933,Blazing,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NotTheRealBlazingJpg/,16,3,0,277.7,October,"15,",155,6,1,"This review is written by a player new to the franchise. TL;DR:++Immersive monsters ++Armor customization and selection++Weapon customization+Weapon diversity+Reguarly adding content -Grinding-Difficulty--Port --Hub--Story--Repetitive--RNG based elements--The Handler---HitboxesStoryThe story itself is fairly uninteresting. It serves mostly as a way of introducing the world and the monsters to you. Not at any moment did I sit on the edge of my seat in curiosity for what was to be come next. Therefore, the story  should not be your reason for playing this game.GameplayI do find the gameplay fairly disappointing, mostly because of its lack of accurate hitboxes. It can be a real annoyance at times – especially when the monster can one shot you. For example, it is not uncommon for you to get charged for, as far as I can tell, its full damage when you’re standing BEHIND your target.The monsters can also often roar CC you and gets quite annoying when it happens multiple times in a row.There’s also a random chance of getting stun after being hit, which can guarantee your death if you’re, well, unlucky.The targeting system is horrible with M+K. Better off aiming manually all the time.. Flash Pods are absolutely broken and make any monster that flies into the air a joke .Walking up a climbable vines/walls makes you climb automatically – even if you’re using an healing item and therefore canceling it. This can actually kill you when you’re accidentally walking into it backwards.You can get pinned down, which seems to have no other purpose than killing you by being unable to quickly move out of terrain that damages you.Your attack animation seem to not be accurate in conjunction with the actual hits. For example, hitting a monster and seeing your weapon pass the monster entirely can not hit if the monster roars or hits you right after that.Your cat’s abilities can often get ignored when called for, and calling for them requires you to put away your weapon. This can cause you to have to repeatedly sheathe your weapon to call for it again until he does it.There seems to be no way to guarantee a mount (skillfully), it just seems to be a chance that slowly goes up.  Other than that, the mounting itself takes no skill after you realise that It also seems that CC chaining monsters is the highest tier gameplay, which is fairly disappointing.Disregarded all these imperfections, the combat is fairly enjoyable and decent.DifficultyThe game does not pose a challenge skillwise, it poses a challenge in preparation and knowledge. The most important to winning the game long term is to upgrade your equipment and weapon. For short term with a specific boss and to obviously know its general moveset.The game’s difficulty is mostly just pumping up numbers: make monsters hit harder and give them more hp. You generally have Besides that, they recoloured a few bosses and called them different. For example, The monster variety seems to be too small for a game that focuses on killing monsters, and a lot of monsters are very similar. They are, supposedly, adding frequent free monster updates, though, which does ease this issue.ImmersionWhat I believe the game excels at most, is the immersion. The monsters feel very realistic and it can feel like you’re hunting a real dinosa.. monster - at least in the beginning. The immersion does wear off fairly quick once you kill the same monster a few times and start to understand its  general pattern. The terrain, although sometimes somewhat small, can feel very immersive because of how distinct the terrain is –  clearly an eye for detail.The scoutfly system does ruin the immersion a lot, though. These shouldn’t have been constantly present. There’s a mod to remove it, though.Lip sync is off, not everything is voiced and the lines were not written well.Characters are named by their role. They literally couldn’t even name your “Handler” or any of the expedition leaders.WorldIt is NOT an open world game.The hub is especially badly designed. There’s a lot of running around for the occasional micro tasks you should be doing, because the locations are not optional - you even need to go through a loading screen for one. There’s actually a fast traveling mechanic within the hub for covenience, but they’re not well placed and missing in the most essential spot .There’s a countdown after finishing a quest, which means you may have not enough time or too much.  Should simply have an option to leave whenever you want after finishing.There’s no retry option or proper stay as group option (staying as a group in an expedition is not the same, especially when everyone has to accept the next quest all over again).MultiplayerHub seems to be mostly for playing for friends and for arena, should’ve raised the capacity so you can have an active quest board. Also could’ve made your hub fill with players and not just purposeless NPCs.The SOS system is nice for getting random people into your hunts, although I believe it shouldn’t be main co-op method.A leaver in your quest cannot be replaced, which means if someone is intentionally doing nothing you either can kick him and get no replacement or let him get double value by looting or doing nothing and still getting the boss reward.The multiplayer only scales for solo or multiplayer, not depending on the amount of players. Arena is always scaled for multiplayer (unnecessarily).GrindingThe game seems to like grinding... It really, really likes grinding... If you’re not a fan of it, I suggest you better be satisfied with only completing the story line because nearly all the customization requires grinding.  The bosses get repetitive and boring quick once you kill it 10x in a row, which ruins the immersion a lot. Just so you have a 1% chance of getting that one thing you want.CustomizationThe character customization for your character and your cat are pretty extensive, although I did miss the common body height/type modifications.The different armor sets seem very unique and you can switch them around. You can also create interesting Skill combinations.The weapon customization is even more diverse. At higher rank, UIThat chat bar is bad.The order of consumable items does not seem to consistently save, meaning you often have to reorganise it if it’s your main way of using items.The game forcefully changes your camera angle when it thinks it locates something important, even when it means locating a monster that is infront of you by turning your camera around.SOS quest board search critera does not get saved.Port/OptionsYou can rebind keys for melee and ranged weapons, but not for specific weapons. The last should be a thing because the weapons are generally very distinctive and deserve their own kind of keybinds.Quick access menu in combat allows you to sharpen your weapon while it is out, but it cannot be done with the normal use item menu (???).

And why not make it possible to join a game even with the damn Cutscenes.Look at games like Borderlands 2 or other games where they managed to do great coop gameplay. I rly. like the game.

So I may be a bit Biased, but this is the opinion from a Monster Hunter Veteran:This game is an amazing entry in the series and perfect for new comers of the series who have never touched a Monster Hunter game before. It has a lot of mechanics that streamline things that were challenging in previous monster hunter or took time away from hunting such as gathering or load times between areas. Honestly, the maps are very interesting and very unique.That being said, this game also may dissapoint people who've been following the game as long as I have been. The game is way easier and there are less monsters than what has been included in recent entries in the series. It really makes me Crave Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate, but I will honestly find myself coming back to this game for a long time. Because it is more accessible more of my friends are picking up this game and its honestly not really comparable to the traditional Monster Hunters. This game has so many unique mechanics such as the Environmental Hazards and the Monster Clashes, meanwhile MHGU allows you to play as a palico and has more content. I will be picking up both this month because of this."

Long-time MMORPG player.9/10 | The Graphics are great! Compared to previous entries, which i've always followed, it looks awesome. 10/10 | The Combat. If you've seen the trailer, you know its good. You FEEL the hits and FEEL good! Especially when you pull off a combo or the perfect positioning attack. Having  14 weapons to choose from is a HUGE added value too and all vary in gameplay. So try them all out. 4/10 | The Story... is a story. Not that great, but you do feel a sort of relationship with the characters. Won't really be invested in the npcs as much as you get invested with the monsters that you slay/capture.9/10 | Great Replayability. Create your own build. Learn all the weapons. Challenge stronger monsters. Find a multitude of ways to slay/capture a monster. Hope to see more kinds/types of monsters added to the game.Looking forward to the DLCs and would definitely pay for new significant content! On a personal note regarding other reviews:While there may be problems with the multiplayer at launch, this is common with any game launch on any platform. I think people have their expectations set way too high. Monster hunter is NOT an MMORPG. It is more of a single player game, rather than a multiplayer. Though the multiplayer is an awesome addition to the game, being a key feature with the previous entries on handheld consoles. Playing with friends is a BIG PLUS, but i think the game should not be put at the same standard as MMORPGs or Online Shooters. Monster hunter can be played solo throughout the whole game, whilst an MMORPG cannot be played offline. Heck, even MMORPGS have bad/rough launches due to connection issues. It is a common occurance. So please be reasonable with your reviews, especially if you have invested a TON of time into the game. As the future of the game; like new content, could be impacted by your review.- UPDATE - Acquired tons of Layered Armours from events.New Expansion announced and I am not disapointed. Cant wait for ICEBORNE. Been keeping up with the updates. Enjoyed AT Vaal and looking forward to Behemoth."

4964,Cynquilla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cynquilla/,2,,1,292.7,October,"30,",148,0,1,"I had been sitting on the debate of getting this game for a long time. The fact that it has mixed reviews can be misleading. The game itself is gorgeous, with very modern physics for a game in this day of age. The ambiance is amazing. The combat system is complex, with a variety of weapons to choose from, depending on your playstyle. It's better to team up with friends in hunting the bigger monsters, though, taking on a furry t-rex solo was both challening and fun.  With the hours I put into this game, I am very addicted and satisfied with the choice I made with my purchase. My only wish is being able to interact with the Palico companion more, since you do get little pets to place into your room, and be able to interact with them. A little sad that I don't get to cuddle the kitty friendo. Character customization is what I love in games. A lot of options to choose from, including facial features, expressions, the use of a color wheel and makeup. Don't  forget to pick up your free dlc for more hair choices and a free voucher to edit your character if you don't like how they look in the beginning. Overall, the crafting system is very unique, as in, being able to have pages open on crafting the necessary components to craft what you actually need. What you need solely depends on how much you research and harvest on your expeditions.You can fend off your foes with parts you've obtained from their species and have forged into your gear. Keep an eye on effects, skills and stats your gear offers. Mixing and matching can benefit you in many ways. Researching your hunts is a huge benefactor in the game. The more you track/research them, the more you understand what  they are strong and weak against, as well as their locations, territory, diet and rivals. Watching your prey fight another monster is quite a sight and you can use this to your advantage.The hunts themselves are really fun, especially having to track and chase down your prey. Again, depending on your weapon of choice, the hunt may result in a quicker downfall of the monster. I was able to take down a Pukei-Pukei without having it run off with the Jagras form of the Commission Axe. Very satisfying, considering I was taking a chance with the bow at first. Eating is key in this game, depending on what you get at the canteen effects various stats for yourself and your Palico. I also, at least, recommend watching the cutscene of the Palicos preparing your meal at least once. On your hunts/expeditions, you can also prepare your own quick meal  with raw meat. What you do with the meat is up to you; whether tainting it for your next kill, or grilling it to the beat of the music for an increase of stamina and recovery. Upgrading and forging armor and weapons is a little mundane, and depends on what is it you're after. Choose a weapon that you can understand the combos with, and understand how affinity works.  You upgrade your weapon, if you want a higher damage, but downgrade if you want to expand the branches, and increase elemental effects or obtain even more damage. Understand that the furthur you progress in the game, the more parts you can unlock to upgrade your weapons. Honestly, if you are a PC gamer, understand that this game is better with a controller. Best of luck, hunters."
4965,ShaggyShoe,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005655210/,2,,1,169.6,October,"7,",125,0,1,"Despite the mixed reviews, I can safely say that - as of me writing this - most/all of the glaring bugs and problems have been fixed.  Haven't had a connection drop since the patch and loading times are nice and quick.  With that out of the way, I can best describe MHW as 'repetition done fun.'  You start the game with a ""Story Mode,"" which is essentially a glorified tutorial, getting new players situated with the world, your weapons, and - of course - your rogue's gallery of monsters that you will become well-aquainted with as you beat the ever living daylights out of on your way to creating loadouts and sets for every occasion.  You begin in Low Rank, going through story quests that pit you against most of the monsters.  Eventually you graduate to High Rank, which unlocks tougher versions of the same monsters in low rank, as well as some new ones that are only available in HR.  From there you move up to the six Elder Dragons that are apart of the base game (I'm not counting Zorah...as you don't really fight him per say.)  More to come in future updates as the PC version of the game catches up to the console version.Speaking of updates, everything that contains ACTUAL content is FREE.  That's right folks, no EA shenanigans here.  New monsters, new weapons/armor sets, holiday events and festivals, and siege events are free and will be added to the game as an automatic update.  Only cosmetic items such as stickers, gestures, and a couple of armor skins actually require monetary purchase.As I mentioned, the game is repetitive, but if one ever finds the game becoming dull as a result, just change weapons.  MHW has 14 different weapon types in it, each with its own style of play.  Want that satisfying feeling of KO'ing a charging monster ten times your size?  Roll the Hammer and play Whack-a-Mole with its face.  Want to look like and/or pretend to be a cool guy?  The Longsword and Dual Blades have some of the flashiest moves in the game.  Want to keep your distance because you're definitely not a coward or anything like that?  The Heavy Bowgun is basically an M60, have fun!As for system requirements, my computer's getting a little on in years so I run the game on med-low settings to be safe, but that being said it runs smoothly and quickly even so.TL;DRGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950 2GB x2CPU: Intel I7-6700k 4.0ghz 8MB Smart Cache LGA1151MB: GA-Z170X Gaming 3 LGA 1151 w/CrossfireRAM: 16GBRepetitive, but fun.  If you find a weapon getting boring, just swap.  Every style is different enough that it mitigates fighting the same monsters over and over.  Word of warning about Modding: Capcom is currently sitting on the fence.  If you want to play it on the safe-ish side, avoid anything that circumvents actual gameplay (basically any mod that changes the stores or introduces a 'one-hit-kill' weapon, etc).  If they do decide to crack down, those will be the first they target.8/10Would save Clifford from an Angry Pickle again."

Not sure but lets just go and jump into it. *** If you play using a keyboard and mouse it is a frustrating experience. I highly recommend getting a controller.A decently controller can be had for rather cheap. The original Xbox 360 wired controllers can be found for 10-15 bucks and work great in this game. ***This is the first Monster Hunter game I have ever played. A friend of mine who has thousands of hours in other Monster Hunter titles convinced me to get this and honestly I am glad I did. When the game first came out it had its bugs and honestly for a team who has never made a PC title before it wasn't bad. However, the connection issues were a real problem. Once Capcom figured those out this game has been a blast. Overall the graphics are absolutely amazing. Just a shear joy to run around and find something new. The entire enviroment especially in the Ancient Forest feel alive. As far as combat I can say it is a lot of fun. You would think limited move sets would make things boring and I can say it doesn't. Learning the monsters you fight and knowing your weapon is half the battle. Understanding when and where you can pull off a move is what makes this game so damn fun. You get punished later on when you make mistakes like any game should but nothing unreasonable.That being said, sometimes you just get into really dumb situations. A monster stuns you then pulls off its big move and you are dead. It happens and is frustrating. Sometimes the hit boxes are a bit off but overall the game is rather polished. I love just going into a mission and playing with a few friends. When you face a super hard monster the joy of finishing it off is great. Overall there is a lot of complexity in the game especially once you start getting into armor, weapons, decorations, etc. Figuring out what works best for not only for your play style but your weapon can be rather daunting. Luckily, the community of Monster Hunter is incredible. They are super supportive of new players and go out of their way to help. So, with me rambling on here, what do I think? Absolutely get this game. It is a load of fun but a bit grindy. If you are looking for a game where you can jump in, have a couple of games and leave this is not one of them. It is a time commitment but worthwhile. Overall I would give this game a 9/10. There are still some bugs or whathaveits but those are one of very few detractors of the game."

Particularly, with Monster Hunter World, they vastly improved on many of the previously lacking aspects of games past. No longer needing to paint monsters, mounts, camps, and fast travel systems make exploration and hunts quicker, and less tedious. The tracking system is fairly fun and fits the environment really well. The graphics and immersive environment of this game in particular is absolutely fantastic. I hope all future Monster Hunter games have environments this developed and immersive and dense. The endemic life capturing and house customization is just a cherry on the top. As for the hunts themselves, AMAZING. While this game in particular lacks in sheer number of large monsters compared to some others, such as MH4U, it certainly makes up for with some extremely cool new and interesting monsters and battles. With all the DLC and events out by now, the number is fairly well rounded compared to release and there is a lot to do. I also particularly love that they added layered armor and weapon sets. Which makes the game a lot more fun to mess around with fashion and looks. I hope further installments expound upon these systems further, as it would be nice to have access to layered equipment from the start, with more customization options always available, particularly with weapons, which are very limited at current. The weapons and armor, generally, are very cool looking, unique, and fun to mix and match, though i do have some minor complaints with some weapons, such as the bow, which often feels like most of them are simply reskins with slight changes and are rather uninspired. Many others, though, such as DB, IG, and GS for example, have a plethora of amazing looking unique weapons that make it hard to part with once you get something with better stats down the line. One further complaint I have with this game in particular, is that it is very grindy, and has a lot of RNG factor with monster drops, and decorations in particular (a weapon/armor augmentation/upgrade system). Although this system allows for a great variety of customization and is extremely powerful, far too often meta or powerful builds rely on very rare or specific decorations that can take literally 100s of hours of grinding to get if you aren't lucky. For example, the bow class and it's infamous Mighty Bow decoration, which is considered a necessity on any bow build. Luckily, they have tried to lessen the harshness of this grind with the elder melder, allowing you to craft many rare decos in exchange for a LOT of other decos, and also, with events that award a lot of decorations for beating them,such as the greatest jagras event quest. Even still, too much of the end game is reliant upon farming these decorations in order to put together the builds of your dreams. Finally, overall, this game is filled with fantastic battles, decent story, and addictive gameplay, with the one real annoyance again coming down to grind and guidance. While some grind is expected and fun, on top of having to farm monster parts, augmentation materials, and decorations, which takes hours upon hours to do, a lot of the endgame, including many of the most powerful monsters, is gated behind a confusing and poorly explained system called the Guiding Lands. The Guiding Lands themselves are fairly interesting and fun... at least for the first couple of hours.  But shortly thereafter, you are left wondering how to progress, whether you've already reached the end, or whether there is still more to unlock. This is separate from the other sets of confusing to unlock monsters, which eventually leads to the true final boss. However, once you do finally figure out how to unlock them, it is well worth it, as the sieges and the final boss are some of the best fights you will get in any game."

It looks amazing, especially with the volumetric fog and weather and day/night system.It's the first game I've played where the world truly feels alive. I was worried about open areas but it's a massive step up from previous Monster Hunter games. It feels like you've entered a real place that developed naturally, full of living, breathing creatures.The combat and gameplay are top-notch. MH has always had amazing combat but they have streamlined it over the years. I was worried it was getting too simplistic but as a veteran it's nice to see how many quality of life improvements they've made. Clearly the dev team really care about Monster Hunter and haven't lost touch like a lot of games sequels seem to.The combat feels heavier and more impactful than ever, but also more fluid. It's like the offspring of old Monster Hunter and Dark Souls.Really I'm just scratching the surface but this is the first significant upgrade we've seen to Monster Hunter since the original. Capcom has always taken it easy, using handhelds and the weakest consoles of the generations. Granted, they pushed those consoles to their limits, but it was always so much less than it could have been with more powerful hardware.I've always dreamed of what Monster Hunter could have been if they tried as hard as they could... well we finally got to find out. It's amazing."
4980,Valkroz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/palvalkroz/,3,,1,"1,038.1",August,"10,",211,0,1,"Having bought a PS4 just to play this game in January, I love this game and this series. I will mention first that I am very, very early in my PC/Steam review, so don't make a final decision based ONLY on my review. I'm here to say my first impression while its fresh. I'll start with the bad before leading to the good.I have a really good PC setup; GPU is a EVGA Nvidia Geforce 1080TI SC2 (11GB VRAM), CPU is an Intel i7-7700K (4.2 GHz), and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM. Despite my specs, I've noticed that non-cinematic scenes dip in frames when I play 4K and max settings. I'm fairly confident that its not so much my specs handling the load of my settings, but rather how the game uses CPU memory. I don't know how to give specific details, I'll just offer a personal opinion on the matter: Its not game breaking at all. I kept my eye specifically out to see if it was as doomsday as some media reported.The only thing else worth pointing out, something that's much more critical, is that default mouse and keyboard controls are a bit wonky. Combat specifically isn't that bad, its actually more navigating menus and accessing your item bar thats awkward to say the least. Everything more or less has to be confirmed with a left mouse click, and to exit anything/go back, you have to RIGHT CLICK. ESC doesn't apply all the time, and the most bizarre function I accidentally prompted was accessing a load/save-your-loadout menu while trying to equip my first weapon, and once I accessed that menu accidentally, ESC turned into a ""Rename your loadout"" button. Right-clicking was the exit/go back function. I don't see that as practical. Also, right-clicking is your action button too. Picking up recources, accessing item/equipment boxes, that's your button. Meanwhile, E is to use your selected item, and holding Q brings up your item bar that you have to navigate with mouse buttons, HOWEVER, to switch item-shortcut menus, you have to use arrow keys. That's pretty freaking hard to do while your mouse has to both navigate your camera, your attack moves, and your action button. I should never have to take my hand off my mouse to navigate anything.Aside from these complaints, the game is as much as I remember it feeling like when I play it on PS4. The content of the game delivered me over 400 hours of playtime, without friends who play. For all my complaints, there's 10 more praises. Play the game, play with friends, watch tutorials, find guides on armor and weapon sets, and explore one of the most engaging communities in this industry!"

4983,Aeylr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeylr/,2,,1,303.0,September,"19,",289,0,1,"Awesome game. Game looks good, runs really well for the looks too. Some odd settings, like antialiasing making stuff blurry, but if you run ReShade the game looks amazing.Monsters act like they actually would realistically; They'll run from you and try to recover, when you chase them the monster will put all of its energy in to protecting itself only to tire itself out. Really feels like the monsters have a personality. There are 14 completely unique weapons and they are all completely viable, even the support weapons can solo a monster. All weapons have a level of complexity to it, many of them can be hard to master, but you can  pick up any of them at any time and do well enough.  Even the Greatsword, which looks really simple, has complex abilities behind the scenes that let you take it to the next level.Every monster you hunt has two armor sets and atleast one weapon set (one for all 14 weapon types). It's fun hunting monsters just to see what the smithy can do with the monster parts you collected, but it also allows for a huge amount of build diversity. All of the gear you collect gives skills that reflect the monster it came from, which leads in to.. Preparing for the hunt. The one thing most games skip out on, monster hunter does it right. Before you get in a tussle with a giant monster, you need supplies. Potions for healing, damage boosting, you need traps and explosives. You can even build a set of armor to counter the specific monster you are fighting. You'll also want to eat a big meal, don't ever hunt on an empty stomach. The more preparation you do, the smoother the hunt will go. However, it does not become flower picking simulator. Once you can grow or purchase most of what you need, you will only have to go out and collect stuff if you run out mid-hunt, or for the occasional rare material. You should still plan what you bring with you in a hunt, It'll be a bit hard to fight a monster without a cure to its ailments.Story of the game is good, but monster hunter isn't a story game first. Most of it is there to teach you the game, and give you excuses to fight the next monster. The characters are memorable though, and your custom character does show up in whatever gear you are wearing during cutscenes, so it is done really well.Singleplayer and multiplayer are smoothly transitioned. You can play the whole game solo, or call for backup at almost any point. There are also gathering hubs for hunters to gather in and hang out. The only issue I could find, if you want to do a playthrough with a friend you have to start your story missions solo to watch a cutscene. You can back out afterwards and join your friend, but it is a slight annoyance.There is also house customization, you can decorate your home and even capture smaller creatures to put in your house. Iceborn adds a lot more customization and allows multiplayer within your home, but I was having fun with it even before Iceborn released.In summary, 9/10The story is good and all you need in a MH game, the combat and customizablility are amazing, monsters act like I'd believe they would if real, the game is beautiful, and their attention to detail is amazing in all areas, including time spent before and after a hunt.Took one point off for a number of small annoyances, like having to start cutscenes in solo, having to run ReShade to get the most of the graphics, some minor hitbox issues (Most hitboxes are amazingly tight, but a select few can extend out a little too much and hit you with a ghost), and the few weapon designs that had amazing potential but were butchered by gluing monster parts to the iron variant. Overall the only issues I've found have been small, none of this really hurts game enjoyment for me.- Fifth fleet hunter, PS4/PC, Bow/Greatsword/Chargeblade user"

I write this review as i wait for the credits too end for my first playthrough and i must say, this was a beautiful and amazing game to play. The game is an excellent intro to newcomers to the series and a swell game for veterans of the series. I will not use any special formats like pro and cons i will simply put it as it is. This game teaches you what you need too know to play and have fun but leaves some stuff a mystery so that you have to play and understand the weapons and builds that you make. Even with 100 hours i have only use two weapons so there is still much more for me to experience as i get up to hr-100. The only things i did not enjoy were being unable to connect to friends quest or getting randomly disconnected during quest. As this past week and a half have gone by they have beocme less frequesntly i assume from server maintenance but regardless i see no major problems with this game and i recommend anyone to give it a try and play it for a bit. P.S. The ""Bug"" everyone thought was a bug is just a missing file that you can find online or on the MHW subreddit and even then its rare for people to get it.

Having an i5 processor and a decent graphics card I was confused, and decided to check the settings. It told me that (even at the lowest possible Graphics settings) it was overtaking my graphics card and RAM space, but when I tabbed out of the game, my computer was totally fine. I decided to experiment, and tabbed out again, my computer was still fine.This game is absolutely beautiful, the movements are realistic, and the environments are nothing short of awe-inspiring.But the voice acting is terrible. Given that it was originally a Japanese game I expect the lip sync to be bad, but the voice acting is terrible. Just turn voice off. On top of this, a lot of people complain that the in-town music is annoying and I agree. To fix that problem, find a Spotify playlist or something, mute your music when you get into town, and press play on that playlist. Boom, instant fix.Getting into the game is like a slap in the face. It hits you with more information and you can get comfused fast. Here are my tips for newcomers like myself:Watch these two videos: -  (A source that explains weapon types) -  (A decent beginner's guide to tell you what you should do first)Some pointers: - To make your Palico's equipment, you need things called research points. You can't start getting research points until you finish the second story quest where you kill the Great Jagras, - Scout Flies are super helpful! Follow them, look at footprints to upgrade them, and you won't get lost, have to spend an agonizing amount of time looking at footprints, or miss out on resources you wish you had grabbed on that last big monster hunt. - Start with the defender armor, and abandon it as soon as you've finished the first couple missions. This way, you don't have to use crappy leather or chainmail as a last resort and make something you like, but be safe in the process. - Play with a controller if at all possible. This game was originally made for console-based controllers. It's just the smart thing. - Experiment with different fighting styles. Fainting is a-okay, and so is failing the mission, so long as you can find a good comfort zone for yourself without breaking that controller I told you to play with by smashing it into your nice 4K monitor you waited so long to buy. - Grab literally everything. Thing on the wall? Grab it. Weird bug? Grab it. Monster intestines? Grab it. They may not seem important now, but the further you get into the game the more you're going to need that weird ♥♥♥♥ you grabbed along the way.I hope this helped!8/10 so far,Zeph :)"

I have never felt in love with a game quicker. The uniqueness that every monster and creature has in the game is what gives it the charm, and the freedom to customize how you play with weapons and armor is crazy with tons of different sets and weapons to craft from monster loot. Like every MMO you're gonna have to grind to get materials, but I've never gotten bored with grinding in this game. Fighting monsters with other online players is an experience I've never felt nowhere else. I've even gotten help from veterans from the series because they could tell I was a total newbie to the game. The only cons I have to give this game is the server issues, but I think everyone knows at this point that Capcom servers are something you shouldn't have high expectations of anyway. Sometimes the game lags or crashes due to server issues as well. Also if you don't use voice channels for communication, talking with your allies is almost near impossible, but the game has something you can use to communicate with shortcuts you can customize. Obviously the task of most missions is to hunt and slay a monster, so communication isn't always needed, but when you get to harder and more challenging monsters, it's needed severely.MHW is a great experience, and very friendly to new players entering the series, the community is very welcoming and open to helping newer players and assisting with missions. Definitely worth trying out, and worth coming to if you're a fan of MMOs or RPGs."

I have never seen a perfect game like MHW. Besides, the other games always had repeatable contents that made you get bored.Whenever the monsters spot you, they will kill you, and yet they will retreat to sleep for some reason. There's a chance for you to get an instant kill by using bombs or any explosive items.Overall, the combat, grinding, equipment, maps, and monsters are great. The monsters' movements are like an AI , they have a brain and know what to do if you trigger them.

Then I got it for PC and I fell in love with it. Yeah, it doesnt have as many monster as the older games have, but it does have some features that make it better for what it is. The series has promise as long as Capcom keeps supporting it with bigger and better updates. I highly suggest this game for new and old hunters. Old hunters need to remember this is a new project.

Drop in and drop out multiplayer.OMFG i cant take hearing from people how ♥♥♥♥ the servers are it honestly makes me want to throw a dung bomb in their faces because they have no idea how big of a change this is to the series. YES this is having some major issues now but to me this is dream come true even if a player does drop out you are still able to continue the quest and have them rejoin!(ps i have found the best work around for finding your friends and joining their games is to start the game in your own online session and than going to the notice board to join their session. not sure why this works but there is an issue with joing straight from the main menu right now. youre welcome.)3. User friendly. This game will point out everything to you heck... for the first time ever there is a forced tutorial.. ill be walking around an fireflys will point out every item you pass instead of having to look for a physichal crack in the wall to mine of hope that a bush will provide bugs for you (love how you actually grab bugs off the surface) tracking a monster is a little annoying sometimes but im getting used to it.4. Chanhging gear mid quest. This part is so amazing i misspelled the title part on purpose! finaly you can go into a mission and have the option to change your gear mid game to suit the needs of your situation and team mates. i will change between guns and long swords even the hunting horn u used to HATE it now something i enjoy using in this version of monster hunter.5. The enviroment.  EVERYTHING LOOKS AMAZING!!!  you can swing from trees jump off walls grapple onto bugs on trees kick a frog that will parylize the enemy DAM like.. its so fluid and you feel like you are a true hunter instead of relying on your own provisions you can use your knowledge of the enviroment to aid your quest!These are just 5 reasons to grab this adventure of a lifetime. i didnt even mention DAMAGE INDICATORS or TURF WARSCapcom i love you so much for making this series i have started streaming this on my twitch page  i bought a cable from japan so i could stream my psp screen playing monster hunter unite it took 3 weeks to arrive! i can honestly say i will be following this game till the day i die.few Glitches and tips i have found.*players cant join from menu (as i said above there is a way around this for now)*pukie pukie gets caught in vines. now  i dont know if that is intentional but when they fly away they glitch on the vines >:D                  *WHY THE ♥♥♥♥  DOES MY PALICO GO RUNNING TO THE BOOK GIRL AND NOT ME WHEN WE MEET UP?? i feel like a horrible owner is there some way you can put a pet feature in for the palico? or i can give them a treat? i want to let them know they are appreicated </3*push to talk would be nice as there is no way to adjust my mic input in game and if i turn it off i cant hear anybody talking to me which kinda sucks cuz voice chat is an amazing feature*key bindings are totally welcome i just upgraded my mouse it has buttons i just dont have a use for them in game i would like to...

5049,DeadStrife,https://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstrife/,3,,1,500.7,September,"3,",249,0,1,"Monster Hunter is a niche game. It's always been a niche game. Go look up an old review for the oldest Monster Hunters, it's not pretty. But it's always had a large fanbase. Large enough to consider porting the game to a medium (The PC) that isn't very well understood by Japanese Developers. Monster Hunter World is the most successful Japanese made game on Steam, and one of the most Successful games on Steam period, and because of that it's no surprise that so many people do not recommend this game. It's no surprise that so many people would be furious with the port as it's not as well optimized as it could be in many regards. But often it's compared to the Dark Souls port to PC (a game that's praised despite this, for good reason), and that's kind of an unfair comparison, because this game isn't as bad a port by any means. The Good (Why I recommend it.)> Hunting oversized Lizards with oversized weapons> Modding Community> Visual eye buffet with higher end machines> Many mechanical QoL improvements for the series> Monsters and the world feel more alive than previously.The Bad (Why you might want to wait to spend your money, keep in mind some of these are being fixed)> Monster Hunter is a niche game. It can sometimes be nonsensical and frustrating.> Poor optimization in some cases. Especially when there are a lot of particle effects being created, even on the best PCs.*> Network issues.*The Ugly> Salt Factory. > Hackers exist and generally they help you on hunts. Capcom has no plans to do anything about them.> Previous quality Monster Hunter titles typically have waaay more content. *These are things that Capcom is actively fixing right now, and there have been less issues since the week of release, but they are still present issues at the time of this writing. Anyways, I'm honestly just trying to bump the score up with this review. The game is too good to have such a negative Steam score, but a lot of what people are saying is fair. If you read this far you're probably looking through all the positive reviews to feel good about your purchase or something in the sea of bad reviews. Why did I write this"

The mouse feels great, the game runs extremely well (but I have since upgraded to an RTX 3090 FE - now the game runs at 5K DLSS pushing 85-100fps!), the performance can be optimized by turning off volumetrics (makes the image so much sharper and contrastier while giving better fps). Iceborne made the game a lot more fleshed out as well - love it!Definitely recommended now, even though it's still very different from the classic MH games.Day1 review: I'm a HUGE fan of the MH series, but I'm giving this game a thumb down and a middle finger up for the following reasons (until fixes are issued):1) MOUSE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE! What they did was map the mouse to a virtual analog stick, so you deal with things like ""deadzones"" and a speed cap for movement, making everything very stupid on the mouse. RIP gunners... Don't force me to play with a damn controller! The chinese MH Online works wonderfully with a mouse - apparently Japan has no PC gaming industry and knows nothing about how things are done...*smh*2) Online keeps dropping. So far my friends haven't got the game, so not yet a problem, but will need to be sorted out3) Weird bloom/blur over everything... I want a sharp, contrasted image, not a mess that maybe used to work on a TV a bazillion feet away from one's eyes with contrast pumped up on the TV.4) Too many things are mapped onto the same keys. Again, going back comparing to MH Online - MH World needs more flexibility... I'm a blademaster, but I hear gunners have problems with this particularly.5) This probably also worked on TVs a bazillion miles away from your face, but the texture detail is pretty garbage up-close... Definitely needs a high res texture pack!6) Tutorials....tutorials...more tutorials... I'm sick of them!!!! I'm a veteran and there should have been an option to turn the damn things off, like in all the previous releases. You know, you load up a game and it asks ""have you played before? Do you need a tutorial?""- you hit ""no, F off, I'm a veteran"" and go have some fun...Annoying stuff that annoys the crap out of me as a long-time MH fan who played EVERYTHING ever since MH Freedom on PSP:1) Story. Sorry, but it's not only unnecessary but also crap. I Want to hunt monsters and craft stuff, not spend an hour on cinematic and ""follow this guy"" nonsense. The old games had almost no story and it was perfect.2) Autocraft of potions is weird3) Why am I allowed to have the full item box in the camp? Makes no sense. The old inventory system worked wonders, even with the addition of transporter felynes - made gathered item management a good and realistic gameplay mechanic.4) The ""fireflies"" or whatever they are. Stupid mechanic, takes up too much screen space, too much hand-holding and glows in your face for no reason. Hate it.Notes: Don't know if it's my settings or what, but 60-80fps on a 1080Ti (no SLI support, so I can't use my second card) at 1440p is a bit...low...I'll update this as I discover new things and the game gets updated. Hoping for fixes at LEAST for the darn mouse emulation thing, raw input is a MUST."

I recommend this game."" But I can not. Dont get me wrong though if this game works on your computer then by all means play it. Its wonderful and great. The graphics are so detailed and you can get lost in the game play. I never seem to get tired of taking a big monster down or goofing off with my friends.However the reason I give this a thumbs down is because there is a group of users that cant play this game without it crashing constantly with no rhythm or reason. I could get on for a second and crash or do a few missions and crash. The crash can be as simple as being kicked out the game to locking up the whole computer and forcing me to restart the whole thing. I have tried so many different options to fix this but I feel like its a combination of things one being my radeon card and maybe the internet. Its all speculation though and those of us that do have this problem its like were this small niche of people and its not worth their time to fix the issue. So for all those unheard people I hope my thumbs down helps bring some attention to the problem.And as you can see I have put some time into the game 141 hours to date. I crash about 4-5 times in an hour so that is what 564-705 crashes since I have gotten the game. I am rank 12 now. And so you all know as well if you crash in a mission or while you are out doing things you lose all progress and items. That is what is more annoying then anything. Its very frustrating."
5059,darthaegis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stechyo/,4,,1,107.2,February,"2,",386,0,1,"[The final paragraph serves as a TLDR.]Monster Hunter: World is an action RPG where you (obviosuly) hunt monsters. You do this mostly to turn their hides, scales, fangs, tails, etc. into armors and weapons that look cool. The game has a story and... it exists. I'm not a huge fan of grinding and I enjoyed this game quite a lot, though I'm not very likely to keep playing after finishing the game because I've already crafted the weapons I liked and I'm quite satisfied. However, if you like grinding to get a ""perfect"" build, there's easily hundreds of hours of gameplay to have. The game has a bunch of quests which consist of killing one or more large monsters, which are set in different open areas. You can also just explore these areas with no mission attached. Each area is fairly large, and it's just full of plants, fungi and animals. Smaller monsters have their own special loot (or just raw meat you can barbeque yourself), and different plants and small animals can be picked up to craft consumables, to be thrown as projectiles, or activated to heal you or do more interesting things such as releasing paralyzing gas or poison. The environment itself can be used in hunts: slopes and cliffs enable you to jump and try to mount a monster, and some terrain makes monsters get stuck in it when you attack them. It's pretty fun to walk around these places gathering stuff and then getting to know what to use against monsters when you hunt them later, and with all the density in bugs, plants, animals... These areas have so much detail they feel quite ""lived in"", in a way. When you're not exploring or on a hunt, you're in Astera, a sort of home base where you can forge and upgrade gear, eat food for buffs, collect materials you can set to farm while you're out and select bounties, which are minor MMO-style quests (""mine stuff 15 times"") that you'll do anyway, but they give you good rewards.Missions usually consist of hunting a certain monster, with limits on time, number of faints (if your health turns to zero, you faint and return to the nearest camp inside that area) or retrieving the monster without killing him. The game is really fun because you start to understand the environments and the monsters. With some time, you know where they're going to go and can sort of think ahead about how you can engage each monster, and what you need. Monsters have a certain tendency to start infighting and start a ""turf war"", and you can use this to your advantage to get some damage on your mark. If you feel the other monster is doing to much damage, you can just throw dung at him so he'll leave your target alone. If a monster goes to sleep, just plant explosive barrels on their tail to try and cut it off, and he might even just die right there with your explosive finisher! There's just a lot of fun stuff you can take advantage of to slay your monster faster.Of course, the ""classical"" method of damage dealing is weaponry. The game has 14 weapon archetypes, each with a huge tree of different weapons, which require parts from different monsters. After the game's intro, you get the starting version of all types, and you can try them out in a ""training area"". I ended up liking the switch axe (an axe that can turn into a gigantic anime sword) and the insect glaive (a glorified vaulting pole which enables you to jump around hitting monsters, combined with an insect that collects extract from different monster parts, each part giving you different bonuses). Each weapon has their own special mechanic apart from just different movesets, and each branch in their trees has different benefits (elemental damage, status effects) so there's just an insane amount of variety in weaponry. Pretty much the only grinding I did was for a switch axe, a glaive and dual daggers. Apart from weaponry, each armor set has different bonuses as well, and decorations can be applied to them with the bonus of your choosing, making for the potential of customizing your build to perfection (though that is likely to require a lot of grinding).Each monster has mostly different movesets and behaves in different ways. Some dragons like to fly around while others are just too heavy and mostly walk around. If it has a tail, it's gonna use it against you if you try to spam attacks behind it, though you can try to cut it off and reduce that nuisance. As I mentioned, you can mount monsters. After a successful mount, the gameplay boils down to button mashing and the occasional quick time event ending up in a finisher move which knocks down the monster, but it's still pretty cool to see the monster desperately trying to shake you off, to the point where it headbutts walls to try and get rid of you. Hunts have good pacing since monsters will usually run away somewhere else after a while. This not only makes it so you don't get bored of fighting in the exact same place after a while, but it also gives you some breathing room so you can heal up, sharpen your weapon (they get blunt and ineffective after a while), and plan your next move. After a while, they start limping and return to their ""home"" to sleep, at which point you can capture them alive or, as I mentioned, blow them up. This game is extremely fun, and I loved my time with it. However, it's also very flawed when concerning things outside of the core gameplay. For starters, the online is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ garbage. I've been disconnected seven times for no reason, and when searching quests, I never find more than five. I mean, am I doing something wrong? There are always over fifty thousand people playing, yet the game can't show more than a few quests. The PC port is also not very good. While the game ""only"" crashed once, it drops down to 40 FPS whenever the screen gets too many particles. I've got a GTX 1060, and at the very least there could be a graphics setting for particle quality so I can turn it down and keep a stabler framerate. The UI is also a bit of a cluster♥♥♥♥. Yes, the game is quite complex, but there's dozens of different menus and doing anything requires at least three or four clicks. One of the most annoying things is that you can set custom loadouts so you always have the exact items you need in a hunt, and you can set hotkeys for items and messages, but even though these have completely different menus and means of access, they're linked together. If you set a loadout, then set hotkeys and then select your loadout, the hotkeys reset because you didn't guess that you must first set your hotkeys and only then save your loadout (or maybe I'm dumb and missed one of the text dump tutorials which said that). Also, there's a menu with the sole function of switching from a gamepad-friendly radial menu to the keyboard-friendly hotkeys. The game can automatically switch from keyboard button prompts to gamepad, but I guess switching menus as well is too hard or something. Also regarding keyboard and mouse, why in the everloving ♥♥♥♥ is the Interact button left mouse when you're in your home base, but right mouse when you're on hunt? Right mouse isn't used in your home base, so there's no point to this weird change. Yes, this is a nitpick but it's extremely triggering. Yes, I'm probably being autistic.Monster Hunter: World is excellent. The game is just super fun to play and its complexity and variety mean that you won't get bored quickly. Even if you only do the main quest, it's easy to play a good 40 hours and enjoy most of it. However, the PC port isn't very good, the UI is a bit of a mess and I'd maybe not recommend this game if you plan on playing online, since there's frequent disconnects.

Armor and upgrade combinations are too many to count. Environments are vivid and offer a lot of exploration, they each offer their own quirks and hazards. The multiplayer is robust but painless as you are left to your own devices unless you seek out to participate with others.Works great with Keyboard and Mouse, so a gamepad is not essentialSome downsides, at least personally, would be the lack of gamepad rebind customization, I was on a Souls binge and the muscle memory messed me up.

5083,Marked One,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UrbanMez/,2,,1,425.2,February,"22,",632,0,1,"I am re-writing my review after Capcom has updated their game over time. Originally I decided to not recommend this game for Co-op based players due to the sheer amount of disconnects/network issues & poor handling of scaling, migration & other issues stemming from this. Since then, aside from keeping the disconnected person's slot occupied on disconnect, all issues have been resolved. This game is an absolute delight and time sink. The gameplay loop is surprisingly deep & will have you playing for hundreds of hours to master techniques and learn the game world. At no point did the loop break and I feel like I was wasting my time even after hundreds of hours. This game is not for the weak of will, there's an epic ton of systems to learn, styles to fight with, mods to work with, monsters to fight and lots more content. You will be playing this for quite some time trying to get all the content and by the time you get to it, they'll release more. There is no game series that matches the monster hunter series, and even with the more simplified version that is Worlds, it's truly an experience for even the most novice of players. The depth of the hunts & gameplay systems really drives home how much the developers care about their games. The graphics are beautiful and are part of why I haven't been able to play Rise yet as I've been spoiled with the game engine in World. Each location is intricately designed with quite the attention to detail that will immerse you in the game. The sound design is spectacular and has an OST worth streaming (which is on Spotify fyi). The plot gets a little banal after time, but the fights certainly do not. Each one gets progressively more & more bombastic and intense, requiring you to learn new move sets, weaknesses & other tactics to adapt and over come. You have at least 300+ hours of content with just the base game not including DLC's. This game WILL take your time, but it tends to respect it. If you are the type of person who tends to only jump on for an hour or two, this game COULD work for you but you will have problems further down the road in terms of progression as some hunts can take 45 minutes + to complete. The game plays solid in co-op and is strongly recommended to be played in either public or with friends as it really shines during those co-op only moments."

Pros: Graphics, Story, Gameplay, Multiple Character Slots, Upgrade TreeCons: Matchmaking system, Hub Area, Random DisconnectsPROS: The Graphics and Gameplay are determined on what computer you have. The Multiple Character Slots is good if you have another person that uses your computer and wants to play Monster Hunter: World. The Upgrade Tree at the beginning is slow but after 10 or so monster fights you get an expanding tree to upgrade your weaponry.CONS: The Matchmaking System for me ruined the experience to play with other people either my friends or random people I would've liked to meet playing this game. Sadly the Main Hub for you and others to meet isn't in the Tradeyard or Canteen but in a seperate area called the Gathering Hub, so you cant meme with your friends in the spawning area of Astera. (READ) The random disconnects in hunts made this game unplayable with other people and honestly made me hate this game to the point where I say NO to anyone who wants to buy something overpriced $60 AAA game that has worse servers than MW2, A.K.A 2009 servers on a 2018 AAA game.

5087,Tumtums,https://steamcommunity.com/id/tumtums/,2,,1,115.1,August,"14,","1,171",0,1,"Overall I like this game. If you tried dauntless and liked it, this is similar but with much more to do, multiple monsters in the same area and with expeditions, cycling monsters in and out of the area with up to three large monsters in the area at the same time. The monsters will even attack each other. Story is rather annoying with the unskippable cutscenes and the handler. Expeditions seem to be where I enjoy the game the most but every mode has it's benefits.There are several poor design choices such as limiting your time to loot the area after finishing your task to 60 seconds while making it so that the camera pans around to different angles and being unable to carve the target for the first 10 seconds. If you think the meme of REEEE is annoying, you will despise this game. The screeches can be as frequent as 30 seconds for a single monster and up to three can fight each other in the same area making it almost non stop at times.I see a lot of people complaining about multiplayer but I have primarily been playing solo. I have noted that sometimes if I alt tab I will get disconnected from the online session but it continues in offline mode."
5088,meow pal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oodlesofnoobles/,2,,1,268.5,August,"13,",136,0,1,"There are lots of negative reviews here, this is a solid monster hunter game.Lemme try to clear it up, the game has really great hunting, the maps are full of gathering spots and the tweaks on combat have made this far more accessible and less frustrating than previous versions of the game. It plays really well.The downside is the early part of the game is focused on solo play through the main assigned missions. There is little room for true multiplayer here because of the lock on other players joining missions if all of those players haven't watched the cutscenes. So it is a pain to play this with your buddies. However, the optional quests after the story are completely joinable.Other than that, if you press ""matchmake"" for online you will have a bad time with disconnecting. Instead you should search for the quest you want to do and join a party.Finally, the game needs push to talk options for voice chat.

5089,Sellyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aesoup/,3,,1,62.6,August,"10,",621,0,1,"Please check minimum and recommended specs before you buy the game. Now, assuming you did that, the port is very good. i7-6700k and GTX1070FE nabs me 80+ fps with infrequent drops. Monster Hunter World was amazing on the PS4 and being able to play it at 60+ fps is a dream come true. Highly recommend that you turn off Volume Rendering as it adds 10-20 fps. If you've never played a monster hunter game before, the gameplay involves you tracking down large prey and killing them. Every attack in the game is dodgeable and over time you will learn when an opening is safe to attack and when it isn't, what works well against different monsters, and what doesn't work at all. Improvement in the game comes in weapon and armor smithing, which requires ore and monster parts that you will accumulate as you hunt. You can play through the game perfectly fine on your own, but you can also engage in up to 4 player co-op and even call in other hunters on the fly when you need help (S.O.S flare). Do not be ashamed in failure - it happens to even veteran players, learn from your mistakes and try again.The game is a lot of fun, but it also involves a lot of RNG in farming monster parts as certain ones are rarer than others."

Most of the time this happens DURING a mission. - Why can't you re-join a multiplayer session during a quest if aforementioned disconnects happen? Quests take a good half hour if not more, it's extremely frustrating to be either forced to complete the quest separately or abandon it altogether.Aside from the questions above I do not recommend this game, at least not at the state it is in currently. The premise is interesting and the game itself is fun IF IT WORKS, but arbitrary decisions like disallowing multiplayer because of cutscenes RUIN the entire experience! Am I not allowed to progress through the game with my friends?! If I could I would refund this game, but the introductory cutscenes, character creation and tutorial alone take two hours so I suppose that's off the table. To anyone considering to buy this game to play with friends I can only say: Don't! Once again Japanese game devs prove they are incapable of providing a functional and streamlined multiplayer experience. Honestly I don't know why I expected Monster Hunter: World to be any better."

I know that there has been a lot of issues with disconnects in mutliplayer.  Although I think it's bit better than it was. I've played Monster Hunter 1 & 2 on PSP, and 3 on Wii, and 4 on 3DS... so I'm a bit of a fan of the series.  I was eager to get into MHW when I first heard about it, but was sad to hear it wasn't on any platform I owned... and I am done buying gaming consoles.  But I was very excited to hear about it's release on PC!  Finally!  A Monster Hunter on PC!  I've been wanting this for a long time!This game is a blast to play! You are a puny human that hunts monsters that are larger than life! You have to track them down and brawl it out in an epic heart-pumping battle! You really feel like you have the disadvantage and you really have to fight hard and strategize to bring the monster down. It gives you a very satisfying sense of accomplishment when you are victorious over a particularly nasty monster.The areas are very diverse and the monsters feel almost real. Some monsters will have turf wars that can be so entertaining to watch, it can be easy to forget your mission objective!  Even fighting the same monster can still be a very different experience because you never know what will happen.  Will another monster come in and stir things up? Will something happen in the environment that will throw a monkey wrench in your plans? You never know. And the fun and excitement is multiplied when playing with friends.For those that have played the previous Monster Hunter games, there are some changes in this one that I see as improvements.  Some may disagree, but I'll list some so you can decide for yourself:All of that said, there are still some multiplayer issues from time to time.   There's nothing more frustrating than starting a multiplayer investigation with a voucher only to be kicked off and be stuck in a mission scaled for multiplayer. At that point you can either tough it out and try to fight monsters that are not intended for single player... or  you can give up and accept that you will lose the investigation and voucher.  But in all, I think it's worth it. It's currently my favorite PC game."

Fine. But Iceborne was also delayed four months and was delivered with many bugs, including critical of people losing game saves with hundred of hours of gameplay and regression in title's performance.What's worse, Capcom butchered title with some background checks and DRM that degrades performance. The most stupid workaround confirms it, as when launching and clicking RMB on title icon and selecting ""Close"" gives small prompt, which asks if you want to close - just ignore it and play, with stable 60 FPS on highest settings with high resoultion texture pack. It was added with Iceborn expansion, update shove to everyone even without expansion. Now they have to stabilize and tweak it for many people to work.It's not Epic Store and F2P knock-off Dauntless, but a large publishing house with AAA franchise that broke sales record - it should not stand for such an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up release."

No words can even describe how.I loved learning the moveset of a fire breathing T-Rex. I loved being a superhuman capable of carrying and slicing a fat lizard with a chunk of metal almost as big as a 2 metre door. I loved swinging around a golden katana like some 11 year old in black ops 2 attempting a 720 flash swap silent shot final killcam with their golden DSR-50 to try to apply for FaZe. I loved re-enacting Attack on Titan scenes with my dual blades. I loved making builds. I loved being a team healer and a damage dealer. I loved turning my boring archaic iron crossbow into a 21st century monster shredding shotgun. I loved unwinding in my private royal room after fighting a pissed off hungry pickle monster. I loved getting my ass spanked by a spikey dragon then overcoming it and later slaying it more times than I've had hot dinners. I loved hunting monsters, co-op and solo. I loved all weapon types (especially charge blade). What you read above was only some of the World experience, so basically even if you didn't get Iceborne you're still gonna have fun, whether it be simply finishing the story or continuing your adventure till endgame. ""But if World is fun, why should I bother with Iceborne?"" you might ask.Basically, take everything that world did, expand and improve on it, and you've got Iceborne.Here are some Iceborne exclusive features:- You can visit your friend's luxurious room filled with fluffy creatures (that they kidnapped from some jungle probably) after fighting a super saiyan monkey with a naruto cosplayer.- After further exploration of an area you get rewarded with the ability to chase monsters by riding a big raccoon thing (that sentence has multiple meanings) called as a Wulg. (Though, you can literally do anything while riding except for checking hunter notes? c'mon Capcom)- New weapon combos. Some of these weapons' moves are such a big deal because they add completely new play styles or nice DPS gains. (Example: Charge Blade Savage Axe mode, Longsword special sheathe, LBG evasive reload, A Thousand Dragons for Bow and, my favorite one so far, Sword and Shield perfect rush)- Lots of monsters were added (including ones from older MH games), and a snowy area was added too to accompany them. Afterall, you're gonna be fighting Diego from Ice Age, that thing can't adapt in any area except for snowy regions amirite.- Moar armor and weapons. (but to be honest some Iceborne weapons look pretty bland, although you can ""mask"" the appearance of your weapons to compensate for this)I could go on even more about how good this game is. Even though there's a few things in this game that are obnoxious to me like the tenderizing mechanic and , you honestly shouldn't worry too much about them if you are planning to play casually.TL;DR: Try to get the expansion too. From swinging around explosive giant transforming axes and riding literal steel dragons able to manipulate wind to arm wresting with friends, this game truly has an unforgettable experience and a long lasting endgame."

5118,RickyWL,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RickyWL/,2,1,0,32.9,August,"13,",428,0,1,"Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game plagued with many, many technical issues that it frankly shouldn't have due to delays. When PC gamers were told to wait for an extra 6 months so the devs could polish it, many people trusted them, expecting that they would legitimately use the time to make the port as great as it could be. What we instead have is a poorly optimized game with virtual joystick controls, horrendous networking and a poorly designed co-op story mode where players have to ""watch cutscenes"" before they can join each other. When Monster Hunter World works however, it's *so* much fun. It's honestly difficult to not be able to recommend MHW because from a gameplay perspective it's utterly fantastic, but the irritations that come with this dreadful port job mean I can't recommend it in good conscience. I hope they've learnt their lesson for the inevitable Monster Hunter World 2; Capcom may have goodwill from people this time for finally bringing MH to PC, next time I'm not so sure."
5119,MoldyShishkabob,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156041869/,2,,1,997.3,August,"13,",140,0,1,"Played MHW when it was out on PS4 and XBox. Compared to that version, though, everything has been the same for me but better. Only complaints I seem to see from other reviews that I really agree with are the CPU usage and the server issues, and the latter could/will likely be fixed in the near future anyway.Maybe I just have low standards, coming from 20 sec XBox loadtimes to 1 sec PC loadtimes, and from the 30 FPS and low resolution of the 3DS games.That said, Monster Hunter is an experience best made with friends, whether it's alongside a veteran of the series who can help show the ropes through the first five hours, or if it's alongside a few others who are just there to have a good time. I hope the server issues can be fixed soon to help reflect that a bit better on the newcomers on PC.That said, looking past some of the technical issues that seem to plague the reviews section... There isn't a Monster Hunter game that's generally friendlier to beginners than this game. Though the tutorial seems long, I honestly think it's a necessary evil compared to ""here's the controls, now get your butt handed to you by the first (and easiest) big monster"" that seems to happen in past games.Once you get past the tutorial, some of the best gameplay in the entire series opens up, in my opinion. While past games were rigid and methodical (not a bad thing, but less welcoming), Monster Hunter World feels fluid and free in just how much detail is given to the moves of weapons and the general movement one has while fighting. Of course, monster movement is also much more fluid to compensate for this fact.Overall, I've been able to play about 9 of my first 10 hours on PC with a friend and it has been a fantastic experience so far, even in spite of how generally weird the process is for doing story missions with friends. Monster Hunter World may not have the same amount of content as Monster Hunter Generation Ultimate will at the end of this month, but the gameplay is of such good quality that I didn't think was possible, coming from an already high-quality series."

The gameplay has added mechanics that make the combat smoother. The AI is alot more smoother and not so unrelenting as it used to be. You can finally bowgun without feeling gimped. It's quite balanced with melee and ranged so I love bow gunning in this MH.Only gripe is the constant online disconnects. But this game is selling very very well so it's servers are hammered.If you have not played a monster hunter game before, you will need lube to make it through the first 24 hours of gameplay before you start to get good. Its like playing dark souls for the first time. You just have to git good. But don't give up, the pay off is huge.I'm about 1/3 of the way through and I'm quite satisfied. Would recommend this game for any serious gamer. This isn't casual land where rainbow and unicorns exist. There is a ramp up to a high skill ceiling. It feels good to get there. The question is are you too casual or do you want to git good kid? Be the gamer we need. Show capcom how we reward good games that don't cater to casuals and instead reward skillful mechanical play.10/10, enjoy :)"

It seems the PC port is well done, a few graphics settings that are missing would be nice to have patched in, but it is in my opinion not that bad with quite a few settings compared to other console ports. The online is more complicated than it should but the as long as you join a friend who is either at the same place in the story or behind you, it seems to function correctly. Only problem I've had with online is that I can't join a private session even with an invite, even though the game specifies that invites should still work. A little patch to fix these issues and the game is perfect. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but it is meant to be very grindy, as where the other Monster Hunter games. If you are not looking for a grindy game then this is not for you. I will definitely recommend this game for people who are interested in this kinda game, and like these types of games. If you are unsure if it is your cup of tea, I would suggest watching some gameplay videos or reviews as the intro scenario and tutorial takes more than 2 hours and therefore might remove any possibility of a refund."

5139,Mohl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mohl97/,3,,1,483.9,August,"23,",254,0,1,"It's a fantastic game, but it's a pretty bad PC port. That said, if your PC is beefy enough for it to run effectively, the game will easily last you hundreds of hours, probably even thousands.Capcom's working to fix the various issues (both in terms of optimization and disconnects), but until then, it's rather hard to play multiplayer, either due to not being able to connect to other players in the first place, or getting disconnected halfway through a hunt and being forced to deal with a scaled up monster alone.Also of note is a ""bug"" where the final credits cutscene can corrupt your save file. This is false, and is actually just the game crashing due to your computer not having the proper codec to run the video. As it's usually installed with windows (but not Windows N versions), it doesn't affect most people, but for those that are affected, you can simply find the proper codec online and download it, and you'll be able to continue as normal.Overall, the game's a gargantuan diamond that's somehow covered in some rust. Once it gets polished, it's going to pretty much take over your free time. In a good way, not ""you gotta grind for 4 weeks to make any progress at all""."

The addition of guiding lands is a good imo, while it includes a different kind of grind, at least it removed the RNG part of Augment hunting.The main shortcomings are (in my opinion):- Clutch claw and its fluidity. I really dislike how you have to drop everything just so you can extend the ""clagger"" animation. - Some performance issues. While I hadn't experienced it, and from what I hear its mostly fixed, I still know people had suffered its issue with their systems (and I am not talking about 10 year old laptops having issues with it) - I know a friend of mine had problems with CPU usage on Intel x9700- While there are quite a few monters, once your gear gets pretty good 80% of the monsters just become irrelevant. Regardless of its shortcomings, I still love this game and would recommend it to anyone who likes action games and isn't afraid from a bit of a grind."

5178,Hex: Thicc Booty,https://steamcommunity.com/id/osamuinoue/,2,,1,427.2,March,"27,",50,0,1,"The overall graphics and story is just immersive. The sounds and effects are excellent. First, the graphics is outstandingly overwhelming, especially when the high texture mode and DLC are installed. However, I'm not going to tap into that because it needs a powerful PC and I only play on my Ryzen 3 2400G processor and it runs great. Even with the lowest graphics, it still runs good and the immersive element is not lost.Focusing on the story, it gives a heart-warming feeling with a dash of that ""success"" moment when you hunt/slay/capture a monster, best with friends involved as well. The music and sounds perfectly fits the scenes where you have to listen where the roars are coming from in hunts, down to the small details of water flowing from the walls in Hoarfrost Reach----the ambiance in Seliana's gathering hub and the environment change during various weathers and time of the day.Moreover, materials and the difficulty of gameplay isn't that hard when you just know what you are doing. The game made it clear about monster behaviors because you'll know when  to capture or when the monster is really weak to slay it. I am still hoping for more to come in the future and I hope Capcom would do its best to attend to its multiplayer area.I would really recommend this game to any other players wishing for an immersive hunt! In the real world, we must conquer evil by hunting it and wearing those ""scars"" as our armor and weapon to defeat them!"

Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game that you should go out and play right now if you're fan of:- The Monster Hunter Series (obviously).- Constant and pure boss fights.- Teamwork.- Rewarding gameplay.- A good amount of content.There's absolutely no contest. In my opinion, as a Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate player, this is the best game in the series to date. Some aspects can be fixed and/or improved but the overall package is pure Monster Hunter love all around.I would've liked to see some monsters returning to the franchise but the new monsters do scratch that itch you're looking for. However, not everything is flowers and roses, like I said. The game has a few negative aspects that I do not find pleasing at all:- Your HR(progress) is locked behind a main story.- Unskippable cutscenes, UNSKIPPABLE CUTSCENES WHY.- Can't join a hunt if the player is doing a main story hunt and they haven't watched all cutscenes (WHY DID THEY DO THIS).- No G-rank (as of now, but iceborn will add Master Rank).- Bad gathering hub this time around. It's pointless to use it mostly.- Not good optimization for PC although it's been slightly improved (I run the game perfectly with a FX 8320 and a RX 480).- NO ZAMTRIOS.Everything else are pros from my point of view. Just be aware, if you plan to buy it to play with your friends, every single one of you will have to join a main story hunt separately, then leave and join to a single one after the cutscenes play. I still have no idea why they thought this was a good idea. The cutscenes played just fine in MH4U.Those are the caveats I found and this comes from a Monster Hunter fan. Happy hunting!"

If you like extremely satisfying combat (bow ftw), immersive environments, engaging co-op, and challenging battles with well designed AI, then this game is the jackpot. The grind may be excessive at times due to dumb RNG chances for certain items, but imo the combat and the monsters more than make up for it. Moreover, people who are expecting a deep storyline will be disappointed as its a very straightforward plot (normal for MH). However, the game has a very interesting and well thought out lore.Overall, the game is a 10/10 from me :)"

Always hunted with my friends irl and we had the most fun playing the PSP Monster Hunter games back in the day. Hammer main since MH Freedom baby.If you like Monster Hunter you will like this game.My only complaints are that we need more monsters to hunt, which also ties in to another complaint I have is that there are not enough weapon trees and armor sets. Bring back all the old monsters and maybe some of the old maps reimagined in Monster Hunter World style (would love to have some of the original maps from MH1, the old forest, jungle, or swamp maps.) If they bring back more old monsters they can add a lot more variety to the weapon trees in this game as well as new armor sets to collect.Put my boys Rajang, Plesioth, Yian Garuga, and Khezu in Smash and this game would be 10/10.(Edit as of Iceborne) They added my boys Rajang and Garuga. Hell just bring back everything at this point imo. Next DLC should be an island/tropical based DLC with Plesioth, Hermitaur/Cenataur, Lagiacrus, Plesioth, Ludroth, and Mizutsune.

Upon playing it I realized how amazingly fun the game was and the beauty of the world! Everything from the combat, monsters, quests, and story, all of it gave me thrills I haven't had for years from other AAA games. Then it got to the 'end game' bosses the elder dragons. I was obsessed with farming gems and materials for my gear. While all the Elder Dragons were difficult there was one who stood above the rest. Not because of their roar and immediate thrashings, nor because of their damage that could sometimes kill me in one hit. Oh no it was much worse than that.The Monster that gave me the hardest time was one called 'Kushala Daora'. A giant steel dragon who loves to spam his attacks quite often. At the beginning of the fight it is not a problem and most of the time easy to avoid. However it was when the dragon was weakened and went back to the peak of the mountain that I truly began suffering. As you will all know, Monster Hunter World is so beautiful in the highest graphic settings and so I am sure many of you will play it this way. Yet if you fight Kushala Daora, don't. This is because after immediately waking up he will spam tornado's with swirling debris all over the area. Even with my excellent setup there was a very noticeable frame drop and everything was choppy. With the first fight, everything was alright. Yet after a few consecutive fights against Kushala Daora the unimaginable happened. My screen went black, and I got the dreaded message 'signal lost'. I figured it was just my monitor, unplugged and plugged back in, still though the same message. I tried a different monitor I had spare and yet still the same message. I was devistated, as I knew it had to be the graphics card. I took it to someone professional I knew and they told me it had been overclocked and will no longer work. I now have to get a new graphics card.So am I upset about the entity known as Kushala Daora spamming its gritty attacks all over the place like a spastic child? Yes. Am I mad that I now have to spend hundreds of dollars on a new graphics card to replace the one I had? Extremely so. Does this mean I would stop playing Monster Hunter World? Absolutely Not. It is an extremely fun game with lots of content to discover and intriguing stories coupled with badass monsters to kill. My only advice though is if you play this game on the highest settings, be prepared to lose your graphics card. Especially when fighting the blowhard Steel chick.TL;DR  Don't play this game on highest graphics settings against Kushala Daora. I suggest turning it all down. Still a fun game even if it costs me a couple hundred dollars now."

Does it have its issues? Of course it does, it's rare that releases like this that are this anticpated go over completely smoothly, and I very strongly disagree with the sentiment that it is just a ""half-assed"" PC port. I've seen much much worse. The multiplayer issues are much less of a port quality issue, and more of a SERVER issue. Let's not forget MH:W's multiplayer was basically unplayable for over a week at its release on console. I understand the frustration with how annoying the servers can be, but when a game slingshots up to the thirdmost game in Steam's concurrent players board the day of release, I feel like it's fair to expect some server issues. Especially when there's really no way to completely prep for a full release of that scale with new servers. When it comes to multiplayer, your yield may vary, for myself personally it has its hiccups but for the most part I've been able to do numerous succesful hunts with my friends, when it DOESN'T work however it can be a massive pain in the ass. That seems to be the BIGGEST gripe most are having with this game, but it's something I expect to be fixed soon as the amount of players levels out, or as Capcom patches the game in the future. However, there are two other issues as well.From what I can hear, the optimization can be pretty hit or miss for people. My friends and I all have PCs ranging from mid-high end, and most of us have little-no issue. The graphical settings are pretty specific and can be changed, if you're having issues I'd recommend turning a few settings down and it's easy to run consistently well on medium at or above 60 fps on most mid-range rigs.The secondmost problem being mouse controls and camera controls. The camera requires getting used to, and I changed my settings a few times to find what I was most comfortable with, but it'd be better if they were to update or patch it to be more user-friendly. Mouse controls are a straight no-go for me, unless you're using a ranged weapon of some sort. Otherwise, I pretty much only use my controller for this game, and with the response to the mouse controls I'd recommend the same.Overall, much fun to be had.- Load times have the speedforce, especially on an SSD- Higher framerate options, higher resolution options- Multiple inputs supported- Steam integration is cooler than squads, fight me.All this on top of an already amazing game with a beautiful world. The tradeoff is the servers may be janky SOMETIMES, maybe a few frame drops for you, and mouse acceleration will take some getting used to.BUY IT!!"

Hands down. Whether it be the grinding system, rewarding combos, amazing monsters or simply awesome level design. This game is incredible. The regions vary widely, and the design is as beautiful as it is complicated. The little details in every aspect of the game really make it shine. Capcom has done an amazing job at polishing this game to a bright shine when it comes to graphics. Another aspect of the game I love is the grinding system. Unlike other games where one must defeat masses of weak enemies, this game has one boss-like target to defeat over 15-50 minutes. It feels like a fight for your life, not an endless grind like other games. Additionally, the grinding system also promotes skill. The more mastery you have of your combos, the more effectively you will break monster's parts, and the more loot you gain. The crafting system of weapons, armour and other items (I. e Jewels) is also great. The online multiplayer in this game is what truly sets it apart. Especially on console, and somewhat on Steam, hoping into a chat with strangers and helping them or receiving help like its no issue is so good. Making friends, memorable moments and an overall atmosphere of positivity surrounding MHW are among the many things that Online has done for both the series and myself as a player. The Session system could be more polished, especially on console where the servers sometimes crash and disconnects often occur. That aside, I've seen no such issues on PC.Overall, this is an absolute legendary game that will forever hold a place in my heart. Watching the final Dev Diary and listening to the 'Stars at Our Backs' OST play for what I thought was the final time made m appreciate how lucky and the rest of the MH community are to play such an amazing game. Worth the 80 AUD on console and 40 AUD on PC. The expansion is also one of the best I have seen. Also worth paying full price for. It doesn't matter what kind of games you played before (I came from Fortnite and COD), this game is worth investing your time and money (he he handler outfits go brrrrr) into."

Maybe not the best story, some new features might look weird, but having monster hunter on PC is a blessing.If you haven't played any monster hunter game before, this one is probably the best one to take you into the genre. Watch a few videos to see if you're gonna enjoy it, but you dont risk much considering the quite low price of the base game.Iceborne is only required when you've finished the base game, which means 20 hours if you rush it to 100+ hours if you take your time so feel free to buy it when you want to get to the next step after beating the main story"

When you start a combo, it’s done you can't change the way you attack, you must stop your attack and back off, reposition to attack... LAME and BORING, AND TRUST ME, you will repeat this almost 200 times in a gameplay session and in those 200 times you will get what? 20 full combos. The Combat System is so bad that there is only 5 or 6 weapon that are useful and trust me, useful, is a REALLY BIG WORD, because almost all weapon doesn’t have a decent combo. And the hitbox are TOTALLY BROKEN, you'll get hit from far and without any reason, trust me it’s going to happen a lot… the hit boxes are really broken. In the Arena mission you will see Canons and ballista and IF you finally manage to hit with the canon the Monster will just take no damage because he was mid animation to jump up while chasing your friend… WHAT A BAD GAMEPLAY. Oh, and let’s talk about this Connection Error that happen 200 times a day “Error Code: 50382-MW1” you can’t play with your friends or Online almost half the time and when you finally get to play with your friends, they get disconnected in the middle of the Monster fight. NEXT, the online is really bad, let me explain how the online works. You enter a server where a maximum of 16 people can join, BUT, there is no point about it because you are alone in town you can’t see them. You can talk to them but not the people on a mission AND THERE IS A WHOOOLLEE chat system with Emote, Emoji and Quote… BUT FOR WHAT??? If you can’t see them in town??? And there’s this area called “The Gathering Hub” where you CAN see the other players if they come there but again what the point??? To put a Social area nobody goes?Your character will clip through everything, wall, ground, objects and more. Your pieces of armor will clip through each others. Almost all the pieces of armor are ugly as f**k, in the end, you will just hate your character after building a build you like. Your character will look fat and feel fat while walking and fighting, it’s like nobody in the game have brains. If I was fighting Monster like those, I would want something solid and light, so, I can move more freely and have a lot more endurance.There is so many items that you'll get lost trying to search one item in your inventory. When you eat food you get a bonus, okay? but after you eat, you can't see if you have eaten or not in any menu, you can't see what bonus the food gave to you and your Palico after eating, it would have been nice to get a little menu or icon you can go to see a description of the actual effect you have.My opinion about this game? The Japanese doesn’t have standards in gaming and this game is bad AS F**K… SAVE YOUR MONEY and go play the Free-To-Play, Dauntless, this is the SAME game but with decent combat and connection.Overall: 4.3 / 10Story: 2/5Waifu: 0/5 (NO WAIFU AT ALL)Characters: 1/5 (All the armor are UGLY AS ""F"")Cinematics: 4/5 (I will give it a 5 but the fact that the gear is not there is really annoying me.)Gameplay: 2/5 Multiplayer: 2/5SFX: 4/5 (A lot of NPC are harrassing you if you don't do your mission right away.)Voice Acting: 2/5"

It's the kind of game for me that comes along for me once or twice in a generation, and consumes every waking moment of my gaming, for as long as I'm physically capable of playing it.The mechanics are wonderful, the monsters are incredible in both animation and gameplay perspectives. The world and exploration are just deep enough that you'll find new things to discover even after 40hrs, keeping you guessing and introducing you to new monsters with a drip-feed of tension and excitement. It mixes simplicity and complexity almost perfectly, and keeps you constantly surprised that there's even more content you haven't seen yet.Just when you feel like you've 'got it', and you're beating monsters in 15 mins instead of 35, it'll throw you yet another, deeper challenge; fight more than one or two of them, in the same 50min limit. The requirement to completely re-work your strategies and re-analyse your playstyle when faced with a new, seemingly unsurmountable challenge is fantastic. You're always working towards beating the next, more exciting, even more dangerous battle, and need to master the mechanics to overcome the greatest of the challenges presented to you.There's a lull in the action after the first 'main chunk' of story which some might find to be quite an intolerable grind. My only advice with this is to bear with it, the increase in challenge and complexity immediately after this is worth it!"

Some mods recommended, others more so for low quality setups.Concerning other reviews from earlier and other minor technical bits:When this game came out it had problems with its online play, disconnections were frequent and lead to lots of annoyed hunters, quit quests and lost time. Nowadays, the game has cleaned up its server problem and has been quite stable as of late. while there still might be disconnects, as far as i can tell its been entirely because of internet connections.The Game:Story:not going to spoil, story is fairly simple, always involves hunting something big and probably wants to eat you. progression is fairly good, although the story is focused on someone else.Characters:there are only really 3 characters in this game that you will care about, your hunter, your large assistant murder cat and the super buff cat who works the kitchen. There is also the Handler, your supposed partner who doesn't really do anything, and the story seems focused around her.Gameplay:Very solid.While there are 14 different weapon types in this game with their own individual playstyle, there's a weapon for everyone and they are relatively easy to pick up and use. now a quick summary of the weapons:Bow: fast, versatile firing, multishot bow, dodge for life, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ROCKET POWERED ARROW(called dragon piercer(you have infinite of these))Charge Blade: fast/medium speed, low/decent damage, can change between sword and shield and large axe, dodge/block for days, very versatile weapon, smack down and explode them mostersDual Blades: fast attacks, low damage, lots of hits, dodge for life, weeb weapon #1GreatSword: slow, hard hitting, charge up to hit harder, sheath and run or block to live, can shoulder bash a T rex to the groundGunLance: medium speed, high damage, single hard hits, block all day, EXPLOSIONS!?Hammer: medium speed, high damage, lots of hard hits, dodge for days, play wack-a-mole with the monster's faceHeavy bowgun: slow speed, medium damage, lots of ammo types, roll or block all day, choice of either dakka or anti tank rifleHunting Horn: medium speed, medium damage, casts buffs on allies and self, roll for days, SCOTTLAND *FOREVER*Insect Glaive: medium/fast speed, good damage, can self heal/boost defence/change movest, roll and fly for days, you control the skies nowLance: decent attack speed, decent damage, can block basically anything and charge, block for days, DEJA VULightbowgun: decent/burst fire speed, decent damage, can deploy mines, dodge for days, watch the monsters blow themselves upLongsword: average attack speed, average damage, pretty user friendly, dodge for days, weeb weapon #2, omae wa mou shinderuSword and shield: fast, low damage, fastest weapon in all senses, can block or dodge, very versatile, can use items without needing to sheath.SwitchAxe: medium/fast attack speed, medium damage, can swap between a slow axe or faster greatsword, dodge for days(best dodge in axe mode), exploding greatsword shoved in monster face.gameplay itself:choose from any of the above weapons to hunt your target, watch the flies guide your way/break your character's neck to show you the way. when you find the monster you group up and hit it till it dies. it will try to leave many times, there are ways to stop it like flashing it, mounting it, knocking it out, stunning it, trapping it. when monsters are low health you have the choice of capturing them by placing a trap at their feet and slapping down some tranqs or killing them while they sleep.VERY IMPORTANT:when a monster is asleep, they will take double damage from the next hit, good rule of thumb, the best people to wake up monsters are people who know the ins and outs of their weapon and who have very powerful/big weapons.The mods:The game has a fairly active modding community who have come out with fairly impressive and interesting mods. there are plenty of quality of life mods and another mod which means you don't need to compromise fashion for function. for lower grade setups there are mods which will make the game run smoother and will remove some of the annoying effects they need to patch options in for still. failing that there are shaders you can download to make it run easier sometimes.for a quick guide to how you install the mods, its fairly simple:most mods will have install instructions in the description, but most can be summed up simply as ""stick the file called Native PC into 'MONSTER HUNTER:WORLD' file in steamapps common."" just be sure to read the finer print of the mods you download to ensure you can get the most of them, though other mods will simply be their own applications, so take care which ones you go for."

And if you then add an extra slot and try to rejoin then.. you may have waited too long and wont' get quest completion credit anymore.Not to mention numerous quests require you to pick up the quest solo with your buddy doing the same, walk into the quest, listen to some dumb cutscene, walk around some, see a big monster, leave the quest, RE-accept the quest, RE-start the quest, go out with your friend now actually in tow and THEN you get to play.It's the most awkward, needlessly convoluted and stupidly frustrating system of multiplayer I've ever seen. Just share cutscenes, it's 2018, we've been showing cutscenes to more than one player at a time for decades. There's also dozens of ways to not constantly have players disconnect from one another or, at least, be able to *re*join easily.The game was delayed heavily for PC, is full-price, and there's a whole plethora of previous titles to learn from. This is a solidly ""don't bother"" review just because the multiplayer is so uttelry frustrating to get working, and it loves to fail constantly when you do finally get it working. Some will say ""oh well after the main story it works better"" - that's not a valid justification to me at all. It's multiplayer, we've been doing this stuff since LAN-playing Doom, and I sure didn't get disconnected, booted, have invisible players occupying slots, etc. etc. happen there. It's not that hard, and all these games that do it so poorly just boggle my mind.tl;dr - It's a game that is designed around multiplayer, yet multiplayer is absurdly convoluted and unreliable to get working. If anything goes wrong, you are screwed with progress/can't rejoin.edit: Okay, even after the disconnects are improved by altering settings, and ignoring the fact that there are a dozen ways the disconnects could be mitigated (none of which MHW does - if you disconnect, you're screwed)  - I'm leaving this as a not-recommend because the design is just dumb half the time. The game actively prevents you from playing and enjoying it. Why must I join a mission, see some pointless cutscene, leave a mission, and THEN get ot play with someone sitting right beside me? Have we not figured out how to share cutscenes?Better yet, why do we need the cutscene?Spoiler, here is EVERY SINGLE MISSION in the game: STart mission, aimlessly wander until you find tracks, follow tracks to spot, see pointless cutscene where your dumb handler stands in the way of danger, narrowly shove her out of the way/avoid an attack from the foe (who you may have seen/tracked a dozen times prior, doesn't matter!), and then begin fight.It's the same, mission after mission, and it's just tedious. Wasting 15 minutes running around to find a monster I already know the lair of just to see a dumb cutscene that is the same as every other cutscene so I can leave the mission and THEN restart the quest with someone I am co-oping with.. it's just needless tedium and wasted time.When you get to the fun part of the game - fighting monsters - it's fun. But getting to that part is way too tedious, there's absolutely no need for so much of the aimless fiddling and issues in design to get in the way of an otherwise good game. But given the price, and the delay of time they had to make stuff work right (did nobody test their game on the steam servers if it's solely steams problem?) I don't really consider it acceptable - it's bad design choice."

Controls react the same way they do in Darksouls, combat is also very much the same. The game literally gives you a guiding light to your target so there's no reason to ""hunt"" anything. Monsters seem to only have about 4-6 different attacks which due to the way combat works is why the game feels very artificially difficult. There are only about a dozen weapons each with their own upgrades and trees (usually 2-3) meaning actual content wise there isn't a lot here. There's not much story and there certainly aren't any survival aspects.On the other hand. The game is beautiful. I'm running a mid range comp (<1k$) and running on max with no issues. I've run into two bugs that are issues but are not everytime, alt tabbing can cause the game to crash (does this about 1/10 times), and their servers suck and boot you on occasion (seems like they are more likely to boot you when you are using them rather then when they are just running in the background). Ultimately it's a game that feels like running on a treadmill do to x do y to get z to go to x etc. etc. etc. I'm roughly halfway through the game doing all side content it's taken me about 20 hours so far and I'm just starting to hit the point with weapons where the skin looks the same as the last one. However armor is neat (if in many cases overly bulky and unattractive) and doesn't seem to recycle textures like weapons do and the monsters are interesting to look at and fight. Ultimately this game is a game about fighting large monsters like a t-rex with naught but a sword. If that sounds like fun this is a game for you. If not... well move along I guess? :P"

I started back on Tri in 2010 and have played almost every game in the series since then, excluding generations (waiting for the ultimate switch version which releases later this month). I just got to say, Monster Hunter has never looked or played this smooth. I thought that this might ruin the gameplay I have grown accustomed to over the years, but it really doesn’t. Some of the new mechanics I am still getting used to, but this seems like the logical evolution the series needed. Getting critical hits on monsters and shooting their face off with my heavy bowgun feels exhilarating to say the least. So far, it seems to be a tad on the easy side of things when it comes to monster hunter difficulty, but I am still fairly early on in the game and I am assuming that this will ramp up. I am crossing my fingers that we get some proper g rank up in here. I am honestly, a little sad with the way that multiplayer works. As compared to past games you could just post it and go. Here, you have the whole S.O.S. flares which in theory sounds great. Having a little trouble with that single player quest? Shoot off a flare and allies will come help you! I was excited because they claimed you could do the whole single player in multiplayer! In actuality, there are quests that you can’t join until they reach a certain cutscene. This seems silly and it is frustrating to go and join a quest and have the ui tell you you’ve failed to join and give no explanation as to why.  (Come on Capcom, it’s 2018, why can’t you get multiplayer correct?) As far as the pc port is concerned, I haven’t really had any issues. I have a 1060 and a Ryzen 1600 I get minimum 54 fps rarely and most times it sits stable at 60 fps. I turned off fxaa, ambient collusion, and the volumetric options. The game still looks great. A couple things I wish, would be an option to turn off motion blur, turn off motion blur, and TURN OFF MOTION BLUR! Did I mention TURN OFF MOTION BLUR? I am baffled as to why this option was not included? 99 percent of games allow you to do this from within the advanced option. Why Capcom? I wish Capcom would continue to optimize the game, as many reviews are complaining about terrible performance. I am not having issues, but I understand others are. Also, Capcom, turn off denuvo. Just please. I am not going to beat a dead horse for that aspect of the game. Overall on the pc port side of things, Capcom did an OKAY job, the gameplay however, I feel more than makes up for that. So, I am going to give this game a recommendation, just know that Capcom still has lots of room to grow when it comes to ports.*RE-REVIEW After putting more hours into the game I can really see how terrible optomized this pc port is, that along with the issues for multiplayer (dropping in and out randomly, making me lose connection to chat) I have to say, this port is far from finished. It is so frustrating it makes me not want to even play. Fix your game crapcom!"

Let me be clear in saying that this is an amazing game, probably one of the best I've ever played, but it's not a very good port. At least not yet. You should expect the game to improve drastically over the next few months as we start getting the same patches the PS4 version recieved. If you want to buy this game on the PC, that's absolutely fine. In fact I would reccomend it even more over the PS4 version. Just be aware that there are a few things that you're going to need in order to properly enjoy it. You should treat this game as if it's Dark Souls Prepare to Die edition. It's a port full of flaws, but a redeemable port none the less. What you'll need: And thats pretty much everything you need in order to have a decent experience like I'm having. One last point I'd like to make is that if you want to try the game out then I don't reccomend purchasing it and then refunding it if you don't like it. It takes well over 2 hours to get to the meat of what the gameplay is. By the time you know enough to form an opinion on the game you won't be able to refund it. Go on youtube and watch some other people play some of the earlier areas of the game first. Not only will this give you a safe way to tell if the game is something you'd like to play, but it will also preemptively teach you how to play."

Although it can be a bit grindy at times but that's a low price to pay for such a great game 8 out of 10 from me."

Good luck finishing any mission multiplayer as the game will constantly drop network connection.Certain monsters will suddenly gain MASSIVE phantom range, hitting you from literally opposite ends of the arena despite the animation not being anywhere remotely close. I attribute this to a desync issue as it typically happens when you were in a multiplayer lobby, although I have had it rarely happen during offline fights as well.Controls are about what you can expect from a Monster Hunter game, but with the presence of occasional control issues. For example, a command not going through or buttons becoming nonresponsive.These are only some of the more frustrating and prominent bugs in the game, there are plenty more. If these bugs didn't exist, I'd recommend the game."

Decent gameplay, good graphics, good story so far, amazing monster designs, really fun to play.Whoever is responsible for the servers and the idea for ""If someone DC's for half a second, we should remove them from their party, force them to solo quests, and make it impossible to reconnect to their instance without completely restarting the game,"" needs to have an actual pile of feces dropped on their doorstep. If you have shotty internet, such as Spectrum, and your internet lags occasionally, or every ten minutes, the MH team has made it impossible to play the game. You'll start an instance, of which most are designed to be played with multiple people, and as soon as the internet hiccups, you get disconnected. There's no reconnect option. You can no longer call for help. If you were in a party, your party members disappear. Your instance outside of the dungeon is now screwed until you quit the entire game and restart it. You can't connect to matchmaking again, you can't connect to friends' servers, you can't even make a new one. This is the WORST setup for disconnects I have ever encountered in a game. It's doubly frustrating that even if you have a monster at low health with your group, if it disconnects, there's a chance the monster will glitch back to full health and you have to solo kill it, from scratch, without your friends, from FULL HP, with the time limit still running. Yeah, no. 0/10 would not recommend unless you're a severe masochist who enjoys wanting to pull their eyes out of their sockets on every simple level."

5338,̧҉ ҉Minorou ꧁💀꧂,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Minorou/,4,,1,448.3,November,"27,",592,0,1,"Monster Hunter is a notoriously difficult series to get into, but with World, Capcom did their best to make it as accessible as possible for newcomers to the series while still maintaining that distinctive feel of a Monster Hunter game. Did they succeed? Somewhat. The recent popularity of similar games such as the Souls series did well to get people into the mindset for the genre, and the changes made to the series with World were an additional step in the right direction to get more people invested into the franchise. Now, more people than ever are playing Monster Hunter, and the series is doing well for it overall! However, the game is not perfect; it stumbles in a few areas.As Monster Hunter moved into its now ""fifth generation"" of the series, it's made some significant departures from some longstanding traditions. The archaic point threshold armor skill system was replaced by a more streamlined incremental skill system that makes more sense; an overall positive for the series that promotes more build variety. The change from segmented hunting areas to a seamless single area with no loading zones changes the tempo of the hunt dynamic dramatically, and greatly enhances immersion. Things are much more vertical now, and the addition of the slinger, a grappling hook/slingshot combination, is a great move. Other quality of life improvements such as the SOS system or eating food during a hunt are also a great benefit. Some might scoff at these improvements with ""back in my day"" comments, but honestly, things are a lot better now.The core of the game, combat, is better than ever. Each weapon is streamlined and smoothed out to feel great. While some weapons are naturally going to be more popular than others, they're all equally viable from early game to end game. If you want to main a weapon type, or be a generalist, you are always free to do so without any feelings of missing out. The verticality and environmental hazards of the areas also greatly enhance the hunt. No longer are you just fighting in ""zone 3"" with flat ground and dull scenery; every part of the hunting zones in World feels like a living ecosystem, with things to help or hinder you as you see fit.Overall, the game is great, and will carry a player for a hundred hours plus, easily. However, things are not all well. The early parts of the game force you to experience the story, and you can't do so in multiplayer; other players cannot join the hunt until everyone else has seen the same cutscene. If you're playing along with friends, this results in an awkward situation where everyone all starts the same mission solo, sees the cutscene, then everyone leaves their quest to join in on one player. It's an awful mess that critically messes up the multiplayer experience for the early game. In addition, you can't see other players in the same hub unless you're in a specific area of the town, but that area doesn't have access to the farm, the ship, the armory, or anything else critical to preparing for a hunt; people often just never go there, so even though you're often in a hub with up to 15 other players, you're not seeing them. Another unfortunate thing is that once you know what you're doing, the game is much easier solo; so except for a few specific situations, you're better off hunting alone anyway.Given that this is a new generation of the series, it's inevitable that the game has relatively few monsters compared to older generations. While it's satisfactory for the game itself, veterans of the series might be dissapointed with small variety of monsters given the huge amount we've had access to in previous games. New monsters will come in time, as Capcom is constantly working to give out free updates.The last major problem with Monster Hunter World is that the end game can be a bit underwhelming. Once you get over the novelty of fighting tempered elder dragons, you suddenly find out that grinding them is pretty much all there is left to do. Sure, there's a few distractions like Kulve Taroth events, but the majority of end-game is fighting the same four to five monsters over and over again for low chance RNG drops. Older games in the series handled this better.All in all, Monster Hunter World is a great game with a few minor gripes. After all, if you get 100+ hours out of it, can you really complain? I only put up the demerits above because I love the game so much and want to see it improve, and I know it will. Capcom's been releasing patches over the past few months, fixing the problems people have had with the game. It's not perfect, but it's well worth your time."

Some people love the old format with content upon content but for me that has gotten stale at the point WORLD has been a breath of fresh air. It's colourful, vibrant and gives my pc a run for its money finally. YES, it has been streamlined as i would make the campirison that WORLDS is the bloodborne of monster hunter fast paced and straight into the action. Which turned me off at first but honestly where the clunky difficult lacks in, it makes up for decently tough hunts. As a player who played MH before i found it a relativily easy breeze through. However non MH players who pick up WORLDS will probably find a decent challenge until you vs the HR 50 monster (GOOD LUCK ON THAT).YES, ive heard people on here say its pretty lacking in content compared to other games and 80% of armour sets look ugly af. BUT we must remember this is the teams first gam on this engine and having to make everything from the ground up to achieve this impressive game i worthy of  my £50 purchase. There are stil lthose little stupid things i mentioned like having to use transmog to not look like a clown and not much variety in monsters.

""This is the first time we’ve taken a mainline Monster Hunter game to PC,"" producer Ryozo Tsujimoto tells us in a written Q&A, ""so we wanted to take the time to get it right and do the proper research and preparation.""In his beginner's primer, published on the day of its console launch, our Steven explored why people love Monster Hunter so damn much. Capcom tells us Monster Hunter: World has since become the developer's biggest-selling game, having shifted eight million copies globally in less than six months.sky sky sky~Here's the official skinny: In Monster Hunter: World, follow the journey of the elder dragons as they begin their once a decade migration across the sea to a land known as the New World in an event referred to by inhabitants as the Elder Crossing. As part of the Guild’s Research Commission, players must embark on a grand journey to this massive, mysterious land and uncover the secrets behind this phenomenon. As hunters set out on their quests, the Commission’s sights are set on Zorah Magdaros, a colossal elder dragon that rises from the earth like a volcano.Capcom explains collaborations and ""other additional content"" that's since made its way to the console variant post-launch will ""be coming to PC for free at a later date."" This includes monsters Deviljho and Lunastra, says Tsujimoto.We also know that visually Monster Hunter: World ""will have parity"" with the console version at launch, but that could improve with free future updates. There don't seem to be any plans for mod support at launch, but we do know that the game should run on some fairly old graphics cards. Check out the Monster Hunter: World system requirements to see how your machine measures up.Monster Hunter: World is due on PC via Steam on August 9, 2018."

It severely trivializes the early game, and makes some of the tier 1 - 3 weapons look useless in comparison to the defender weapons, and the defender/guardian armor makes fighting any monster a joke. Firstly, it's a high rank+ armor that is FULLY UPGRADED that can be used in low rank, and no monster can get through the physical armor. Not only that, but it has no elemental weakness, so there is genuinely no reason to switch off of it for, say, high metal armor which has great ice protection but is made incredibly weak to lightning, so you have to think whether it's a good idea to bring it to a tobi-kadachi hunt, who will be hitting you with lightning attacks almost exclusively. It trivializes even trying, as since it has no weakness, there's no reason to stop using it for, say, the rathalos set, a set that was the low-rank flex since it is arguably one of the best sets to farm for when you're around that level."

I can only report my experience. I've enjoyed the game immensely. The game´s goal is simple. Killing monsters. But you have to learn how to do it. You´ll need to discover their weak points. Work with others at times to accomplish the goal. There are many MMO like features. Paths of progression. But above all, plenty of weapons that offer extremely different feels. Although the goal is to kill big beasts over and over again, they are all unique. And the game keeps on trowing new layers of things you can do such as exploring, researching, hunting and so on. This is not a game I would recommend to play alone. Hallf the fun is going out on missions with friends or calling out for help and getting some random people to assist you in killing that major beast. Above all the game successfully makes you feel like a real monster hunter. Some people will greatly enjoy it and some won´t. But that doesn't mean it´s a bad game. Just it isn't for everyone."

Can be a bit overwhelming or confusing at first, but you will get the hang of it eventually. The only things bothering me so far:The ingame chat doesn't seem to really work. There is no popup if someone writes and you manually have to go into the menu and then scroll to the chat to open it up. The Bow as a weapon also feels underwhelming. You have like 2 attacks and a third special and thats it. The mouse is just emulating a controller stick, thats why it feels like it has some extreme smoothing.No decent anti aliasing implemented. FXAA is super blurry and so is TAA. If you happen to have performance issues: Disable Volumetric Lighting. Lower SH Diffuse to low. Put Ambient Occlusion to medium.Lower LOD to medium. These 4 settings enabled me to run the game with a somewhat solid 60fps on my system:I5 2500k 4.2Ghz8GB DDR3-1600GTX 980If your CPU is even worse than that, disable Flora Sway.

Nothing new to see here.Voice acting is also in the typical bad video game style that usually plagues these type of games.High learning curve with unclear tutorials.Cutscenes not skippable (as far as I know, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).Chat system is just plain dumb and borderline unusable.Connectivity issues.IN BETWEEN:Boss fights can feel a bit linearToo many optional questsBattle fluidityThe GOOD:A huge amount of customization for buildsA nice variety of weapons with different play stylesEnvironments can be used against BossesDifferent ways of taking down BossesSolo play is very challengingFighting, fighting & fightingConclusion: This game shines where it needs to and falls flat in everything else. Hunting Bosses and customizing your character into some Godly Hunter is all that really matters in a game like this and thankfully it mostly got it right. As you see above I wrote ""battle fluidity"" in ""IN BETWEEN"" and that is because the mechanics at times, can feel a bit stiff and slow. I would prefer something like Vindictus' play style which is much more fluid BUT it is still good.Not going to mention graphical stuff since all the down voters have already mentioned all that."

I had already done The Big Heat which was what my friend group referred to as our cross-country road trip from New Hampshire all the way down to California, where we finally stopped off at San Francisco. Most people drove back home but I stayed with the intention of renting a sailboat to travel across the Pacific ocean to the famed island state. After a few days out at sea, I woke up to find a peculiar little green character rummaging through my ♥♥♥♥. Instinctively, I spat rancid hot stomach bile by the liter at him - missing by just an inch. I dove for him but as he was quite the intuitive little fellow, I missed and flew right into my prized ""Nostalgia Critic grimace"" collection, shattering both the collection and my pants, once again. The green fellow was now on the helm, steering us away from the Sandwich Islands - unaware of my presence. I grabbed him by the legs and gave him a stern telling off before slapping him with the might of God himself and launching him back to shore. I eventually did make it to Hawaii, had a great holiday. Flew back with Delta, got home and saw a huge, pulsating green mass outside my house, chanting my name. ""Colin. Colin. COLIN"" it started to move towards me, as I pulled the AVGN grimace and Doug Walker scream. I dove for the ♥♥♥♥ just like his son... He popped like a couple of balloons in any training level from a quirky FPS in the 2000s. I sat on my doorstep and began to listen to Death Grips, balling my eyes out that I would never be able to demonstrate the stomach bile attack ever again. I also pissed myself."

I have a love/hate relationship with this game now. On the one hand, the world is beautifully crafted and it’s really fun to wander around the world, finding new locations, things, or paths in the area you’ve been playing in for days now. Hunting down monsters is really fun. You follow the tracks, and suddenly you see them just around the corner, in all their majesty and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ massive size. Battles are hard, but after you’ve worn the monsters down, you track them, injured and limping as they are, as they drag themselves to their hideout for a rest, or to eat something to heal. There’s a lot of different weapons and play styles to choose from. Bored of your standard sword and shield? Try two swords! Too low on damage? Try a big-ass sword and axe. You’re dying because you’re always to close to the monsters? Try a ranged weapon! I’ve already switched weapons a couple of times to find a style that more suits what I like to do. On the other hand, I hate this game because I’m not good at it, and I end up dying more often than I would like to admit. Still, perseverance pays off in the end, when you kill/capture the baddie that’s been slamming you down on your ass for the last couple of hours. Alternatively, open up your quest for multiplayer and hope for the best. I don’t like the semi-instanced nature of the quests, but there’s an option for free play if you would like to just roam around or stock up on supplies. Definitely a 10/10 from me. Please excuse me as I go back to face the same foe I’ve been fighting the last couple of days. I have a really good feeling about this try!"

While it is sometimes frustrating to not be able to play with friends consistantly the game is still very well put together and very enjoyable to play again. While I do hope that they get the multiplayer fixed soon it still is easy enough to play solo.Pros:- fluid controls- short loading screens- in depth customization- beautiful level design- very rewarding gameplay- most important of all Palico'sCons- multiplayer connectivity spotty- optimization could be better- possibility of breaking a computer because of some fights.-squads were removed from this version.Now would I recommend this? The answer is yes, however, if you are wanting to play this game with friends constantly I'd say to wait till multiplayer is fixed first.Update: The capcom team is working to fix the connection issues. This is still following the same trend as far as how long it took to iron out the connection on console so it is not a big deal.

Just like anything else.Is the game fun?Yeah. Sometimes. The first, maybe, 30 hours is the real experience; immersive, beautiful, fun, and it's evoked a feeling in me about games I haven't felt since MGSV. With each new area and each new monster, you really feel like you're exploring and learning about the new world. It wasn't until hour 100, where I felt like the game was a chore. To sum up endgame, it's deco grinding, build optimizing, pet hunting, and fashion hunter. Although, through long sessions of grinding I get bored at times, I've yet to be burnt out on the game, so take away that this game may click with some people and won't for others. However, I will say that each new content update keeps me coming back and I play regularly (with friends and solo) so that should speak to its replayability. Combat feels fleshed out, mechanics are balanced (so long as you care to learn them), and there's great music to pair with every setting. Won't go into detail about gameplay since you'll get more mileage for that out of watching actual gameplay than me sitting here, explaining it to you.Anything bad?Main talking points for this question are lack of content, bugs, and Denuvo. Now, personally, I never minded the initial lack of content in comparison to the console port (even though PC took 9 months longer), as I really sympathize with the developers (even though it's Capcom). However, Capcom has really pulled through these last few months and has given us many pleasant surprises with this December packing some of the most anticipated content updates (*cough cough* Behemoth *cough cough*), and seemingly by March of next year, we'll be fully caught up to the console port (with hints to newer content on the way; game awards, they said they had something big planned ^.^). So, in its current build, this game is absolutely worth it to pick up in terms of content, especially since Christmas is around the corner. Nothing bad to note here, and I can only say that for all the people who screamed at Capcom to push out more content like it was their first born child, I hope you're happy.Now, the game has had its faults with poor optimization, graphical errors, save file deletions, and the notorious connection drops, all of which, I've been a victim of except save data loss (I backup my saves). Sure, in the first 3 seconds that I experience these bugs I get pretty upset, but the game's just too damn great to stop playing over these inconveniences and as of late, they've mostly hashed out all the problems (at least in my case; there's still some connection drop issues from time to time, but I can attribute that to bad internet most of the time). They optimized the control scheme, such as the ranged weapon controls for keyboard and mouse, which I'm very grateful for. Hell, they even plan on adding Ultra Wide support for the game for the people who asked for it, so they're actually listening to their playerbase and addressing issues one step at a time.And lastly, Denuvo. Not much I can argue for in favor of MHW here. Denuvo is straight trash, and even to this day, it comes up as reason to give this game a bad review (I can see why, but at the same time I don't). Capcom has removed Denuvo from games before, but not anything recent to my knowledge, so even though MHW has recently been cracked, I don't see it going away anytime soon. However, this still doesn't deter me from playing it. Yeah, it would play better without Denuvo, but the benefits and my enjoyment far outweigh the cost of Denuvo so I couldn't care less.Returning MonHun fan?Personally, I haven't played much of the previous iterations of MonHun except a very short stint with Generations, so take this with a grain of salt. The game is different. Some things are good like no more loading times when traveling from section to section in maps during a hunt, but then there are other things that people will argue as either hand-holding or good game design. These things are like the fact that you can fast travel back to camp instead of running all the way back, or the fact that you can sometimes spawn away from camp in high rank instead of always. In some ways, yes the game does hold your hand a lot, but at the same time, it also makes the game more fluid in terms of its gameplay so take that for what you will. Other changes could be in features and meta; there's no more charm tables and instead it's deco farming, GS meta is TCS now and it works differently, new LS mechanics, etc. But, all I can say is, don't be a meta slave and don't be a baby. The game is balanced enough to where pretty much anything is viable (I main capture net). But, if you can't get over these changes because you're too attached to the old MonHun, then I'm very sorry for you, but this probably isn't your game so do the research before buying.Happy hunting!"

And with the fact that the performance isn't stellar even in high end systems can say a lot about the game.)>Multiplayer (it's like a gamble everytime you play Multiplayer, for there's a chance that you get disconnected from the host player, or the host player gets disconnected and everybody is instantly disconnected from each other, leaving you with a monster with a difficulty the same as if it were fought by four people. Not really much of an issue but it is rather a nuisance.)Overall it's still a great game, even if you don't touch the Multiplayer side of things - you could get lost in the variety of weapons and armor that you can forge and use and study what situations they are best used in, or you could get lost in the beauty and life of the environment around you, and see each monster's interaction with the world, or you could get lost in the huge number of monsters you could hunt and all the ways you could hunt them in this game.Despite the multiplayer issues, it's still worth the buy.TL;DR Rating:Graphics: 2.5/5Gameplay: 5/5Sounds: 4/5Replayability: 5/5Controls: 3.5/5"

Just make them Clusters or something.- Multiplayer was not explained properly.===Things to avoid when starting===' Button Mashing' Reloading while being looked at by the Hunted' TOADS, STAY AWAY FROM THEM' Hitting friends with long Weapons (XD)===Problems I've seen so far===* Most Players seem to complain about increased CPU Usage which can make it unplayable. I have seen it spike from 40% to 90% a couple of times in my playthrough.* Reloading Bug, you just sit there and reload your Gun over and over again until something hits you.* CTD. Now I haven't gotten this yet but some people I know have. It doesn't seem to be frequent.* Multiplayer random disconnects.===Final Verdict===The Game is fun, it brings an interesting amount of mechanics to play around with during fights. Although it has problems, the gameplay outways those problems and I'm sure they will come out with Patches to fix many of these problems and add more features.I haven't played enough for it to get repetitive yet, so that's a good sign so far. I would also recommend that you actually take a look at your hud before freaking out and trying to figure out your Keys to heal, switch ammo, etc. Pretty much everything is infront of you.Lastly, I would highly recommend that you buy this game on Sale (from trusted sources) in it's current State, hope you enjoyed my review!"

I was very happy when they announced a PC version for Monster Hunter World and i have not been disappointed at all. I think to everyone who is used to the old MH graphics this game is a real eye-catcher. There is so much detail in everything, the monsters are so well designed and it just looks in harmony. The soundtrack is speaking for itself- i get goosebumps every time i hear the main theme and most of the monster themes are very fitting for the monster.I can‘t really describe the gameplay so make sure to check out some gameplay videos to get a taste of what you are actually doing in this game and what it looks like!The fact that i am already well-experienced with the games of course helped a lot when fighting most monsters but i guess the game is very friendly to players that are new to the game as well. In MHFU you didn´t get healed by your cat all the time or had special cloaks or boosters that make the game so much easier overall. Hitboxes back then were way worse. And in MHW i have been wondering a lot already how something that would´ve knocked the crap out of me didn´t hit me at all. The controls with M+K are a bit strange at first but i got used to it very fast. If you prefer to play with controller you can do that as well. And trust me- the controls in MH: World are way less clunky than in the previous parts.I don´t know why people are complaining about the graphics and the performance. It says in the recommended specs that you will only get 30 fps on high settings if you have the listed hardware. If your PC cant handle the game don´t blame the game for it.  because as soon as the lobby leader leaves the lobby will be disbanded. This will at least lower the chances of being kicked out of the online system that is probably overloaded right now. to anyone who played , liked and loved the older games. To anyone who is new to the franchise be warned: it can be a tough and tilting experience at first and it will be likely that you don´t succeed with every quest from the beginning on. Although you get spammed with help you  but it is definetly worth a try for everyone who likes challenges and needs something different than the usual games he plays."

It took me a solid day of gametime to get used to gathering while running and stuff auto combining. At first i didnt like the practice of being able to access all your stuff when your on quests (swapping gear, refill items) but being able to do that is pretty damn useful, especially when your bag is full from gathering and you can easily empty it without leaving a quest for expiedition. Also, fireflies are pretty cool, but i never minded having to keep a monster paintballed. (fast traveling between camps is EXTREMELY useful.) Theres a ♥♥♥♥ ton of quality of life changes, like being able to walk/jog while healing, or being able to roll and stop the healing animation, and a few named in the post above. (gunner specific pouch for gunner ammo so it doesnt take up 2/3 of your bag space for ammo and crafting mats.) I love how monsters dont feel as easily predictable as in previous games, as well as all the little interactive things in the zones. (heal plants, smackable flashbombs poison plants ect.) im loving basically everything about this game. Other than one thing that is EXTREMELY annoying.. having to do the story questline multiple times because you cant join a friends quest if you havent already finished it, in previous MH's i believe you could go on quests, and you were just forced to watch the cut scenes with the quest poster. this is my only thinkable annoyance to the game, (its pretty annoying..some people might not find it that bad but to me its damn annoying.)If youve played MH before and enjoyed it, this game is a must."

The bad hitboxes and iframes get even worse when there is any kind of visual effect on screen and the fps drop down to about 5-10. Theres problems with textures not loading properly. The monster AI seems bugged, instead of fighting each other, they stand and look for you even before spotting you in the first place, 3 minutes straight. Some features were probably meant good, but are either buggy or straight up annoying after 50+ hours of it, EVERY HUNT (I'm looking at a certain bombing bagel). Weekly Quests reset (not the weekly reset) for no good reason, some items dont seem to work as intended, quests disappear Theres so much more little things I dislike about World, but they could be overlooked by just how fun the concept of Monster Hunter can be.

Monster attacks? You time your dodge and leave that monster empty handed.Master these core gameplay mechanics and you'll be turning even the biggest and baddest of turbo lizards into a hat so posh you won't even care what kind of garbage armor skills it has.In all seriousness, I've already put 500 hours into the console version of this game, here's to another 500 on PC.

That's why its finally a good game on Steam.This only holds your hand for the first hour or so, and by holding your hand I mean pointing you in the right directions. It doesn't put you in a wheel chair and sprint past the challenges while you can drool and recieve achievements.When it comes to the online bit, well some things you might want to get help on i.e. Nergigante, Pink Rathian, Diablos to name a few.... BUT the monster scales up so if you get someone clueless well, that's it. Shared lives so while you might be prepared nothing is guaranteeing the ones joining are. Or it might be someone who can kill it within a second, real roulette here.The multiplayer stability is just fine as long as you do not alt+tab out of the game for too long or using wi-fi connection. So if you got a friend who'd like this game aswell I'd say go for it.There's two downsides though;The price, while I'd say it's worth the price it might be a bit too steep so maybe wait for a sale. Also when you think you've beaten the game, well that's just halfway through the game and then there's plenty of times where you go ""wait there's ANOTHER end boss for me to get horrible murdered on a dozen of times?!?!""And then things start to scale with you -never giving you an upper hand."

Menus can be navigated with your mouse and you can click everything, it's fantastic. There's also a new mmo-like item toolbar that helps mkb players even more.+ Even though my PC is under the minimum system requirements, I still decided to give it a shot. It actually runs pretty well, 30fps with a few stutters when there's too many particle effects on the screen, so I can't complain about the performance. + The new load times are fantastic. I spent hours watching the game load on the PS4 and now I can barely read the tips on the screen, I can get into quests in less than five seconds.+/- The online system is the same as the PS4, so if you don't know the workarounds to play story quests (enter quest, watch cutscenes then tell your friends to join), you'll suffer a bit. Occasional disconnects happen when Steam hiccups, though. Not great, but so far it has happened to me only once. The upside is that it's easier than ever to join your friend's sessions and guilds are now Steam Groups, so joining other people is easier than ever. On PS4 I had to message my friends and make sure everyone is in the same page before playing, on PC I can just hop on a lobby and do some quests with people on my friend's list.I still strongly recommend the game. Despite the online interface and some menus being still a bit below the industry standard for online play, this is still a fantastic game with hundreds of hours of content. Happy hunting!"

I still load it up from time to time, and there's still 2 monsters I haven't beat (I might need better teammates than randoms).  It has enough grind to keep me playing, but not too much.   Every match is a boss fight, the feeling of satisfaction of taking down a monster after a long hunt (up to 50 minutes) is really great.  The weapons are all precise and have a learning curve.  I just picked up lance (my all time favorite) after 2h blades, after hammer, after greatsword.  I could pick up a new one of the 16 and keep the game fresh.  I got a buddy to get it, but he thought it was too rpg-y. It has less rpg-y-ness than even Borderlands really I told him, also the loot is carves from the monsters you craft to make new gear.  The community is pretty good.  Most people are quiet, and the social media people seem helpful.  I am comparing this to say Evolve, another monster like game where I found the online community toxic.  I have had maybe 1 or 2 bad experiences with other players the whole time, the last being someone who got mad the lance charges flinced him (you can get items to stop flinches) and complained I didn't do enough damage the round (my doorbell rang, and the loser had to download a mod to see everyone's damage percentage it's not native).

However, I actually like it as it serves as a good entry point to the franchise and is quite accessible to many players. Adding fuel to the fire, the story is also really stupid,boring pointless and extremely forgettable with unskippable cutscenes it is absolutely ridiculous.Further frustration, however, comes from the game itself with the server disconnecting every 10 minutes, confusing and non-sensical co-op / multiplayer with a questionable PC optimization.The game is designed to be played in co-op as upon selecting your save file, you are immediately given the options to join multiplayer, create a session or join a friend's session. Joining the session does not put you in a shared hub meaning you cannot see other players in the same session thus have any interactions, unlike previous MH games. To participate in a quest, one has to post a mission and others has to run to the nearest quest board to accept it rather than just having it appear on the screen as you are already in the same session. Even when all 4 players joined the quest but did not select ready, the quest starter will depart on the job by themselves and others has to then depart individually to the same session.Participation on main story missions requires everyone to first start the mission solo and play up to the point of encountering the boss and trigger the cutscenes associated with it. The players then need to quite the mission in order to join the story mission together. Otherwise, the game will tell you either that you have not progressed enough into the story to participate (When you clearly has) or the host has not finished the cutscenes and you cannot join. On top of this, the constant disconnects (or should I say random?) from the server will automatically kick you out of the multiplayer session and you either have to join again or play solo leaving an essential aspect of MH working smoothly only half of the time which ultimately ruins the fun of the game.Did I also mention that under full screen the game forces big picture mode which replaced the traditional steam overlay meaning you have to alt+tap out in order to talk with friends. Ridiculous.As far as co-op goes, the game is not fit for purpose and currently half broken. However, IGN and many other outlets seem to say otherwise.But hey, at least I can run the game smoothly...(Buy it with caution and Capcom fix your ♥♥♥♥♥!!!)"

Once you're past that phase, the game really opens up to you with all of it's splendor. It's got great combat with a wealth of weapons for you to use, beautiful scenary to immerse yourself into, and a pretty sweet and reasonable grind that allows you to take your time with the main story or rush it as you see fit. The game is easily playable both in solo and multiplayer mode, so however you prefer to play the game you don't have to worry about feeling like the game leaves you behind.Now all of these positives are all nice and dandy, so you might be wondering why I'd give this a ""mixed"" rating instead of a positive one instead? The reason is that, unfortunately, is that the game includes a spitroast cooking minigame, where in said minigame, a ""well-done steak"" is considered an overall better item than a ""rare steak"" when cooking raw meat over an open flame. This is absolute blasphemy, and it completely ruins the experience for me that I am forced to ruin good meat if I don't want to end up with, according to the game, a ""worse"" item.

Each weapon type has a well thought out moveset, having moves that excel in certain situations, and this is where a rift might be created between people who enjoy the game and people who dont. Souls-like games require you to learn the enemy and counter with technical prowess, but what sets them apart is that Monster Hunter relies a bit less on being able to react perfectly to enemies, and more on positioning yourself advantageously, preparing before battle with favourable weapons that suit the behaviour of the monster you're encountering and, due to the depth of the weapon movesets, learn how to use them proficiently (e.g: greatswords dont have the best mobility or dodges, but your shoulder tackle has hyper armor and minimal chip damage and can be used to counter monster attack when used properly). Because of all this, you need to ignore a lot of what you have learnt in souls like games and put effort into relearning the combat, because tactics youd use on a souls like wont work on Monster Hunter and vice-versa.TL;DR:The game will take time and effort to learn and master, but once you do, youll get some of the most satisfying combat moments you can have in a game"

I personally much prefer MH's combat gameplay to other action game combat systems. The soundtrack includes some tracks good enough to be listened to even outside of the game, which is good considering you won't have the leisure to savour them during a fight. The graphics are not outstanding, but still far exceed most other ports of Japanese console games. Speaking of ports, after some initial issues concerning performance, save file corruption and graphical glitches, the game seems to be running quite well; I have played it on both AMD and Nvidia hardware without major problems.If the concept of Monster Hunter appeals to you even in the slightest, then you will have a good time with this game."

If you can't beat a monster, practice and you'll get there. -the armor design is top notch for both male characters and female charactersThe bad: -though the skill ceiling is incredibly high, you can't learn the weapons purely by yourself: you pretty much NEED to watch youtube videos explaining how they work (i suggest Arekkz), otherwise you'll find yourself banging your head against the wall because your movement will feel clunky. -The fights don't change: the first time you fight a monster will be similar to the 20th time you fight a monster, so if you don't like that, this game may not be for you. -The endgame decoration grind. One of the mechanics in the game are decorations, which drop from high rank and master rank monsters. The RNG involved in this system is a huge turn off, but this is primarily an endgame thing so if you're new, don't stress over thisFinal thoughts: I obviously adore this game. The graphics are tight, the performance is good and the mechanics tie the fights in so tightly that once you get the rush of taking down the hard monsters, you'll never stop. It is grindy, but in my opinion the grind is, for the most part, fair: the journey is as rewarding as the destination."

Find it to be the same old grind as the base game and it's the same formula just reused with a fresh coat of snow covering it all.Unlike many other users, I personally do not find performance to be an issue, and the game is overall noticeably prettier (Ryzen 3600 and a GTX 1080 so nothing overkill).

Monster Hunter World is a great initiation for new players to the series, and ever since I experienced this game, I have been hooked on Monster Hunter's previous games and monsters. MHW's ability to reach a wider audience has garnered much success for Capcom, and I hope they continue to update their game to the degree they have already. I am excited for Iceborne and all that is to come following the expansion, which I hope can fill the same shoes this game has already. (or even possibly exceed it) World will take you into a genre which you may or may not have experienced before and will leave you wanting more and more. MHW is, quite simply, a stellar game.

The monster AI while at times it can seem a little dopy it does well to try and interact with the world around it bringing more life to the world.There's probably much more I could expand upon or add to this review but I'm not the best at writing them so I'll leave it at that. Overall I'd recommend this game for both new and returning hunters, but for those returning I'd advise not to expect the same kind of difficulty that the previous titles have offered."

Overall though, I recommend it. It is grind heavy, but if you enjoy chasing around interesting environments and bashing or shooting monsters, this is for you.The game involves a lot of learning the patterns of the monsters you're fighting, using the environment to your advantage and generally becoming familiar with everything you encounter, from the zones themselves to the various enemies within it. There's a kind of pattern you need to get used to, even in town, in order to play this game effectively. It is very fun though, and I enjoy the world itself, it's lore and the of course the monsters.The annoying parts, to me, are the grouping options, which I feel could be streamlined a little. The learning curve, while not steep, has a lot of 'secret knowledge' things involved; concept and tactics you need to learn from other veteran players in order to really get better that the game itself doesn't really communicate well to you... or at all sometimes. And the story itself is forced; you can't go through it with friends in a simple fashion, as you need to watch cutscenes before you can get any help on story missions, and if a friend hasn't seen it either, they still can't help. It's a little *too* endgame focused, especially not that the Iceborne expansion is a thing.All in all it's a fun, interesting game to play, and I recommend giving it a try though."

Just about the only thing I can complain about is that using a wireless controller and having it disconnect (idle/ dead battery/ etc) is pretty annoying because it's often mid-hunt and now I have to relaunch.I knew the MKB controls once upon a time but it didn't add all that much to the game for me and MH games have always been controller oriented for obvious reasons.  Other games seem to handle controller reconnection just fine but MHW seems to lack object permanence in this regard which is pretty forgivable since a game and not a sentient being.  However, it does seem  a little weird when you see this exact feature working in so many other games and MHW could almost be expected to be able to do this as well considering it first launched on console and came to PC months afterward.However, when you compare this shortcoming to something like a Bethesda game and interesting question arises from it... ""What the ♥♥♥♥ does Bethesda even do?  Why do I still have to install modpack on modpack to fix bugs that have been in this series since mfing Morrowind??""In conclusion; Monster Hunter World is a great game and if you still need to hear someone tell you that it's worth it to buy it on PC in 2022, then let me be the first to welcome you to owning a PC.  I know, it's probably your first and I'm very excited for you and all of the mods you're going to try to install in Skyrim and Fallout 4, because lets be honest that's the real reason you got a PC.  Don't even deny it, you're just lying to yourself, and there's nothing to be ashamed about.  Now go watch some MXR and download all the best mods and play the ""I'm going to mod the absolute ♥♥♥♥ out of this game just to play it for 2 hours and get bored"" game and then come back to this review, mark it helpful, and then buy and play MHW.

The game requires some time to get used to in terms of difficulty, but playing multiplayer helps with that. There is grinding but it's reasonable (Example: you may need to fight a monster more than once for the items it drops for a specific piece of armor/weapon). I highly recommend playing with other people, but it's easy enough to find randoms if you don't have friends who play. The only downside to this game in terms of gameplay would probably be the lack of tutorials. I was lucky to have friends who played previous versions of monster hunter (even the concole version of this one) to guide me through the more intricate mechanics. Even though there are some splashscreens that give you the basics now and then, the information they give you is slim and I can see why some people might have a hard time getting into the game. My best recomendation would be to look up a few beginner guides on youtube or check out the Monster Hunter Wiki.When I bought this on release, there were a variety of issues in terms of performance and connectivity. These issues have been mostly addressed and fixed (I would say 90% of the issues I had at launch are no longer present)."

If the game ever gets stale, just change your weapon and it's a whole new game. The only complaint I have that I've seen a lot is that the monsters here feel SUPER agile for no reason. Rajang for instance was never so fast in the old world, but it's kind of made up up for with the added mobility that hunters have. Slower weapons sometimes can feel impossible to hunt with, but if you can get past that in iceborne, you'll be fine. Set making is made super accessible and clear to understand in this game too, so you can always have fun theory crafting and experimenting.  I've played through the game twice, and both times my runs were completely different even with the same gameplay loop. If you like games with rewarding combat and mechanics, this is for you! :)"
5603,Mynx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/themynx/,2,,1,407.2,August,"10,",217,0,1,"From a singleplayer point of view, this game is a lot of fun, lots of content and really you'll never get bored of it. There's a whole lot to do, whether it's farming, fighting new monsters, playing with friends, getting drunk at the canteen, fashion hunting, fishing,.. you name it. Plenty to do, you can very easily get over a thousand hours out of this game and still not get bored of it.However the online portion of the game...Capcom screwed co-op up. You HAVE to watch the monster cutscene BEFORE being able to send an SOS flare. And before your friends can join they also need to WATCH the cutscenes, which results in someone having to abandon the quest just to play with their friends... huge hassle, not enjoyable.Here are the pros and cons I found in a list.---Pros:- Lots of replay value- Extremely fun with friends- Extremely fun alone- Main story lasts quite a while (took me ~ 43h to finish it, as a veteran of the series)- Great character customization- New monsters will be added via free DLC and game updates, adding to the replay value.- Game is a lot more casual compared to other MH games, making it easier to get into. Also a con for older players, read Cons for explanation.- AMAZING soundtrack.Cons:- Playing with friends is not enjoyable until you reach high rank. Unskippable cutscenes, and impossible to watch together. You must depart alone and then you can SOS flare for your friend(s) to join. This becomes much less of an issue in high rank where there's nearly no cutscenes anymore.- Forced motion blur, DoF, mouse acceleration.- Very CPU intensive. - As of the time of writing, online mode is really unstable - check the EDIT for a temporary fix.- Game is a lot more casual compared to other MH games, making it a bit too easy for people that have been following the series for a while. Gone are the moments where you can't sign up for a quest because you ran out of zenny, where you forget whetstones, potions, took the wrong weapon, etc.. Now all of those issues can quickly be solved, either within an expedition/quest itself or it's simply been removed (entry fee for quests). Also a pro, though overall it doesn't make the game less enjoyable to me, just more care-free.--Now, would I recommend it?Despite its flaws, yes, absolutely. It's a game worth the premium 60€ price tag, and I recommend it vividly, the game is a huge sucess and there's a good reason behind it. No brainer of a purchase.Thank you for reading."

5609,»melonbuns«,https://steamcommunity.com/id/melonbuns/,6,,1,200.1,August,"14,",219,3,1,"I haven't written many reviews before, but I'll do my best with this one. I've been playing Monster Hunter since MH3 on Wii and man, has it been a journey up to this game. My friend gifted me a copy of this game and I appreciate it very much. I'd been waiting eagerly for the PC port and I am so glad I waited. Personally, I really love this game and honestly, I'm so spoiled by World that I'll find it hard to get back to the older games. I'm quite looking forward to MHGU on Switch at the end of this month, we'll see how well the adjustment goes for me.*I recommend a controller to play this game. I have heard the kb+m controls aren't so fantastic.PROS:+Unlimited pickaxes/bug nets/whetstones? Yes please. Running out of pickaxes or bug nets during a quest always sucked hardcore. I love picking up materials on each quest I go, it makes it so much nicer to have both of these unlimited without taking up an item space. Oh, and whetstones too, though you could argue it wasn't very easy to run out of those anyways.+Fast gathering? Hell yeah. It always felt incredibly slow when you would have to do a gathering quest in the older games (looking at you, MH3). I absolutely love how you can run by something and gather it with just one button press and I adore that when you DO have to do the sometimes tedious (some more than others) gathering quests, it gets delivered without having to go back to the camp. Except, y'know, good old egg quests.+No more paintballs! Once you've studied enough tracks from a monster, your scoutflies will level up and start leading you to where the monster is and they will show up on the map. I absolutely love this improvement, especially for those times I forgot to paintball a monster and completely lost track of where it was. It also saves some time (if your scoutflies are a high enough level, anyways) since you won't have to look for the monster in each area. It's also nice to see where each gathering material is on the map and how long it'll take to replenish itself.+The enviroments are amazing. I love how MHW utilizes most of the things that are in the area surrounding you, such as sporepuffs or poison cups. It's also fun to see big monsters trap themselves in vine traps from trees they knock down or just hiding in a bush and watching a couple of them duke it out with each other. I love the interaction that each monster has with each other. Instead of just auto aggroing the player (most times anyways), they start a turf war until one runs off  in shame.+MHW is very beginner friendly compared to the old titles. I feel as if this game is much easier for a new player to get into seeing as how different it is from the older formula. My first time playing a MH title was not a kind one, but I learned to love it as I kept playing. Now, I'm enjoying a game that I love with a new style with my friends who haven't played the titles before this one.+PETS. You can collect pets to decorate your room. Who in their right mind doesn't love collecting cute, cool, or interesting animals to spice up a place?+POOGIE PETS IN HD. Praise be to Poogie.+Weapon changes. I feel like the weapons have changed at least a little bit from what I've seen of them in the old games. I main switch axe and have for quite a while now, and I love love LOVE the combos! I also really like the design of some of the weapons (some better than others, of course..)+Layered armor. Whaaaat? I think its a really neat addition to the game and it may possibly bring fashion hunting to a new light. I hope to see a few more layered armor sets, I like the samurai one from the deluxe edition, but I like having variety, too.+Palicos are great in this game! In the previous titles, there was an enthusiasm system for your palicos. The lower their enthusiasm, the less likely they will be to fight. There also used to be different classes/specializations of palicos and they would have certain monsters or duties they would do (i.e. fighting, large monsters only, support bias, etc). At the beginning of the game when you first get your palico, it has a gadget called Vigorwasp spray that heals you reliably so (at least, in my experience). There are times where they pull a Donald Duck move from Kingdom Hearts and heal you after you've already used a potion. There are different palico gadgets that you get through the game, mainly from optional quests, so ultimately you decide exactly what you want your palico to do. Also, most the armor for them is just so freakin' cute. Capcom is really after my heart with this game.+NO LOADING TIMES BETWEEN AREAS. FINALLY, it really broke immersion in the previous titles how there was always a short loading screen between each area, but it was useful for when you wanted to get away from monsters to heal or.. do whatever you need to do, really. Though just because there aren't loading screens between areas in this game, you can still either hide in bushes (your screen will indicate when you're hiding with a kind of black border? I'm not too sure how to describe it so well, but you'll know when you see it). Either that or you could use the Ghillie Mantle (which you get pretty early on) to basically become 'invisible' to monsters until you attack or the mantle runs out of time. Ghillie Mantle is VERY convenient for the egg quests.+Free content. There are a couple of event quests that come out at specified times (schedule here:  and from what I've read from previous posts from Capcom, some of these events come with special materials to make rare layered armor sets. Of course, the upcoming events aren't as cool as the ones out for consoles, but that's mostly because the PC port just came out and I am positive the cooler quests will come later down the line.CONS-Some of the settings interfere with the FPS from the get-go. For better performance, I recommend turning off volume rendering and playing in borderless windowed mode. I'm not actually sure if there are any other settings that should be turned off, so if you know any I don't, please let me know!-The main story is kind of bland in my opinion. Traveling to a new land when suddenly OH NO an ELDER DRAGON APPEARS TO BE GOING TO THE NEW WORLD!? We have to FIND IT and CAPTURE IT and then RESEARCH IT! It's personally not my favorite, but I haven't finished the story all the way through, so I'll update after I've done so.-At the moment, multiplayer doesn't seem to work too well. You also have to disband your group after each quest in order to go back to the hub.-Remember the monster turf wars? Yeah, sometimes those get a little bit annoying. Though its really fun to watch another monster get beat down, it can drag on for a little bit too long when I'm just trying to farm or end the quest.-Sometimes fights make your FPS crash hard, but I suppose that's what happens with most games when too much is going on all at once.-If grinding for materials isn't something you enjoy, I wouldn't recommend this game. Personally I like the grind, but I understand that not everyone enjoys the time (and sometimes frustration) that goes into it.-If you're looking for a hack and slash game, this definitely is not it. The combat is rather slow but incredibly rewarding once you've learned a monster's patterns, when to dodge, and when to use your combos. Though, combat speed varies with whatever weapon you use (i.e. dual blades are faster than hammer).-No Sophia AKA Guildmarm from MH4U. I miss being called doodle.-Event quests are no longer permanently in your quest list. In older games when you downloaded a special/event quest, you could do it whenever you want. For MHW, the event quests are only around for a specified amount of time but I believe they do come back around.Overall, I've had a blast playing this new entry in the Monster Hunter series and I look forward to the future. I'd really like to see everything Capcom has in store for the next games."

I saw a lot of mention about bad performance since the Iceborne expansion, but as far as I can tell it has been fixed as the game has been running perfectly fine for me. The clutch claw addition is really badass and fun to use and the new attacks for the various weapons are great. I'm particularly fond of the [Any attack] > slinger fire > True Charged Slash for greatsword combined with the increased damage from the second hit of that attack if you connect with the initial hit. It's so good that I ""main"" greatsword now when I had barely touched it during my time playing the base game.Something about the game overall that's come to bother me is the weapon appearances, however. Looooootta recolors/""bone weapon with [Monster] bits slapped on"". Having been playing MHGU on Switch recently this became even more apparent. It's obviously not a deal-breaker cause the game is still incredible and, IMO, the best entry point into the Monster Hunter series, but it's definitely a glaring issue with the game.______________________________________________________Base game review from around the PC version's release:Combined with my time on PS4 earlier this year I've got ~100 hours in, which still isn't much by Monster Hunter standards, but E H.MHW is damn fun and honestly makes it really hard to go back to MH3U and Generations with the amount of QoL improvements that were made in this installment. I remember seeing people complain about connectivity issues with the PC port around release, but I've only gotten a single connection problem and that was when I was just AFK in the base so I unno musta been fixed. Aside from that single thing that didn't really affect me at all it's been a flawless port...if you just use a controller. K&B controls just don't feel right even when you customize keybindings. Luckily it feels really good with a controller and that's coming from someone that has spent 90% of their time in MHW using the heavy bowgun and bow so, ya know, relatively accurate aiming is needed.Good gameGood portJust use a controller"

This is by far my favorite monster hunter game in the series, and is a great starting point for anyone on the fence about trying it for the first time, however be aware that the game is EXTERMELY CPU heavy and there are numerous connection issues bogging down an otherwise amazing experience. Thumbs up for amazing gameplay and monster design, but just be aware that you may have problems.EDIT: In light of recent review scores,I thought it important to note that while the game in it's current state is not at all what a AAA high profile release should be by any means, I also do not believe it to be indicitive of the overall quality of the game. It needs work, yes, but it is by no means as bad as the score makes it look. Bad, yes, but not THAT bad."

I wasn't, till this one so I will write my review as a person who have played a Monster Hunter game for the first time.TL;DR If you are an MMORPG lover, who also enjoy raids with friends or grinding and leveling up your character and kill endless bosses and mobs alone, this game is for you (I highly recommend playing multiplayer though) The game basically is boss fight after boss fight in every quest, enemy variations are great and combat mechanics are not simple to learn yet not impossible and you'll definitely have fun while doing so. Though I'd say don't expect a mind blowing story cause you won't find it in this game, the game is not about the story anyways. It's about hunting monsters and it does what it supposed to do very well.Graphics are good but I should warn you though, you definitely need a good PC, otherwise you won't get a good framerate, or you'll end up playing the game with potato graphics cause even though the graphics are great and smooth in most occasions it's not really that succesfully optimized for older systems so even medium graphic settings looks very bad.Audio is nice and fitting, soundtrack does work very well with the game, which is all I need from a game soundtrack anyways. (Though when a game has a soundtrack that can be considered a masterpiece I never complain obviously)I played it with both controller and keyboard and since this game heavily depends on weapon (of your choice - there is a good weapon selection in game which is a plus) combos, I'd say it's way better and comfortable with a controller. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was badly optimized for keyboard users, it's doable. It's up to your preferences I guess.And last of all, grinding is a real thing in this game, you'll end up grinding for supplies, killing endless amount of monsters and if you find grinding in games intolerable you'd end up hating this, be aware of this before you buy it.TL;DR ended :) Over all I really enjoy this game, it's challenging, it's fun and it's well worth it's price."

The story it forces down your throat with custscence that you cannot skip is incredibly annoying but once you get past it your left with a fun monster murd- researching simulation that will provide you endless hours of entertainment. The jewel system, the augmentations, the armors, the colors schemes, and inherent armor skills all come together to create a very deep level of customization that will allow to create your own unique builds or just copy the most meta ones you find on the internet like everyone else.

There are network errorrs (there is an unofficial solution though), there were occasional crashes, maybe still are. These are cons, and I understand why people might dislike/hate this game because of this, maybe also the 14 weapon types that are hard to get along with initially, and mastering them might be even harder, as there are a few combos that you can only get through trial and error (or by watching/reading guides). That's why if you're too lazy to spend 5-30 minutes of searching for monsters, another half an hour to learn the way of a [insert weapon type here], getting killed (or carted), and just want to get it all, then forget about this and go play some shooters on easiest difficulty to chill after a hard day.Now with bad stuff mostly over, ask yourself, do you enjoy games with open world? Do you like hunting, skinning, slaughtering away innocent monsters, stealing eggs, mining ores, rummaging through bonepiles, gathering herbs and mushrooms, running through fields in hope to capture another rare animal and let it loose in your cramped quarters, eating, drinking, fishing, and giving sausages to your pet? (If last part makes you smile, congrats, you're pervert.) If so, congrats, you just have to come aboard a ship, get yourself a chicken, mead and a weapon of choice before you get into troubles. Also customize your character, your bipedal cat sidekick, and go on hunting. There will be challenges, there will be some frustrations, you'll hate any weapon you get your hands on for first couple of hunts, you'll hate big guys for being too strong for you, you'll hate the waklings for grabbing a bite out of you, you'll hate when big guys limp away, and you'll love to finally skin the bastards after an hour of hunt.

The amount of adrenaline that rushes through your veins when trying to topple a monster that may be out of your league creates an artificial ""fight or flight response"" that I just haven't felt so purely in a video game before.Gathering resources can be a pain, but when you're all ready and go up against that next monster, you feel absolutely pumped and even when you get your butt kicked, you're right back into the fray. That's the best part about Monster Hunter: You can lose over and over again but the moment you get into the groove of the fight, you feel like a complete monster of your own: learning the monster's movements, getting that gut feeling of when the monster is close to death, and having an unexpected second monster coming in to completely change all of that as you try to juggle two monsters at once.With fourteen different weapons to try out, you can really experiment with what weapon type works the best for you whether it be the hammer to bonk the monster into submission, the hunting horn to play sweet music in the ear of your foe, the longsword to weeaboo your path to victory in style, or the bowguns to pew pew the monster to death. Added on top of this is your Palico, your feline companion that you customize alongside your main character who you can eventually equip with different support gear depending on what feral feline group you've managed to make allies of that can absolutely save you: the earliest and arguably the most useful early on of which is the Vigorwasp, which allows you to heal yourself instantly without using a potion!Monster Hunter: World is a game of boss battle after boss battle. You're constantly going up against monsters that could easily become the bane of your existence and you will likely feel the need to go back and teach them who's boss once you've upped your gear far above what they can handle. But once you reach the end and you've faced the monster to end all monsters and you've managed to come out on top, there is no game in the world that can top that level of satisfaction and euphoria quite like Monster Hunter: World can."

After watching this series grow over the years, i'm honestly impressed that they have made it to this point with the game. A few years ago i never would have thought they would have been able to produce a MH game with such detailed maps and fluid controls(compared to other MH Titles). when they announced the game i was ecstatic. If this is the new direction for the Monster Hunter series, I fully support their decision. So many quality of life changes that it almost brings a tear to my eye, such as:     being able to move while drinking potions and consumables     actually being able to dodge while carrying wyvern/herbivour eggs     changing gear while out in the field     being able to eat a meal out in the field for passive buffs(no longer have to worry about forgetting before a big hunt)     no Blademaster and Gunner armor sets and the list goes onone of my favorite things about the amount of detail that they put into each area is the endemic life and how you can capture them to display in your home. it truly brings out the Pokemon complex in me, i always keep my net equiped just in case i run into a new little creature to add to my collectionnow i know most other hunters out there that have played previous MH games have been showing their disdain for the lack of G rank, though i know, as with previous monster hunter games, they will release G rank for monster hunter world, and since it is on pc, xbone, and ps4 they will most likely do it as expansion that you can purchase instead of what they previously had to do which was rereleasing the as an Ultimate or G version.my review for MHW may be a little biased but that is because i had the pleasure to watch this series grow into the wonderful world it has become over the year, but if you truly wish to appreciate and enjoy this game, i strongly reccomend finding your way to the  program which was officially recognized by Capcom before the initial release on consolesthe game may have some optimization issues but overall they did a decent job for their first main series Monster Hunter release on PCtldr;     Great Game, can't wait to see what comes next in the main series"
5679,DefaultNPC,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069537369/,1,1,1,343.6,August,"19,",286,0,1,"[Quick summary as I feel pretty passionate about this and dont want to waste the time of people that wouldn't care.  Amazing game,  first quality port in years,  incredibly well optimized for how pretty it looks, occasional stutter when 1 specific dragon spams the screen. Online connectivity issues that cause a DC once every 7 hunts or so. A valve issue that's being worked on. Best title this year. Easily.]Let me start this off with the following statement:I don't get surprised by many things in life.Yet somehow almost every aspect of this game from development to launch has surprised the hell out of me.When capcom said that they'd be releasing this title for PC, I expected it far down the line. Monster hunters don't get released soon enough. August release wasn't even considered for me. While being released, there were dozens of people making such bold statements as: ""This uses Denuvo? I'm not buying"" which surprised the hell out of me again. Some passionate people even posted negative reviews for the use of denuvo. That's got to be band wagon,  right? As an adult willing to support the franchise it surprisingly doesn't matter to me if the game is DRM or not. I imagine the category of people complaining would like to see a game non DRM? With literally tens of thousands that just downloaded the game free? I'll never understand why this was ever anyone's concern or problem of you're enjoying the game as designed.Upon release, the game was incredible.  It ran perfectly smooth on high settings with my 1060, and has consistently shocked me over how incredible the game looks without tanking my medium end machine. There are reviews of people well below reasonable setups complaining of how demanding the game is.  Sorry? I feel for you. But this game? Amazing port.  I doubt making a review about performance on a shoddy machine is a legitimate review.The online, if it were a but more consistent,  would be game changing.  The entire story can be completed with friends. They can drop in at any time and help the progress of any active quest using either SOS flares, or manual joining via quest board. I haven't played a game where playing with others was that easy. Speaking of playing with others leads me to my next point. Online is unreliable.  The GAME, which I imagine anyone bothering to right a review would base their opinion on, is stellar.  The connectivity issue that VALVE(not sure why you're writing negatively about Capcom and not them.) causes is annoying,  sure. Bur enough to say that it's a bad game? Ridiculous.  Especially considering that ""Lukeda14yroldSasukemain""s negative review of the game blaming connectivity issues has invested well over 100 hours into a ""bad"" game.*Pizza is incredible.  Sometimes I can't share it with my friends because the uber eats guy dropped their portions while delivering.  Because of this the pizza suddenly tastes horrible.  I'll write a negative yelp review and never site the driver. Now excuse me while I order the same pizza for 150 hours. Why? Because it's delicious.  Bad pizza though.*That sounds brain dead to me. Yet it's literally 90% of the negative reviews. Then there's the kid with way too much money that's upset that running the game on three 4k screens at once on ultra settings while bit coin mining in the back ground only nets 46 fps instead of 60. I can kind of understand this negative review. You paid a lot of money for your set up. But the game looks and runs smoother than its console counterpart so I'm not sure what you want. I also imagine that adults having this issue are just fine with not running the game ultra on three monitors. Only entitled brats could bother stating: ""My computer can't run this game in ""Real71f3p"". As a gamer looking for a positive gaming experience,  I don't consider that an actual issue.Dude who wrote the review about investing 60 hours to have his save deleted? He's legit. I'll leave him be. That's a pretty honest reason to be upset.All in all this game is insane. Fantastic port, fantastic content, attention to detail is overwhelming at times,  and it all runs so damn well. I saw a trail of ants carrying a monster part. I saw the little iguana raptors flee once enough of them are picked off. I see them get brave when their primary predator has been incapacitated.  There's pet collection, Quest collection, a complex skill structure that makes hyper interesting builds,  and a shocking amount of free upcoming content. Each weapon is like playing a new game. Each habituated is lush, interesting, unique, and an absolute joy to traverse. At no point do I feel confined to a small premade space, or cursed to wander endlessly through an open world environment. The quality of life choices in this game are enough to exceed any expectations I could've had for It.,And the pet system? You can catch ants. You can put your pets(The ants) in your home.  You can literally come home to a floor full of ants.  That's crazy.  If something gets game of the year over this, I'm going to be very upset.Monster hunter has always been niche.  I'm glad it now has it's time in the public eye. Just wish so many confused people understood the point if reviewing a GAME."

Also there is surprisingly a modding community for the game where people make cosmetic alterations to creating full blown custom quests and events.Recommended that you play using a controller."

BUT and I mean a massive BUT, there are so many dumb little problems with the online that it's ridiculous. Major issues-Alt tabbing sometimes kicks you offline-You can randomly be sent offline-Guilds were removed and replaced with Steam Groups. Would be fine, however the option to host a server with ONLY your Group members able to join was REMOVED from the Steam version mind-bogglingly enough. -You are unable to set basic join restrictions such as ""Friends Only"". Yes, believe it or not, this is a problem in 2018 for this game.-For people with seemingly less than 12 logical cores (typical i7 processor), there is microlag due to the developers trying to use more processing threads than they should. This is mostly fixed by a steam community mod called ""Special K"" atm, but still a developer fault. Minor issues-You cannot join friends who are in a quest where they have new cutscenes to still see.-Parties are locked into P2P servers called ""sessions"" meaning joining your friends consists of joining their ""session"", THEN joining their party.-Even in the same session, you can't see each other in the main lobbies. You have to be in a specific lobby area to see other players at all.All in all, this is definitely a must buy for Monster Hunter fans and a great game, but it's hampered by a lot of dumb issues that we thought the long wait for a pc release would fix. I like this game a lot, but please....CAPCOM, fix your game! It's a horrible online experience right now."

If you're considering buying this game and are hesitant because of all the negative reviews:1) Note that virtually all of the connection issues and many graphical issues have been fixed.2) Look at the hours played by people giving very salty reviews about a few FPS drops, the lack of editing of a certain graphics option, or complaining that the mouse control is too sticky (use a controller people!). It seems a lot of people refused to wait a few weeks for these problems to be fixed, and haven't changed their reviews to positive. The game itself is a really rewarding and addictive action RPG that is based on hunting monsters in different environments, by mastersing one (or several) of 14 different weapon types, beating up the monster alone or with a few fellow hunters, taking it's parts, crafting new weapons and armor, so that you can hunt stronger monsters. If you care about story, or exploring a vast open world with cool characters you won't find it here. Monster Hunter certainly has beautiful environments that are fun to explore, but it's based on fun and complicated combat with many weapons, and essentially doing many differnt kinds of thrilling boss fights with monsters to craft gear. Note that these fights will usually be 20 minutes long. This may seem like too much, but remember these fights are the whole point of this game. One complaint that I have, and this may be partially my fault since the game has only been out for 1.5 months on PC, is that once you finish the main story and do 30 hours or so of post game content, while still fun, it gets fairly repetitive. This is due to the fact that there are ""only"" about 30 something monsters, and the new ones roll will out slowly (monthly or less frequently). 100 hours or so of gameplay may seem like a lot, but for a non-story focused multiplayer game that the devs promise to support with content for years you expect more. Since this is the first AAA MH game for PC they have to remake all the skeletons, skins and attack patterns for the monsters in this environment, so I guess that can take a long time. I think the game will truly be fleshed out with content updates, but for now, expect about ~100 hours of gameplay that's not too repetitive, is addicitng and challenging."

Because it's on PC, I was able to introduce the Monster Hunter series to friends who had never played the previous games (and probably never would have, since they don't really play on consoles). It runs great on my computer, the combat is a lot of fun, and the skill curve is ; You'll get noticably better at the game over time, and it feels great to down a monster you had been having trouble with previously.The $60 price tag may not be for everyone, especially if they're on the fence about whether or not they'd like the game. I think it's definitely worth picking up while it's on sale, though."

5689,MaskedMouse,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027662208/,3,,1,368.5,August,"17,",126,0,1,"Fun and addicting game. Recommended to play together with friends and do the story solo!Pros:- Feels like an adventure!- Fun to farm, doesn't feel like a chore- Moderate / good difficulty scaling, sometimes difficulty spikes- Feels like an achievement hunting the more difficult monsters successfully- Good intro / tutorial information- Fun to play with friends, advisable to play the storyline solo- Overall a good port, had no crashes whatsoever. No memory leaks.- Can be played casually and hardcore!Cons:- Settings require a little tweaking so that the FPS doesn't drop. Audio to surround sound and headset.Personal opinion Cons:- Somewhat limited character creation customization, a lot of options feel the same. Couldn't really find a face for the character that I liked.- Max 4 player co-op, sometimes we have 5 players meaning someone has to sit one out. Would've liked to see bigger maps for 5 or 6 players. But I can understand for performance and balance that 4 is a maximum.- Server issues at release, but they're working on a fix! It made me fail a hunt somewhere at the beginning of the game. Also occured just about starting an arena quest with friends, we got seperated from eachother at the start due to this issue. Had quite a difficult fight alone.- Rewards for investigation quests feel a bit off. 10k for an easy vespoid quest that takes 3 min, compared to a hunt quest that gives the same amount but takes a lot longer to complete, like 15~30 minutes. When the quest is done with multiple ppl it splits the money reward making the quest reward even less attractive. Some quests have low time and low reward whereas others have high time and high reward. Just feels off.- Constantly spams Steam Friends that they play the game, a bug that requires to be fixed soon.What I like about monster hunter world is that the farm required doesn't feel like a chore to do. It's actually fun to farm.It has moderate / good difficulty scaling, things feel like an achievement and not being all that easy to complete at times. Which is nice.It is sad to see ppl complaining about either Denuvo, FPS or Server issues.Denuvo doesn't kill performance of MHW, I don't even notice it is in there.FPS is fine as long as you tweak your settings, there are so many hardware configurations for PC that creating a setting that works for everyone is just difficult. I've set Volume Rendering Quality to variable, the overall suggestion is turning this off to increase performance. Yes the game is CPU intensive, got an i7 6700k @ 4.5 GHz overclocked to support it. Do I have FPS drops? pretty much none.Server issues are just starting issues, probably a too high load for the servers. They're working on a fix though, sure it sucks when it happens but it does not make the game not recommendable like a lot of people do. They're going to fix it."
