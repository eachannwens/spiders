1,Trader Tiny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TraderTiny/,170,2,1,10.3,July,"5,",466,0,1,"Incredible game that was ahead of it's time and brought parkour, combat, and single player all together perfectly. I highly recommend this game, it had no flaws and despite it coming out in 2013 it was easily one of my favorite single player games I have ever played. Definitely worth the price with or without the sale."

Good campaign mode, the story is very nice. Good graphisms for a 2013 game. Sorry for my bad english speaking o:"
3,Artemis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtemisDergon/,167,4,1,11.5,June,"18,",196,4,1,"This is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."
4,The Sightless Swordsman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSightlessSwordsman/,163,1,1,77.7,July,"21,",153,3,1,"While I've seen many people who disagree, I think this game is magnificent.  The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.  I've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.I've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.Now, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.  I've played through the whole game twice the first three days I had it, and now I'm going in for a 3rd time just because I love it so much.  Enough said?Also, graphics?  There's a graphics option just for the quality of Lara's hair.   I think that speaks for itself.  It also absolutely KILLS my framerate when I turn it on, too.  My PC is decently powered too, frames are really smooth otherwise."
5,bUm805,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bUm805/,130,,1,14.0,December,"14,","10,452",1,1,"Used to play Tomb raider back in the day and got bored after the third one. But after watching the trailer for this game, I decided to pick it up and jumped into it.Well, that jump turned into a 10,000mph dive and I was hooked. HOOKED I SAY.Although I usually hate rail games, this remake is fantastic and I highly recommend you pick it up.Regardless if you pay full price (currently $14.99) or pick it up on sale, you will not regret it."
6,Gusmanbro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gusmanbro/,277,17,1,8.2,June,"23,",231,6,1,"I bought this game during the 2017 Summer sale..... and I beat it the day I got it. This is probably one of the best games i've ever played, and i've beat a good few. I would recommend to anyone looking for a new game. It took about 8 hours to beat, so it was an alright length.(and it was only $5??)Edited for fall 2017 badge"
7,Croft,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SergiFire/,314,21,1,31.5,July,"30,",531,11,1,"Review made by a huge Tomb-Raider fan. This is the reborn, the first story of our favourite adventurous girl in the world. The game has a lot of good and bad aspects, ✓  if you are planning to buy both  and  I would play this first as you are gonna find several references to Yamatai and Lara's friends in them. It's not necessary at all to play this game to understand future Tomb Raiders, although the experience is way better if you read all the documents you find on the island.✓  one of the most visible changes for all the players;  with a beautiful enviroment, great lighting and character models. We cannot forget the  mode which allows you to make Lara's hair more realistic and beautiful (back in 2013 this was something incredible)✓  you can jump, run, tumble... Map design is cool as it allows you to explore the whole area✓  you have hours of entertainment in front of you... Did you just finish the game? No problem! Now you can try to obtain all the achievements, hidden tombs, upgrade all your guns... However, as you have no elections during the story nothing will change if you replay it✓  sometimes it feels like  because of the brutal killing animations with both your pickaxe and bow. You can also crush your skull against a rock (which looks painful)✓  hit an run. Use your bow (it feels  to use it) and go Arthemis-like all around the map, or just make everything explode with your shotgun. The game offers upgrades so you can make them deadlier, which feels nice and is actually very useful✓  possibly the best feature of the game. You are probably going to fall in love with Lara because you'll see her origins. If you are a TR fan or if you have played old Tomb Raider games it's worth to mention that this story is ""not going to make any sense"" because it has nothing to do with them as"
8,❤ Lusty ❤,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Envy_Me_1_Forever_Till_Death/,957,2,1,23.1,December,"2,","1,161",26,1,"Do you remember Lara Croft? That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.This new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.The story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ass chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.To sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles."
9,Murphy's Lawyer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/murphyslawyer87/,449,35,1,34.7,September,"11,","1,122",10,1,"(Full review follows below) is absolutely one of the most enjoyable games I have ever played.  The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.The graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.The gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are “puzzles” to solve ( classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels—all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline “escape” scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.The game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don’t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).Lastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn’t  dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though— which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn’t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.So, in summary,  is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics— a truly “top-shelf” game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn’t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre."
10,AngryBoz68,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AngryBoz68/,308,,1,28.1,March,"9,",406,15,1,"As my first entry into the Tomb Raider franchise, I found this reboot a very well-crafted game.  It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game.The visual effects were stunning.  Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments.  Character animations were realistic and played smoothly.The writing was done pretty well for an Origin story.  The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in.  The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier.  The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings.  Voice acting was also very good.  I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes.  The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story.Combat takes a cover shooter approach.  The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely.  There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival.  There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game.  I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games.  In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little.  The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities.  The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death.I only had a couple of issues with the game overall...There were a few crashes as I played through the game.  Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently.  My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes.  The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying.For an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure.  Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones.  Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too ""shooty"" for my tastes.  I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game.  Boss encounters were also very lacking.  I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means.One other minor complaint are the death animations.  I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top.  Not sure if getting impaled through the face was really necessary after failing an action event.Overall I was very surprised and pleased by this game.  I am hoping that we will see further adventures for this rebooted series with the same attention to quality."

14,ρоѕιтяои_,https://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/,81,4,1,33.9,March,"6,",647,9,1,"Tomb Raider is a action adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix and Feral Interactive. This title follows the gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor as she must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island in order to escape its relentless hold. Being quite the cinematic experience from start to finish, this title quickly pulls you into a fantastic adventure and simply will not let go which is what a truly great game is able to accomplish with the right story, eyecatching graphics and edge of the seat action. Along the way you'll also get the opportunity to explore many tombs and solve some challenging puzzles as well. However, during the course of the game this title did make me cringe alot because this young lady manages to take quite the punishment from all manner of falls, injuries and combat yet despite these horrible events it was very inspirational to see her persevere through it all and emerge such a strong and confident female. This is a truly great origin story that will set the pace for what will no doubt be an excellent continuation of the Tomb Raider franchise.Graphically, this game is such a stunning showcase of visuals. Even though this title came out in 2013, on ultra settings one could easily mistake this for a ""next generation"" game as it's that gorgeous. The CG and rendering is amazing. The lighting is simply spectacular whether you're scaling the cliffside of some random mountain at high noon or quietly walking around a darkened tomb with a torch. Also, each area of the island is varied and has a uniqueness of it's own. This is definitely not one of those games that uses recycled environments...yes I'm talking to you Dragon Age II. One of my favorite things about the visuals in this title is the fantastic attention to detail and immersion that Crystal Dynamics took. For example, when Lara walks through a forest the shrubbery and foliage moves apart as she trudges through it. You can also hear twigs and leaves snap and rustle as you step on them it's simply brilliant. The game also does a fantastic job of seamlessly blending transition sequences and quick time events into the gameplay. There are no loading screens unless you're entering or exiting the game which is a very nice touch and really shows the amount of polish that Crystal Dynamics put on this title.The musical score and sound effects in this game are also exceptionally done. Jason Graves does a fantastic job with the soundtrack appropriately scoring action sequences, tomb raiding as well as dramatic moments of shock and awe which are quite abundant in this game. That ""attention to detail"" that I mentioned before about the graphics in this title definitely extends to the sound quality as well.  I've been a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise since the very beginning so when the series was due for a reboot I was very excited and rightly so because this is just an amazing title. I originally preordered this game and started playing at release a few years ago but, I'm sorry to say, a few hours into the game I ran into a big problem with the prompts not showing up during the quicktime events which was extremely annoying at the time...I believe I punched two maybe three babies I can't say for sure?! Crystal Dynamics eventually fixed the issue but before that happened I stopped playing and had moved on to something else but I can't believe that it has taken me this long to come back. With its gripping story, dazzling action and added multiplayer I'll no doubt be playing this game time and time again. There are also a multitude of achievements to seek which, if you're a gamer like me who loves to explore and find things, is a welcome addition to the gameplay. This title should be in everyones Steam library...highly recommended!!!"
15,DixieFlatline_01,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DixieFlatline_01/,257,,1,39.0,November,"21,",311,4,1,"Tomb Raider is a fun game that is really well made. It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. In the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that’s a pretty obvious point in this game’s favor!+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you’ll really like this one, but if no it’ll probably kinda piss you off.+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it’d be a lot of fun if they’d quit hogging the controller.+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don’t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value. Buy it used if you have a console, wait for a sale on Steam if you have a PC.For a much more in-depth critique, please check out the full version of this review:It talks about the Lara Croft Reboot, Character Empowerment, Ludonarrative Dissonance, Design, Platforming, and Quick Time Events.If you like what you see, join our Steam group for updates!"
16,Cracktus Jack,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030788488/,95,2,1,32.6,June,"5,",685,5,1,"is a 3rd Person Action Adventure. When the Endurance is grounded on the shores of an island while on an archaeological expedition, young Lara Croft must face the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the isle in order to save her friends while discovering the mystery that has been causing shipwrecks and airplane crashes for centuries.: This reboot of the franchise takes the game in a whole new direction where your young and naive character learns to survive against the harsh weather and homicidal community, all the while exploring the island. You train your skills with the experience points you amass from battle and from uncovering tombs and dozens of hidden collectibles, including relics and journals left from the earlier Yamatai Empire and other people who ended up on the island through the centuries. You also collect salvage and parts with which to craft and upgrade your various weapons. The story is pretty interesting in itself, you'll feel halfway between  and  through most of it. The platforming and environmental puzzle solving is optimized for a game controller, and the rest of the gameplay is ducking and shooting which seems pulled right out of the  series.: The interaction with the environment can break the immersion in subtle ways, from the climbable cliff sides that are exclusively located at way too convenient locations, to the fact that there usually is only one specific pre-determined way to solve puzzles or reach specific areas. Ammo is also too convenient: loot an enemy who was attacking you with a bow, and it just happens that the only ammo he has is the one for that machine gun you haven't reached full ammo capacity, yet. The more cinematic scenes are often resolved by a quicktime event involving timed or repetitive button pressing. A mere handful of side characters get any development, and there's nothing you can do to save those that will face a story-determined death.: ★★★★☆ - Next on your list!This game is much better than I expected it to be. It might not be genre-defining, but it's a franchise-changing success that convinced me to get my hands on . Fans of the original games beware: this one is very different. But if you never cared for the franchise before, you really should reconsider and give this iteration a try!—————————————————————————"
17,W=F.SCOSθ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LOLPPPWW22211/,63,1,1,20.7,June,"9,",724,3,1,"This time reviewing a perfect rated game. First of all, I have completed overall 100% of this game (not by achievement side) means all collectibles, challenges and everything. So let's start.★ Gameplay ➜Tomb Raider is an Action, adventure,puzzle-solving third person game based on an open-world environment. There is only one map in this game and enough to explore the whole world. There is no mini-map. By its name, the game series should be more focused on searching for tombs, artifacts, relics, historical interest, puzzle, traps, etc. I was expecting that but it doesn't exist properly here. The thing is something different. First 80% of gameplay gonna be end by saving your friends and learning the survival tactics which makes this game more enjoyable but doesn't judge its name properly. But the developer arranged the whole trilogy successfully like the next sequel is going to be more tomb searching rather than learning survival tactics and the main protagonist of this game Lara Croft going to be a great adventurer and experienced.In this game, the gameplay is mainly focused on using environmental stuff properly, learn survival tactics against some crazy enemies and weak animals. So hunting is a part of this game but not so much enlarged. There are some RPG elements I have found. The skill tree was really good but expecting some more useful skills. Combat is based on weapons bow and cover as well as playing stealth is important to success in Lara's opinion. Bow, Weapon and it's customization is also great, you have to explore for parts which are really enjoyable. Here searching for collectibles is interesting because every time you have try something new, so never felt bored and reveals interesting information. Climbing is my favorite part in this game because it is not only restricted in 'W and Space' but also using equipment is also necessary as there are climbing-axe,rope ascender, rope arrow etc . Enemies are crazy, they do everything to get Lara. So every time searching for something new is required to survive their ambushes. Quick time event and close quarter combat were like an action movie. I think this part made this game famed. Besides insane fighting with enemies, there are some optional Tomb which is not so much puzzled in my opinion. Lara has got a great instinct, you have to use it to progress in this case. Using fire torch in dark caves thrilled me. There is no repetitive content so I never felt bored. But I have felt some lacking like there is no underwater part as Lara is on an island. There are no survivors without Lara and it's team so there is no side mission in this game. Lara can't climb trees etc.★Story ➜Story is really cool, some people suggested me to explore it's story. After completing the story, I am fully satisfied by story progression. Basically, Lara wanted to be an explorer and adventurer from her childhood, wanted to explore the beauty of this world. So as part of his dream, she was in a team traveling by ship intending to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai which is the Island of Japan. There is a famous archaeologist in that team but the whole team always listens to Lara as she has got good instincts. According to Lara's speech, they changed directions and their ship crashed by a dangerous storm. So they stuck on a mysterious island as there is no escape for dangerous weather and separated from teammates. Now the journey starts from here.The story was full of mystery and suspense, related to their whole team like a Hollywood movie.Story was large enough to enjoy.★★ Graphics, Optimization, Soundtrack and Miscellaneous ➠➠➠As a game of 2013 graphics designing was really cool. Design of Character, Environment, Jungle, Tree, details, texture, shadow, water, bloom, lens and flare, sky, cloud everything was fine. Not best but fine. The combination of shiny and stormy weather was amazing. Optimization was quite well. But I was expecting better sound quality and more music. Faced a lot of bugs like I have executed jumping upward but Lara jumps on right or left and dead. The animation and movement screen during the quick time event like escaping a collapsing cave was up to the mark. I was amazed by their story representation.★Multiplayer ➠So many don't know about the multiplayer of this game. Multiplayer is actually quite fun. It is totally PVP and has got a match instantly. Ping was Under 150 which means totally playable, PVP rewards are good, can be used in single player. Multiplayer of this game is also recommended if anyone wants to spend time.Personal Overall Rating -19/20As a Tomb Raider rating -6/10 (Less historical stuff and puzzles, more action,adventure and RPG)By the way, Lara is one of the greatest female thief in this world. Sorry for any mistakes If I made any"

This game goes from a bold and engaging story to a sense of adventure, action and emotion that pushes one to want to play some more.This game is able to display hair very beautifully with the new Pantene TressFX shampoo. It almost looks like each strand of Lara Croft's hair is moving with the rules of physics.If your down with killing hundreds of men with a compound bow and climbing mountains with your climbing axe, well then this game is for you."

20,DyeHardFan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ianbadeer/,108,,1,18.8,December,"3,",244,1,1,"This review comes from someone with no previous exposure to previous Lara Croft games.The story and setup took me a moment to realize this was a prequel coming-of-age story, and not one where Lara already has all her skills developed. That said, it offers an interesting storyline for developing who Lara Croft becomes and provides some neat avenues for that to happen.The gameplay is reasonably fluid, climbing and navigating have their moments of frustration, but overall it's a positive experience. If you're into the cinema feel, this game is like living in a movie: the cutscenes are impressive, the lighting and textures are gorgeous and the whole feel is immersive. As Lara gets beaten and bruised throughout the game, you'll find yourself wishing for a reprieve for her, because the events just never let up.Achievement-wise, the collectables offer a little more backstory, and I was able to get them all in the first playthrough before finishing the game, so that earns props from me.The important factor, is it fun? Yes, you'll have a great time climbing and fighting throughout the game, but your experience is more limited to being along for the ride in Lara's story, rather than actual feeling like you're influencing anything she's doing.Overall, it's a solid adventure with a great cinematic feel, just don't expect too much control over it."

I thoroughly enjoyed this game (this is the first TR game I’ve played so I can’t compare it with Lara’s previous outings) and, a few gripes aside. Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play."
22,PrinzEugen,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030080447/,64,3,1,40.4,January,"23,","1,260",6,1,"This game is one of the most widely praised on Steam, currently sitting at an average rating of 95%, a figure that is all the more impressive since it is based on over 60,000 user reviews. I played it several years after its release in 2013, but even almost five years later, it still holds its own in almost every domain.I only touched briefly upon the earlier instalments in this series, so I won’t be comparing the reboot with the games that preceded it. And just like any game, a reboot, being a fresh start of a series, deserves to be judged on its own merits. In this case, those merits are abundant: I have seldom enjoyed an action adventure game as much as I did here. The story starts promising, with Lara Croft on a discovery towards an almost mythical archeologic place together with a fellow professor, a film crew and the ship’s crew. Things do go awfully wrong very soon, and the game tries to evoke how Lara evolves from your next-door archaeologist into a very tough survivor. Although this is a great concept, it’s not executed to perfection: Lara becomes a battle-hardened killer and an extremely tough survivor way too soon to be believable in any way. Still, I quickly felt a connection to Lara, mainly thanks to the impressive voice acting and some neat details like her “thought by the campfire” which come up now and then. The fact that she looks gorgeous, and far more realistic than in the earlier games, surely did play a role in this as well.Not that the game aims for realism in any other way: I’ve seldom seen a character survive falls from such heights, and even taking several bullets in a gunfight can’t get our heroine down. The story doesn’t entirely convince in the end: although it is expertly told, it ultimately suffers from too many clichés and foreseeable twists. But I doubt that the majority of the people playing a  game are really wanting a believable story. This game is all about fast-paced action scenes which get the adrenalin pumping and more relaxed exploration, looking for as much loot and collectibles as possible in order to upgrade your weapons (which look great) and to unlock new skills. The feeling of progression is definitely there, and since the enemies become tougher and more numerous, the game never becomes overtly easy despite Lara’s weapons and dirty tricks packing a lot of punch in the final stages of the game.The actual gameplay is very smooth and pleasant, both in the combat and in the pivotal exploring (climbing and sliding included) department. Playing with an Xbox 360 controller, Lara felt very responsive indeed. Graphically, this is still an impressive game, despite its age. The island off Japan’s coast comes to live vividly, thanks to some wide views over both ocean and land, and an abundant use of vertical space: climbs, rockfaces and hills feel for once almost real, not diminutive. There are enough options to suit everyone’s taste and the game ran extremely smoothly for me at 60-75fps on my mid-range pc (see my profile if you’re interested in the specs).I didn’t buy any of the dlc, since it is mostly geared towards the multiplayer element of the game, which seems dead by now (early 2018). So I cannot comment on that aspect of the game. Sadly, for those aiming for a perfect game achievements-wise, a fair amount of those can only be obtained through the multiplayer, so it would be almost impossible to get the game towards 100% anymore.In the end, this was a very pleasant gaming experience thanks to the highly polished state of the game, which executes a good overall plan almost to perfection. It didn’t go beyond that, however: the experience probably won’t stick in my memory, as I never felt truly emotionally involved or intellectually challenged. But there is nothing wrong with a game that just wants to be excellent entertainment, after all."

When I first discovered Tomb Raider, I was so enthralled that I played it three times back-to-back, only stopping because my backlog was crying. The first thing I noticed were the gorgeous graphics.  There are tiny details everywhere, from incidental carvings that you'll only see for a moment, to the way Lara shivers in the cold, or the way her arms shake with exertion when she lifts something heavy.  The cutscenes are beautifully-directed, and add much to the story.  The voices, music, and sound effects are superb, and every aspect of this game weaves together to form a stunning and vibrant tapestry. EVERYTHING is beautiful, even the ugly things. is multi-faceted, and you can tailor it to your preferred style.  Want to face your enemies head-on, Rambo-style?  You can do that!  Prefer to explore and learn everything about this island and its inhabitants?  You can do that, too!  My personal preference is option #2 with a healthy dose of I-Am-The-Night stealth and silently removing enemies before they know I'm there. are many, ranging from relics, treasure maps, and journals to area-specific quests like blowing up old sea mines.  I am a completionist, and one who loves finding every last scrap of story and information in a game, but there is an incentive to find everything possible, even for the Rambo-types... Experience and Salvage. nets you Skill Points, which are used to upgrade Skills: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler.  I won't bore you with the list of possible upgrades, but here's an example of each: Increased Exp when looting, Increased ammo capacity, Dodge skills  allows you upgrade your various weapons: Bow, Pistol, Rifle, and Shotgun.  You'll even find weapon parts if you look hard enough, which increases the power of your weapons even more!The  will show all of the items that will get you to 100% completion on the game, but do NOT show quest items, ammo, orange plants, or salvage, all of which will also add to your Exp & Salvage totals.  Another great way to earn both is by hunting and looting, especially if you go for those headshots I mentioned earlier.  (Bonus experience; ka-CHING!)Want those treasure maps?  The secret tombs are where you'll find them.  These tombs are pretty hard to miss, since you'll hear a chime play whenever you get close to them.  Raiding a tomb consists of puzzling out how to get to the payoff (large chest, ho!), and generally take about 10 minutes each to complete.  They're a great addition to the game, and the experience bonus is a GREAT incentive to go exploring!Throughout your travels you'll find , which serve as extra saves points (the game auto-saves), and will also allow you to apply the skill points you've earned and to spend your salvage on upgrades.  They also serve as """" points, and will allow you to transport to different areas of the map instantly.  Be aware that fast travel is not always available, depending on where you are in the story.There are intermittent  that will require you to... well, to survive. lol~  If you're dexterity-challenged such as myself, I recommend sticking with it -- It's absolutely worth the many times you'll end up dying. ;)There are  available, 15 of which are for multi-player include Concept Art (too many to count!) and 18 Character ModelsIn closing, to me Tomb Raider 2013 is well-nigh the perfect game, blending all of my favorite elements with a hefty dose of knuckle-whitening action, and leaving me with nothing but a feeling of total satisfaction.  I cannot stress enough how good this game is, so what are you waiting for?  PLAY IT NOW!!"

28,literally me,https://steamcommunity.com/id/night_cloud/,93,4,1,26.0,December,"31,",246,4,1,"Adventure found me.'Tomb Raider' is the reboot of the beloved series of adventures featuring the fearless woman Lara Croft. In this game however, Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.Tomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.I strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.9.5/10"

36,✦ hastur ✦,https://steamcommunity.com/id/catbytes/,57,2,1,22.5,December,"6,",115,1,1,"PROS- Excellent Storyline, plays out almost like a movie. The storyline for Tomb Raider made me care about each character and what happened to them throughout the duration of my playthrough. It never felt tedious and was excellently written. Loved it.- Open World is a plus. I really liked how the developers made the environment open for exploration in each level, which really encouraged you to look around for secret areas, items, etc. that would spawn around the map.-Fighting is well programmed. Fights in Tomb Raider always felt smooth, and through the style of the game, it put YOU in the driver's seat on how to engage enemies. The variety of weapons in the game match these various styles too, and they sometimes even have uses outside of fighting, which I found interesting. - The Goal in the game is clear. Tomb Raider is a perfect example of great script writing in this sense. I never felt like I was aimlessly doing something in the plot. I felt like every action I made had some meaning that pushed me closer to the end of the story.- The game is challenging, but not overly so. Playing my first run-through of the game, I had no idea what I was getting into. At the same time, the game can be very conducive to new players, teaching them the mechanics of each tool early off in the game without deliberatly giving you a tutorial that has no meaning to the game. That being said, I died many times, but quickly learned how to avoid the situations that had killed me in the past. - Game Environment is gorgeous, VERY immersive. Each scene has a picturesque feel to it. You can be running through an environment and be awestruck from just looking out into the distance. You feel like you're there beside Lara Croft.CONS- Won't hold your hand. This game can be very conducive to new players, but I was frustrated with certain levels in the game and their difficulty. This game will not hold your hand, whether you like it or not, it'll throw you into the deep end with no floaties. Prepare yourself!- No substantitive DLC! The DLC for Tomb Raider consists mostly of player skins, but I would've loved to see another few missions added as something a little extra. I understand the studio that made this game was planning to make Rise of the Tomb Raider and didn't want to creatively drain themselves, but I would've loved to see some post-story missions or thematic material. This has to be one of the best games I've ever played. If you're still looking to buy Tomb Raider, it's always on sale during Steam sales, but it is always worth it to buy this game. I literally have nothing bad to say about it functionally or about the story. You WILL be amazed. 9.5/10"

The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not  gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your ""to play list"". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues. I have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.Yeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.Anyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times."

Despite my deep and abiding love for Indiana Jones I never had any interest in her games, not until the distant Guardian of Light made it to Xbox Live Arcade. That primed the big Tomb Raider reboot to be the perfect place to jump on the raiding train, especially with its open world features and collectibles that felt included just to appeal to hopeless packrats like myself. I expected a bit of spectacle with it but what I got far surpassed my expectations, both in enjoyment and intensity.Forget the T-rex slaying supersoldier Lara you might remember from your childhood, this one is a humble researcher on an archaeological expedition. The crew of the research vessel Endurance is on the trail of the lost Japanese kingdom of Yamatai somewhere in the west Pacific, and ends up shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Things go south for Lara and her friends very quickly as the island’s ruthless inhabitants hunt them down for their own ends. Pushed to her limits, Lara begins to grow and adapt into a warrior who can fight back against her foes and save her friends from threats both familiar and fantastic.“Pushed to her limits” is not just flowery language, as much as I like being flowery. The hallmark of the Tomb Raider reboot is struggle, illustrating exactly what dire circumstances transform Lara from a bright-eyed scholar to a stone-cold killer. In the first twenty minutes of the game she wades through filthy water, eats a chunk of rebar to the gut, and weathers a brutal assault. The game never really lets up on poor Lara either, reuniting her with friends before cruelly snatching them away, sending aircraft and entire villages tumbling at her, and sticking you with some of the most disturbing death animations around if you foul up certain escapes. Honestly it can feel like a horror game at times if you’re not so good at avoiding the quick-time-event fatalities.I’m getting this out of the way because it’s an important caveat to an otherwise magnificent game. You’ll need a bit of a strong stomach to get through this one, or at least suspension of disbelief that wading through pits of fouled blood won’t kill a person via disease outright. Lara’s journey is a harrowing and stressful one but it’s also full of incredible sights and setpieces to experience. Early on you have to climb a radio tower and the sequence is done so well that I began sweating and second-guessing my actions, even while marveling at the incredible scenery. The many escapes from collapsing or exploding structures are done just as well, and the story beats that accompany them help build the legend of the warrior woman Lara becomes under your control.In terms of control, Tomb Raider plays much like other third-person adventures like Arkham Asylum or Shadow of Mordor. The melee brawls of those games are traded for fast-paced cover shooting and vicious ice-pick takedowns here though, so if you were looking for more blood with your tower-climbing and spelunking this will do the trick. Lara isn’t Rambo (yet) so your best options are always going to be stealthy takedowns and long-range gunning, though later in the game the robust upgrade system opens up additional options for close-combat management that can alter your playstyle. Weapon upgrades also provide you more reliable tools for staying in the middle of the fight and always being the last one standing.The real meat of the game is the exploring and, dare I say it, tomb raiding, and in these areas it does not disappoint. The vast island you find yourself in is divided into discrete regions that can be fast-traveled between once you establish camps in them, and each contains a variety of artifacts and notes to turn up. The collectibles are very well done here, providing valuable backstory on the bizarre events in the island’s history and entertaining challenges in reaching them. The tombs themselves are by far the highlight of the game, cleverly-designed puzzle dungeons that will tax your brain at least in a small way before allowing you access to the historical riches within. If I were to lay one real complaint against the game it’s that there aren’t enough of these tombs to raid, both because they’re so entertaining to raid and because it’s the name of the game for God’s sake.Even four years out the graphics are breathtaking at times, tracing every detail of ancient villages and ruined bunkers in the very grain of rotting wood and cracked concrete. Locations look both real and fantastic, images right out of National Geographic of places you can barely believe exist on the same planet as you. Vast caves, cliff-side temples, and snowy peaks await here, matched with some expert sound design that brings it all together with meaty impacts and threatening booms. It’ll take you nearly twenty hours to see everything this title has to offer, and every minute of it promises to be an incredible journey. I may have missed out on Lara’s early adventures but this reboot does more than enough to make me a huge fan, and eager to see what comes next.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at  or on my !"

Thin, small, young student with no relevant skill which  main protagonist of action game should have. But yay, we still have that tight shirt and jeans. After a while, you already know what's going on. Lara is war beast who knock the f. out army of occultists with wide variety of arsenal.Story is banging. Opening even more. Starting things up with awesome cutscene where is our beautiful new rebooted Lara reading on the boat and boom, you wake up in some cave where ugly mountain bastards wants to eat you or kill you or both. If you pay attention, you might say the whole story was pretty predictable but surprises are way way way up and there's lot of them. Singeplayer will last you for estimated 8 hours, (if you go for 100% then maybe 12) but to be honest at least for me, going for 100% was nowhere near to being annoying. It is one of very few games where I really enjoyed getting collectibles and challenges. Places are absolutely beautiful, from deep raining jungles to underground caves, from sandy shipwreck beaches to town from post-apocalyptic movie to amazing ancient asian spots, tombs, houses and villages. Tombs are pretty easy. Maybe first one will be kinda medium, until you realise how the game works, but rest is really obvious and few of them you'll finish within two minutes. Stealth option was funny too.Multiplayer is just to extend your gaming experience. It's nothing significant, after a while it gets really boring, but it's worth putting multiplayer time in to finish achievements. Sometimes when you get nice crew, it can be fun, and some matches you will really remember, but as you can probably see, its understandable that it's not made to be big as BF, but just so Square Enix can sell DLC. This reboot was really great idea, and I am so glad that they did it. Lara is beautiful, it's fun with her and Tomb Raider 2013 is true success. I can't wait to finally play Rise of the Tomb Raider and I wonder if it'll be close to this, or even better!"

Even 7 years down the line (as I write this in 2020). The island you explore is bustling with fauna and environmental effects that make the island feel alive from the get go. And as you explore it only adds onto that. The characters have their own personalities and backstories that make you feel like you're on the island with them. And the story is so raw and down to earth, as you play as Lara discovering her true potential as an awesome historian/archaeologist, you feel like you could be a Croft yourself.There are some character game-play issues throughout, but this was more than likely due to the fact I was not actually supposed to do those things. I only experienced a couple of clipping issues, but considering the level design and fluidity of progress and movement in-game, it wasn't game-breaking.. (I probably deserved it for pushing the game in such a way).Something well worth noting is with optional areas and in-game objects. There are many 'artefacts' and 'documents' that really flesh out the whole game, bringing a sense of realism to the history of ... Well everything! (Other than the common enemy, the Solarii ... There are an unbelievable amount of them on what is supposed to be a lost-unreachable island)But other than a couple of very minor personal issues I experienced, the game itself was one of the best stories I've invested my time into, and for anybody who likes single-player games I couldn't recommend it anymore...And for those that remember the old games, you'll be happy to know with great character design and clever game-play camera angles, Tomb Raider has never looked better! ;D"

56,Biomechanoid,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989376417/,51,2,1,11.8,July,"19,",494,3,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) is a pretty solid game in most cases but also a bad Tomb Raider game. The combat feels great, the graphics are excellent, the mouse and keyboard controls are fluid and the game is very optimized. The story is pretty predictable and not that great. Despite being a Tomb Raider game, the tombs are optional and the puzzles are quite easy to solve. The platforming has been made much more simplified now that Lara can stick to almost anything she comes near. There is some exploration in the areas but not as much as it should be. You can go back and revisit the areas since the island is ""open-world"", but there isn't much stuff to do there aside from collecting some boring collectables and the optional tombs. All of the weapons in this game feel great. I liked how the guns evolve when you get enough parts. For example, the WW2 submachine gun you start with turns into some sort of AK-47 and your trench shotgun turns into a SPAS-12 combat shotgun. The weapons sound great aswell. The game sometimes tries too hard to be cinematic, especially at the beginning of the game which is a scripted QTE fest. Actually, there are too many scripted sequences in the later parts aswell which got dull pretty quickly. The QTEs for keyboard are terrible. They use these stupid icons mainly instead of just showing the actual damn key. Sometimes the game does tell you which key to press but it should have been like that in the first place (I would have preferred no QTEs though).Lara goes from innocent girl to stone-cold killer very early on in the game. When she does her first-kill, she goes like ""OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE"", then the next thing I'm pulling 360 n0sc0pe headshots with the bow with ease. The survival elements are not very deep at all and feel kinda phoned in. There is hardly any resource management since you can find a ton of ammo on the ground and Lara can regenerate her health. The combat is your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last few years, though with a bit of jumping here and there. It's pretty good for the most part. The game holds your hand too much, however. The games treats you like an idiot with giving you forced hints while you're doing the (easy) puzzles. Thankfully, the survival instints feature (Which highlights the stuff where you're supposed to go) is optional. Didn't play much of the multiplayer so can't say much about it but who plays a Tomb Raider game for the multiplayer anyway?Overall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a decent TPS but not a good Tomb Raider game at all. The game would be a lot better if had more exploration, a bigger focus on tombs, little to no QTEs and scripted mumbo jumbo and less hand-holding. Even with all the flaws in the game, I still enjoyed playing it."
57,The Horror Network,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathlessVoid/,34,1,1,17.9,February,"6,","3,686",13,1,"This review may be a little late to the party, by about six years, but it's never too late to talk about Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics' masterpiece of a reboot that's simply titled Tomb Raider. It's hard to believe that this game is just nearing its six-year anniversary, mostly because it still looks incredibly stunning and it's still one of the freshest action games that you can play. It's a reboot that not only revamped the Tomb Raider series in its entirety, but it also set the bar for what an action game should be.Of course, the name Lara Croft is known far and wide; from her triangle-boobed early PlayStation days through to her more recent top-down style adventures. This simply named Tomb Raider reboot puts an entirely new spin on a character that most of us have known our entire lives, by shedding new light on her personality and background. Accompanied by her close friends, a mentor, and a ""celebrity"" archaeologist, Lara's first expedition begins on Yamatai; a fictional lost island in the Dragon's Triangle off the coast of Japan, where she is in search of an ancient lost kingdom. However, her ship, The Endurance, soon gets struck by a violent storm and sinks, leaving the group stranded on the hostile and uninviting island with no means of escape. Even worse, a mysterious curse seems to thwart any and all attempts to leave. It's up to Lara and her crew to figure out exactly what is preventing them from leaving Yamatai.The story marks the turning point of Lara going from being a normal archeology major to a hardened badace survivor. The gameplay in this release is more linear in comparison to Rise or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but that's not to say that there isn't a lot to do. There are tombs to explore, artifacts to collect, challenges to complete, journals to read, and many collectibles to find. You can also upgrade Lara's equipment by finding upgrade components and salvage. She ends up getting decked out with quite a few weapons, a pistol, rifle, shotgun, and her bow, although later games see many variations of the weapons that can be used. There are also three different skill trees to max out, all which provide Lara with powerful benefits to make her feel just that much more like the hardened survivor that she eventually becomes.As it has been said many times over, this reboot of Tomb Raider is exceedingly dark and gritty; there are even moments where you'll find Lara covered head-to-toe in blood. The graphics still hold up exceedingly well for a game that's six years old. More importantly, the gameplay still feels fresh even after over half a decade; this is thanks to the many twists and turns that the plot takes, players never know exactly what they're in for just around the next corner. It's also thanks to the many unique action sequences and interactive scenes.So, is the reboot Tomb Raider worth playing even still in 2019? Absolutely, it's quite possibly one of the best games that you could play in your lifetime. Even if you're not a fan of any of the previous incarnations of Lara Croft or the gameplay style of the original Tomb Raider releases, this total retcon of the series is sure to win you over. If you've already played this reboot and you want to breathe some fresh life into it, it's worth picking it up again on PlayStation 4; the system uses the speaker on its controller to add an entirely new level of depth to the experience. It's a hell of a steal on sale for $3.74 CAD on Steam, but despite how good it is you should be hard-pressed to pay full price since the multiplayer portion has long-since died.The Horror Network  |  Click for Gore"

You will start with old weapons and latter you can find components for an automatic rifle with a grenade launcher so don't forget to open all boxes and explore all hidden tombs. Exploring tombs is fun and they are not same, each offers different puzzles and interesting places. I don't prefer games where you need to jump a lot, but in this game I really enjoyed it. The story is not long. You can finish it in around 8 hours, but I played 15 hours because I explored all hidden tombs and collect all collectables and read it all texts.

Unfortunately, this is my first Tomb Raider game, so these aren’t the thoughts of a diehard fan. Therefore, I can’t tell you whether the franchise took a step in the right direction or not. I was personally anticipating Tomb Raider to be a copy of an Uncharted game, and I don’t think that my inaccuracy has ever brought me this much happiness. In fact, comparing this with Uncharted is rather silly, because the similarities between the two games end rather quickly. Tomb Raider is its own game with its own unique features. The gameplay is everything I could’ve asked for, and more. You gain XP and purchase skills that are divided into three different branches, or “skill trees”. There are many different ways to gather resources, which allow you to upgrade the 4 weapons Lara finds throughout her journey, each of which have unique advantages in combat. In addition, challenges and collectables are introduced with rewarding incentives, which will encourage you to dive into these fun optional features. While the characters may not have these remarkably appealing personalities, Crystal Dynamics gave us an incredibly strong protagonist. Lara Croft is a clever and tough woman who plays the “hero role” perfectly. Character detail and animations are nearly lifelike and the cut-scenes are cinematically brilliant.

70,Emporor Penguin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EmpororPenguin/,31,,1,10.6,November,"26,",130,0,1,"My opinion: Tomb Raider was an pretty good addition to the series, with only a few overlook-able problems.I picked up this game during the summer sale, so I had a plethora of time to play it. At the time, it was 75% off, so I picked up a normally $60 game for  $12.49. At the time of writing, it is yet again on sale for 75% off. Is it worth it? My answer is that for this price, it's a steal.I hadn't played a Tomb Raider game in a while, it must have been a few years ago since I played one, so the chance to explore a reboot of the series excited me, especially at this price. At the start, I had a few problems - the game would crash at the introductory cutscene, and since lore is one of my favorite things in games, I restarted the game and hoped it wouldn't happen again. Unfortunately that wasn't the case, and I wasted more time. I ended up skipping the intro and going to YouTube, but this was a prevalent problem. It does crash at some points, save points are usually not that far behind but the long loading screen just made it an annoying inconvenience. But if you're willing to look past a few lost immersion points, then you're in for a hell of a game.To start off with, the game looks fantastic. I had my graphics on low because of my sub-par computer, and it still looks amazing. Putting them on ultra would be fantastic. The scenery, and sounds, and little touches make this incredibly immersive if not for the third person perspective. The people move fluidly and realistically as well, I'm not exactly sure but I'm betting they used real life actors to animate the scenes.Want to continue reading for a more in depth review?

73,Trey Tom,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984355081/,49,,0,17.1,March,"21,",273,4,1,"I've played Tomb Raider games since the first one, so I have a soft spot for them. But this one made me consider, why I actually like them. Unfortunately what I found out is that the parts that made other TR games fun, were changed, or lost in this one. First of all, the fundation of any Tomb Raider - platforming and puzzles. For me, that part of the game was usually the most fun - figuring out where to go, how to get there, and what to do after that. And in this game, it's just not well done. You just follow the white line, and go along. I did not even used the yellow marker (pointing you to destination) and still I was never lost, or forced to stop and think for a secound. And puzzles - the so called ""tombs"", they are a joke. Let's not kid ourselfes a kid from kindergarten will figure them out in like a minute. Another thing is combat. While in the other TR games, you run around and use the mobilty of Lara to evade enemy atacks, while you pepper them with your dual guns (which btw became Lara's trademark, changed in this game to a bow :/) in this game combat is a cover based shooter. Your character doesn't jump, and roll and shoot, rather she just moves from cover to cover. It makes fighing boring. Also it's worth to mention here, that you don't have a lifebar. Instead you just heal all dmage by not taking damge for couple seconds. That also means no more healing kits to find around the maps. And the last thing I'll point out is exploring. In older games exploring was fun, because it rewarded you with ammo, better weapons, healing kits - items that had much impact on your gameplay. Here you get scrap, artifacts and stories. And as much as I enjoy the lore aspect of this game, I can't agree with the scrap mechanics. You get all weapons from story, so there is no way to find a better weapon before you're supposed to, Instead you can upgrade them, yet the upgrades are limited by gun parts you find (meaning if you like some weapoin in particular you can't just pour all your scrap in it, because the part you need to upgrade it is only attainable in the place thats way further up the storyline). The effect of these mechanics is that you don't really feel the need to explore maps, nor you get enjoment from finding hidden stuff. Unless of course you enjoy finding pointless items scattered on the map just to see that you have 100% the map. So to finish this review up I say this: from all the Tomb Raider games I've played this one is the best to look at, and the worst to play, It just does not feel like a Tomb Raider game. If that is the way they want this reboot to go, I don't think I'll enjoy the new Tomb Raider games half as much as the old ones."
74,BOO! it's nathalie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/booitsnathalie/,38,1,1,19.6,September,"19,","2,080",4,1,"It’s the tagline that’s been attached to every trailer, screenshot, and press release surrounding Crystal Dynamics 2013 reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, but it actually serves as a pretty good summarization of the series as a whole. From the revolutionary first game, through its progressively mediocre sequels, eventual revival with Legend and then repeated downward spiral, it’s not always been the most successful of franchises but nonetheless is one of the most enduring throughout its failures. With Tomb Raider 2013 (hence force just “Tomb Raider” or “TR”) Crystal Dynamics has done away with many of the hallmarks of the series, leaving something behind that some may argue bares little resemblance to its predecessors but in my eyes is the exact incarnation of what Tomb Raider needed to become relevant again.Gone are the lengthy, puzzle riddled tombs, the emphasis on absurd level designs, lackluster combat, and an enormous set of breasts standing in for a protagonist. In their place we find a tightly knit, extremely cinematic, blockbuster action game that completely overhauls what we consider TR to be and turns it into something far more compelling and polished than the series has ever been.As an origin story, TR is as much the story of Lara Croft’s ascension from curious but naive archaeologist to the incredibly self sufficient treasure hunter we know her best as, as it is the harrowing account of an expedition gone south as Lara and co become stranded on an island populated by what could most easily be described as the criminally insane. It’s a darker narrative than we’ve ever seen with Lara, with moments that made me legitimately cringe and could very nearly be categorized as horror, but it’s also the deepest and most personal.Lara is a fragile and vulnerable character, but not a helpless one, and in watching her grow and overcome so many trials she becomes an immensely relatable and empathetic character. She keeps your attention from cheap sex appeal, but for the fact she’s a believable and well acted character; flawed and broken by the events around her, but never beaten by them. It’s a shame the others characters didn’t receive nearly the same level of development, though for what they are they provide enough of a narrative hook to be memorable. If I had any issue with the story, it’s that it disappointingly falls back on the series trademark supernatural elements in the latter half, which came off as almost silly in such a realistic and brutal world. But even then, the plot moves at such a quick pace and so much velocity that it remains almost absurdly compelling the entire way through, making it easy to gloss over an occasional lack of exposition to just enjoy the ride.Where TR has seen the most growth over past games though, is in the refinement and broadening of its mechanics. Combat is no longer a tedious lock on affair, but made up of brutal, intense encounters that are consistently evolving and requiring you to constantly think on your feet as enemies react and attempt to flank you from all sides. For this the auto cover system works shockingly well, causing you to crouch behind objects when enemies are nearby and easily pop in and out as you pop enemies off. It’s fast and feels incredibly fluid, never once breaking on me as similar systems have in the past, but instead given me one less thing to worry about so I can focus my attention elsewhere.This would mean little if the gunplay wasn’t excellent, but to Crystal Dynamics credit they’ve crafted some of the most satisfying third person shooting of any game I’ve played in recent memory. Your arsenal is limited, but it’s composed solely of the weapons you will actually need, chief among them an amazing bow which works brilliantly as both a stealth weapon and a powerful killing machine if you’re spotted. It defines the combat in TR and gives it its own identity that I’ve yet to tire from.The other most prominent part of the experience is the Uncharted-esq platforming (I tad ironic considering where that game got most of its roots), which if anything is scaled back from what it used to be but is made up for with how intuitive and fast movement has become. There is no extraneous platforming to be found here, but a focused and dynamic moveset that works with the environment to direct you where to go and gives you no trouble getting there. It really cannot be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the often confusing, terribly imprecise level traversal of even Crystal Dynamics’s prior TR game, Underworld. I never once had to fuss with the camera or controls, which is more than I can say of even most of TR’s contemporaries.Wrapping this altogether is an open world that finds the sweet spot between so large it becomes overwhelming to navigate, and too small you lose all sense of scale. It’s distinct and enjoyable to explore, packed with secrets that actually mean something and are used to flesh out the world past the core plot.And less you somehow forget, this is an absolutely astonishing looking game, with a recognizable art style and some incredible environmental effects. Watching a building be torn apart by violent winds, or fire engulf a ship is jawdropping, even more so when it’s viewed through a wonderfully cinematic camera that escalates even simple scenes into something you can’t look away from. It’s simply gorgeous, and has been scarily well optimized so much so that my mid-range PC barely flinched as I began turning settings up well past what I expected I could.Tomb Raider might not be what you expect, but it’s a game that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. Crystal Dynamics has managed to once again salvage a series and brought it to a height I didn’t think was possible. It’s a stunning adrenaline rush, that does as much for Lara’s character as it does for rejuvenating the franchise, which by the end had left me with a lack of words past a barely audible “wow”."

The fights are also very satisfying thanks to the different weapons and tools you can use.I had played this game at the time on Xbox 360 and recently redone on PC, the game has aged well and can run well on any current computer.In conclusion, this is a game that I absolutely recommend to anyone looking for a single player game with excellent gameplay and a very good story for a very generous price."

78,AshHousewares,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AshHousewares445/,151,,1,7.1,June,"23,",683,5,1,"What can I say about Tomb Raider. Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.You start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many  endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.While you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.The graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.The enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.I like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the (""run for your life"") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.The game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it. The single-player is a  definite must-play for everyone who likes survival, shooting, and gorgeous women. I love this game, and I recommed you check it out, espcially when it goes on sale."
79,jpsf91,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jpsf91/,25,1,1,20.5,May,"26,",639,0,1,"The Tomb Raider 2013 reboot is a two face coin. On one side, it's an amazing game, no doubt about that. It's an action adventure game, with platforming and puzzles, similar to the Uncharted series. And you can see it almost as a competitor. The story tells the origin of Lara Croft as a tomb raider, through survival. The game has a decent story, characters and music, good graphics and fluid gameplay. What i really liked were the unique sequences that this game has, which are plenty and intense. If you only play it for the story, it feels more like a movie, which isn't that bad here. If you try to do 100%, the extra exploration needed will make it feel more like a game. The game quality is consistent, being great from beginning to end. Now for the other side of the coin. To put it simply: this isn't a Tomb Raider game. The main series games are also similar, but they put a lot of attention in it's puzzles. I'm not gonna criticize the straight platforming of this reboot, but the lack of challenging puzzles really hurts this game. You'll solve most of them in a few minutes, and many are optional. Really? Even the hardest ones won't take more than 10 minutes to solve (there were 2 or 3 of these). And to make things easier, the game has an in-game hint system, showing where you need to go, which objects you can interact with, and more, effectively guiding you through the whole game if you like. There should at least be a mode in which this system was permanently disabled for purists. Basically, the main challenge of the previous titles are gone, creating an identity crisis. So, should you play this game? Absolutely. It's an amazing title, gripping you the entire journey. But don't think of it as a ""true"" Tomb Raider game, otherwise you'll be disappointed."

94,[AReV]Nomed,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/,199,,1,3.4,November,"29,","1,078",10,1,"Tomb Raider is a successful reboot to the franchise.You once again play as Lara Croft but in this installment, she's fresh out of college and no longer the confident tomb raiding adventurer from other games.The game begins with a shipwreck; leaving Lara stranded on an island somewhere south of Japan in the Devil’s Sea. The Island is beautiful, featuring a variety of different areas to explore along with tons of hidden unlockables. Tomb Raider feels like a lot of other games combined, mainly Resident Evil 4 mixed with a bit of Uncharted and maybe some Assassin’s Creed style platforming. This meshes together very well into a lengthy and enjoyable action/adventure game. The story is somewhat forgettable but the gameplay is solid (although it’s fairly easy). The multiplayer isn't worth mentioning, it's decent but not anything special. You should purchase Tomb Raider to experience the single player.For a more in-depth review, here’s a video I made:Tomb Raider has also made our list for the top 10 games of the year, if you're interested on where it stacks up, check out: If you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator:"
95,zeroxxx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zeroxxx/,35,3,1,46.5,September,"16,","4,078",2,1,"After 4 years of release on Steam, the game's still considered good enough for today's standards. It has semi open-world, decent stealth mechanic, fast and fluid combat, simple story with great graphics and voice acting.Keep in mind, I don't review the multiplayer aspect, this review only covers single player.The first thing that appeal to me is the graphic. It's excellently designed and implemented. While some don't make sense like Lara's TressFX hair (right, her stylish and silky smooth hair after she jumps into the mess anyone?), the scenery and environment are indeed breathtaking. If you can max out your in-game settings without any FPS drop, do it, you'll be amazed. The cutscenes / movies are also excellent looking and pretty realistic.Oh, you can test your rig in-game, it has its own internal test to see how good your rig to play the game and adjust the setting accordingly.If you have good speakers, plug it in, the combat feels very realistic with surround sound. But most of the time, though, you won't pay any attention because Lara's pretty weak and goes down after few shots, and it's better to run away when you enter the combat and fight from afar or even better kill one by one by stealth from the beginning. I have to give a prop for the voice actors, without them the game would be less than complete - a good VOs is always welcome for any kind of game for me.Gameplay has similarities with Batman Arkham Asylum. While the combat is extremely on a different side, the stealth mechanic has emphasis here, playing with many gadgets (Hook Claw vs Hook Arrow) and the limited scope of open world remains the same (Asylum is locked to a prison, here you're in an island of nowhere). Tomb Raider has fast travel feature in form of camps, though, it is handy to access all side-quests that require backtracking if you're too far ahead. There's essentially a mirror of Batman's Riddler Quest here in form of collectibles. You'll have no shortage hidden objects to collect to complete your collections and achievements. And yes, some are really well hidden making it harder, probably you might want to see Youtube videos for guide or something. I've given up collecting everything though, lack of dedication of my part. :)Every game has its flaws, and Tomb Raider is no different. A few notable downsides are, for example: boring, repeated QTEs where some require you to trial and error and so when you die in that particular QTE you're forced to watch the previous cutscene. Yeah, damned QTEs, and even Resident Evil 6's doesn't do it this way.Another one is the hunting mechanic, it doesn't really add much value to the main game. So you hunt the wild animals and loot some resources, then what? Nothing more. It feels pretty detached in my opinion, it's only there for the sake of it.Lara is also even better than Batman. There's no way a girl like her would be able to run overnight without fatigue, fight many strong armed men simultaneously, and after receiving open wounds she can still fight like monster. Not to mention Lara's shotgun is still fully functional even after submerged in many of her QTEs in the river/water. While it's a downside definitely, it's a side effect of the game being linear and thus no realism. On PC, the game's still better played with Keyboard + Mouse. I've tried using Controller for several hours and the results are miserable. The game requires your aim skill when you fight, controller can't do that, there's no auto aim here. If you insist though, you can plug your Xinput capable controller and set it up in-game menu. Dinput doesn't fare well and even requires some specific hack to make it work properly, so not recommended.For side perks, it has achievements if you're into it and cloud save which is a must for all games nowadays and it has saved me several times from losing my progress. You can also jump into the multiplayer if you like, though I never touch it since Tomb Raider is only all about single player for me.Overall, this is a proper AAA, something that I can really recommend despite some flaws. Most of the times the game would be on heavy sale, so get it if you like the genre.8,5/10"

You really get a sense of the internal struggle Lara faces having to transfrom into a killing machine.  The cut scenes are emotionally intense and well acted.  The game is very cinematic and sometimes you feel like your watching a movie.  The gameplay is addrenaline packed and the third person perspective suits the action well.  Climbing and traversing the terrain never felt so fun and dangerous.  Melee combat is smooth and brutal.  Your trusty pickaxe used for climbing makes a nasty weapon.  Although there are not a ton of different guns to use, each has its purpose.  They do a good job of making Lara feel powerful and a destructive force.  Especially when you utilize the bow and arrow effectively you feel like your Legolas from LOTR.  There are alot of unique caves, tombs, and other locations to explore.  There is the odd puzzle that is never too difficult but adds a nice element to the game.  There are tons of collectibles and lore to unearth. The multiplayer though non active is entertaining if you can find some people to play.  All in all this is a must play for any gamer and a truly enjoyable and memorable ride."

106,¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/,20,1,1,45.2,April,"3,","1,908",1,1,"This game is a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, showing Lara's origin in the tomb raiding business, however, there's not a lot of tomb raiding, to be honest, with the game's story being more about survival in a hostile environment, surrounded by an ancient mistery that Lara unveils through the game. The plot is pretty good, and I'd say it shows Lara's evolution from a sort of bookworm archaeologist to the badass we all know and love; of course, she still isn't all badass by the end of the game, but she's now ready to actually take on some big adventure.So, to actually talk something about the story, it begins with Lara and friends getting stranded in an island somewhere in the Pacific during a huge storm. While at first it seems to be a pretty normal island, with a few ruins and such, soon she encounters some of its inhabitants, who seem to be cultists of some sort, and strange things begin to happen whenever Lara and her friends try to leave the island. I won't go into much detail here, but I'd say the story is very good.The gameplay seems to be more action oriented rather than being about platforming puzzles and such, but I'd say that's better, considering the game's plot. There's a few different weapons you'll find along the way, which you can upgrade in different ways, along with several tools to help you navigate the different environments. Even then, there's also a bit of platforming here and there, and there's plenty of collectibles to find, some of which give a lot of background to the game's plot, although they aren't necessary to understand the story.When it comes to level design, I'd say they did a great job when making the island. There's many different areas you can explore along the way, from jungles to old WWII bunkers, and even ancient Japanese castles. You can also return to some of these areas later on, when you've found new tools, in order to discover new secrets.The game also has a multiplayer component, but that's something I don't really recommend. I don't see why some developers and/or publishers feel the need to add a multiplayer mode to games that don't really need it, but it's there, and I played it, so I'll give my opinion. Pretty much: it's a buggy piece of crap. Now, I'd say it could be somewhat decent if they had supported it after release, but after all this time, there's still plenty of bugs, pretty much nobody plays it, not to mention that it has that stupid levelling system where you unlock better weapons the more you play, meaning that new players have a hard time when matched against those in higher levels, which will happen a lot when only a handful of people play the MP. Personally, I think the resources spent in developing the MP would have been better spent in improving the SP, which is still good, but could have been better.Well, I think that's a wrap for my Tomb Raider review. I recommend the SP portion, the MP portion is crap."

I have never played the original Tomb raider games and this is my first Tomb Raider game.Tomb Raider is an exhilarating action adventure as a terrific origin story for Lara Croft.It's story arch is very tempting and beautifully written and the graphic for it's time is amazing.The gameplay is awesome. The scenery in which the missions take place are very unique and the progression of the single player missions are intriguing. The shooting mechanics are nice too and the arsenal you get, you can change how you want to approach some enemies.It's mostly a pseudo open world game with many collectibles, tombs and challenges that are somewhat enticing to complete and to solve. The game has full of informative historical artifacts which all tells stories.The multiplayer section is like an abandon city. :P Nobody plays it. So if you are an achievement Hunter like me, then make some friends to get some of the MP achievements. But you will surely enjoy the Single player part.Overall, it is a very good game and I will highly recommend buying this game. On sale is the best time to buy the game."

We've seen them quite a lot from the time the first game of this franchise was released, and ""re-boot"" of the year 2013 was not the first one. However, it is still a 3rd-person view action/adventure game with the female heroine, who knows her ways around archeology and survival in the ""Indiana Jones-style"". And, it is a good game, even if flawed a little, but quite decent overall.The pattern has changed seriously this time. Now it is much less a puzzle with ""how to get there"" problem, but quite an ample action with ""shoot often, kill many, remorse nothing"". It is not bad, but looking too much Uncharted. Which is somehow amusing, as it was Naughty Dog who looked at TR games as an example. But let's not trouble ourselves with the quiz ""who's copycat whom better"". Much less climbing and jumping and much more shooting for one, damned quick-time events on every corner for two, and not bad, but quite dead multiplayer for three (with many achievements for MP which you'll probably never unlock fairly). Sounds almost enough to nail the coffin, right? But I called TR'13 the good game, despite all those things. Why? 'Cause it's still a fine adventure! And if you're not troubling yourself too much with 100% achievements in every game, I really recommend you to try out this re-rolled Crofty, as there are not so many comparable titles anyway (and Uncharted stays with Sony, without any chance to climb on the PC mountain so far).The setout of the Tomb Raider'13 sounds very similar to the one of Far Cry 3 (which was released just a few months earlier to the TR game). Lara and her team crushed occasionally on the distinct island filled with unfriendlies, and need to find a way out. You'll find a bow and will be hunting animals for resources. And, by all means, you'll get guns - and quite enough mean and ugly targets to unload them. Ah, and don't forget the semi-open world, where you can search for numerous ""artifacts"" and other collectibles, as well as some small tombs to scavenge... on your way to saving your team and yourself.Let's talk about strong and weak points.The engine and visuals - are really good. Especially I enjoyed the visualization of fire and wind - they are, like, alive - which is good for atmosphere in the game - and for dynamic puzzles, which are (lucky we) not just ""push the button, turn the lever"". I enjoyed the sightseeing, the climbing and hiking were quite rewarding... if they were not haywire by the not-so-great controls and framerate drops, which happened too many times, especially when I played the game for the first time, right after release. Now the framerate seems fixed (or at least, much more stable), and I'm getting used for controls, more or less. Still, the count of my deaths out of flawed controls (during some tricky jumps usually) and for low framerate during damned QTE (like with AlphaWolf) - really freaked me out so many times.The story and characters - another strong point. It's like the ""Lost"" serial - only with a bunch of sane and (pro)active people. Even your enemies are good and solid - in their way. They are not just respawning mobs without any logic or reason. On the contrary, they're all well-placed. I've seen better scenarios, sure, but only in gems like Bioshock or Witcher - which are sure of a rare breed.Battle system - not exactly vivid, but good enough. You sneak, you hide behind the obstacles, you perform silent attacks with bow/pistol, then enemies discover your location, hell breaks loose, you see the rain of lead, you've got molotovs flying right on your head, your cover breaks after some shots... Yeah, it CAN be fun. I especially liked the bow - it performed much better than in Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 3... or even Skyrim. Much more arcade than in the Mount'n'Blade, of course, but still quite fun. And yeah, brings associations with the Hunger Games Katniss tool for some, sure. Never liked that franchise... but I do like bows and prefer them to crossbows (and occasionally to rifles) even in real life.As of semi-open world (I call it so for the TR still a narrative-driven game, even if it allows you to return to previous points to collect miscellaneous stuff you've might miss earlier)... The tombs are quite optional, and, as much as I've enjoyed puzzles in there, the sequence when Lara completes the challenge in the tomb... is really out of order, with that big chest, wow-hush on the first occasional trinket - and that's all! Take your bonus to supplies and return on your quest! Not really rewarding, if you ask me. On the contrary, the more basic artifacts Lara discovers on her way feels much more suiting her Archeological agenda, as well as adding more colours to the world around. That's great, if only transiently. Yet, overall trinket searches not really providing additional fun, being somewhere on the level with feathers from Assassin's Creed franchise... unless you're really looking for more lore on the Lara Croft's universe, and really reading diary pages - a thing so rare now, when those pages scattered among all games and so little people actually pay any interest to them anywhere...As we're talking pro/contra, I'll repeat about two downsides: the quite-dead multiplayer, with something about 15 out of 50 achievements related to it - which means no fair complete. And bugs, mostly based on the not-so-good optimisation. Some of them were fixed... like the occasional drops of framerate. But in that process of updating, I've got my savefile broken - with the 18th level MP charachter, and 100%-completed story... So I had to repeat all the process, without ""Newgame+"" and with MP character zeroed...With all said, my mark of the game is 7.2/10. It's a neat dramatical adventure, worthy re-work of the title. Yet some of the gamedesign decisions (like the emphasis on QTE or Lara's quick transformation from bookworm to mass-murdering angel of death) - and bugs problems, along with stupid ""one slot saves everything"" policy, which isn't good even on consoles - all this holding me praising the game higher. Still, a good pick, if discounted, no doubts there."
113,removedm,https://steamcommunity.com/id/removedmaterial/,28,2,1,21.2,September,"17,",532,3,1,"Crystal Dynamics as we know have made Tomb Raider games in the past, however Tomb Raider  is the first Tomb Raider game that I have ever played, and to be plain-spoken I am satisfied with the introduction I have gotten to the franchise.Tomb Raider  is a cover-based, action-adventure game with a compelling narrative from our new Lara Croft. The game offers an immensely immersive gaming experience as it throws you into a game world with an array of visually impressive environments, many cinematic camera angles and an exceptional score composed by Jason Graves. The single player campaign offers a captivating plot  with friendly and appealing characters, enthralling combat and gameplay alongside collectibles and a point + reward system for Lara’s abilities and salvage to upgrade the weapons she uses.The game visually is a treat for the eyes, well optimized and it certainly helps to have a decent enough rig to play it at the settings that allow you to experience the graphical fidelity that this game has to offer . Crystal Dynamics know how to immerse a player  as Yamatai’s environments had such a fine level of detail I found myself in awe as I ventured into the island. The game constantly has that atmospheric vibe, giving you that sense of adventure wherever you go, whether it be a forest populated with wildlife and foliage or tombs with skulls strewn across the ground, it is somehow always present. The gameplay and combat are enjoyable for the most part, you do realize it becomes somewhat linear halfway into the game but it does not hinder the experience in any way. I especially appreciated the creativity and thought that was put into Lara’s combat, stumbling and then flinging dirt into your enemies eyes to immobilise them for just the right amount of time to give them that final blow, or evading an enemy’s melee attack at just the right time to then go on to stab them in the knee with your arrows, allowing you to kill them right then and there if you have the correct abilities unlocked, or giving them a blow to the head with an arrow or bullet. Quick Time Events or QTE’s are present in this game and being honest I am not one for QTE’s especially if they are game breaking or not done right. But luckily for us players, Crystal Dynamics did a good job at including them. You don’t and won’t find yourself doing a QTE at every possible moment in the game, instead, they seem to be wisely placed into parts of the game  and add to the overall immersion and feel that the game manages to radiate. Stealth, unfortunately, is not seen in Tomb Raider  at all, it is possible to take out enemies silently with the bow,  however you’ll most likely be able to take out 2-3 enemies before one of the other NPC's will spot you, which some if not most of the time is absurd as to how they even know where you are when you could be in a tall tree or in really good cover.                                                                                                   Also, the game mostly puts you in situations where you always find yourself guns blazing, killing a whole brigade of enemies, and I won’t lie it will make you feel like a bad a*s.I spent most of my time in this game looting bodies and looking for salvage or collectibles which I greatly enjoyed, particularly because it gave me a reason to venture out into the game world and bathe myself in the beauty of Yamatai for a while longer. I found collecting and finding the relics  somewhat pleasurable, especially due to the fact of being able to listen to Lara’s presumptions as to what age/period that said relic may be from and what it might have been used for, it just lets you know that Lara knows her sh*t as an archaeologist.Finding collectibles also gives you survivor points which can then be spent on unlocking dozens of abilities for Lara, from 3 different classes/categories. Other ways to earn survivor points can be from Eliminating enemies, Completing received tasks, Finding secrets or Exploring tombs, which I greatly enjoyed as exploring each tomb you will find out that each is unique, and each has a puzzle for you to figure out in order to gain that much-wanted loot. There were few tombs in this game so it left me feeling lost after completing them all. Finding salvage on the other can be used to upgrade your weapons, from giving your bow an explosive kick, to silencing your rifle, buffing up your shotgun or making your pistol more efficient. Each weapon has 3 modifications that you will gradually find throughout the campaign leaving you with quite the arsenal.Crystal Dynamics have created some sort of treasure that I feel honored to have played, seeing our new Lara Croft  grow from a frightened and vulnerable survivor to the Tomb Raider we know and love, is profoundly compelling. The game has such a full-hearted and ardent score that compliments the game so very well. It was so awesome to watch the final clip of the game as ‘The Tomb Raider’ played in the background as Lara says “I’m not going home”, after that I just must hand it to Jason Graves for composing music that was such a pleasure to listen to during my time with the game. Overall Tomb Raider  is  and , with a Lara Croft that I did not just care for, but love. The game after completion has left me feeling empty, so I just hope that Rise of The Tomb Raider coming out later this year manages to be the righteous successor this game deserves."

She starts out gearless, and terrified of shadows, and gradually becomes the stunningly badass Tomb Raider, while remaining incredibly human along the way. I did not expect this game to be nearly as memorable as it was.Cons:-Fewer QuickTime events, however, would have been nice; none would have been perfection.-The multiplayer was... well, the game would have been better served by the effort involved there being put into something more useful, like a DLC that turned all the deer into a slightly different species of deer.Pros:-Everything.

I did complete this game in no small part because the combat is actually very good, but I found myself laughing out loud at how ridiculous and over the top the set pieces were in this game. Every single structure on the entire island on is built out of matchsticks and will probably collapse, explode, combust, get blown down, etc. if you so much as look at it. Enemies will routinely appear out of thin air in order to make cutscenes more interesting. Characters who have spoken like two lines all game will routinely get these contrived and preventable hero's deaths and you care deeply for like three seconds and then get back to brutally murdering people in cold blood. I could go on, but you get the idea.Another annoying part of this game is the skill point and upgrade system. In most games with even primitive skill trees you'll have a variety of compelling skills that you can master to specialize a bit and turn yourself into a badass. In this game, the overwhelming majority of the skills are either entirely useless, uninteresting, or downgrades over the default. For example, you need to use four separate skill points just to make the reticle glow red when you're aiming at an enemy's head with each of your weapons. You can use another skill point to stealth kill with your ice pick instead of your bow, despite that there's little to no functional difference between the two. You can use like five skill points so you can melee counter all enemies after dodging attacks, despite that this takes more time than just shooting the enemies in the face and makes no sense tactically in a cover-based shooter. Other skill points destroy the exploration side of the game by making items and areas you're looking for glow through walls or show up on your map. Another couple of skill points give you more salvage while looting, and grabbing those skill points early, as I did, means that you're probably going to have enough salvage to buy every single weapon upgrade as soon as it becomes available and you’ll no longer need to actually make decisions about what's best for your character. You can just get a 100% larger magazine, double damage, massively increased reload speed, and an undermounted grenade launcher all at once! Hooray!Except, not hooray. This game is the first game I've played in a while that didn't offer a challenge even on the hardest difficulty setting. They eventually add a couple of different enemies, like armored enemies who take two headshots to kill instead of one, but it’s not nearly enough. The challenge went away fast and without a really compelling story to fall back on, the game just got more and more boring as time went on. It seriously feels like it was balanced around base-game Lara and they made zero effort to keep it balanced as time went on. It just gets worse and worse the more upgrades you buy.Sometimes this game would impress me with its attention to detail, such as the animation for Lara dropping her torch to open a door and her actually picking up the torch again once she finishes, or the fact that you see Lara make a flicking motion with her left thumb to light the tip when switching to flaming arrows. Other times, though, there are glaring visual issues that drive me nuts. For example, she's given one ice pick to climb with, not two, and magically uses that single pick to Spiderman up massive ice walls and rock faces alike. Would it have been too hard to at least give her a second ice pick so her climbing could make a tiny bit more sense? As is they may as well have let her use her bare hands since she’s glued to the wall anyway. Another part they probably never bothered to test PC was the quicktime sequences. Rather than putting the button you need to press in the center of the quick time element, they would *sometimes* put the button in small font at the bottom of the screen and sometimes not show the button you’re supposed to press at all, leaving you to guess whether you should be hitting E, F, space bar, M1, or something else entirely. Usually the price for messing this up is watching Lara die horribly, which made this even more annoying. There were several sequences in the game where I’d have to watch Lara get impaled through the throat or pincushioned with arrows as I got increasingly frustrated trying to figure out what the freaking game wanted me to press.A final gripe is that they halfheartedly tried to make Lara be the stereotypical sensitive girl at random times throughout the game despite that she clearly gives no ♥♥♥♥♥ for the other 99% of the game. You'll have just finished calmly and quietly wading through a river of blood amidst heaping piles of severed human limbs and shooting dozens of Russian commandos in the face with a bow and arrow before pillaging their corpses, and then next thing you know it you'll be on the radio with Roth sniffling about how you don't know what's going on and oh please, Roth, help me, I want to go home and I can't possibly fend for myself. Like c'mon now, if you're going to be this unabashedly over-the-top action game and ask again and again for us to suspend disbelief, just let your protagonist be a natural badass who don’t need no man.All in all, Tomb Raider was visually gorgeous for a 2013 game and the combat was tight, but in its quest to be a third-person shooter, a platformer, an RPG, a cinematic adventure, a stealth game, an exploration-focused open world game, and like seventeen other trendy things all at once, it feels like it misses the mark on most of these. I picked it up for free, and if they ever give it away again, sure, it might be worth a shot. Maybe you’ll get more out of it than I did. Otherwise, there are much, much better ways to spend 12 hours."

Loved every single moment of the campaign mode as it just reminds me of how much of a wimp I am compared to Lara.Graphics wise it is beautiful. The range of landscapes you are exposed to (Eg: mountain-tops, caves, plane crashes) always set the scene (not always stuck in a cave or a building). Gameplay wise there are not many flaws at all. And if there are, they are probably either miniscule or hilarious enough for me to laugh off.The weapons are such fun to use, especially when the enemies don't know how to wear helmets and a single shot of anything in the head pretty much kills.Wolves are scary :CI've only had a few hours on campaign mode at this point in time, but I definitely do recommend this game to literally anyone. I've had a blast staying up way past my bed-time in the dark killing off mercs and watching Lara completely destroy 20 men in a single room with a bow and arrows vs. assault rifles in less than a minute. Plus she can scale walls like a beast with a single pickaxe.On sale: BUY ITOff sale: BUY ITFor free: WTH U WAITING FOR BUY ITI have no friends: PLAY ALONE :'("

The way it plays, the way it looks, the environments, the story, just everything about it works amazingly well. If this sets the standard of the survivor trilogy my brain oozes with excitement for the other two. This is the most fun I have had with modern gaming in a long long time.With that said, I will not be going for a full achievement set as a large portion of them are locked behind multiplayer which is long dead for this game (be warned achievement hunters).

144,Logan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Theonlyloganhere/,15,1,1,46.3,December,"27,",388,4,1,"Because one reboot in the franchise is not enough.Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix.Discover a terrific origin story of Lara Croft, as she ventures on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance to find lost kingdom of Yamatai. Expedition quickly turns into a nightmare as unexperienced Lara will have to save her friends and discover islands secrets to survive and escape.Tomb Raider combines action-adventure, exploration and survival mechanics in one gritty package. If you have played Uncharted series, take that action-adventure gameplay from it and mix it with semi-open world design.You will make your way through an island while completing simple objectives to push the story and unlock more of the island. Most of the locations are connected to each other, allowing you to go back and explore them fully later on. From forests and beaches to temples and world war 2 facilities, Yamatai is filled with secrets and mysteries waiting for you to discover them. Majority of locations is small to medium sized so you don't have to worry about getting lost. To travel between areas you can use camps spread across the island.Game puts a big emphasis on survival, as young Lara is not experienced with challenges ahead of her and lack of tools doesn't help. Main progression system tied to storyline features Lara gathering, or rather salvaging more equipment and weapons to make her situation easier and allowing her to explore more. So if you come across a location you can't access yet, don't worry! Throughout the game you will additionally search for supplies used to your weapons, to improve them and add accessories. Once in a while you will even find weapon parts, which completly modify your weapon if you will find enough of them.Yamatai is a place filled with history, so on your adventure you will find plenty of relics and elements from the past! You can collect and examine them to discover additional information and gain experience. Plus knowledge! Or I think so. I mean, some of those historic elements are definetly based on real history...right?Additionally there is plenty of other documents, notes, and Lara's personal thoughts you can gather throughout Tomb Raider. Besides collecting you can beat challenge tombs and challenges featured in almost every location. Amount side content will keep you busy for a while yet it won't feel like a chore.And if you have a hard time with exploration or puzzles, game features Survival Instinct, ability that highlights key elements or enemies.Almost all actions in the game linked to hunting, collecting or combat give you experience points. Earning enough of them will give you a skill point available to spend at the camp in 3 different categories.Speaking of killing, unlike previous titles where combat was mainly focused on animals and mythical creatures, here it has a major focus on fighting other unfortunate human survivors who are stuck on an island, while wildlife and mythical enemies are a secondary enemy.Enemies are either melee opponents, using agility to quickly get to you, or ranged enemies with bows and firearms. Once in a while you will get tougher opponents. This time you won't be jumping around, performing all sorts of acrobatics while wielding dual pistols. Combat is similar to Uncharted. It features cover mechanics as Lara is smart enough to know arrows and bullets are bad for you, destructive enviroment giving opportunities to both sides of the conflict, ability to free aim and engage in close quarter combat to stun or execute enemies. Regenerative health system is implemented here- if you are hurt you need to find a safe space and wait few seconds to heal.Sometimes you will get a chance to eliminate your opponents stealthy, here a bow and patience will help you gain upper hand.In her arsenal Lara has 4 weapons, with her main weapon being a bow-stealthy and deadly long ranged weapon with multiple accessories, perfect for hunting. But if you prefer a pistol, shotgun or an assault rifle, lucky you. As mentioned before, first weapons you salvage are relics from the past, so be on a lookout for supplies to improve them as in their original, outdated state using them will be rough. Good kind of rough, gunplay is damn satisfying in TR. And at the end, there are platformic elements, because what Lara Croft game it would be without them! Those are...pretty much the same thing as before. Climb, jump, use ledges, ziplines, different platforms to make your way through the locations.The only thing that one can nitpick from entire gameplay is amount of Quick Time Events. Especially in first half of the game there is more of them than I thought, and I know not everyone likes them. Outside of gameplay, characters could be a bit more...original. Cast of secondary characters is cliched, so you can figure them out in first few cutscenes. Lara herself and her entire ""Survival"" development arc is good, though it suffers from narrative conflict. Story Lara is an inexperienced and vulnerable person that doesn't like and doesn't want to kill people, learning to become a person who we all know.Gameplay Lara straight up takes a rock or alpenstock to smash enemies face with it while gunning down others. For some reason game encourages you to play in a very agressive and brutal way which doesn't fit entire narrative, especially in first part of the game. That is why I was surprised game features only...one forced stealth section? Maybe two? After you are done with Single Player you can step into Multiplayer for the first time in main series! It's a basic ""Good guys v bad guys"", featuring 5 maps and 4 different gamemodes, with aability to play ""casually"" or ""competitive"" but competitive is totally dead. First uou unlock new weapons, upgrades to them, and characters by gathering experience and leveling up, then you buy them using supplies you get from games and lootable boxes on the maps. Unfortunately, Multiplayer lacks players. You either enocunter veteran players or cheaters, making it hard to have enjoyable or even a balanced game. However if you will find a game where teams are balanced and on equal skill level, you should have fun. Should. Performance was great, pretty much had no issues with...well, anything. Unfortunately my game wasn't in English when it comes to sound design so I can't say if voice acting is good or not. The rest-enviroment, weapons, and ingame soundtrack was great. A reboot done right, Tomb Raider with fantastic gameplay and level design, yet few issues in writing and semi-open world might make this gritty origin story of famous archeologist not for everyone. 8/10!

Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years, and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately, I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68%, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty, and although I died a couple times - seven times to be exact - The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies. Overall, I love this game. I found everything about it great: the story, the graphics, and gameplay. It isn't often that I find a game like this where I want to come back and keep playing day after day, and not put it down at all. This game is amazing."

Like many young gamers I too had a  really hard spot on my crotch for this game. Her grunts, screams and moans definitely awakened something in me.Tomb Raider 2013 feels like AAA polished perfection IMO. There's zero fat on the game. Nothing feels extra, tedious or out of place. Incredible visuals for the day and they hold up just fine. The high resolution textures, shadows, tessellation and hair physics? Icing on the cake.The reason I liked this game way more than the sequels is that it's the story of how Lara becomes a badass. It was the speed of her transition from ingénue to stone-cold killer that really got me! It's been a while since I played it, but I'm sure I remember a scene towards the beginning where she really gingerly and uncomfortably picks up a gun that someone dropped, and then a few scenes later she's John Wick, leaving piles of bodies everywhere she goes.Additionally one of my favorite things about the game was the metroidvania nature to it, and  how you slowly developed your arsenal and used it to complete the myriad of challenges tucked away.That said, the scale of mass murder, the lack of tombs, the amount of times she falls and the way she falls (honestly it’s almost injury porn), do drag the experience down a little. I mean, do we really need to see Lara with a large spike through her head, futilely trying to unimpale herself only to finally give in to death? Yeah, no thanks. Finally, I really liked the way the game actually progressed through a bunch of genres, taking bits and pieces from each but never over staying its welcome.  Too many games are afraid to try anything different.Honestly now that I’m 49, I really just like linear games at this point. I’ve long since ODed on Ubisoft worlds, so a game like this continues to feel like a breath of fresh air.10/10"

The opening gameplay is packed with action and done really well, the game grabs hold of the player and shows all it has to offer in the first twenty minutes, leaving me wanting more. It wasn't just the gameplay which had me hooked. I wanted to know about the mysterious island Lara had become stranded on, I wanted to know more about the dangerous people on this island and why they were so hostile. The story goes along at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to be pieced together by an attentive player. Sometimes I felt Lara was a little slow coming to a conclusion I has reached hours ago.The gameplay introduces new elements at good times, allowing Lara to become more powerful, or speeding up her adventuring across the island. I felt after around 16 hours of gameplay a slight lull, I wa ready for the story to be wrapped up, and started to be bored by the repetativeness of the combat and exploration. This only lasted a couple of hours, until I felt happy that the game had been stretched as I wanted to play more again.I finished the game with a 90% overall completion score. I missed picking up a few GPS caches and many of the optional challenges in each zone. I picked up most of the documents and relics as I played the game, going back to pick up the few I had missed before I completed the story. I clocked over 25 hours in completing the game in this way, which is fairly admirable by todays standards, and acceptable for such a game.I was fortunate enough to be able to run the game as the highest of settings, which was truly a beautiful experience. The island feels very real, and really helped me feel the immersion that I did.Most of my time playing Tomb Raider was extremely enjoyable, I look forward to the inevitable sequel. I would recommend this game, especially at the low price it can now often be found for."
158,Dellicious,https://steamcommunity.com/id/koreanjuice/,21,1,1,136.4,January,"27,",351,2,1,"As a huge Tomb Raider fan since the original in 1996, I'm surprised how many fans dislike the reboot and its direction. Crystal Dynamics/Square Enix has done a great job in giving the series a new lease of life. Sure, the puzzles will never have you scratching your head for hours like the classics, but the visuals, atmosphere and effects more than make up for it, giving Lara her first real Hollywood-esque adventure, something that she more than deserves. The story sees a young inexperienced Lara thrown into a scary and unforgiving world, as she battles the harsh conditions and even harsher bad guys after she becomes shipwrecked on an Island. The adventure takes her on a brutal journey that will see her flourish into the skilled Tomb Raider that we all think of when we hear the name, Lara Croft.The game is very well polished and you can appreciate the minor details because of it. Little things like Lara brushing her hands across walls in tight areas as well as the effortless nature of the climbing and jumping mechanics. The game is honestly one of my favourite third person adventure games to play. It just feels so good to control Lara, even with a K+M. The way she traverses the world, jumps, turns, it all feels amazingly solid and responsive. The sound and voice acting is also of a particular high standard, giving that high budget, Hollywood feel. There are certain elements that some users may not appreciate, scripted QTE's and shaky action camera angles can frustrate and disorientate, but for the most part, any action adventure fan who appreciates an epic Indiana Jones style experience will be right at home. There is a nice, although basic, upgrade system where investing the salvage you collect from the island gives you better weapon damage, or upgraded bow, which help reinforce the feel that you are growing and getting more confident as time goes on, much like Lara herself. There is also some basic hunting where you can gain XP, but it's simple, nothing on the level of a Far Cry 4 for example.Multiplayer is there, although not very active now. It was a fun experience back in 2013 when the community was active; it was certainly up there with Uncharted MP and superior to Metal Gear Online 3. Personally I wouldn't even consider this game if you are thinking about it from a MP perspective. If you are playing for the first time in preparation for Rise of the Tomb Raider, it is definitely worth a go. It will help you understand Lara’s character and backstory, and tie in nicely to the sequel."

This game is basically about her slowly becoming a badass, having her trapped in an island full of crazy people is the perfect setting to tell that kind of story."
166,EmP,https://steamcommunity.com/id/superemp/,25,3,1,23.0,December,"12,","1,130",2,1,"Lara’s had more than a few turbulent years since an ‘accidental mouse slip’ brought her to prominence almost two decades ago. Championed first by Core Designs, then shipped off to Crystal Dynamics, she’s undergone rewrites, retcons and ever-changing personal tragedies. Her history has been altered often enough, and her relatives resurrected and then killed off under wildly different circumstances enough to make her twisted canon a nightmare to follow. Her mother died at birth, then she died on a ship instead, then she’s alive, except she’s not. Lara’s even been killed off herself once; that lasted all of a year. It’s somewhat ironic, then, that in her ever-shifting landscape of dead ends and unresolved cliff-hangers that it’s in going right back to the beginning that she changes the most.Tomb Raider is one of these series reboots you see everywhere you look, and, as such, Lara’s no longer the ice queen she’s often portrayed as (aside from that awful period they tried to rewrite her as a flirty archaeology floozy we all seem to pretend never happened). She’s younger, fresher, no longer has twin guns glued to her hands, no longer wears the khaki equivalent of hot pants and her head is actually bigger than her bust. These are noteworthy changes, but should never be the focus. In this outing, Lara is raw, inexperienced and naïve, shipwrecked on an island filled with hostiles who want her and the people she cares about dead. It’s a situation that forces her to do the unthinkable constantly to survive, and the incidents that play out are unapologetically gritty; should rapid currents get the better of her, Lara will be fatally flung into protruding debris that will spear through her throat, leaving her a scant few seconds of life to pointlessly grasp at the protrusion before falling limp. If she’s overcome by wolves, she doesn’t just die; she’s mauled. If she doesn’t manage to fit though an ever decreasing gap during a rock slide, she’s crushed. It’s not a graphic death, but the screen is filled with unforgiving stone and glimpses of a small section of the heroine’s lifeless face. It’s uncomfortable viewing.The new take on the franchise is a million miles apart from the Lara of old, but that’s the point. Tomb Raider tries very hard to tell a story that explains how she turned out the way we know her, and does a brilliant job of painting her afraid and vulnerable. She starts the game being abducted by an unknown force, and from there she’s left hanging from the roof of a cave to die. She’ll have to scramble past the corpses of former colleagues in order to survive. In these panic-filled moments, she sobs and cries. Squeezing herself through a flooded, rock-lined corridor that only affords her a scant few inches of breathing space leads to gulped yelps of distress in between nervous stumbles that see her vanish underwater for uncomfortable periods of time. Should she manage to survive the ordeal, she sets up a shelter from the raging storm that serves as a light at the end of a tunnel, huddling under a rocky outcrop, shivering violently from the wet and the cold.Tomb Raider really is a distressing stumble from one personal apocalypse to another. Finding the remnants of your crew leads you into a burning village. You’re captured again, your hands are bound, and you’re forced to sneak through the burning ribcages of huts while madmen with guns seek you out. Lara’s captured; she’s beaten, and the seeds of imminent sexual abuse are planted. She fights back, and, in her struggle, a sizable section of her abductor’s face is blown off. It’s gory, uncompromising. You’re forced to observe the light leave the man’s eyes, to listen to his death rattle, to watch Lara fail to hold back her disgust and sorrow. It’s worth pointing out that a similar ‘first kill’ moment was used in Tomb Raider: Anniversary (a game that had you only kill three human adversaries right at the end), but the gravity and emotional kickback it’s afforded here is shocking. Seconds later, Lara’s worked her way through the rest of the enemy platoon, and a concerned ally asks how she’s coping with the sudden blood on her hands. It’s with a sense of guilt and fright that she admits how easy it’s become.Throughout the tale, Lara is forced to slowly harden to the situations that assail her. When a friend tries to take on the island on his own, she mentally lambastes him, only half out of worry, for having to undertake the same soul-wrenching decisions she was forced into. She becomes uncompromising and bitter, but still retains a lingering sense of regret for the things she’d had to do, and for the parts of herself that she’s lost forever. Sneaking through forests, silently putting arrows into the back of a guard’s head, or holding point at the mouth of a shanty town against waves of armed foes may invite criticism that focus is put too much on battle at points, something Tomb Raider has never been about. It would be a fair point, but I see there being more of a case that it’s something Tomb Raider has never done right, instead. Until now."

Experience Lara Croft progressing from just your average girl to ultimate badass, and take a truck load of punishment in the process.Action sequences & storytelling are exceptional & all blend perfectly with the gameplay. This kept pace pretty much for my entire 20hr playthrough, switching from more puzzle & exploration locations to all out  action sets. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult compared to previous  games.There are some very clever game design direction too, like subtle commentary to give you guidance, use of selective camera angles & forgiving map design & controls  minimising those frustrating moments. There are some light RPG elements in skill & weapon upgrades allow you to set Lara up to suit your playstyle. I don't think this RPG element was really needed, but it doesn't hurt the game design.Visual style is rich, highly detailed & immersive.Lara's overall persona & attitude through her character animations & audio commentary change over the course of her adventure, giving a good depth of emotion & shows a lot of personality. This along with the good story results in you ending up caring for Lara trying to survive the danger strickened island. This improved emphasis on character & story really sets the bar higher for the series & sets it apart from many others in genre.If I was picky, more variety in the baddies  so they don't feel like an 80s B-grade action movie re-run, & bit less  levels & more puzzles would have been perfect. Turning  into a 3rd person shooter is just not what these games are about to me. Also to this point, they could have given multiplayer a miss IMHO as it really doesn't fit .Other than these minor points,  was an awesomely enjoyable experience, both suited to the fans of the series as well as new comers."

So, first I have to say that it's my first Tomb Raider game, and, ""Oh boy!"", the graphism are awesome (even if I'm playing in Medium-High to keep a good amonth of FPS), the storyline is fascinating, each character are interesting (from Lara to Jonah), the soundtrack is great and the gameplay is amazing.However, even if this game a big load of pros, there is a small part of cons. Indeed, even if the controls are really good, you may find strange that you can't actually sprint or crouch when you want. Moreover, whe you finished the game to the 100% and you went absolutely everywhere, there's no more animals, ennemies and teammates. The game seems empty in that case. I have to add that you will have to show a lots of patience when you're in some enigmas like the secret tomb. The difficulty is balanced but the QTE (Quick time events) are somewhat annoying the first time you have to do them. Two thirds of the achievements are based on the solo mod and one third is based on the multiplayer.I can't give information about multiplayer considering I didn't play it. But, overall, this is a really good game.→ 78/100"

But still, it is interesting to replay this old game and see how much they have improved, changed and added in it's sequels.Apart from less bugs and improved combat the sequels also take longer to finish with much more fun and challenging tombs and DLCs."

I completed it within 15 hours, with 92% completion. The story is fantastic and engaging, if a little far-fetched, but with the Lara Croft franchise this is kind of to be expected. The mechanics and movement and exploration of the overworld is incredibly intuitive and fun and easy, with very very few ""environment screwed me over"" moments. It's incredibly well designed.I didn't touch the multiplayer, as I'm not interested in it, so I wont comment on that. I will say, however, that I am looking forward to any upcoming DLC which is released, as it'd be interesting to see where they take this already great story.As a downnote, however, the game is a little too ""easy"", in particular ammo seems to be everywhere. I played the game on ""Hard"" from the very start (hardest difficulty) and found only three 5 minute encounters which made me die and re-do the encounter. It seemed to me the difficulty affected only the enemy AI and the amounts of enemies, which is a bit of a shame.Otherwise though, a fantastic game which I'd recommend thoroughly.Nilesy"

183,jeffv0id,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffvoid/,17,,1,16.7,July,"16,",532,1,1,"This was the biggest gaming surprise I’ve had in a while. I expected a lame rehash from a stale franchise. Instead, I’m happy to announce that Tomb Raider is an incredibly fun and intense experience that has resurrected Lara Croft. I played the original years ago and while it was fun at the time the formula got old quickly and I could not get interested in the sequels. It was roughly 90% intricate, drawn-out puzzles & platforming with 10% miserable combat sprinkled in. What they’ve done is rebalance the game mechanics so it focuses much more on combat (which is oh-so-fluid) and the puzzles & platforming are more of a side dish. I think this works because it keeps the game moving along. For example, there are optional tombs you can raid, but they are very small areas with only one puzzle that won’t take you more than 10 minutes to solve. This is a little disappointing, I’ll admit. I would like to have a little more meat to the puzzles, but I will take the short ones over getting bogged down in a 45-minute labyrinth. RPG elements have been introduced, as well. There is a lot of optional stuff you can do in this game which will yield experience to make Lara stronger through special skills as well as finding “salvage” which is used to improve your weapons in certain ways (more damage, less recoil, etc). Special journals can be found, too, which help to unravel the mystery of the island you’re on. Another brilliant touch is how they’ve tweaked exploration. Each area has several sets of secrets to uncover but you don’t have to find them all before you move on (some will require items you don’t have yet, anyway). You discover campsites as you play and can fast travel between them. This lets you focus on having fun instead of feeling obligated to gut an area’s secrets right away to avoid a lengthy backtrack to an earlier area. It makes things so nice. The game is gorgeous, too. Environments are beautiful & smartly designed so they feel very open with lots of nooks & crannies to peek in and usually multiple paths to traverse around obstacles. As I mentioned earlier, combat is fluid and thrilling, the exact opposite of how it was in the original game. Head shots with fire arrows never get old, and the AI is smart. Ranged opponents will throw fire bombs to flush you out of cover or shoot guns at you while melee opponents will zip line in to close on you. And there are so many gratifying ways to kill them. Stick an arrow shaft through their neck with your hand at close range, dig your climbing axe into their back for a stealth kill, hit a guy right as he’s about to throw dynamite resulting in a friendly fire explosion, etc. The story is very good, too. Games rarely make me want to play to find out what happens next anymore. Usually the story is something bland & serviceable to keep me level grinding. I really like the narrative in TR, though. Quite unrealistic, of course, but still enjoyable. And if you’re concerned, keyboard & mouse controls work just fine. This is not one of those sloppy console ports that is unplayable w/out a gamepad. The only knock I have against this game is the use of quick time events. QTEs are something I want to see go away and never come back. I am tired of the “press E to awesome” gameplay mechanic. However, Tomb Raider doesn’t rely too heavily on them and they are at least presented in a very dramatic way, so don’t listen to any commenters saying the game is nothing but cutscenes & QTEs. The beginning is admittedly slow and has a lot of them, but that’s because you haven’t gotten your weapons yet. Once you get armed, you encounter them a lot less. The QTEs don’t ruin the game and only end up being a very minor annoyance. There is also the obligatory multiplayer mode that all video games are apparently required by law now to include. I don’t know anything about it and I will probably never play it. It’s an extra thing if you want it, but know that the single player campaign is not lacking at all. If you like action games, you should definitely pick this one up. Tomb Raider had lost several steps over the years but is now running like a more polished version of Playstation’s Uncharted series, with better combat & storytelling. A very nice surprise that is worth your attention."

The single player is more of a story/survival oriented part of the game. Youre following Lara through her battle for life and and attempt to save her ""friends"" . The story itself is unique but some of the characters may seem a little bit cliche. 2. Multiplayer- the multiplayer is fun,the content is great considering the fact that this was originally a exclusively single player game. The characters are ok,the combat is fine. The biggest downfall to it would be the connection which is peer2peer so there might be some occasional lag and the unbalance between player levels and teams.. 10/10"

A much needed one if I do say so myself. To be honest its a pretty “standard” game meaning it's got platforming, shooting with soem light stealth mechanics, leveling Lara's abilities through weapons and tools. I'd elaborate but it's truly in almost every game. People expect it now and tend to be surprised when it's absent. The game is quite grueling in that while dying is a normal part of games, it's a bit harder to look at it with a spear jammed through your skull. The death animations are really something to behold. The game is actually fairly linear in nature; however there are multiple optional Tombs serving as puzzles to solve for new items and XP. There is also fast travel between camp fires but in all honestly this is just a way for you to go back and get to a new tomb or area after acquiring a new ability or tool and serves no real purpose into the narrative and honestly takes away from it slightly as the pacing of it doesn't really make sense. The story is decent, it's quite riveting the first time, though I wouldn't be as engaged on a second playthrough. Personally, I find the ending ludicrous. It takes away from real, actual relatable situations that arise from being trapped on an island full of cultists. Then, without spoiling anything specific, they basically throw it all away for something ridiculously out of place. But other than that it's excellent story telling."

The Benchmark is also a great tool to see improvements month by month in the Linux kernel, Nvidia Drivers and all the other packages that boost the performance.Next to a great story the gameplay is very smooth, Who doesn't like hunting bad guys with a bow? The controls are spot on, And the AI is challenging at times, but good strategy gets you through any situation. Especially on the higher difficulities it starts to get a challenge to see how to complete certain partsThe multiplayer is pretty dead on Linux, You can play with Mac people, But Windows people are seperated. There are several groups that still play this game online on Mac and Linux, You can also hit me up, I am always in for some Tomb Raider.I would recommend this game to anyone, Especially if you enjoy Online PVP with friends, If you dont enjoy PVP the Single Player experience is great, and worth a few replays, This game is a solid 10 in my bookFollow my Curator Page:"

Doesn't have much sense of exploring, adventure and survival, just slaughtering hordes of enemies. ""Hidden"" tombs are pretty fun though, they contain different puzzles that make me wish there were more. Sadly, these are really not hidden. There's a notification on your screen for ""HIDDEN TOMB NEARBY!"" And there's also clear markings on the wall around the cave, sometimes even an arrow. So you can't really miss those. That takes away the satisfaction of finding these yourself. There's leveling system to gain different skills and you can gather materials for different weapon upgrades. Using the bow is quite satisfying. The game tries to show Lara bit weaker, vulnerable and less confident than what we are used to and during the game she gradually becomes the legendary tomb raider. But the point is lost when the game celebrates with notification to extra xp for headshot you just made and have already killed 50 guys in an hour  with those same headshots. Decent Tomb Raider reboot, with wasted potential. [Score: 80]"
202,Kirbo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/forthnoggin/,33,3,1,26.3,November,"11,",223,1,1,"Really, really nice and surprisingly poignant game. The supporting cast is a bit weak at times and there are a few too many quicktime events, but, overall, the game is definitely memorable and, more importantly, fun. Plus, Lara herself kicks so much ass that it's, like, totally inspirational to anybody who's ever had a hardship that's made them feel alienated and weak - males, females, etc. all alike. I suppose in that aspect, solipsism is what, ironically, binds us together, regardless of our differences, and this game totally, like, isn't afraid to push that theme at all. Such a nice game; I can't recommend it enough, really.Pros: - Immersive environment, music, graphics, and animations- Inspiring protagonist- Fun combat system- Challenging puzzles - Many rewarding collectiblesCons:- Relatively weak supporting cast- Weak antagonist - Too many ""frustratingly cheap"" quicktime events- Not enough puzzles"
203,Ossi ㋛,https://steamcommunity.com/id/armanossiloko/,15,,1,15.7,September,"27,","1,058",0,1,"Tomb Raider is a reboot of an action-adventure video game franchise developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and got an OS X Linux version in 2014 and 2016. The game, according to Crystal Dynamics, was in development since 2008. And, oh boy, it's hard to imagine how worth the waiting actually was.Set on a mysterious island (which is populated by mysterious inhabitants), the game sees Lara find herself in a cave after a shipwreck. In the beginning, sadly, all you can actually notice (beside pressing the keys on your keyboard 20 times in a few seconds for the sake of Lara's survival who is running away from chasers or falling rocks) is Lara's scream which can become annoying from time to time. The developers seem to make us want to know that she is a young scared girl who needs to get used to all this, but I am sure there are better ways to show that. Though, Camilla Luddington's voice performance overall is really good and is definitely worth a mention. The first hour or two are more-less sequences that help build the protagonist. Once you passed that, the game becomes a wonderful thing to play and will make you loose on the island many times. When you eventually move your head away from the monitor, you'll notice how time flies away really fast. Lara's character is built very carefully throughout the whole story which you can't, sadly, say about the supporting characters. They often feel pretty shallow, if you could say so.A lot of times you'll have the feel of being an actual movie where a lot of the stuff that happens (which will either help or hinder you) is happening just in the moment you'd expect it to happen. While I wasn't a very big fan of that, I can't deny the fact that it really helped me solve some of the puzzles at times.The first kill in the game is pretty dramatic and might have an emotional impact on some players. However, the transition from that over to a survivor who will happily kill enemies is almost instant and I didn't like that. Basically, you gotta get used to killing in an instant just like Lara herself.The combat in Tomb Raider games, if memory serves me right, had never been really beautiful. However, things really do change. Very often, you get the chance to feel like a hidden assassin and I can't explain how much I love that. The game approaches the combat in a very satisfying way. Cheers to Crystal Dynamics for that.All the weapons are the way they should be. The star of the whole game is definitely Lara's Bow. All the main battles are challenging and require mostly patience. The enemies will be more than happy to take you out of your shelter. The game's polished almost as much as it can be. The controls are pretty good - it's as simple as it goes. All the movement animations are very natural and as dangerous as you'd expect them to be. As you're building the skills, at the same time you get the chance to explore secret tombs that give you the feel of an actual explorer while at the same time not damaging the main story.A lot of the puzzles are easier when compared to those from previous games. This may disappoint some older fans. With Tomb Raider being a modern adventure game, quick time events are there. Luckily, they aren't around as often as many were feared they would be and they're not very hard after all. There's a particular one that really annoyed me. It's set in cave where you get attacked by a wolf and I eventually completed it after retrying it around 20 times and that was the most annoying part of the game.The whole presentation of this game looks and sounds just beautiful. The best experience will obviously have those guys with the strongest PCs and I would like to mention an option which enables more-less (for the period it was created in) realistic hair named TressFX which makes the end result even more beautiful.Some tricks with slow motion as well as motion blur combined with great voice performances help create a real movie experience. The sounds are top-notch and perfectly follow the game throughout all its gameplay and cutscenes.Some fans will not like the idea of the series getting a reboot after all these years, but this reboot, whether you like the idea or not, is really good and absolutely worth a try. Lara's transformation from a scared young girl to a survivor is a bit weird and kind of fast, but all the great aspects of this game (multiplayer excluded) make it hard to notice. This is an exciting and  beautiful-looking game. The single-player is very well-written and there are a lot of secret tombs for you to find and explore if you'd like to take a break from shooting all the enemies. Overall, the game is filled with action most of the time and action fans like myself will love that. If you got some spare time and would like to try an action filled game, this is the right thing to go for."

206,ThicLita,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014321081/,34,,0,11.2,July,"14,",272,3,1,"I wish there was another option to select, rather the ""Yes"" or ""no"" as to whether or not I liked it.Positives - It looks amazing, graphically maxed out it's extremely beautiful, the temples look great, the statues brilliant, the Samurai's even better, nice orchestral music to keep you interested. There's one scene especially where you sneak around a temple full of Samurai's its very raiders of the lost arc, I smiled through the entire thing, very cool.Cons - Lara gets the absolute crap kicked out of her, to the point it completely ruins any immersion, she falls from ridiculous heights, gets her face smashed in, stabbed a few times, shot, burnt, you actually start laughing out loud, it's like an over the top female John Wayne impersonation, I'd say at least 50% of cut scenes she almost dies. Storyline, it's almost cool, you get a very nice ""lost"" the TV show feeling, in fact, the entire thing is loosely based around it. Sadly her comrades are very bland and instantly forgetful, the ""northern"" accent of Roth is just horrific, it sounded like a Scottish guy attempting to be a Yorkshireman, it was almost as bad as Russell Crowes RobinHood massacre. The game play, it's hard, because a lot of it is very good, but it just almost immediately becomes repetitive and boring, I started the game quite looking forward to 100%'ing it, collecting all the cool hidden secrets, well, 2 hours in and I just wanted to push through the game, something I DESPISE doing, I feel like it's an insult to developers, but my god I got so damn bored of shooting these generic morons hiding behind things, the fighting is just abysmal, no challenge at all, nothing remotely cool, which is weird as they insist on having an absolutely identical fight segments in every single building you happen to enter, and I mean IDENTICAL, your heart just sinks when you walk in to a really really cool building and some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shouts ""SHE'S HERE""... Sigh.This game, seems to of gotten endless positive reviews, and I totally understand why, I think the biggest reason it failed for me, is it could of been a brilliant brilliant game, and instead I just wanted it to end. If I had any say in this game, I'd remove 90% of the fighting, in fact I'd make sure she never kills anyone, other then the samurai zombies, so we could in some way connect with her, it makes no sense at all, I'd say she piles up a body count of over 200 people? All to save Sam? I'm just not sure she's really the good guy in this game. I'd give Lara more of a free role, to make her own way from one side of the island to the other, not have EVERYTHING mapped out for you, every single step you take there's a virtual sign post saying ""GO THIS WAY!"". I'd make the puzzles require more then an IQ of 10 to complete, as they are sooo unsatisfying.All in all, this is a beautiful game, but the irregularities in the storyline, poor generic sign posted climbing and dreadful fighting make for a rather lack luster experience."
207,Abolish the Penny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/,165,1,1,19.6,March,"11,","4,360",10,1,"I 100% completed Tomb Raider (2013) today. I'm pretty torn about the game, because there's a great deal of things I liked a lot, and a great deal of things I really hated simultaneously. That's a pretty unusual reaction for me with a game.Things I liked a lot:- Game feel: Movement feels great, shooting enemies with the bow is incredibly satisfying, jumping and climbing is really smooth, the sort of half-sticky half-cover system is really flexible and felt excellent. I can't stress enough how great it is just running around in the game. This has some of the best auto-platforming I've ever played in a game.- Visuals: The game is really, really gorgeous. Weather effects are great. Environments are mostly excellent and there's quite a bit of variety given that it takes place on a single island. Lara's model keeps changing throughout the game as she suffers more and more abuse--and they very creatively have plot reasons to clean her up every once in a while only to make her bloody and dirty again.- Enemy AI: I generally liked the enemy AI. There are only a few regular enemy types, but they combine them interestingly. I generally felt like I had to move around a bit to avoid getting pincered or my cover shot out or blown up. It felt frenetic and engaging generally.- Bar filling: This game is more stuffed full of bars to fill than any game series other than Assassin's Creed. You are collecting scrap. You are collecting experience. You're using experience to upgrade skills and scrap to upgrade weapons. You're collecting weapon parts. You're collecting GPS pickups and relics (like in Uncharted, they have a little 3D Model) + most relics have a hidden thing for you to find if you rotate the model. Every area has something to shoot or burn or find as a per-level sort of thing. There are like 999 combat bonuses for extra experience. For a mostly fairly linear kind of action-shooter, I felt constantly stimulated with tons of stuff to do.- Ziplines: I don't think people in the real world use ziplines but I love them in video games.- The Puzzle Tombs: The game has optional tomb areas which are basically little mini-puzzle areas. This is good because the main game doesn't have many puzzles. These work great, they're very unique and interesting. Totally totally enjoyed these, wish the game had three times as many.- Tension and Release: The game does a great job alternating between high excitement and low excitement periods.- Long, substantial: This is a 15+ hour game easily. I took 19 to 100%, but that's including maybe 3 hours of replay because of lost save progress.Things I didn't like:- Game feel: All of the guns sucked in comparison to the bow, the grenade launcher is incredibly weak.- ""Big"" enemies: Every single shooting game that features a 10 foot tall enemy that wears tons of armour and takes 999999 bullets and then you have to QTE to kill it and the enemy has lines like ""YOUR PUNY WEAPONS WON'T HURT ME"" is stupid. There are no 10 foot tall human beings. This is not enjoyable. No one likes this. Tomb Raider has this multiple times, including two separate boss fights.- End-game combat: About three quarters of the way through the game, all the enemies start having armour and machine guns and combat takes a nosedive. It's much more frustrating without being more skillful. Bullet sponge crap. The last boss fight is like four QTEs.- Setpieces: The game has an enormous number of setpieces where you're in a collapsing building, running from explosions, parachuting through trees, tumbling down a muddy slide, being pushed down rapids, falling large distances and hitting the ground, etc. These suck. They suck in every game that does them. It's not good gameplay, because it's basically an extended low-control QTE. But the worst part is that after the first time, the spectacle wears off. It's just boring and blasé. You see a bridge and you say 'gee whiz, I wonder if the bridge will collapse as I'm walking on it"" and then it does.Things I hated:- The intro: The single worst part of the game is the introduction section. How the hell does this happen in so many games? It has forced slow-walking.- Lara getting the crap kicked out of her: Lara gets shot, burned, inappropriately touched, beaten, falls, stabbed and impaled, hung upsidedown multiple times, etc. If you lose a QTE, you are going to get brutally dismembered by an enemy or environmental obstacle. The Conan Clueless Gamer review that emphasizes this is right to. The sounds here are really disgusting too. This is the definition of pornographic. The scenes aren't done to provoke any response other than titillation. It's just stupid.- Genocide: Lara kills maybe 1000-1200 people during the run of the game. Lara kills more people than Kane and Lynch did combined. This is ridiculous. You can't have a moment in the introduction where the game is like ""omg big emotional moment lara has to use violence to defend herself killing people is such a big moral responsibility"" and then have her headshot 15 people in a row five minutes later. Either learn to make games with less combat, or stop trying to make it a major plot/character theme. Oh and by the way, the first time you kill someone it's in the context of a group of people burning down a village and killing dozens of innocent civilians and trying to kill you after groping you--there is absolutely, positively no shade of grey here. There's no moral dilemma.- The characters, the writing: The characters are awful. You have a team full of awful sidekicks. There's ""Grumpy Old Crazy Man"", ""Wise and Caring Father Figure"", ""Best Friend"", ""Big Dumb Muscle Gronk"", ""Socially Awkward Nerd"" (this guy actually wears a t-shirt with an Esc key, it's just a total joke), ""Oily Used Car Salesman Jerkoff Who Is Obviously Being Set Up For a Heel Turn Later"", ""Sassy Black Woman"". It's pitiful. They're all terrible. The only character who gets any writing behind him at all is the father figure guy, who keeps telling Lara he believes in her, she can do it, etc etc etc. Which is why it's obvious that he's going to die, but not before he gets to have a dying breath monologue where he tells Lara to be strong. It's all so flat and telegraphed. It's so phoned in. And half the dialogue is cliche stuff. Even the ambient enemy dialogue sucks--the last enemy in the game fired a random audio cue where he said ""Hey guys, she's got a gun!"" No duh moron, I just laid waste to an entire civilization. I was really tempted to skip most of the cutscenes.- The story: Hey, you know the supernatural stuff in every Tomb Raider game? And every Uncharted game? Well, it's here and it's just as stupid here.That's a lot of words to say I'd play another one. It's a big dumb mega-budget AAA game. I think in a lot of ways it's one of the better examples of what it's trying to do this generation. Fire the writer for the next one."
208,noibn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/noibn/,13,,1,20.5,March,"29,","1,883",2,1,"Does an already popular AAA big-budget game really need a review? Probably not, but I figured I would at least write a little something, as I did enjoy this game. The new Tomb Raider is a reboot of the series for modern consoles and PC. You play as a young and inexperienced Lara Croft, before she becomes a badass adventurer - a new origin story, basically. This is one of the game's strengths. Since it's not really beholden to anything that came before (except really basic stuff such as Lara's name and archaeology background), the writers were free to build the character from the ground up, and they did it fairly well. The game takes place on a seemingly-inescapable island full of all sorts of mysteries. Sound familiar? If you said ""hey, that's the plot of LOST"", then you win the Captain Obvious prize. The whole setup and plot, in fact, feels like a direct love-letter to LOST, as they share many similarities. So that's a plus if you are also a fan of that series. Gameplay is third-person action/adventure, very similar to the Uncharted series (with some hints of Assassin's Creed and Prince of Persia thrown in). There is nothing particularly ground-breaking about any of it, but it's well made and is pretty fun. Your signature weapon is a bow, but you can also obtain a few others, such as a pistol, shotgun and more. Along the way, you'll also experience a fair amount of ""set piece"" moments and platforming sections. Overall, it's a good balance between exploration, combat, and action sequences. Combat itself is extremely easy (at least, it is with mouse aiming - more on that later). So this isn't a game you should play for a hard core challenge. Play it to experience the story and just have some good clean fun shooting dudes in the head with flaming arrows. There is also a multiplayer mode as well, but I don't really care about multiplayer in these types of games, so I didn't try it and can't really comment on that portion at all.I did encounter a couple of small issues with the game, though. The main problem I had was with the controls for gamepads. I started playing with an Xbox 360 controller, since most console ports tend to be designed for controllers and generally play better that way. However, this is not one of those games - that is, not unless you are a whiz with using the right-stick for aiming. Maybe it's just me (being a longtime PC gamer), but I just find controller aiming schemes to be terrible. For this game, it was too hard to aim with pinpoint precision under circumstances that required quick responses. Additionally, I had major problems with the camera control using the controller. I like to invert my X-axis for camera on the right-stick in 3rd person games, but for some reason, in this game, it just refused to work properly. It will work correctly once, and then not even 2 seconds later, the opposite effect happens, even though you are doing the same exact thing as you did a second ago - it's pretty much completely broken. So I switched to keyboard and mouse, and never looked back. I recommend you do the same. With a mouse, you can headshot pretty much every enemy in the game before they even have a chance to shoot at you. In retrospect, it's obvious that the AI was dumbed down for console players, who have to use the crappy right-stick aiming control method. Another issue I had with the game is its use of quicktime events (QTEs). These might have been novel when Resident Evil 4 came out, but that was nearly a decade ago now. Games have evolved since then, and these unholy abominations should have been banned from modern game design by now... *steps off soapbox*... Anyways, thankfully, there are only a few sections that have QTEs, but the ones that are there are still annoying as hell - you barely get any warning, so if you're not prepared and don't mash the right keys in time, you have to replay a section over and over again. It's really annoying, and takes you out of the game.Those small complaints aside, I enjoyed the game a lot. I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece or anything, but it's definitely well above average and provides a good, fun time (an interactive popcorn flick, basically). The gameplay, graphics, and setting are all pretty solid as well, and the story is a nice new start to a franchise that was on its last legs. I would estimate the main campaign lasts somewhere between 12-18 hours, depending on whether you just run through it or if you are a completionist - and there's also the aforementioned multiplayer, if you're into that sort of thing. So it's definitely worth the money, if you are into these sorts of action/adventure games (and definitely pick it up if you enjoyed the Uncharted series, in particular)."

No other game really even comes close to this but there have been cheap imitations which won't be named. Now I despise Square Enix getting in bed with the Communist Chinese AKA Epic Games.

The new Lara Croft is the most amazing thing that has happened to the series in 18 years (1996-2014). The graphics (characters, landscapes and the animation) are reminding me of the Last Of Us (awesome PS3 exclusive and my favourite game, all in all), which is a good thing, obviously. Soundtrack, voices and ambient sounds are decent as well -- game does a very good job immerging the player into it's universe. Level design and the game progression are just flawless -- you'll want to search every piece of every level in order to find all the secrets and get all the achievements (which isn't pretty hard, if you ask me).After all, the only weak spot of the game is it's multiplayer -- it's pretty boring and kind of imbalanced.I'd rate this game 9.0 out of 10.0, and I'm anxiously waiting for the Rise Of The Tomb Raider, which is going to be released next year, Q4 2015."

The plot is really interesting and left me wanting more. Lara and her crew shipwrecked on a suposedly enchanted island with a hidden ancient city! What could be better than that? You think that it'll all be finding relics and journals (which it does include) but, it has a lot of action in it. It can get really suspensful and leave you gritting your teeth with sweaty hands. Lara's gadgets are also a unique part of this game. They may be primitive but you can upgrade them at campsites into b*tchin' weapons. The amazing cut scenes just top it all off!

The game is a reboot of the popular series and it offers a fresh take on the character.One of the things I loved about this game is the level design. Each level feels unique and offers a lot of exploration opportunities. The environments are beautifully rendered and the attention to detail is impressive. The game also features a variety of puzzles that are challenging but not impossible to solve.The combat system is also well-done. Lara has a variety of weapons and abilities at her disposal, and the game gives players the freedom to approach combat situations in different ways. The stealth mechanics are particularly well-done, allowing players to take a more stealthy approach if they so choose.The story is also engaging, and it keeps you hooked from start to finish. It offers a lot of twists and turns, and it explores Lara's personal growth as a character. The voice acting and motion capture are excellent, making the characters feel alive and relatable.Overall, I would highly recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the series and newcomers alike. It's a fantastic game that offers a lot of variety in gameplay, beautiful environments, and an engaging story. It's a game that kept me hooked from start to finish, and it's one that I will definitely replay in the future."

Admittedly, I did not play multiplayer much, so this review will focus on the single player campaign.- Looks good and controls feel responsive. - You get to watch amateur Lara develop into a hardened survivor. My favourite rendition of Lara Croft so far. - Exciting cut scenes and quick time events.- Plenty of collectables and some hidden tombs. You can unlock a skill later in the game that marks where the collectables are on your map (in case you’re a completionist). - Although the story is quite linear, you’re allowed to backtrack and revisit different locations (again, helps with 100% completion). - Good balance between stealth and aggressive gameplay. The skill trees help you customize Lara to fit your preferred style. - Puzzles felt too simplistic. I felt like the tombs should have been more challenging. - I would have liked more tombs. Lara is known as the tomb raider after all. Tomb Raider has been a celebrated franchise for years. Considering the large fan base, the expectations for this game were sky high. I was not disappointed. Square Enix and the developers did an excellent job with Tomb Raider (2013). I thoroughly enjoyed playing the campaign and am excited to play the sequel: ."

She also goes to an expedition to find more about this Queen, but close to this isle everything start goes really wrong and this is where history starts.In that serie, you can travel every camp you discovery to explore things you haven't explored to complete the history, upgrade your gear wear clothes with some improve habilites and learn skills for better playing.This scenario is huge and very detailed and rich with an beautiful environment.

230,Modranto,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971628333/,19,4,1,27.6,June,"2,",284,0,1,"Let me begin with a warning: this game is brutally graphic. Sometime when you screw up you're subjected to a short, gruesome death scene. Even when you succeed you might find yourself stumbling through caverns strewn with corpses and pools of blood on the floor. Yet if you can stomach it, it ends up adding to the grisly, extraordinary struggle for survival that tries and tempers a young Lara over the course of this game.This iteration of Lara is a compelling one. Since this is an origin story, at the beginning we see her unsure of herself at and terrified when things start going all kinds of wrong. At times her compatriots need to encourage her, other times she is driven to fight for their wellbeing and still other times they butt heads with her. Gradually, as she overcomes the challenges she faces, we see her grow in ability and confidence. The actress and writers did a great job of making her feel like a real person. She's more than just a standard action hero killing machine given a female facade.Voice acting for video games in today's age of mo-cap has become much more of an involved process. Yet Tomb Raider proves that the talent in this industry is greater than ever and up to the challenge. Camilla Luddington as Croft is the obvious star and shows a broad range of believable emotions. Robin Atkin Downes' depiction of the character Conrad Roth exudes a fatherly, gentle confidence that steadies Lara early in her journey. Another highlight for me was the palpable desperation of the ship's mechanic, Reyes (portrayed by Tanya Alexander), to survive and get back home to her daughter. The main acting I didn't care for was for the character Samantha (Sam), who oddly has two actresses credited to the character without distinction for who is responsible for what. She came off as a little flat to me. There's also a point where she voices a letter written by one of Sam's ancestors, yet she hardly alters her voice at all. To a lesser degree I also wasn't too enthused with the writing and acting of the character Doctor Whitman. Neither Sam nor Whitman are distractingly bad, they simply fall short of the excellence of the rest of the cast.Crystal Dynamics has made a game that is visually stunning, living up to its AAA status. One memorable instance was looking out at a deep blue smoke signal rising in the distance that contrasted wonderfully with the tattered reddish-orange banners intermittently placed along my path. All this taking place on craggy, windswept rocks and ruins overlooking a hazy blue-gray sea and sky. Awe inspiring set pieces and soaring vistas abound amidst this chaotic journey.The character design is on par with the environments, including Lara who is just a beautiful as ever and with more realistic proportions and clothing to boot. It's worth noting that the graphics option ""TressFX""  gives Lara's hair its own exaggerated physics processing, but it is very taxing on computers. The only time my frame rate stuttered was during close-ups of Lara's face during cutscenes, presumably because of TressFX. You may get better mileage by turning it off and increasing several other settings instead.This game's third person shooter, cover based combat isn't particularly original but it's polished and largely satisfying. I appreciate that in most cases (but not all), the enemies seem like they plausibly could have been stationed where you encounter them, rather than being spawned in purely for the sake of throwing combatants at you. Melee attacks are limited to single strikes and dodge counters, indicating that you are expected to mostly rely on your weaponry. You are able to upgrade those weapons by scavenging scrap, encouraging you to keep an eye out for collectables as you explore. Lara also gains skill points used to unlock new abilities, which combined with the gear upgrades lends a nice sense of progression to the game. Many of the hidden collectibles have a historical significance that makes this island feel truly inhabited. As you seek them out you'll uncover pieces of this island's wondrous past. There are also numerous, optional, puzzle centric tombs to delve into. On the exploration side of the game, I could have done without the ""mash E"" type quick time events that are used for turning cranks and prying open doors and chests. The QTEs tied to the action do a good job of keeping you engaged during the more scripted parts.Speaking broadly about the story, I liked that it kept me guessing on what was real on this island and what was myth. While it is a little predictable in other ways, it was more than adequate to keep things moving and allow the other aspects of this game to shine. The pacing is excellent, never letting you get tired of one aspect of the game. You'll be driven from one fantastical event and locale to another, with time for cutscenes, character building, exploration and shootouts along the way. My first playthrough, which was about a year and a half ago, took 18 hours and included getting all collectibles and achievements. My recent replay lasted about 9 hours while getting roughly 75% of the collectibles. For this genre I would consider this a pleasantly lengthy game.9/10"

234,october.hare,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019293547/,24,2,0,16.4,February,"11,",212,0,1,"(SPOILER ALERT)(ALSO A LOT OF WORDS ALERT)For a long while, I would have recommended this game, I really would. But in the end, I just can't. Thing is, this would be an excellent game -- if the developers would LET YOU PLAY IT.But they just  It may not literally be every thirty seconds, but it really begins to feel like it, that the game either takes control away from you entirely so you can watch some animation, or drops limits on the camera or the character's movement, or shifts from regular play into some variety of quicktime event, or very often, stutters back and forth between a few beats of no-control animation, then a moment where you've got to ""Press X To Not Die"", then more animation, then another couple milliseconds of gameplay, then almost half a minute where it looks like you're free to, y'know, actually  again, but then you make some story progress and it's back to the on-and-off tango.Much of this is regular videogame material that I'd hardly notice otherwise -- such as Lara doing the Batman thing where she can't talk on the radio without walking really slowly with her hand on her ear, or animations taking over and the camera restricting when she crawls through tunnels and/or wades through water -- but these interruptions large and small , one after another, until the cumulative effect is like trying to drive with someone else's foot on the brake pedal. Someone nervous, twitchy, and convinced that you're a toddler who doesn't know what roads or solid objects are.What really starts to push this into the red is the heavy degree to which the animations you can't control are failures -- not just moments of scripted misfortune, but scenes of the character flat-out failing at the things you can totally do when the game actually lets you use your buttons. After successfully evading a bunch of barriers on your own accord, you have to watch Lara auto-fail and fall a great height. After a long string of hard battles in which you've killed about a hundred guys armed with machine guns and dynamite, you're forced to watch her get beat down by a couple of randoms who don't look any tougher than the rest. After making a long series of leaps from ledge to ledge, the next roof gives way and, once again, she tumbles, out of your control.Lara falling great distances is a dominant theme of the game.Despite all this, I kept on for, well, apparently about sixteen hours, because the scenery is gorgeous, the gameplay when you're allowed to engage in it is fun, and this version of Lara is an engaging and sympathetic protagonist.The last straw for me, though, was coming across the Big Bad (a cult leader with a southern accent, HOW ORIGINAL) and about fifteen or twenty mooks in a cave. Okay, I'm thinking, tough fight, but not impossible. Obviously the game won't let me punk the Big Bad, but I can probably get a couple headshots before any of these guys get into melee range. Just let me sneak up and...... Annnnnd then it goes completely non-interactive. Just a movie. I'm sitting there watching, entirely uninvolved, while Lara wastes the element of surprise getting a headshot on the nameless nobody standing  the actual major enemy, and then the aforementioned beating by two randoms occurs,At least this time, the person she's come to rescue doesn't die the second she gets there, but instead, is saved by literal  while Lara can do nothing but apologize for failing, and I can do nothing but wonder whether the game plans to invite me to participate again, or is just going to carry on being a movie for a few more hours before ending.A short while later, while I, supposedly the player here, am still stuck just watching, Lara beats up a couple guys who may well be the same two from a minute ago. I think this might be the first time in the whole game when I've had control taken out of my hands so that Lara can positively accomplish something rather than screw up.But it's too little too late. I'm done, I quit; I just don't care anymore what might happen with the rest of this movie, because I'm pretty sure it's going to go like this: a bunch of objectives will be presented to me; when I get there, either events beyond my control will render the objective and all the work reaching it entirely pointless, narratively empty time wasting, or Lara will fall from a great height, or both; at the end, the Big Bad will be killed by the island goddess while Lara and I sit back eating popcorn, just in time for rescue to arrive through no action of ours, because until the very last scene of the game, anything we do to seek help will bring only wreckage and corpses, because that's how to write video games, because of how Atlas's submarine exploded.(Okay, so in addition to the constantly-take-away-my-control thing, I'm also  that well over half the game thus far has been devoted to summoning a plane, which explodes on arrival, then going to ""rescue"" the two survivors, who both die when I get there -- making it all a waste of time: nothing has changed, no new characters have been introduced, none of the existing characters' motivations or knowledge have changed, nothing that happens afterward would be any different if Lara had spent the same  time sitting by the campfire talking to good ol' Roth except that the plane's crew and Grim might still be alive, and also Roth might not think that Lara is kind of an idiot. .)Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not interested enough to find out. Roth has been written so positively thus far that he has to die, or turn traitor and then die; Amy is a nonentity even as damsels in distress go; Father Mathias somehow manages to be even less interesting than Deacon Blackfire; Lara is protected by franchise armor, and my input is clearly neither needed nor wanted here. There's just nothing left to care about, except the gameplay, when it's available... and as far as that goes, I can get pretty much exactly the same degree and type of entertainment, without the constant interruptions, from (I'm sorry, really, it feels like I should censor the following term but I just have to say it) .The disease of Game Wants To Be Movie has critically weakened many games.  This, despite the initial robust strength of the patient, is a terminal case."

The gameplay in the beginning is a bit bland but afterwards you are let loose on the island and go to advance the story. Even tho there are a couple of the loved and sought after QTE's the story and locations advance fluidly and slowly but surely we see the birth of the survivor.The graphics are quite astounding to the point that it gives the island a beauty of nature with the combination of the sound which is also quite well incorporated. As for dialog in the game its quite linear but you are able to talk with the other survivors (also and achieve for it) to get to know them better and learn about them. The voice actors in the game are superb.The game offers some DLC but it is mostly maps, weapons and playable multiplayer characters. It's filled with variations of match types and progression systems that you'll see in Call of Duty, Battlefield 3 and other shooter-centric playgrounds. Just so you know, the multiplayer is almost dead. theres a group called Tomb Raider Multiplayer Madness that focuses on the multiplayer and sets dates to play with others. The Lara Croft character is very well laid out, the graphics are great, pacing is pulsating (perhaps the best thing about the game) and gameplay is smooth. This is a great prequel, an intense and gritty story of the origins of Lara Croft.9/10 for this gem of a game."

The PC version runs really well and it's very friendly to multi-monitor setups. I don't recommend the hard difficulty as you'll get into some fights that seem difficult for the sake of difficulty.   This game resembles a cinematic story because you don't have real choices for your actions and path, puzzles are not that hard, and there are a lot of (cool) Quick Time Events and cinematics. The action high points are often QTE or QTE-like, which on one hand it's a good thing because in this case they are done pretty well, on the other you could say that they subtract from the gameplay. Pros: good story. Cons: not sure if the stealth game is bad or I am (maybe both). Rating: all the QTEs!!! Recommendation: if you think you might like it, then you probably will."

For the most part, combat is real time point and shoot with many cool challenges to over come. The puzzles and secrets weren't annoying. The controls are finely tuned. The graphics still hold up well today when ran at max and I still enjoy replaying this to try and obtain remaining artifacts I left behind every now and then.The story is pretty good and what you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game.

255,Ov3RT4K3R,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/,25,3,1,42.4,October,"16,","2,928",0,1,"The game begins with Lara Croft, a young archaeologist, setting out on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance, with the intention of finding the lost kingdom of Yamatai. The expedition ventures into the Dragon's Triangle, east of Japan. The ship is struck by a violent storm and shipwrecked, leaving the survivors stranded on an isolated island. A bloodthirsty, strange cult shows up to the shipwreck and tries to capture and kill the 'outsiders.' Lara soon discovers that the cult is led by a man named Mathias. Lara narrowly escapes capture at the hands of Mathias's men and must track down her friends and escape the island.The gameplay is where the game shines. Throughout the course of the game, Lara comes across a bow, and finds a handgun, machine gun, and shotgun. The weapons can be upgraded with the use of salvage, which you can find in crates, lockers, enemy corpses and animal corpses. You can also upgrade your skills with XP which you gain through story progression, killing enemies and animals, finding collectibles and solving puzzles. The weapons and skills can be upgraded at Campfires, which also allow the player to fast travel back to areas which you have visited before. You have to solve Mini-puzzles to open up a new path. Fire, wind, gravity, and rope arrows are just a few elements that are used throughout the game. Lara can climb rock walls and use valves with the help of a climbing axe, shoot rope arrows to create ziplines and much more.The Enemy AI is smart and will use cover and fire to their advantage. Quicktime events are often used in cases where Lara is captured or attacked by a wolf and they are pretty intuitive. Tombs are also in the game, but they are optional to get XP and salvage bonuses. There is also a multiplayer part. It consists of 4 game modes, Rescue, Team Death Match, Cry for Help and Free For All. Basically in all competitive modes the survivors will fight against the scavengers. The graphics are gorgeous. There is nothing to complain about.The ambient sound is well done. The voice acting is extremely professional.Overall, Tomb Raider is a spectacular game and I can highly recommend it for fans of the old Tomb Raider games and also for any other type of player.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:Also feel free to check out my YouTube Channel:"

The story was decent enough for the most part with occasional climaxes and the characters were likable. Visually, despite the game’s age, it still holds up pretty well. However, the only issue I have with the game is the fact that, unlike what the name suggests, there are not that many “tombs” in the game and the ones you get are usually pretty small and not very engaging. In addition, it goes without saying that the multiplayer is long gone, so don’t expect much in that area. All in all, Tomb Raider is a solid experience and is definitely recommended. Also, if you manage to wait for a sale, the price will be unbelievably cheap for the content you get."

This game is basically about her slowly becoming a badass, having her trapped in an island full of crazy people is the perfect setting to tell that kind of story.If you're like me and had this game sitting in your library for years I urge you to give it a chance, it really made me excited to play the other games in the trilogy."

259,Arbiter Libera,https://steamcommunity.com/id/a2o4c6/,17,2,1,12.7,June,"10,","3,476",0,1,"I find myself torn on how to finalize my opinion on Tomb Raider. As a game it's perfectly solid with nothing to really make it stand apart or fall to pieces. Mechanically it's all there – upgradable gear, skill points you spend on abilities, enjoyable combat and exploration – but I found it never reaches any heights where it should have. Lara Croft's origin story has so little story in it and development that was present I could never buy into due to conflicting narratives, character portrayal and being a reboot that honestly focused on the wrong things. Tombs, as such, being merely optional “dungeon delves” in a game titled Tomb Raider sounds wrong just typing it out like this, and with stronger presence would've been that something to make the game stand out more. Competent or uninspired, you decideLooking back at history of Tomb Raider I am brought to realization just how many games in the series I've missed out on. Not the earliest PS1 titles with those, let's call them charming, controls, but rather installments that followed on the next generation of consoles. PC as well, of course. This puts me at odds and essentially drawing from memory as to what the series originally was. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily. One should keep in mind my modern experience when it comes to “gun-totting action platformer” had been tempered already by Uncharted, though. This game strikes a resoundingly familiar tune in comparison.Story concerns exploring this lost island called Yamatai, but it takes a while for our cast to really get into things. Understandable when you take into account their ship wrecked and things start going awry almost immediately. Even if you ignore the fact they're largely regular people, aside from Roth who happens to be ex-Royal Marine and badass to the bone, there's bad blood on the island since it turns Lara and her crew are hardly first to get stranded there. Why and how would be spoiling, but considering this is Tomb Raider and they're looking for “mythical civilization lead by the Sun Queen” I'll let you piece it together on your own. Speaking of Endurance's crew and related characters we have our own Lara Croft alongside Sam who's family is actually funding this whole expedition as kind of archaeological research. These three figures are the most important ones and game really never makes much of an effort to characterize everyone else past the intro itself and brief radio communications. You have your grumpy mechanic, fellow naive student, professor so drunk on his ego you can see disaster waiting to happen, etc. They're archetypes for the most part and if there are twists to be had you can probably how they'll unfold. Story is not really the focus of Tomb Raider as it focuses more on Lara's own journey of survival and saving others as she gets entangled with things way beyond her ability to deal with at first glance. As game likes to remind you, she's a Croft and it's in her blood, though.Lara herself is one I have even more problems with. I remember it was all the rage back when this was a new release to toss around “ludonarrative dissonance” in order to sound smart and yet these people were not entirely wrong. What does that term mean? Put simply it's when story and gameplay narratives are at odds with one another... which happens to be absolutely true in Tomb Raider. Vulnerable girl persona they have going for Lara takes forever to wash away considering that in gameplay department you're wasting crazy cultists and wild life out to get you about ten minutes in. It's a permanent obstacle if you want to take Lara's character development seriously and I never could. To be fair there are moments later on when she's in full hardcore mode taunting enemies and they genuinely fear whoever is thinning their ranks, but such moments are far too rare and her character is not significantly altered. This one is a personal pet peeve, though – I could not stand Lara's voice. Yeah, posh Brit was always her thing, but if there's an English valley girl equivalent stereotype this is probably what it would sound like. Fact half her script seems to be grunting in pain and game mostly serves to be a sort of origin story for her character doesn't exactly help.With all that out of the way we can finally get to gameplay and other bitsAs I hinted above this was instantly familiar to me, although that could be simply because similar games have codified particular aspects like control schemes, character progression, and others over the years. If you've played one modern third-person action game you could make an argument you've played them all. In that case it's a good thing Tomb Raider is still built on very solid foundation. Yeah, Uncharted with female lead vibe is very strong, but I really liked how tight the game felt and in terms of shooting specifically I think it gave you more freedom as opposed to sticking to cover and taking potshots. In that regard maneuvering through combat zones takes a significant step forward in opposition to more static yet similar games of its time.If I had to divide it very roughly I'd say game has in equal measure platforming, combat and collecting various trinkets, but how they're distributed is not necessarily balanced out perfectly. What I mean by that is there are segments where you're on rails as setpiece after setpiece is, sometimes quite literally, firing around you and you're either doing your best to parkour your way to the objective OR shooting through waves of enemies to stay alive. For a good chunk of Tomb Raider you'll be putting combat aside and exploring zones to get all the sweet experience and collectibles. I come back to it again, but it's the latter that will actually stand in for largely absent story as you discover more about how previous shipwrecked individuals coped with their situations, find relics Lara will expand upon for some ancient Asian history, etc.That “fully realized game” feeling is probably what I liked the most. Yes, you're unlocking weapons as Lara goes through the story and you're using scraps you collect from crates you seemingly find everywhere, even in ruins untouched by mortal hands, but it's how these weapons are incorporated into the world is what really makes them more than merely how quickly they can kill things. Shotgun can be used to clear barricades, bow used to connect two points and create a rope to traverse over, etc. Fact you can upgrade all available weapons and will keep doing so until the very end of the game means you'll have something to do. One issue that kept rearing its ugly head is lack of any real stealth for a game where you're a single person going an entire garrison and your name isn't Rambo. You can creep on enemies and even stealth execute them if you get close with your mountaineering axe, but when you take into account you have three silent weapons (bow and upgraded pistol/rifle) you really have to wonder why that's the case in the first place. As you can probably predict game dispenses with any of that and likes to throw you into gauntlets as enemies surge in waves. I did appreciate the change of pace towards the end when new enemies appear even with staying up to date with upgrades meant I was never really out of ammo. Weapons having multiple uses also means you'll be using them to gain access to more than you initially could in the world aka going back to re-visit with fast travel to collect what you missed on your first pass.Much to my own enjoyment I was pleasantly surprised by how Tomb Raider kept up visually. Most of its failings in that department really come from intentional choices. Be they from the setting game went with (jungles and caves, until the last quarter or so when you see more variety) or simply due to trends in the industry at the time still going strong. It's a game that really wants you to mash those buttons for QTE as interaction and core part of combat itself."

THIS is a tomb raider game, and im happy to be a fan. I am a lara stan, and 2013 was the year we got a new and perfected lara croft adventure. Crystal dynamics sold to a new pub this year, and i hope that means less crappy avengers games and more Tomb Raider."
261,GeoLuz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/,12,,1,32.3,May,"18,","1,067",1,1,"The legendary Lara Croft from the legendary Tomb Raider franchise appears to have been reinvented in this 2013 reboot. She doesn’t appear to be sexualized like she was in previous iterations and looks like a woman who is about survival and gets tougher as the narrative progresses. This is the first time I had ever thought that Lara could be raped by a man who was coming on to her.The plot begins with Lara and her companions being shipwrecked on an island known as Yamatai. You will discover that Yamatai is an island with many perils, including dangerous cultists plenty of wildlife. The game begins with many QTEs (Quick Time Events) that introduce you to the basic gameplay of Tomb Raider. After learning the QTEs, the game opens up and allows you to explore. This game is not as linear as previous Tomb Raider games and this is a great thing. You can explore as much as you want while being mindful of the strict nature of the narrative. Lara looks convincingly vulnerable, but she is very resourceful in trying to survive.Once you have freedom to explore you will notice that Lara needs to eat by hunting wild animals such as deer and birds. She seems to feel bad about killing wildlife in order to survive but she needs to survive. As the plot advances Lara gets used to killing enemies she only gets tougher from killing enemies. The enemies include cultists known as Solarii soldiers and Oni. Solarii and Oni vary in terms of armor, weapons, difficulty.Weapons are a very interesting part of Tomb Raider’s gameplay. You begin with a basic bow and arrow that is upgradeable as you find more gear and salvage. The bow can eventually be used to create ropes in order to zipline from one area to another. As the bow continues to be upgraded, you will be able to attach the arrow to ropes in order to break open barriers. The bow is the best weapon that demonstrates Lara’s resourcefulness. Other well-known weapons such as the pistol, shotgun, and assault rifle can be upgraded also. This is where salvage is significant in the game. Salvage can be found on bodies of dead wildlife, Solarii and Oni and needs to be spent on upgrading weapons. Salvage is a pleasant addition to this game. There are also skill points that you earn from killing enemies, skinning animals, and progressing through the story. Skill points give Tomb Raider an RPG feel, although the game overall still feels like an adventure. Salvage and skill points can be spent at the various camps scattered throughout the game. The camps also serve as save points for Lara.The exploration gives the game a non-linear feel, as you find many collectibles such as relics, GPS cache, treasure maps, and tombs for raiding. Most of the collectibles don’t give much XP, but the tombs increase your XP so much that you would feel very encouraged to find/raid all the tombs. All the tombs require some puzzle solving, but the puzzles are not overly difficult to understand and solve. Raiding these tombs is plenty of fun and makes it fall in line with the title of the game Tomb Raider.Stealth is one of the new features added to this reboot. Lara can sneak up from behind and strangle an unsuspecting soldier to death. The bow can also be used in silent kills by hitting someone in the head with a well-placed arrow. There is a greater reward for headshots with any weapon which is greater XP.The locales around the island really serve as playgrounds not only because of their design, but because of the openness of the gameplay. Previous Tomb Raider games would require you to follow a strict, linear path to reach your objectives. While the storyline itself is linear and predictable, the exploration shows Lara’s interest in archaeology and ancient civilizations. Lara’s companions help flesh out the story. These characters are mixed with people who support Lara and one who’s not so sure about Lara’s ways to get them to survive their unfortunate circumstances on the island.The controls of this game are absolutely accurate, from the platform jumping to pressing the right buttons in QTEs. There is a Q button for those who play with the mouse and keyboard for survival instincts. Pressing the button for survival instincts turns the screen gray and highlights the important objects that you may need to solve puzzles. There is a well-detailed map that makes the game reasonable enough for advancing.I think that the Tomb Raider 2013 reboot is the best of the Tomb Raider franchise. It’s probably best not to sexualize Lara Croft and portray her as a tough, courageous survivor. Also, previous Tomb Raiders didn’t provide so many clues to advance and had frustrated many gamers. This Tomb Raider does not frustrate in the gameplay context. I highly recommend this Tomb Raider reboot to anyone."

This game is so overflowing with adventuring in its truest sense and bombastic action, that it won't bore you for a second. Lara Croft's origin story couldn't have gone better. This is how it's done. Crystal Dynamics changed the heavy focus on linear levels full of platforming and puzzle solving to a more dynamic mix of action, exploration and truly physical storytelling. Don't worry as there are still many many puzzles to solve, relics to collect and tombs to be raided. The levels are abundant with content, there is always something to do, solve, collect or read and it will shed some light on the history of the island you shipwrecked on. You get XP for your activities and gain levels to improve your combat and exploration skills. This reminded me of the Batman series as it has a very similar structure. If you are attentive to your surroundings, you will get 90% of the content the game has to offer naturally. The open levels are very well intertwined with action sequences and the combat itself is quite challenging on Hard difficulty. What I meant by physical storytelling is that the plot is revolving around Lara's survival ability and learning how to function on this hostile island. She slowly uncovers a sinister plot with a supernatural twist as it wouldn't be a Tomb Raider without some spooky stuff. The ending was very emotional for me. The audiovisual presentation is simply breathtaking as well as optimised. I loved every bit of this game and I cannot think of a more serious negative aspect. 9/10+ true action adventure, exploration of the mysterious island, the birth of a survivor, graphics and optimisation- the puzzles might be considered easy"
265,Jedo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jedo/,13,,1,36.4,February,"4,","4,038",2,1,"This Tomb Raider origin story is definitely my favorite version by far. I had a lot of fun playing it from start to finish (minus the multiplayer) due to the breathtaking level design, good voice acting (Camilla Luddington), and overall high-intensity throughout the game.This is an example of a game that you can't play half-awake.It took me about 25 hours to complete the SP campaign (35+ if you count the MP). One major thing that I feel they did right in this game are the collectibles. It's interesting because they're not hard to find due to skill upgrades and treasure maps but they are actually fun to 'try and get' because of all the platforming involved. It's not enough to know which direction to go. Reaching the collectibles requires an understanding of the map's layout. It's actually very easy to get lost within the beautiful island if you are just prancing around without direction.As far as the combat goes, I am split 50-50. The game gives you enough freedom with how you can kill your enemies and that allows for some good times. On the other hand, it seems that enemy detection is a bit screwy. As an example, there's an enemy mounted on a turret gun that can see you through walls and will follow you wherever you go even if you are hidden from sight.I feel that this 2013 version of Tomb Raider is my favorite one so far. Even for an origin story, this Lara Croft is quite different from her predecessor even when you try and imagine how one can become the other. I think that this game should be a starting point for a new series of Tomb Raider games. I do recommend this game to fans of the old games but even more so to those who have yet to play anything from the collection."

Tomb Raider is an adventure game and that offers weapon upgrades as well as skill upgrades.The game plays smoothly with the Xbox 360 controller and the default button setup is well placed for play. Although you can't save the game when ever you like there are camp sites that when you rest the game saves.When you pass by an area with placed you could not get into you will eventually make your way back so that you can access those areas with your upgraded weapon and/or new weapon abilities. The camp sites also let you fast travel from camp site to camp site.The map screen when you access it will show locations of the hidden items to find in a given area once you locate the treasure map or enough GPS devises for them to show up.My first few hours of play of Tomb Raider I have to say have been really good. There are events in the game that require button mashing to be done in order to succeed and although this makes the game more dynamic I don't like it because it distracts me from watching the event by making me focus on what button is about to be reveled that I need to press with in a second.Right now the Game of The Year edition is $39.99 Canadian and I would wait for a sale when it $12.49 or so before picking it up because the single player is where the game is really enjoyable. Although the price of $39.99 is a steal there isn't much to offer for multiplayer as there isn't many people playing the multiplay side of the game, plus the single player story is what Tomb Raider is really about.ːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starːːfirst_starː"

I saw this title, enjoyed the trailers, and decided to give the series another shot.  To be frank, I was blown away.  This game pulls you in from the moment it begins, with an engaging storyline, beautiful graphics, and compelling voice acting.  The gameplay is solid and offers enough exciting combat and immersive exploration to satisfy any fan of the adventure genre.Tomb Raider 2013's story reveals Lara Croft's origins and is based on one of her earliest adventures on a mysterious island.  The player is taken on a thrilling journey that uncovers Lara's true potential and destiny to become the Tomb Raider.  Her evolution from the inexperienced young student to the courageous, gritty survivor/explorer is brilliant.   As the game progresses, there are so many details- from gradual changes in Lara's facial expression to the tone of her voice and behavior- that reveal her gradual transformation.  In the beginning of the game, one can sense her fear and uncertainty, but by the end, a budding confidence and resolve.The gameplay is rock solid.  Combat is fun and exciting, and the player is rewarded for skillfully dispatching enemies with bonus experience.  The weapon upgrades are awesome and fun to use (my favorite was the grenade launcher and fire arrows).  Exploration is a blast, thanks to the fluid and natural way the player navigates the treacherous terrain, be it rock climbing with the ice axe or daring leaps across bottomless chasms.  There is a decent amount of side questing involved for the completionists out there as well, usually involving finding hidden historic artifacts or notes/memoirs.  There are sporadic button prompt mini-games but they don't feel tacky and aren't overly difficult.  My only complaint really is the simplicity of the optional tombs and the trivial rewards at the end of each one.  The devs could have put a little more effort into making these spelunking experiences feel more ""epic"" and rewarding, rather than just a means to find some treasure maps and weapon upgrades.Controls are great.  I played this using a keyboard/mouse and had a very enjoyable experience.  The controls are, by default, very intuitive so I didn't even have to change anything, just played the game.Graphics are amazing, especially for a game from 2013.  Excellent graphical options as well, and the performance is great, no issues for me and my system is a bit outdated.Sound is excellent, but music was mediocre.I spent a good 15 hours to complete roughly 80% of the game, including the main story, all the optional tombs, and a good chunk of the side quests.  If I were a true completionist, I can see this game lasting maybe 18-20 hours or so.In short, Tomb Raider 2013 is one of the most immersive and enjoyable adventure games I've played in recent memory, a classic in my book.  Grab this game NOW if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did!  Solid 9/10 game."
271,Luna,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048313541/,12,3,1,23.6,August,"11,",223,3,1,"Please note that this review is based solely on the single player campaign. I have not tested multiplayer features at all. I will keep this review relatively short and to the point. I will do some minor comparison to older Tomb Raider games (1-5) as it can't be helped being a huge fan of the series.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Tomb Raider (2013) is a brand new beginning and a resurrection for the well known franchise. It took a completely new direction making the main character Lara Croft more human, easier to relate to and less of that sex symbol as Lara has been in the past. The change is fresh, well needed and makes the whole thing more serious. I really like this new look for both Lara and the Tomb Raider franchise.The visuals of the game are fantastic and the cutscenes are both beautiful and well placed between the gameplay. I personally liked the camera angle very much and it didn't suffer from any issues. He whole experience felt really fluid and enjoyable. The soundtrack of the game however wasn't above the average. It did it's job but there were no moments when I'd stop to listen the beautiful melody on the background as in the past. I couldn't find anything I'd find myself listening outside of the game.As with so many other newer generation of games, I can't see myself playing this game again after fully (100%) completing it one time. In comparison I have replayed the old Tomb Raider games many times over and still they keep making me want to complete them yet again. I don't know where the problem lies, I just didn't get a feeling that I'd want to play this game a second time.Overally the game wasn't much of a challenge outside the few moments when I had to stop and think for the solution. Getting all the loot and treasure didn't give me other satisfaction than the ending screen's ""100% complete"" text. It wasn't difficult, rather time consuming since the game could have been completed in half of the total time if I only went for the story. The game had plenty of ammunition for your weapons and I never felt like I'd have to preserve it. The combat was rather easy and the AI wasn't that sharp all of the time. This could be seen as enemies thinking as if they were behind a cover when they actually weren't. I think the amout of combat was overally well balanced however and there wasn't too little or too much of it.You don't have to be a Tomb Raider fan to enjoy this game. It's a fresh start with a fresh story and it's made for both newcomers and old veterans of the series. Xbox controller is supported and the gameplay with it is easy, had no issues at all. I highly suggest to only get the base game unless you absolutely want the GOTY edition for whatever reason. The additional content consists of totally unimaginative skins for Lara (I ended up not liking any over the default skin), some multiplayer maps and weapon skins (for multiplayer) and one extra (bugged!) tomb to explore. A new area that adds 5-10 minutes more gameplay should have just been included in the base game. Charging 2,50€ for it can be seen both as greedy and as a total lack of imagination for deluxe edition content. The whole variety of DLC is more or less a money grab in my eyes and leaves a bad taste to my mouth. Other than that the actual game is well worth the money.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *21:9 Gameplay Review:I played this game using a monitor with 21:9 aspect ratio, a resolution of 3440x1440 and a refresh rate of 100hz. I'm sharing my experience with those who might be interested in how this game works on ultrawides.This game supports 21:9 aspect ratio out of the box and you won't be needing any additional fixes. Some HUD elements didn't expand beyond 16:9 but that was a rather minor issue and didn't bother me personally. During the end credits the screen did some flashing outside the 16:9 area which was a bit annoying. Cutscenes were apparently cropped to fill the screen but I didn't really put too much attention to this (other than a few times when Lara's head wasn't shown completely) and I personally prefer filling the screen completely (without stretching) than having black bars on the sides. Refresh rate was sadly limited to 60 as far as I'm concerned (couldn't change that from in-game options) so I couldn't utilize my 100hz monitor's full potential. Overally very happy with my ultrawide experience on Tomb Raider and as always, getting more horizontal view gives so much better immersion.* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *TL;DR & Ending words:Overally a very nice game with beautiful visuals and a fresh look. Musical score was sadly average and the 100% completion could have been made a bit more satisfying experience. Supports 21:9 aspect ratio and the Xbox controller for PC out of the box. A game worth buying for everyone. The DLC content however hardly gives any additional value and is not worth it in my opinion."

276,Lanzagranadas,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lanzagranadas/,25,,0,45.5,August,"22,",186,0,1,"Way to reboot a franchise, by turning it into your average linear action TPS. Guess that's good if you like moving forward and shooting guys as the main aspect of the gameplay, but as a fan of the classic Tomb Raider games I loved the platformer elements, the inspired level design, the diversity of locations, the puzzles and the challenge in those games. And I didn't find any of that here. This is like a typical adventure shooter with an odd fetish with showing Lara's pain and suffering. Lack of interesting locations and enemy variety (virtually you only fight human enemies); and guess what, you barely do any tomb raiding here because the ""tombs"" are just a bunch of small caves scattered around the game and are completely optional.As a game on its own, it's not terrible, but not great either, it's simply an average game with not much really interesting to offer. However as a Tomb Raider, this reboot made me lost interest in the franchise. I don't know if it gets any better in the sequels (Rise and Shadow) but I'm certainly not going to bother giving those games a try to find out.Giving it a negative is probably a bit unfair, but so are those hilarious 9+ scores from the ""specialized"" press. It's an ok casual action TPS at best, yet forgettable and apparently heavily overrated, with barely anything of what made Tomb Raider unique and great left."

279,MGRza,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MGRza/,10,,1,528.4,July,"7,","2,151",0,1,"Tomb Raider 2013 ReviewShe is back.... after so many years and boy oh boy did our dear Lara get a makeover. You are in for one thrilling survival origin story. Lara Croft has never looked better than she does now. Some key points that this game offers:1.	Origin Story: Experience Lara’s transformation from a young woman to the Legend we all know her to be.2.	Survival, Scavenge, hunt and loot to survive.3.	Breath-taking visuals.4.	Multiplayer.Gameplay & Controls:The game handles super well, on keyboard and controller. It comes down to your preference on which you enjoy to play more, console owners are limited to controllers only but on the PC, you have a choice.Lara’s movement in the game is stunningly done; she handles well, moves smoothly and just looks stunning. Whether you are up high or crouching down for stealth attacks, the game handles everything beautifully and you can get into it swiftly. To better explain this would be to say, the moment you spot enemies and approach a wall or other object that you can prone against Lara will automatically prone to hide for said enemies. We also have the means to aim both left handed and right-handed, thus giving us a tactical advantage when shooting from cover.We have a mostly open world environment that we get to explore as we unlock the means to do so; the said means would be the equipment and gear you obtain on the island as you progress in the story. The world is full of wood crates that can be broken to obtain salvage, salvage being the currency on this island that you use to upgrade your gear.You have several unique weapons that start out looking old and very broken down, but as you scavenge parts for them you upgrade them with a variety of options such as less recoil and being able to do more damage. The further along these upgrades get the better and more modern they start looking.The game features a form of levelling as you gain XP; once you fill up the XP bar you are rewarded with a skill point that can be invested into one of three categories to unlock new abilities like finisher moves or passives that allow you to carry more ammo.  Animals can be hunted for XP and each area has a challenge that can be completed for XP and you can forage certain plants for additional XP.You get the full spelunking experience along with so much more. Tomb Raider’s Reboot truly offers a new and much warranted outlook. Lara is downright better than ever before.Graphics:Saying that the visuals are breath-taking does not do them justice. This game is jaw droppingly gorgeous. Every aspect of this game has been carefully created to deliver a visual masterpiece. Everything looks so real, so lifelike, from the climbable terrains such as the mountains and buildings throughout the islands to the scenic paths; they all look so beautiful. The way the sun hits the mountains when it rises or sets, it truly makes everything so much better.Character details are of the same quality, there are a variety of enemy types, all looking absolutely stunning. The facial features are so beautifully done that it gives these characters a new realistic look. The way the graphics engine generates and creates the shadows fall and rise is impeccable.The game has all of this and so much more; it truly is a visual masterpiece. Under the hood there is a great variety of settings to fully customize how the game runs on your machine.Sounds:Just as beautiful... The in game sounds bring life to the island in a new thrilling and very surreal way. You can hear the wind howl, and the way the game generates it, it almost feels like you yourself can feel it. This is just one of many minor elements that comes together to create this masterful game. As you journey through the island regions the entire atmosphere changes, the sounds, the music, it all changes and that real lifelike quality stays in place. The game has a marvelous soundtrack that sets the tone for the game. It adds to the thrill and mystery of the island.Character voice acting has been done brilliantly. The voice acting in itself adds the last extra bit to truly making everything you feel, see and experience on this island so much more lifelike. The drama through conversations builds and adds the atmosphere and mystery immensely and the climax is well worth it in every way whatsoever.Replayability:The game has various regions you travel through as you progress in the story, some new and some previous areas that you could not reach yet. The Island is scattered with a variety of collectible items you can collect, along with numerous challenges that can be completed. This and the pure beauty of the game will keep you busy for hours, then there are the achievements/ trophies that have somewhat of a grind to obtain.Once you are fully done with Single Player you can take things online with some mates and others in a game of Multiplayer, furthering your Tomb Raider experience.MGR Gaming’s Conclusions:Spoilers ahead:When it comes down to it all, this game is absolutely marvelous. They have done this reboot amazingly. The story of how Lara has to fight and kill to survive, how she is forced to see the supernatural play out in front of her eyes, which goes against her very beliefs. You see and experience how a young woman is thrust into an unexplainable situation, forced to do things she never even considered just to survive.She is forced to fight and kill the crazed islanders in a desperate attempt to stay alive whilst trying to reunite with her friends. Everything is against her, even the island itself.You get to experience first-hand just how Lara Croft became the Legend we all grew up admiring and cherishing. She is one of the oldest gaming icons and seeing her reboot, paving the way forward for new and old gamers is a wonderful experience.A must have for every Tomb Raider fan, and that is not all if you try this game you will love it.

Lets dig in.Tomb Raider is a 2013 reboot/relaunch of a very famous franchise that had lost its way over the years.  It is a third person, action/adventure/exploration game starring Lara Croft, a young archeologist.  On its face, Tomb Raider has everything you would want from a AAA single player game.  Stunning graphics, smooth action with great feel, excellent platforming, tons of secrets to explore and a big map.  The devil, as they say, is in the details.  In Tomb Raider you and your teams boat crashes onto an unpopulated island that is hidden in the ocean and difficult for people to reach.  At the start of the game, you have been separated from your group and you are injured.  You have to pull yourself together, find a camp, and our adventure then begins.  At first it seems like Tomb Raider is going to be some kind of survival game.  You are injured, and need to find a camp, and supplies.  The jungle is intimidating and beautiful.  Very quickly though, the game forgets about your injuries, and becomes a pretty straightforward action/adventure/exploration game.  In Tomb Raider, you are constantly being reminded that you are playing a game.  This is by far my biggest gripe with it.  Over the course of the game, I estimate you kill somewhere around 750+ people.  When this is contrasted with Lara’s arc, and her reactions, it makes NO sense.  It is constantly hitting you in the face during story/dialog sequences, that don’t really make sense after you just killed 15 people in cold blood seconds earlier.  Making it worse, is that it doesn’t make any sense for that many people to even be on the island in the first place.  Additionally, you are able to fast travel between camps.  Considering what a physical ordeal it would be to travel between them, it again, pulls you right out of game and makes sure you are very aware it is a game that you are playing.  This would not be criminal in certain games, but in a narrative based game like this, where they are clearly trying to get you to suspend disbelief and get emotionally invested, it works against what they are trying to accomplish.  I feel the same way I did about Alan Wake.  Tomb Raider would have been a better game if design was more “top down”.  If the developers came up with the gameplay systems based on the story they were trying to tell (trapped on an island with a cult of people who are also trapped on the island), instead of feeling they *needed* certain types of gameplay, and systems, and game length, if they were going to charge $60 for the game at the time of release, and then trying to shoehorn a narrative around those systems.My issues with it aside, Tomb Raider does a fantastic job returning Tomb Raider to its rightful place as franchise with big time, cutting edge, releases that you should be excited for.  I’m looking forward to playing through the sequel and seeing where they took the franchise next.8/10(Edited to correct year the game released)"

This game is an action packed thriller with explosive set-pieces and a storyline to root for.The Lara Croft we know is absent. Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle.Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job!The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles.This game is amazing, I have already played in 4 times and yet havent explored everything. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy.For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece."

The original Tomb Raider may look like Minecraft now but the sets themselves were puzzles that you needed to solve in order to traverse.  This reboot has a button to highlight all areas of interest and removes that in favour of the more impatient action gamers who are just running to the next shootout.I still recommend this because its a good game and you get to feel like a badass despite being put through the wringer a dozen times."

This has been one of the most fun gaming experiences I have had in a long time! The graphics seemed to be great for a 5/6-year-old game and not at all dated. The game is very beautiful with stunning backdrops that are a sight to behold when played on full settings at 1440p. The gameplay was extremely fluid and intuitive, and the camera was always great, and I never had an issue with it. The gunplay is fantastic; having headshots is incredibly satisfying, as is blowing anyone away with a shotgun at point blank range. The melee fighting seemed to be more based on defensive play, such as dodging a strike and then shooting the enemy when they were exposed, which felt extremely rewarding. The overall movement, as well as the climbing mechanics, were extremely fluid and smooth with no problems, making the experience an utter delight. I was so immersed in the plot that I became heavily invested in the main character, which is something I don't normally do in games these days. I intended to play this in short bursts, but I couldn't stop myself from wanting to know what would happen next, and it never let me down.

It reminded me of a cross between Batman Arkham Asylum/City and Assassin's Creed: lots of running around in a big map, getting into a bunch of fights that often require precise timing (QTE's), some platforming/puzzle stuff, and collectibles. Yey. The gameplay is good at what it does, and I managed to keep playing it despite my distaste for QTE's and platforming (the former because its boring, the latter because I am bad at it. XD). Story-wise, it is fine, if somewhat predictable (took me about 12 hours to finish the main story). Sadly, some of the characters I like die horribly and the characters I really don't like die horribly to something other than me, so that was a bit of a shame. But aside from that it is a fun little adventure where you go to alot of freaky looking places, fall onto hard surfaces alot, and eventually make it out by doing a crazy run away from danger only to end up in a place similar to where you just left. Pretty sure Lara would have died half a hundred times during the course of this game if it was reality and not a game. But anyone who has played a fair amount of games is probably used to that by now. XDOverall I thought it was a good game, even if I could do without the QTE's and the sequences where I have to run or slide down a dangerous area dodging and jumping over stuff. Everything aside from that was fine and mostly enjoyable. So if what I have described here sounds like a game that you would enjoy, then go ahead and pick this up. If not, then I guess don't. Enjoy a crazy adventure on a strange island filled with freaky people for you to shoot at! :o"

All the environments, animals, characters etc. look good.The sounds are also very good - especially the environmental sounds, like waterfalls, rain, storms, wind and such sound great and they create immersion well. The voice actors are very good and their voices fit their characters well.The music.. well. Honestly I can't remember much of it - so it's not memorable at all. But I suppose it just blends in so well that you don't even notice it.. lol.Can't say it's bad cause it doesn't annoy me, but can't say it's good either, because it's not memorable in anyway.============The story is interesting - it does have some fantasy elements that might not work for everyone, but for me it did the trick just fine - I really liked the story of the game.The character difference between games is notable - the old Lara was an ample bosomed she-terminator that just shot everything on the run - the new Lara is a whimpering little girl that eventually evolves into a female Rambo - she's even armed with explosive arrows.She's no longer a superhero, and her bust size is normal too. I really like the changes - it makes the character more believable and realistic.============The game and its areas are very linear - but it works in this game very well. I think its better this way than forcing an open world design on it.You just unlock gear that allows you to move forward - and sometimes you gain access to collectibles in old areas with new gear, it's pretty straightforward.The puzzles of the game might be too easy for most people - I'm not exactly the sharpest tool in the shed and I found them all pretty easy.But maybe it's better that they're easy - at least they won't stop you from progressing in the game.(Well, most of the puzzles are optional anyway..) ============Well.. anything bad?It has some technical problems, but they are rare. Once when I went into a tomb, I could see through the floor, whirling water beneath the cave. And I actually could die from this glitch too - the floor wasn't merely lacking textures, it was really bugged. After dying everything worked normally.I also got a fatal error once when moving in the Endurance (Ship).Other than that, I can't find much bad to say about the game - other than some optional stuff.Collecting mushrooms and eggs and stuff is just.. meh. It's artificially made filler content that doesn't make any sense. It shouldn't be in the game at all.Like okay, I understand that you collect relics and historical documents and stuff - Lara's an archaeologist and interested in things like that. But why would she gather Red Cap mushrooms or steal bird eggs? Just.. lolSo basically I could give it a full five star rating, if I had ignored the stupid filler content.. but no, I had to play the game to 100% completion.It's not that time consuming to play to 100% anyway - but those things just didn't make sense to me.============But yeah, I think the game is about perfect in length (if you ignore them mushrooms), it can be completed in about 10 hours if you just play the game and don't mind the extra stuff.Even if you search for every collectible in the game, upgrade all weapons and get all skills for Lara, it takes around 20 hours which is completely fine in my opinion.The game isn't too short and its not too long - the length is just right.Overall, the 2013 Tomb Raider Reboot is an excellent game - easily worth those four stars, maybe even five if you can forgive the things I mentioned above.You probably can grab it from a sale for really cheap, I got mine for a few euros and honestly if I knew it was this good, I could've paid more.It's definitely worth playing, especially if you get it cheap - I highly recommend it for anyone.============Summary:The Good 👍+ Still very good looking+ Immersive sounds+ Interesting story+ Character design+ Perfect length (for me)The Bad  👎- Too easy puzzles- Artificial filler content"

This game being the first in the trilogy leaves some thing unpolished which gets more attention in future games, but still holds it's own to this day gameplay and graphics wise. The only downsides in my opinion are the following:After beating the game, any enemy-killing based achievements will be nearly impossible since all enemy spawns are rapidly decreased or just completely gone, so get those done as you go.You cant acquire every achievement in this game without putting a long time into the multiplayer gamemode. The issue with that is that getting a multiplayer game in 2020 is nearly impossible. You can load into a game with friends so if you have like 4 friends with this game you can get 100% of the games achievements with ease.TL;DR: Buy this game if you want a phenomenal singleplayer experience, but don't expect to do every achievement since some require you to play a dead multiplayer gamemode you need multiple friends to even access."

307,perato,https://steamcommunity.com/id/perato/,18,2,1,37.4,January,"2,",635,1,1,"My last experience of a Tomb Raider game happened around 18 years ago. I played few hours of either TR2 or TR3 on Sony PlayStation. I cannot make comparisons to previous games in the series for this reason alone. Tomb Raider (2013) caught my eye because of the high praise and low price. In short the game is 3rd person shooter with climbing, light puzzles and strong story. If you don't like these features, don't buy it, otherwise it's worth the money.First of all I must praise the game for being very well done. The graphics are great and the game works like a charm. I encountered total of one (1) minor glitch during my gameplay that lasted 19 hours. The gameplay is solid although it becomes a somewhat boring in the end. Sounds of the environment, characters, guns are all on par with the rest of the product. Music I can describe as lacking, since I cannot remember a single moment from any of the songs played in game, not even the main menu theme if there was one. These things in mind  we can move to the reason why I wanted to write my own review. Tomb Raider tells us a story about female tomb robber Lara Croft who gets stranded on an island with some of his friends and co-workers. She gets lost from her friends and they all soon meet other shipwrecked people who attack and capture them. Croft must then begin the long journey to free her friends and eventually try to escape the island that holds a dark secret.Essentially the story is about her growing up to be like her father. What I understood from the game, her father was some sort of an adventurer or a tomb raider alike. Though Lara in the early part of the game seems like your average city girl, she quickly learns to survive in the hostile environment of the island and tackle with its inhabitants. The game begins with a chapter where she learns to hunt, make fire and avoid enemies. A couple of chapters later she's shooting mercenaries left and right and suddenly doesn't have to care about hunger, cold or anything she just learned to avoid. She then starts immediately adopting new guns and gadgets with no trouble.The major problem with the story is that the gameplay itself doesn't seem to relate to it. The conversations with other characters, Lara's monologues and some cutscenes portraits her slowly growing up to become an survivor, yet the actual gameplay throws show much against her in the first few hours that there isn't much to improve later on. About midway through the game she has escaped from atleast three exploding/burning buildings, killed about a hundred mercenaries and climbed to the highest point of the island. After that she just survives those things again and again. And the game does exactly that, more enemies, more exploding buildings and more climbing. There's just too much of it and because of this the game loses its novelty already in the midway of the game. Thanks to varied level design, the game manages to stay mostly refreshing right until the last chapters. The story also manages to stay within its darker shades and there's no comic relief characters or over-the-top sidemissions to alter the atmosphere.Lastly I must mention that this game constantly reminded me of Far Cry 3. And because of comparison that I would consider the problem mentioned above only a minor flaw. While the games have quite many similarities in their setting, gameplay and story, Tomb Raider does it all a lot better. Tomb Raiders story is the center of the game and while the gameplay diverges a bit from it, the game in its entirety manages to stay credible compared to other video games. It could be a bit better but it could be a whole lot worse. Like exploding monkeys and killing alligators to make bigger wallet kind of worse."

Due to ""gross luck"", the island that they happen to become stranded on is the exact one that they are seeking. It is full of history, mystery, and discovery, the latter of which the team has come seeking.Ultimately, this is a game about survival, where the going does get tough and one has to make split second decisions in order to survive.

309,Wiesler,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wiesler/,14,10,1,20.9,December,"19,","3,831",0,1,"This game seems to scream gritty, character-driven survival. The intro has Lara getting captured and using fire to escape from her bonds only to be impaled. Then you use a QTE to rip out the debris from her wound and then as the screen fades you have to search frantically for bandages to heal her up. Then as you escape the caves you are handed a bow, a bow that you need to hunt the animals in order to... level up? Well that’s strange, but at least you have to make choices when you craft it... or not really because there are no consequences when you upgrade, so you just grab everything. At least they don't just magically transform your weapon out of nowhere or have characters just hand you a military grade arsenal, thus taking away the weight of all the work you went through upgrading to this point before being handed said arsenal. Actually they do exactly that.Well at least they are taking narrative seriously because Lara cries her eyes out as she murders her first attacker... but then the next second she starts building up her resume to be in the next Hotline Miami as she brutally kills everyone without a second thought and there is pretty much a whole tree dedicated to killing things brutally to get bonus experience so that you can unlock more brutal ills to get more experience, and that's just a lazy reward system.So for all the grit, realism and seriousness the game seems to put out, Tomb Raider is an average action game at its core. All of the world building the game attempts to set up is taken away quickly as the game rushes to reassure players that they are dealing with familiar mechanics: kill whatever and you make yourself and weapons better. The game also failed to mention that Lara Croft was actually an escaped Weapon X subject, because her super-human healing factor is obviously more important than giving the game some stakes, consequence, or consistency. The game's crafting system is less of a survival element and more of a light RPG element. The salvage you find from bodies and boxes just allow you to easily upgrade your weapons in all number of ways (rather than needing specific material) without any choice or drawback, and she goes from vulnerable, survivor to Rambo faster than she probably snaps a neck.The setting of Tomb Raider houses very little tombs, but a lot shoddy craftsman ship and decent staged events. The game looks open world, but really it drags you around from one set piece to another, often closing off paths, and then allows you to go back to certain sections to hunt down collectibles that don’t really add much unless you are into antiquing or mildly interested in history with a distaste for film, books, research,  or museums. It’s a formula that works, that people love: climb a thing that’s falling apart, dangle around stuff precariously, escape explosions/debris/fire/all manner of things by an inch because the script says so and now maybe rolling through rapid water can be added to the mix. It’s alright, it’s not broken, but after a few generations of video games, you think we could come up with a way to really up the spectacle or, better yet, let the players keep more agency as they are caught in these crazy situations. Tomb Raider really has a “been there done that” feeling.The storytelling of the game is basic. Lara's character is really just summed up by everyone reminding her she is a Croft and super cool. It also seems like there was some sort of board meeting where they decided to make 90% of Lara’s emotional expressions tears. It’s supposed to be a shortcut for us to care about her, but a genuine connection would have been far more rewarding. Instead of showing Lara cry all the time over people we don’t care about, or situations we can’t relate to, why not create an interesting protagonist? Yes, she is going through lots of stress and loss, but I can hardly feel that for her because I am not connected to her or the rest of the cast. Most of the motivations and traits of the characters are told rather than shown (“I secretly love you” “I am your best friend” “I don’t trust you”), which is lazy, but it is enough to make people that this is groundbreaking. I won't spoil the main plot but it goes from some serious murderer/kidnapping stuff to something rather silly. Mostly the story just dragged about and I forgot who I was trying to kill or save pretty early in the game. No one was really memorable, except Lara Croft, because you can’t wade through the corpses of your enemies for more than 10 minutes before someone reminds you about being a Croft. So after all of this, why is it recommended? Well first of all the credits assure me that the developers were sincere in making the best game they could, and I both appreciate and believe that: people need to eat, and they could have done a worse job. Also, Steam only has two categories of reviews, and I don't think too many people are as critical as I am about video games. There is an over-reliance on quick time events, gratuitous violence that totally contradicts prior character traits (which are in short supply already), most of the gameplay is a string of set pieces with many movements being small scenes that take away player control, and there is a significant lack of tombs to raid, but it’s not boring. It’s a great looking game with lots of explosions and crumbling sets, and it’s easy to pick up and play. If you can just accept that the game is shallow, it's fun enough so you will probably finish it before you realize it was nothing new or fantastic. The afterthought-level multiplayer is really just shoehorned in though, like they were forced to put it in at the last minute."

Crystal Dynamics decided to take that route with their version of Tomb Raider. It is a great third-person shooter, which contains climbing and puzzle solving as main gameplay elements, just like in Uncharted. Naughty Dog tried to make Uncharted like Tomb Raider, and now Crystal Dynamics tried to make Tomb Raider like Uncharted. Quite ironic. And it works, in many ways better than Uncharted.The game has a fairly large ""open-world"" (if you can say that) with tons of collectables and side-tombs that you can raid (no pun intended), whereas Uncharted was a very linear game. Tomb Raider also has skill system and crafting, but there's only a few weapons available in the game. The lack of weapons works with the survival aspect of the game, but the overload of ammo doesn't. There's ammo around every corner more than you can carry. It takes away from the experience, and even in harder difficulties this major problem isn't fixed. Another thing I found quite irritating were the quicktime events, which takes away from the immersion of the game. Every time you find a collectable you are forced to punch a button repeatedly. I didn't mind it too much however. The overload of enemies is also pretty damn stupid, but it makes for good gameplay, and the AI isn't very smart either.

I have too many great memories of wonderful moments of gaming thanks to this series, and those moments definitely allow me to forgive the varying issues one comes across when trekking through Lara's back catalogue.However, 2013's Tomb Raider reboot takes the series to places that even I, as a rabid Lara fan, could never have imagined.Quite simply this is a game that will provide you with an experience you won't soon forget. Not only is it technically masterful and gorgeous to view, but the 'new Lara' is someone you will quickly form a deep and lasting affinity with.No punches are pulled here; she is treated brutally and without sanction. The environment alone pushes her thresholds of tolerance to the very limit, let alone the foes she will ultimately face.There are a few QuickTime events that may make you think it's one of 'those' games, but have faith that the few games of Simon Says that do occur are are small and are a worthy price to pay for the emotional adventure ride you will be pulled through.Whether on sale or no, this game is worth the price of admission, and is an experience that all gaming affectionados should list on their gamer cards by default.Recommended without any doubt."
325,alx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alx___/,9,,1,39.6,June,"20,",91,0,1,"The first game in the rebooted TR trilogy.+ The graphics are good for a game from 2013 (and without a remastered version on PC mind you).+ It is well optimized and will run in most modern systems.+ The game has some replay value. There are a plethora of weapons, skill upgrades & achievements to grind for after finishing your first playthrough. You can also challenge yourself with a higher difficulty, get into multiplayer matches or gather collectibles.- The plot is okay for Tomb Raider game standards, but there is room for significant improvement here. The story is generic and gets stale after a while.  Overall, the game offers an enjoyable experience even in 2019 and the 20€ price tag is acceptable, but I recommend getting the game on a sale. There are sales on Square Enix games on the store very often."

327,@Antique_Steel,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018169887/,17,,1,12.5,November,"15,",79,0,1,"This game is enjoyable if you A) expect a mindless platformer and B) don’t value realism. If you want a more immersive and polished experience then you need to know these main faults:Nothing is realistic. Flammable objects burn down in seconds, animals have terrible AI, and the landscapes all have the same obvious signposting for jumping, climbing and grappling. This isolated island is absolutely filled with skeletons, still-lit lamps, and wreckage. Many of the baddies have bows, for some bizarre reason, and ammunition litters the map in a quite preposterous abundance. Curious string bags can be found regularly and they must be set on fire in order to get the ‘salvage’ from within. Why these bags couldn’t just be opened with our Lara-hands is beyond me.‘Salvage’ is a form of currency used to, somehow, upgrade your weaponry and it can also be found in random crates and, um, in animals. Yes folks, that means you can innocent deer and use the body parts to make a better receiver for your automatic rifle. How? Don’t know.The game is over engineered in many parts. The shaky camerawork is unrelentingly present, even in cut-scenes and there is simply too much freaking weather on some maps. The camp menu, which you’ll be using a lot, throws pointlessly exaggerated animations and sound effects at you every time you navigate through it, and I hated it. This menu is where you spend your experience to choose new skills and where you spend your salvage to upgrade your weaponry, and there aren’t many options in it but every damn one of them requires several grades of navigation. Please just show me all the skills on one page and all the weapon upgrades on another without the special effects and flashes and booms and swooshes and beeps—it’s like Michael Bay directed the flipping thing.Strangely, I have seen other reviewers praise the characterisation and the story but I warn against believing them: Lara has no arc at all, starting out as a tough cookie who says she hasn’t a clue but then adventures away with ease; and ending as a tough cookie who, well, adventured away with ease. It’s all tell with opposite show. The story, too, is pretty silly (the big, bad cult leader wants a woman to sacrifice in order to revive a goddess, the protagonist fights through endless lesser baddies to save the woman who we barely know) and it is entirely superfluous with minor, pointless exposition happening through books you can find on the map. None of this really matters, none of it affects the gameplay, and we don’t care enough about the lesser characters to feel any bond to them. Lara could have shot the antagonist many times but the game decided, for no reason, that his death must be saved for the final (disappointingly easy) showdown. Only someone that thinks action flicks are deep or who skips the cut-scenes in RDR2 or The Last of Us could admire the writing in Tomb Raider.But there are positives: it is a decent game with graphics that still look good in 2022 and the weaponry is fun to use. One thing that I really appreciated was Lara Croft’s appearance. While she is still an attractive representation of the traditionally female form, she is no longer overtly sexually portrayed and there are menu options to have her clothed in more practical attire than the skimpy vest she begins with. She is well acted too, with some genuinely memorable lines.If you want some mindless fun then get the game; if you want a cerebral or powerful gaming experience then look elsewhere."
328,LordGandhii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/,17,1,1,12.6,December,"20,",771,0,1,"This game reminded me that this whole series was part of my childhood.The last game I played was Legend, and after that, I completely ignored the series for whatever reason. After seeing this during the Autumn Sale, I decided that I would pick this game up to pass the time until the next (and hopefully better) sale. However, I was blown away that I regret not buying this earlier.The graphics impressed me for nearly the whole game. I have exactly 100 screenshots in 12 hours of gameplay. Almost everything to it looks beautiful. However, at times, I feel like the characters (or more specifically Lara Croft) looked lazily done and the textures looked awful. But, like I said, 100 screenshots in 12 hours. Can't remember when I last took 100 with a game like this. The environments looked beautiful the whole way through, regardless of how bad Lara looked at times. Actually, this game was a nominee for the ""Best Graphics"" award for my blog, but it didn't win. The gameplay is very smooth and the difficulty is relatively fair. The switch between stealth and shooter gameplay mixes well and switching from one to the other is a smooth, flawless transition. The game is somewhat open world, but you won't do much post-game unless you're a completionist. The bow was my personal favorite weapon and using it was a blast. All the weapons share a purpose so you'll use them all in different situations. But, as much as I enjoy the gameplay, I did find a few flaws. One thing is that if you want to buy this game for multiplayer, don't. It's dead. Another issue I had is that hunting is pointless in the game, all it really does is give you some XP to level up. The third flaw I had wih the game was that the QTEs are really unfair. Sometimes, no matter how much you mash that button, the game says you failed the QTE. This is especially annoying with the water scenes, where you're sliding down a waterfall and you have to shoot barricades and use the slow controls to dodge all the spikes so you don't get impaled. Other times, when you have to hit a certain button, they don't reveal that button until the very last second, and by the time you realize it, you're dead. They really need to be fixed. But other than those issues, I was very impressed with the gameplay.Lara Croft's origin story is pretty intense the whole way through. After the ship she was on crashed on an island, she tried to look for a way out and also had to rescue her friend Sam. Although the whole ""save your friend/family/etc"" thing is very cliché, Tomb Raider does this right. The whole journey keeps you hooked, until the rescue mission finally comes. After that, then you'll learn that the game is ""just getting started,"" and from that point on, the last few parts of the game really drag on. First you waste your time killing some members of a cult, then you go find a samurai and the antagonist's real plan, then you have to go rescue Sam again. Instead of this part of the story being thrilling, I nearly fell asleep. However, the ""final boss""  was a pretty crazy fight. Other than the really draggy final part of the game, I'm happy with the dark, gritty origin tale of a legendary video game character.I did some research, and realized the composer of Tomb Raider's soundtrack is Jason Graves, who is known for composing the Dead Space series' soundtrack. That being said, you can expect that the songs sound more creepy than intense. Because of this, the themes had trouble matching and so I wasn't very happy with the soundtrack. But, the voice acting was amazing, especially Lara Croft and Roth (Camilla Luddington and Robin Atkin Downes respectively) who really give the characters personality. Overall, the music needs work but I enjoy the voice acting.The game lacks replayability mostly, and at least 14-15 hours is needed to 100% the game. Plus, the multiplayer is dead. Don't get this game if you want a game to waste your life with.Tomb Raider has a lot of flaws, that's for sure. However, the experience was still intense, thrilling, and interesting almost the whole way through. If you loved the older Tomb Raiders or just adventure games in general, this game's a definite must-buy.Graphics- 9.0/10Gameplay- 7.5/10Story- 8.5/10Audio- 7.0/10Replayability- 4.0/10+Intense, gritty origin story+Beautiful environments+Amazing voice acting+Cool ""final boss""+Great graphics-Dead multiplayer-Music doesn't match-Unfair QTEs-Textures look messy at times"

I generally avoided any game that had heavy reliance on platforming and asked players to pay close attention to environments for hints, well because based on my experience I'm pretty terrible at both, but thanks to the dumbed-down mechanics from the reboot, which were significantly easier to manage than my previous TR game experiences I was able to adapat and actually enjoy the game.Rating(s):Visuals & Graphics: 10/10Amazing. The game is the eye candy and so is the main character. I prefer this new rendition of Lara over the ones in the old games. Cleaner look, doesn't look like a ♥♥♥-dump. Some times looking simple just makes things more beautiful. The environment looks amazing as well. You need to be running the game with a high-spec rig to fully appreciate how the game looks.Music and Sound: 7/10It's not bad... per se, but not exactly great either. It's forgettable at best, but in no way bad.Plot/Story/Characters: 9/10+ Plot is strong and solid. Premises are acceptable (minus the over the top supernatural stuff) everything else is realistic and believable. Characters actually die. :D+ The game does well introducing the character to players. As an origin story, it fulfills its purpose well+ Lara is lovable :D- Cheesy lines that make you wanna punch the characters at times. Gameplay and Mechanics: 8/10I have mentioned on numerous occassions in my other reviews that I  it when corporate decide to dumb-down the mechanics of their games to make it less grindy/less difficult/more casual feel so that they can attract more players. This is probably one of the few instances that I will contradict myself and say: ""I'm happy that they did."" Tomb Raider games unlike most Open World RPGs give heavy emphasis on platforming and paying close attention to your environments. It usually didn't have quest markers to guide you to the right path, unlike the usual go to point B from point A to update your quest progress or kill this certain monster. Tomb Raider 2013 implements this new instinct mechanic that auto guides you and serves as your quest/mission marker. So you don't waste your time finding your way to your next progress point. I would actually play more games from this genre if I wasn't so damned lost all the damned time... but Tomb Raider '13 was very helpful enough to guide newbie players like me into the fray. It really made me appreciate this game a whole lot better."

337,Celador,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aka_Celador/,17,,1,20.2,June,"27,",314,0,1,"Took me 20 hours to get 100% completion. Did not play multiplayer since everyone says that it sucks.While the game isn't that bad and i did enjoy the story - there are some questionable design choices that i didn't like. First of all the game is too easy - AI is dumb beyond any words and Lara is simply too much of a bullet sponge even on a hard difficulty. Then there are puzzles which are way too oversimplified so if you ever thought that Guardian of Light or Temple of Osiris are easy - this one doesn't require any effort or thought at all and the hardest puzzles usually involve a bit of timing and just one or two tries.Secondly i disliked how Lara's character was treated - it wasn't necessary to beat her, shoot her, stab her several times, almost rape her, beat her again, burn her, drag her through poop and then blood, drop her from heights over and over again, and again beat her. The whole thing just felt over the top, and at some point - laughably unrealistic. There's so much punishment a person can take and it went over that limit at least 10 times. It's also weird how her friends keep dying light fruit flies while she keeps moping around one moment and the next one she takes out 30 armed thugs with a bow and a grenade launcher. How about some consistency for a change?Also - what was the point of including other characters anyway? Just so the can die over the course of the game? Do i even know those people? Despite collecting their letters - i've no idea who they are and why should i care about them or why they sacrificed themselves like muppets over and over again.Lastly i am tired of how all ""action-adventure"" games have lately been focusing on climbing, using ropes, towers and collecting crap. You can be excused for confusing this game with Far Cry 3 since they share so much similarities - ♥♥♥♥♥♥ island, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ islanders, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ animals, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ collectibles, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ climbing. Im just so... soooooo over those mechanics. Please for the love of god - someone think of something else already! Not to mention that the whole hunting aspect felt completely unnecessary and arbitrary - you kill an animal once to feed Lara during story and... that's it - you don't get anything out of animals besides scrap and there's no point of wasting your time on ""hunting"" since you can get more than enough scrap from crates, collectibles and enemies anyway.Overall i had issues associating this game with Tomb Raider and it felt more like a generic shooter with climbing and collectibles than a new game or a reboot of the series. It almost felts like the developers had to cut corners with hunting, collecting and character development which felt really subpar while focusing on graphics, scenery and story which seemed really nice. Perhaps they should not have wasted the time on useless multiplayer and polished everything else instead?In the end i was about 50/50 split on voting it down or up, but despite the fact that this is a barely Tomb Raider game - i've decided to follow with nostalgia and recommend it. At the very least you get 15-20 hours of a decent story for a low price (if you get it on sale) and there are much worse games out there for that amount of money."

It was my first modern 3rd person game so the camera and aiming were difficult for me to get used to. I played with a controller. I did really enjoy the story and archaeology aspects. Hunting for all the treasures was really fun. The backstory in all the secret documents was interesting too. The multiplayer portion was totally unnecessary for this type of game. The achievements related to that were very tedious!

The puzzles are simpler. The trade off is a compelling story, that is fast paced and filled with action. I had a great time with this title. The Linux port that was done by Feral is also great. I had a couple times when the camera went wacky and I couldn't see Lara Croft. I restarted my system and it worked fine.There is more dialogue than previous titles. It still has a lot of the Tomb Raider spirit. There are puzzles. You do find secret tombs. It has the spooky feeling. The historical aspect is there, with just the right amount of other worldly shenanigans going on. In this game there is a level up progression system. I found it satisfying. I invested in the Bow/Pistol mostly, but by the end of the game I was able to fully invest in Melee comabat and the rifle as well. I prefer being able to invest in different skill trees. It allowed the game to remain fresh by experimenting with different styles of combat. You can hunt as well to get experience. (My wife however wouldn't let me kill the ""family of bunnies"").

There are still quick-time events throughout the game, but they never really feel out of place and allow you to feel somewhat like you're taking part in an action movie. There's still plenty of climbing to do as with the older TR games, but now there's also a focus on using equipment to gain access to certain areas, which can be rather frustrating if you don't know that certain equipment exists and will be obtained later. The only other gripe I had with this game was that you get about the island searching for relics which you keep (that makes sense, just like the old TR games), but then there are other things you search for like religious artifacts that you are supposed to destroy. If Indiana Jones said ""It belongs in a museum!"" to Lara Croft, she would answer ""No, it belongs in a fire!"" - which reminds me, be prepared to solve many puzzles by setting fire to EVERYTHING. It may sound as though I'm completely rubbishing this game, but in spite of all the above comments TR is immeasurably fun to play and well worth buying. It doesn't feel as punishing as the older TR games as you don't have to worry about your health so much (it has that Portal style health bar where things go red and it's bad, but you get to safety and the redness goes away. Phew!), which means you don't have to worry too much about taking a little fall damage but there are still plenty of chances to die and be impaled on a giant tree branch or something. Anyway, 9 out of 10, would raid."
346,Foxaika♥,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxaika/,8,,1,18.9,June,"24,",389,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a somewhat disappointing game. There's always the sense that it should be a bit more open, and that you should be freely roaming around the map. While it is somewhat the case that it is open world, don't mistake this for being that 100%. Throughout the campaign there are numerous quick time events that have you mashing one key or another in order to do an action. This is somewhat disappointing, though I personally do not believe that it completely destroys the experience. The gameplay is rather fun, and the controls work well using keyboard and mouse. A controller is not necessary unless you prefer that input method. I personally prefered keyboard and mouse because it allowed me to have better aim. Once again though, this is a completely personally choice. The game works well regardless. Visually the game is gorgeous. The character models are well-designed, and the island vistas are a sight to behold. From the shores of the beach to the ruined temples, every part of the game is attractive to the eye(well, except the parts that are supposed to be grotesque). There are not any game-breaking or glaring flaws in the game graphically that I can see. As far as the story goes, I won't spoil anything, but it is rather entertaining. It's a solidly written story that has some nice emotional moments and well-witten characters. I personally found nothing to be wrong with the way the story was written, and I can't see anyone else having any major complaints.Despite the fact that the game does not feel as open world as one would think it would be, I still had a lot of fun playing thorugh Tomb Raider. It's the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played, and I am not looking forward to playing the others."

Choice of weapons is limited compared to the next two entries in the trilogy but enough to keep it interesting.The standout feature of this game is the attention to story elements.

I would consider myself a passing fan of Tomb Raider as a series, and to be honest, I groaned inwardly when the “gritty reboot” was announced. I never intended to play it at all, but ended up impulse buying it over this past summer sale  -- and I’m so glad I did.I found the technicals of this game to be amazing. It’s incredibly well-built, and the actual gameplay (in terms of how the character controls) seems nearly flawless. I liked all the weapons, but the bow is especially versatile and fun to bring into battle. The enemy AI often leaves a lot to be desired - the enemies are mostly just really stupid - but I don’t think I could claim to have played any games that do it better. Maybe I’m just sheltered. In any case, I was never bored or disappointed by the frequent gunfights, although they weren’t always appropriately challenging. I liked going for the stealth approach, too - it was surprising how well stealth worked at times, though at other times, frustrating how easy it was to remain undetected (again, lame AI).The environment design and exploration aspects are really great as well. Exploring and collecting rarely felt like a chore, which was a little surprising considering just how much there is to collect. (I did end up getting the last Previous Inhabitants flag and the last Sun Killer ornament only after looking up their locations in a guide. The flag, in particular, felt really cheaply hidden compared to all of the other challenges in the game.)From an artistic standpoint, the environments are immersive and believable. Beautiful graphics and excellent sound design abound in this game. Quite early on, Lara was standing in a rainstorm with lightning flashes and thunder (I had headphones on), and I was just blown away by the distinct feeling of actually  in that virtual world. The darkness and detail in the various tombs made me feel legitimately eerie and claustrophobic in quite a few instances. The action-oriented set pieces, while silly in terms of gameplay, were appropriately impressive. I particularly liked the escape from the  after rescuing .Looking back over last year’s Tomb Raider OT, I’ve read complaints about the lack of tombs/puzzles, the cliche characters, and the flat story. I’ll address those objections below:First, I understand the issues with the tombs. Each one (of maybe 7 optional tombs, and 2-3 required ones) is basically a single-room puzzle that I was able to solve as easily as if I were playing with a baby’s shape sorter. At the same time, I believe that a high quantity of challenging (or time-consuming) puzzles really tends to kill the replay value of a game, because who wants to go through the motions of redoing puzzles that they’ve already solved in a previous run? Boring. So I’m of two opinions about the whole thing, but sort of favoring the way this reboot treats its tombs - short and simple. I do wish there had been more of them, in any case. My favorite tomb in the game? That would have to be the Flooded Vault.Second, yeah - when viewed objectively, the story wasn’t exceptional, and the characters were mostly nothing more than stereotypical devices to deliver predictable plot points. But in the context of being the Tomb Raider origin story, I think it served its purpose just fine, with no bigger problems than any other video game story. That’s not to say it gets a total pass, just that the criticisms were way overblown. One endgame event that I found pretty unbelievable was Whitman’s . I mean, I know the guy was , but do you really expect me to believe that he spent all that time  (his words) and never once overheard those thugs talking about how ? They wouldn’t shut up about it whenever Lara was sneaking around, I know.Anyway, the one major disappointment with Tomb Raider in my mind ended up being . All the same, I consider that a small objection in the grand scheme of the game as a whole, and I did appreciate the  at the end there.My ultimate conclusion? If this reboot is going to be the new standard for Tomb Raider games, I don’t need the old standard anymore. I’m sure the classics will still be fun and all, but the notion of a Tomb Raider whose content is predominantly puzzle-oriented is an idea that’s ready for retirement. I’ve also decided that Attitude Lara was a fine enough concept back in the ‘90s, when every new mascot was an attitude mascot, but Survivor Lara is a lot more believable as a character - and quite honestly, much easier to build a story around, if we’re still going for stories in games these days (I don’t consider them necessary, but whatever).Greatly looking forward to the sequel."

But as the game progressed it became clear that Tomb Raider was not a mere carbon copy offering a more linear story, a much more subtle RPG framework, and trademark gameplay elements from the early Tomb Raider and Prince of Persia games.The evolutionary story of Lara Croft is without a doubt the highlight of the game and is superbly presented, however it's hard not to give praise to the amazing graphics as well showcasing some incredible shadows, lighting, and fire effects. I seriously could not stop playing this game once I started, taking only 2 days to complete my 15 hour campaign--it was just that good.Some of the less stellar aspects of the game include the RPG skills. While they were helpful in moving the evolution of Lara Croft along, they really didn't feel all that unique or useful and in many cases I was forced to spend points on useless skills simply to unlock the next tier. The weapons, other than the bow, were lackluster and the upgrades just felt common. I also don't like interactive cutscenes in video games, and while this latest Tomb Raider hasn't changed my position, this is the best implementation I have seen so far.Overall, Tomb Raider turned out to be a highly enjoyable adventure giving a much need reboot to this franchise. Although if you're looking for that dual wielding Barbie badass, keep on looking."

If you've played and liked Assassin's Creed or Uncharted, you will feel right at home. The QTEs are NOT fun, but fortunately there are almost none after the first 3rd of the game. Multiplayer is less fun this far out, but there are some groups of achievement hunters still playing it.Technically, this game still looks brilliant even in 2020. Was able to run it on an i5-6500 paired with a GTX 750ti (lowered settings), and am now able to get above 100 FPS (1080p display) with almost everything on Ultra, running on an i7-7700k and an RTX 2070 super. This game did NOT like overclocked GPUs, tried OCing my 1060 6gb and got CTDs everywhere. Also, multiple articles say that the hair physics (which do look great), are better on AMD cards.

I played 1,2 and 3 and found them fairly mediocre to be honest. I then paid no attention to the series at all until 2013 when the commercial's for the reboot started hitting tv. The commercial was enough to peak my interest as it look alot more realistic and dark. I decided to take the plunge when it came out and I was not dissapointed. I am looking forward to ROTT very much.The story and characters are very good. Starts of very realistic and gritty, almost like a survival/thriller start. The story does develop more into fantasty and mystacism but its done in such a way that its enjoyable and is done right. The gunplay is fun and the ability to upgrade weapons and craft things is a really nice touch. The puzzles in tomb's and amount of collectables is great fun if you like me love collecting and 100% things.The Multiplayer is an odd one. I'm sure some people will absolutley love it but to me it seems unnecessary, the same way that other great single player games recieved what seems like a ""forced"" multiplayer mode for the sake of it being there. Games like Batman Arkham Origins and to an extent Max Payne 3. The MP can provide some fun, for me it was about an hour then I realised it was more of a chore than fun. So I grinded out the MP achievments and never went back.A truly fantastic title with a meh MP (Hence why it didnt make it back to ROTT), I am glad I overcame my doubt and went for it. This is one of the best reboots I have seen in a long time and would recommend it to anyone."

Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?Tomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island. To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.Now I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider. The story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.The gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs. The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too. Graphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played.  Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.The optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy. Boss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.The entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it. In the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved.

This game does not deserve the ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" Score it gets and it baffles me that it somehow tricked anyone into believing it was good. The writing in this game is absolutely mediocre, it fails to make you care about any single character death, justifies poorly every single scene, and completely wastes all the effort that was put into making this game as cinematic as possible. And this effort into making the game cinematic then DETRACTS from the game when you're playing it, because late game really wants to be a blockbuster action movie, so it forces waves of the same goons you've been fighting throughout the game on you, no longer giving you the stealth option that was actually the fun part in the early game, because stealth FELT like Lara was a person that could die, and not a supersoldier on meth gunning throughout Generic Game Setting Far Cry Did Better, Japan. Also, Boss Battles Bad, because cinematics get in the way of gameplay, and then go away at the moments that should make the fight satisfying. I have so much more to complain about, but there is one thing that rings true on all the positive reviews this game had:  “A master class in AAA game development.”– CraveOnlineThis game has every sin in the book for AAA game development, it may trick you into thinking it's good because it's pretty, but it's devoid of a soul and you can spend your money elsewhere for a better use of your time."

I've not played the previous games but I absolutely loved all the characters and the story arch. The Stormguard were cool as hell, Lara gets a really cool start to her character arch and development and it's a reasonable one too. I mean it implies that she's a college student by the time this journey starts so it makes sense that this is shown to be a traumatic experience in Rise of the Tomb Raider. And her distress over this game, all the way til Shadow of the Tomb Raider, was really well handled.The character gets cooler, and even scarier over the course of the events of all the games and it's so interesting and genuinely fun to watch it happen. I love being part of that. TL;DR if you wanna make yourself enjoy something just for the hell of it I recommend it, and I genuinely believe they did a good job and the story was well done."
391,Chip Cheezum,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chipcheezum/,7,,1,20.8,November,"30,",503,0,1,"Tomb Raider is one of those gritty and realistic reboots you see a lot of these days, but at least this one manages to be pretty decent. The developers basically took the gameplay of Uncharted and slammed it into a gameworld designed like Arkham Asylum's. I felt the game had a nice feel and weight to both the platforming and the combat, and the automatic cover-system actually made the game feel pretty smooth. The story of the game is pretty blah and the absurdly brutal QTE deaths in the game are kind of gross and didn't really do anything to enhance the game.My other main complaint is that this game focuses too much on the combat. While the combat felt good, I would have preferred more platforming and some puzzles in, you know, actual tombs. The game does have some single-room secret tombs in the game, but they all feel kind of hollow because the game telegraphs these ""secret"" areas mega-hard and it kind of ruins any sense of discovery you could get from finding them yourself. Damn you, modern gaming!!Overall, though, the game is decent and lasts around 11 - 14 hours. I'd say it's worth it when it's on sale."

Well in comparison to the over-produced Angelina Jolie debacles, any competently produced movie offering would look favorable but what I'm trying to say is that Tomb Raider is one of those AAA games that are incredibly well-made but without any hooks that would constitute a must-buy. As gripping as Story Mode gets, from a game design standpoint you're on a linear path with QTE challenges, scripted non-repeatable enemy encounters and a few puzzles so easily solved they're barely worth mentioning. It's an interactive movie where you are the hero.You are Lara Croft and you are fighting for your survival. You can't actually starve to death or catch your death in cold and you regenerate from bullet wounds after a short period of time so in this case ""survival"" means tons of enemies out to get you and all you have are a bow and arrow. And a pistol. And an axe, a combat shotgun and a machine gun. Kinda undermines the whole point, really. Combat is actually the bees-knees with flawless controls in a cover-and-shoot environment against determined foes out to plant a machete into your skull. Your melee options are rather lacking, leading to tense gameplay where one fights desperately for every inch of personal space against maniacs with firebombs trying to flush you out from cover.I guess the ""hook"" of this game is that it's a Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider fans will buy this product sight unseen and call it a shining beacon in the franchise. That's fair, but what about the rest of us? Well if you're like me and you barely touched the series, Tomb Raider is certainly more accessible than any of the previous Playstation installments. It's downright easy, even. The reboot mixes realism and fantasy in equal measures so as to build genuine dread at your desperate plight while still being respectful to the setting established throughout previous Tomb Raider titles.Needless to say, Tomb Raider multiplayer is dead in 2016. I tried it, had a nice 15 minute conversation in the lobby then wrote that part of the game off. I cannot recommend this game at full price but I couldn't endorse simply watching a Let's Play either. And because story is such a central part of the product, every scene that you witness prior to play takes away some of the value from your purchase. Price it as you would a blockbuster, with popcorn. I'd like to thank Tonton Mori for the giveaway as I finished this during a long three day weekend and I cannot say that I regret the experience.Finally, a word needs to be said about the gruesome death scenes. Those squeamish over violence against women should probably give this title a pass.  is required viewing for anyone thinking about purchasing this game."

She is isolated from her crew and faces off against hundreds of foes wishing her harm. Players are tasked to shoot, scale, and zipline their way off the island. Story/CharactersSo an ancient city, long since lost, is the goal of the expedition. Others have shipwrecked on the same island and become part of a cult that doesn't take kindly to those that oppose them. That's pretty much it for the story. Croft is on her first big expedition and wasn't expecting to take on hordes of enemies in bloody gun battles. The game does try to establish that the mass amounts of killing are not to lara's tastes, but a line about not liking how easy it is to kill someone doesn't stack up well against the pile of bodies in her wake. This is particularly noticeable with brutal finishes (though Lara can receive these gruesome deaths as well). She gets seperated from her crew mates at the start and spends much of the game on her own. This is a bit of an issue in that the player never really learns much about her friends and colleagues so it's tough to really care about any of them. GameplayThe game has a heavy dose of 3rd person shooting with some parkour and zip lines to get about. Lara starts off with a bow, but picks up a handful of other weapons along the way. Killing enemies and completing challenges gives experience towards skill points to upgrade lara while salvaged parts from looting can buy upgrades for weapons. While the game hints at a stealth approach (having a bow, and guards calling in reinforcements) because killing enemies grants experience, it compels the player to be loud. There is also a dodge mechanic were lara shuffles on the ground, though back to back activates cause her to roll. It feels pretty clunky and isn't always effective at reducing enemy accuracy. I didn't find the combat overly difficult (though the AI is often aggressive and wall hacks) so players won't get frustrated getting stuck in the same combat repeatedly, but those looking for a more challenging game should look elsewhere. When not in combat, Lara can zipline and scale about the various regions. These skills are also used for optional crypts that require some puzzle solving. There are fires that allow quick traveling, sometimes. It's actually odd that all the fires don't allow fast travel. Players only backtrack to find collectables, and since lara can't run, it becomes a chore trying to make one way through the same zipline fields or scaling walls to complete collections. Lara also has detective (i guess, archeologist) vision that causes intractable elements to flash gold.Misc.The various areas of the map are pretty well designed. It's easy to know where the game wants the player to go, but it disguises the pathway to make it not feel like walking down a long corridor. I didn't find the music noticeable (maybe had volume to low) but it also wasn't annoying. I didn't experience any crashes and only a few minor bugs.OverallTomb Raider is a competently made game. There aren't really any highs, but it doesn't have a lot of lows either. I don't think players miss anything special if they don't play this game, but it won't make you rage or hate yourself for playing it."

400,Sivarg ∞,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/,11,,1,25.0,August,"19,","1,018",0,1,"Tomb Raider was released in 2013 by Square Enix and developed by Crystal Dynamics, an action-adventure game with light puzzles. Story is focused on how Lara Croft became the tomb raider she is so famous about in the previous games of the series.The story focuses on Lara Croft in her young days on an expedition by ship to the ""Dragon's Triangle"", which the island Yamatai is located. The Triangle in the Pacific Ocean, south of Japan, known for its violent storms and countless missing ships in the area. As you imagined, Lara and her crew on the ship Endurance, find themselves becoming yet another victim to the Triangle's storm mayhem and strand on the island. But it's quickly discovered that not everything is what it seems, and the island is inhabited by hostile shipwreck survivors, aswell as supernatural weather phenomenon's. The story centers around these events from the very start, to the very end, and it is done pretty well. The story is also one of the first used in a game that I am aware of. The story does at times seem obvious, but overall it is quite good.The gameplay is rather easy to get into, and feels smooth, with only minor character turning problems, especially in close quarter area's. When walking over an edge, most times, Lara will grab onto it rather than fall down. This is a 75% case though, I have tried a few times where she simply fell to her doom.You always play in thirdperson.When jumping over a free-fall spot and aiming towards a walkable log or plank, you can clearly feel the game force Lara somehow faster towards the thin walkable object, when clearly you could see you wouldn't have made the jump in time. This seems to happen no matter how hard you try to jump to the side of the object and forcefully try to suicide. The game simply forces you onto the object for Lara to stand in a balancing stance.When climbing ropes or walls with your axe, it is done very quickly, making you wonder where Lara gets all the energy from. Sure, she is fit, but there's no way she can climb or move that fast. Obviously this is done for the player's benefit, and not sitting for a minute of rope climbing.Lara can do a low dodge, followed by a second one in the form of a roll, avoiding all current sword swings etc, this doesn't count for bullets though. Instead you are forced to find cover and wait for the blackened screen to turn into a normally coloured one again, indicating your health is low. There are no health pickups. When gaining a skill, you can dodge and attack enemies, either killing them or stabbing them in the knee region with an arrow. This is done by a quick played scene and animation of Lara and the hostile, in which you must then be quick to press a key, which is mainly E or F.Other scene's Lara is controlled by the computer as you must press certain keys to avoid being killed, examples being rockslides, losing grip after a jump, close fights or other various scenario's with nature or objects.If you wish to be in full control of your character at all times, this isn't the game for you.The aiming system is decent, and you're given a focus system to highlight certain objects or waypoints to further the game. This can be everything from lootable crates, to challenge items/things, climable walls, ropes you can use and waypoints. Later on in the game a skill will provide better focus for you to find items easier.You're given a melee weapon in the form of a mountain climbing axe, the striking animations perhaps abit quick in my opinion, but overall showcase Lara as desperate when fighting close quarter against hostiles.Throughtout the game you unlock access to more weapons over time, though they aren't many.Overall they are mainly four range weapons, the fifth being the melee axe.They are as followed: Pistol, shotgun, smg/assault rifle and bow with arrows.All of these, even the axe, can be upgraded throughout the game by visiting campsites that you discover and using scrap metal parts that you loot from crates, enemies and animals (with a skill, bones).As stated, the smg can be upgraded to give you an assault rifle (ak-47) instead, which seems abit unrealistic.There are plenty of upgrades to be unlocked, and most of them change the appearance of your weapon.When aiming with either of the weapons, you are zoomed in over Lara's shoulder.Throughout the game you pass several optional tombs that can be explored. Most of them when entering, you are forced to go slowly with Lara, while having a lit torch, even being forced to light the torch at the start. Sometimes this is a dragging experience and isn't for the action-craving players. You will never encounter enemies in optional tombs, instead you will encounter puzzles.Puzzles aren't difficult to figure out, even Portal puzzles are harder, but should you be confused what to do, open steam browser and look up video's on youtube. Same goes for challenges and relics, all can be found by the help of youtube video guides.The puzzles range from bringing an object to a place at the right moment to get to the end of the tomb, to throwing objects up onto an makeshift elevator to opening up window shutters that keep howling storm wind at bay, and using it at a correct timing to reach the tomb end.Each tomb has a campsite that you can use for upgrades and skills, but you can't oddly enough fast travel, forced to go out the slow process that you came in with from the start of the tomb.When reaching the end, you are rewarded with gear parts, sometimes relics, or a map that will reveal all the collectibles in a zone that the tomb is located in. They also reward EXP.Most zones have challenges, mainly destroyable things. They range from banners you must burn, to forest mushroom caps that you can (presumably) eat and destroyable tribal fetishes among others.All of these contribute towards the game's progression procent aswell as achievements, and award EXP too.Relics can be found in each zone, having atleast 3-5 in each one. They are almost always different, having a zone theme going along them, or a set. For an instance, a village might have old handmade fans, or theater masks as a set. Other relic theme's are WWII-era items, like dogtags. All of these relics are always in chests, when opened, appear close up with Lara saying something about their history, some of them being able to be examined closer and more information will be revealed by Lara. You can never use these items ingame and serve only as items to be found. There are even modern day familiy ""heirlooms"" among the relic theme's and sets.You can gain EXP from killing any type of animals and enemies, completing challenges and finding relics aswell as tombs.Full EXP levels gain you a point to use in skills, which you can access when sitting at a campsite. There are three different categories of skills, some unlockable only after progressing in the game.All affect gameplay in some way, including better hunting wildlife abilities, to attacking hostiles and performing finishers on them and last but not least, your inventory, upgrading yourself to carry more ammo etc.As Lara, you interact alot through cutscene's with other survivors aswell as enemies, and minimal interaction in playmode with friendly characters. This serves as a stand-next-to and press a key to interact with them.There aren't alot of outstanding or noticeable characters, they are more down on earth and the game maintains this well thoughout the story progression.The characters are quite detailed, just as the gameworld. Nicely rendered, and looking realistic. If you are a sucker for character details, this game is a must."

Very nice animations overall, and the gunplay is very satisfying for such a genre. Kudos to the devs!I discovered the game only now (2021) but considering that it's actually from 2013, I must say I am impressed. The engine performs very well, and deliver some very nice environments and effects. Lighting, FX, textures are all excellent for me. And it scales quite well to 4K.I actually appreciated the fact that the reboot tried to move away from the bimbo akimbo style, and actually tries to shape the story of how Lara became who she is. You will actually see her grow through the events and challenges, and the overall story is very well delivered with little to no down-time. Bravo!For the hunters out there, this one will be troublesome due to the online ones. Very hard to get people online unless you get a group of hunters. And 2 will require hours of grinding.

408,thetargos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetargos/,8,,1,121.4,October,"21,",480,0,1,"I absolutely love this game, I know for many it is not in the spirit of the classic TR games, but it serves to show how she became to be the hardened combatant we saw in the previous installments of the games. Indeed it is not in the spirit of classic TR games.However, the story protrayed in the game is quite rich and enthralling. Sure many of the situations are ""very unlikely"" and unblievable, but so were the classic games. At any rate, there is really good writing in the form of the journals and the artifacts you can collect. While it is indeed not the most polished in this regard (Naughty dog has done a superb job with the Uncharted series), it is indeed very intersting.To some the combat aspect of the game puts them off, and I can relate to that, however given the setting of this particular game it makes sense, and it also offers plenty of huge areas to explore and much platforming. While clearing areas indeed feels like a chore, it indeed is. But it is supposed to be that way, is part of how the game ""forces you"" to explore if you want to get all tid bits of information and artifacts, but that is not required to advance the game. These parts are suposed to be that way, and exploring tombs reveal the bulk of the map elements, though not all.In regards to the implementation, since I have only played the native Linux version of the game, it does have its flaws, especially in large areas, where the performance tanks regardless of the machine you have, as long as it is above the requirementes, you will see low performance in some areas. Not a killer as such, especially since high framerates are not required to actually enjoy the game, it does incur in visual inconsistency of very fluid gameplay to a stutter fest, especially when looking at wide areas in the game (Mountain Village, Shanty Town, etc). Personally it is not such a big deal for the enjoyment of the game, but I know to some FPS freaks is reason enough to put down the game.All in all, I like it for what it is, a Tomb Raider adventure, I do not like much that there are not many tombs in the game, though, but subjectively speaking is a good game."

Tomb Raider is a reboot of the classic series  that started in the 90s. This one, thought, is fairly different than what you'd experience in the original one. Tomb Raider (2013) has you fighting for your life as you search for a way off a baddy-filled island. On your adventure, you'll have to find and even rescue some of your buddies. The overall story leaves coming back for more and never really being bored with its twists and turns. The survival aspect is a little different from what we get from other Tomb Raider games, but it definitely is refreshing and well done. The characters in the game thought are a little flat and cliche. One problem with the characters is that Lara is such a great and well developed character that the others fall flat and aren't super memorable. Lara does go through a journey that changes her and makes for a really great story though, which makes up for it. Remember when I said that this was a baddy filled island? Well, I wasn't lying, nothing there really wants you there. There are an army of soldiers that are also on that island, and they're not a fan of Lara. There are different enemy types, some are heavy brutes that can take their share of bullets and arrows, there are also your standard assualt rifle dudes, shotgun punks, some machine gun nerds, some explosive throwing jerks (They've got molotovs too), and some pretty cool bowmen.  Along with those dudes, you'll also find some wolves on the island from time to time, which of course want you there as much as the soldiers do.The gunplay isn't something super new, but it is still satisfying and fairly easy. You eventually gather a fair arsenal of weapons, which you can upgrade by salvaging stuff and upgrading them at campfires. There's an assualt rifle, a bow, a pistol, and a shotgun. The bow, in my personal opinion, is the most fun weapon in the game. Throughout the game, you'll stumble upon weapons parts that allow you to build better versions of the weapon you have, once you have all of the pieces. The upgrades availible to you for weapons are pretty useful and some add some fun features. As well as the ablilty to upgrade weapons, you have the ability to up Lara's skills (such as combat, salvaging, etc). The game also gives you a climbing tool, which comes in handy for climbing cliffs and stuff of that nature. The game also has ziplines that are pretty awesome to ride. Being that this is Tomb Raider, there are also some tombs to explore and they are worth the trip. Also there are, of course, puzzles. None of the puzzles are that hard to solve, but they do provide for some fun gameplay. Overall, this game is fairly easy on normal difficulty, even the boss is easy. This can be a good thing though, if you're worried about getting stuck on a difficult moment. The game also has a solution for getting stuck and not knowing where to go. It has a sort of 'detective vision' that shows you where to go. The graphics in this game are easily some of the best to come out of 2013. There is some really beautiful scenery in this game! The player model and npcs look great as well, you can tell that they weren't messing around when they made this. One thing that I really liked is that they de-objectified Lara in this game. Lara is a bad*** character and definitely doesn't need to be objectified. In all, this game is a fantastic edition to the Tomb Raider franchise. The story has some intense moments where you'll be on the edge of your seat, it's got great voice acting, a pretty kickin' story, amazing set pieces, great combat, and more! Also, if you're looking for a game with an Uncharted feel, this is definitely what you're looking for. In the end, this game is definitely worth giving a shot, even at full retail price!"
416,RiddleMe,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063340786/,7,,1,51.5,April,"28,",115,1,1,"THIS is how you modernize a game.  To give some back story, I grew up on the old Tomb Raiders, followed through Underworld, and adored them all.  When I heard the series was being rebooted, and we'd be visiting Lara Croft's origins, I immediately dismissed it.  And I won't lie, when I heard negative things about the game, I was happy to hear that my choice was ""on the right.""  Fast forward to five days ago when I stumbled upon a video including this game, and my interest was piqued.  Now at the wonderful price of $20, and on a recommendation of a friend, I decided to give this ""terrible game"" (words I had previously used) a shot.  I was horribly, horribly wrong; and ignorance is no excuse.  The game is incredible, the setting, the atmosphere, the entire plot.  ""Reboot"" typically involves negative connotations, the largest of which typically means sucking out the soul of what had made the original series great; because in order to get to the point of rebooting, the developers typically have to have lost their way.  But, this is not the case here.  Though modernized, and starting with a new story, this game sticks with great platforming, amazing set pieces, collectibles, and a wonderful historical/supernatural story.  All the elements that had made the original great.  All that has been changed here is how it is presented.  With a modern open world island, that has details that are off the charts.  I've finished the story now, but I can tell you I will be diving back in promptly to find all the collectibles and details I missed.  I was wrong:  A reboot can be for the better, and have a positive effect.  I hope any others who thought as I once did listen, and give this game a proper chance.  I don't regret it in the slightest, and hopefully neither will you.  And now, after having despised this game when it came out, I look forward to it's sequel with bated breath.  Because if they can put as much effort into the next one, this series has got a hell of a future."

Players take control of the series lead character Lara Croft. The game uses an interconnected hub-and-spoke model that combines action-adventure, exploration, and survival mechanics. Players can traverse between the camps and across the island using footpaths, improvised or already-available ziplines and climbable tracks. Many of the players moves are carried over from the previous games created by Crystal Dynamics, with some tweaks added.players having the ability to free-aim Lara's bow and the guns she salvages, engage in close-quarter combat and perform stealth kills. Players can also use Survival Instinct, an ability in which enemies, collectables and objects pivotal to environmental puzzles will be highlighted for players.Players progress through the game, they earn experience points from performing certain actions and completing in-game challenges linked with hunting, exploring and combat: this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways, such as giving her more storage capacity for arrows and ammunition. Players can also upgrade and customize weapons using salvage collected across the island. There is also a character progression mechanic in the game: better items, weapons and equipment are gained as players progress, though the appearance of most of these items is closely linked to events in the story. In addition to the main story, players can complete multiple side quests, explore the island, revisit locations, and search for challenge tombs.What a mindblowing journey! This is the best TR game i've played so far! The developers have really outdone themselves with how well this game is displayed, all the way to the littlest detail. I've tried to find a fault in this game but nothing jumped out at me which is exactly what I was hoping for. Tomb Raider really takes you on a adventure and i'm so glad that there's another two to play! If you can get this on sale then I wouldn't hesitate on getting this, even on full sale I would buy this. A truely amazing masterpiece.Side note: The muliplayer is dead but that's to be expected for a 2013 game.No one leaves the Dragon's Triangle.■■■■■■■■■■ 10 / 10Review to Rise of The Tomb Raider: Review to Shadow of the Tomb Raider:"
421,Dark Blue Monkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nww02/,7,1,1,22.0,April,"17,","1,340",0,1,"As an old-school fan of the original Tomb Raiders, and having seen the utter hash that some producers have made of 'reboots' that cover 'origin stories', I was less than enthusiastic when this came out.   I hoped beyond hope that they didn't ruin it with mushy nonsense that tried to mesh with the ""kiddy Lara"" bits of Chronicles, which were fun at the time, but if treated seriously nowadays would have been a bit tripe.Well, my fears were for nothing.  This game is brilliant.  Although it takes a few subtly liberties with Lara's origins, given the stuff in the aforementioned TR:Chronicles, this game is very very well executed.  It tells the tale of graduate student Lara, possibly doing a post-doctoral thesis which involves researching an ancient lost Japanese culture somewhere in an area which is the pacific analogue of the Bermuda Triangle.  The obvious happens, and Lara and the crew are trapped on the island.  Unfortunately the inhabitants have gone mad because they can't escape the island, and have turned to worshipping a long-dead Sun Goddess who allegedly had mastery over the weather.  The only problem is that something is still screwy with the weather today.. Did the sun goddess just milk the inhabitants' superstitions, did she have something that helped her control the weather, or was she magical in some way?  Given that she's holed up in some ancient tombs, there's only one way to find out... RAID THOSE TOMBS!!!!!!The graphics in the game are excellent given the game's age.  Textures are bright and sharp, water is slick, mist and fog has a real depth to it, and the changes in the weather are just amazingly well handled.  As you progress through the island, you go from tropical paradise to icy windy peaks, and all the way, the soundscape and graphics really portray the environment.  Standing in the bogs, listening to the insects and frogs croaking around you in surround sound is just amazing.  As soon as you get to the first windy area, surround sound makes you extremely nervous, coupled with the camera shake... Everything feels like you're going to blow away...The music, sounds and voice acting are all top notch.   The characters all portray their feelings very well, and the body animation is also extremely good.  Interacting with the NPCs feels natural and solid, although there were a few times I'd have chosen a different thing to say, making the conversation feel like it avoids addressing an important point...    Lara's animation as she runs, jumps, dives and fights are all excellent.  In one area I strayed too close to a wall and as Lara was running she held her hand out to stroke the wall in a very lifelike way.  That small piece of detail was really impressive.The loading times are very short compared to some other games.    Despite the areas feeling open and large, the game loads each area surprisingly quickly, so you're not staring at a progress bar or the tedious loading screen hints for too long.The choice of weapons is VERY pleasing. Keeping it to a core four weapons, with upgrade options makes for more fluid gameplay, and you can switch out the weapons to suit your situation very easily.    The upgrades all materially improve the combat too, and by the end you're switching weps, battling like a real brawler with almost no effort.The only thing I didn't like were the QTEs, especially the special 'F' attacks when a scripted enemy goes into slowmo.     You're in the heat of battle, pressing keys, switching weps, ducking, feinting, shooting when all of a sudden.. myoww, the game goes slowmo and ""PRESS F!"" appears.. You press F, but instantly die....   The game wants you to wait for some reason for a circle to get to just the right size to press the F. Too late or too soon, and you die.  It's REALLY annoying, and there's no need for it, really.   Why devs persist in putting QTEs in is utterly beyond me.  Someone in a meeting must say ""Hey, just when the player's frantically fighting, less flash up keys for them to press, then suddenly change it so that if they actually DO press the key, they die! haha! That'll be exciting for them!"".. No. No it isn't.  Please stop!Other than that, the whole game is great.  100%ing it is tricky because some of the collectibles and challenges require scouring really large areas for something that's hidden behind a tree, or down a hole.  It's possible, but once you've finished, just go for a walkthrough guide if you want to 100% it.Excellent game, well recommended!"

Bought this game while being on 85% sale and since I am so bored and wanting to try out new games, I gave it a shot. I haven't been also into the Tomb Raider games. This is my first game of the series.The gameplay is just right up my alley, gun blazing and beating the ♥♥♥♥ out of Mathias' goons, artifact hunting, heck even Tomb Raiding! (haha, get it? c-cuz.. the game title- okay whatever.)  Story is intriguing, and since its based off the Japanese History of Yamatai. Graphically, it's fine. I mean its a game from 2013, duh.

Very often there are explosions everywhere, but you miraculously survive. Probably hundreds of instances where something happens at the last second that saves you. Boring characters with no personality. Can't immerse myself into the game because there are cutscenes every 3-5 mins.Gameplay-wise, there are a lot of instances where I felt game was just insulting your intelligence, by providing tips for absolutely everything. Enemies' AI is awful even on hardest difficulty. I think I didn't die to them even once.Graphics are pretty nice even from today's standpoint, so is audio.I do not understand how can this have a 95 % rating.

Speaking of history... it hooks you up and makes you want to keep playing. It is also very varied; you can hunt, search for treasures, make climbs, solve puzzles and assault tombs. All this to improve your weapons, level up, advance the plot. All this allows you to complete the game 100% and with it unlock incredible and exclusive images of the game.The gameplay is very good; it is very easy to handle. In each mission you can choose different modes to do the mission/task; these modes are: stealth or normal. In the multiplayer section... We will be able to meet Lara and the other characters; that there are some that you will have to pay to use it, that is a dlc. Currently being an ""old"" game there are not so many people connected and that makes it difficult to find a quick game. With nothing else to add I enjoyed playing this game; I even played it on my PS4 when it came out. If you like adventure games you should at least give it a try, it’s worth it.Find more reviews in:"

I would like to notice, that it has completely redesigned gameplay, which includes many features, ranging from huge locations that you can return to, to dynamic battles.The game is quite well optimized, has a pleasant soundtrack, and a good story (albeit primitive in places). Also, the game brightens up the multiplayer, which 8 years later even has online. I recommend the game, and pretty sure, that it's a great continuation of a great franchise."

AWESOME!Playing this reminded me of why I have stayed with this series since the beginning.  The story was perfect! It's an origin story like the details above say. You really do get the feel of her starting out as a vulnerable, self doubter and by the end you see her as the confident, no fear character you know her to be from all the other games.The game visually has a lot of darkness to it, in lighting and atmosphere.  It's the grittiest Tomb Raider I've ever played.  Without spoiling anything there is a reason you learn later on in the game why the environments are so dreary in parts.I've always been a fan of the series, but there is always one part in every one of the games that a timed sequence has driven me nuts.  Luckily there are some challenging timed sequences in this, however they pretty much perfected the checkpoint saves at all the right intervals! In other words if you die, you don't have to repeat a whole bunch of stuff all over again.. it's just a tiny bit.  Which is great for short of patience type people like myself, you won't lose your mind.There are some stuff I did have to look up since I wasn't sure how to get where, thanks to Stella's walkthrough site she saves the day!A really great thing is the inventory, menu system.  Spending skill pts is a breeze, and earning them as well.  The map tracking is so helpful!!! I'm so glad they have this map tracking, because without spoiling it too much.. if you are looking for a specific collectable you can track it in blue, then use this special vision mode that makes it light up like a beacon.  This feature saves you from a massive headache of wandering aimlessly around trying to get all the collectibles!Say you forgot some collectibles in one camp.. NO problem they have a real handy fast tracking back and forth between camps.  Say you finish the whole game and still didn't find all the collectibles... NO problem at the end of the game you are given the choice to continue if you want to find them all, or just wander around and explore.I think the Devs really put a lot of thought and care into this game.  I really enjoyed it.**The only negatives that I remember are:  Sometimes the voice actors would call her Laura one minute then Lara the next... first time I heard this error in this entire series.One other thing the camera angles in 1 or 2 of the timed sequence was a bit off which usually got me killed, however thankfully the improved checkpoint save intervals it wasn't that big of a deal to repeat.The game didn't like it too much if I was alt tabbing to much.  I could get away with a couple of times but I'd eventually crash it. Most games are like this though..."

Usually I split review into good an bad, but almost everything in this game has good and bad points. For context I played bits of Tomb Raider on PS1 a long time ago but can't really remember much of it. - It's like this game doesn't know what it wants to be. At the beginning it plays like a TellTale game but without the choices, then they have a tutorial on hunting animals and it seems like maybe it's a bit of a survival game... except then you never have to hunt an animal or worry about food again ever for the rest of the game. Then it becomes clear it's really a standard shooter with puzzles in between fights- They appear to offer you the option of stealth for  parts of the game, but  so it's very hard to do successfully and you'd just keep restarting and frustrating yourself if you insisted on stealth. The only times the stealth was easy, involved merely waiting for NPCs to finish their conversation and walk away.- The combat is surprisingly decent, but again there's no cover button, it relies on the game automatically detecting you being near cover and making Lara duck, which is inconsistent- The weapon customisation system is reasonable, but it's the type where by the end of the game you have almost all possible options, rather than making you pick and choose- It's nice that there's puzzles, but most of the time the puzzles just didn't excite me or make me feel cool for figuring them out; it's no Portal. The difficulty of them is pretty good, not easy but I only needed to look up a walkthrough for one in the entire game.- Graphics are all fine and good- Lara's accent is not good, particularly when she says """", which she says a lot.- They have all this optional collectables stuff but I just had zero interest in it. Same with the 'tombs', I did two optional ones but... eh.- Not a huge fan of the story, mainly that it relies entirely on the supernatural and doesn't have some secret 'logical' reason for everything.- After the first hour I guess I just felt like the next 10 hours didn't offer anything new, mainly just the same stuff but with better guns/tools. Only new thing was the boss fights but they weren't particularly great.- Obviously the multiplayer is completely dead, but you would've suspected thatSo yeah, it's not that it's a poorly crafted game or ugly, or too clunky... there just wasn't enough variety for me, the limited stealth they offered was too hard to do, story was mediocre, and the puzzles weren't that fun (and there were a lot of them). But I was still fine to play the game 'til the end of the story."

Puzzles are braindead. Scenes with limited control state, and forced camera angles are countless. CoD slow motion is here. It has a skill tree that doesn’t offer any replay value, regenerating health system replaces health packs, pseudo open world that you travel in straight line with fast travel, you level up and craft by resting at camp fires.Doesn’t it all scream Tomb Raider to you?And this survivor premise that has been repeated endlessly. Yeah, Lara is cold and hungry once in a cutscene. You’ll need to kill a deer once, and waves of men after. Enemies drop loads of ammo, and levels are littered with pickups. You get experience points for shooting as many men as possible; extra points for bombastic fatalities. There is no way to avoid conflict, our “survivor” refuses to use her traversal abilities, until every last enemy is dead.Odd choices when it attempts to stitch together a survival story about evil men against our precious girl.Lara is bland, generic, safe, fragile, moaning, and is out of breath for the whole game. Gone is the hot badass. Her quote „I hate tombs” – summarises perfectly what people who wrote this think about the series. This game ♥♥♥♥♥ on everything the Tomb Raider series was about, but keeps protagonists name.This “Uncharted” copy would have been OK under a different title, but to call this travesty a “Tomb Raider”, is like calling a city builder “Surviving Mars”, “Doom” because few names are the same.The departure from TR Underworld is just sad, but this one made a lot of money so it’s grand, I guess."

While the gameplay itself is not innovative in many ways, nor is the game very difficult.  It's the way that the overall package is put together that makes this game great.  You continuously upgrade your weapons/tools in order to reach places you couldn't reach before.  The island is a beautiful island to play in and Lara Croft moves fluidly through the environments making it look good when she performs her acrobatic moves.  The pacing of the game is just right, action, explore, platform, and then start again.  The exploring part is mostly exploring for collectibles, the rest is pretty linear like a natural floral hallway directing you to the next scene.I understand why others wouldn't like this sense of clostrophobic environment for a Tomb Raider game, but it allows for a smooth flowing story with very scriped scenes that make for a smooth flowing game of story/action/etc...  I obtained a 100% completion and it took me about 20 hours to accomplish.  Great game, great graphics, great action, great platform all wrapped up together it makes for a must play game of 2013."

So  I decided to review TR's Multiplayer instead.Let's start with matchmaking itself... To say the truth, I've seen way better. Although there are several matches running, the game sometimes seems to be unable to find any matches, but when you try to join a session your friend is in, there's no problem to join. When you finaly start joining a game, it MAY happen to you, that nothing will happen... I mean literally nothing. You see just loading screen with beginner tips'n'tricks for hours if you don't quit your game (Via ctrl+alt+del,.... or sometimes helps if you try to join your friends game through steam library)Well, take in mind that above described things just might happen, it does not happen every time :)So now you are in game, what od you have there? MapsThere are five basic (and 7 DLC) maps, which are all very beautiful with many great details... Still after 250 hours in-game I sometimes discover some things i had no idea there were. Each of the basic maps has a small special feature, like sand-storm revealing your enemies' positions, submarine's auto-destruct system, which sets remaining time to two minutes and starts destruction of the entire map granting kills to whoever triggered it,... There are also many sweet traps you can prepare for your enemies, starting with snare trap and ending with making a barbecue of them. The maximum number of players per match is 8, that is also the ideal number of players for map, because the maps were made for 8 players. However quite often you end up in a game with 4 players and it takes forever to find somone. Characters:Let's get through this quickly. There are two teams: The Solari and Survivors, both with about 4 starting charcters for you to select and many others that unlock as you level up. There are also 4 DLC characters. Then there are ""Zac"" and ""Scavenger Archer"" characters which are xbox exclusive, however sometimes you discover someone playing with them on PC.Now, let's shoot some guns.Like I mentioned that characters are divided to Solari and Survivors, the same goes for guns. Both groups have unique weaponry. For your characters you create loadouts which consist of primary weapon, secondary weapon, special weapon, survival skill and offensive skill. Weapons, skills and more loadouts unlock as you level up.In primary weapons you can find bows, which serve as sniper rifles in this game, assault rifles and shotguns. In secondary weapons are hanguns, submachine gun (yep,.... just one) and a neat sawed-off shotgun. In specials you can find stuff like grenades, flashbangs, napalm, land mines,... Survival skills allow you to take less damage from a certain weapon type. Offensive skill on the other side should help you stalk others.All primary and secondary weapons can be uprgaded in a certain way. Eg. greater clip size for 1911 or shorter draw time for your bow. There are also 6 DLC weapons.  Well, now... What's the worst about multiplayer? The community!When I started with this game, there were many players... Now there are just very few left. And why is that? Again the community! New players simply stop playng this game because of the old ones. More and more I just find matches with a team of maxed out players camping in front of the enemy spawn, while in the other team there are new players (max lvl 20) who get slaughtered whenever they try to leave. C'mon! If this happend to me when I tried MP for the first time I would probably just give up any atempts of trying it ever again. So. match is over, new players surprisingly still here, game forms new teams, Fair teams. What do maxed out players do? They form the same team they had in the last match! Why? Really?! What's so funny about standing on one place waiting for a head to appear? These players sometimes even complain that you are camping on your spawn! No. This is just nonsence. They kill you whenever you leave it and than are surprised you don't want to leave... Best thing about that is that usually one uf them uses a bow for instant kills, another has a grenade launcher in case you decided to move WHOLE 5 M away from the spawn, third one has the overpowerd Silverballer with rapid fire and the last one picked up a Super Weapon (yeah, there are super weapons- Competition bow and minigun), and not to forget mines at every single exit.Well, let's end this. The Multiplayer has great maps, many great characters, even more awesome weapons and... players.In the end, my review must be positive, because creators of this game are not responsible for its players. If you are new to this game, I definitely recommend starting with singleplayer and when you decide to test multiplayer, don't get discouraged by the behaviour of some players, there are still some players with sence of fair play. Well, good luck, Tomb Raiders!"
448,Caine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trudg3/,7,,1,16.4,May,"15,",480,0,1,"Having never been a fan of the Tomb Raider series I was pleasantly surprised with this reboot of the franchise. And despite a warranted dislike of quick-time events in gaming, they weren't of any real hindrance so far. Animation work is smooth and believable. The score and overall audio work is amazing. And the combat is brutal and fun so far. Looking forward to seeing what other upgrades, gadgets and weapons Lara is going to come across.Definitely recommended."
449,Hoshizaki,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067783376/,10,,1,19.3,September,"14,",263,0,1,"Tomb Raider is the reboot of the popular franchise of the same name. It was Square Enix response to Uncharted as a way to try and generate revenue through their newly acquired Western studios such as Crystal Dynamics. The product was one of the most expensive games ever made. While the reimagined Tombraider trilogy never met Square Enix financial expectations, it was enough for them to continue making titles. Tombraider plays similarly to Uncharted but with more content. There is a multiplayer mode that was pretty much dead on arrival so do not bother trying to play it. Unlike Uncharted their are optional ""Tombs"" to raid that offer a puzzle for Lara to solve for extra XP and salvage, they are a relatively fun distraction with nice set pieces. The shooting gameplay is pretty much your standard fair third person shooter but with the ability to upgrade your weapons as well as having more options to traverse the environment vertically than others. Unlike other games, Tomb Raider decided to go with a sticky cover mechanic instead of toggle, it is not janky like some other attempts at it and never got in the way or led to frustrating deaths or inability to traverse the environment. One thing to not in the game is that Lara goes through absolute hell in the game with extremely brutal death scenes and set pieces where she is thrown around like a rag doll while screaming. It is pretty gratuitous and took me out of the moment especially because it happens so frequently. It is like they played through Uncharted and saw the crazy set pieces that Drake went through and decided to make Lara go through even worse as a quantity over quality approach. The games story is alright with an interesting setting of Yamatai and Queen Himiko that does not really have a presence in Western media. It felt a little derivative at times but it was still enjoyable all the way through outside of Lara getting so many innocent people killed and not really feeling that bad about it. TLDR, Tomb Raider is a great reboot to the franchise and its gameplay stands out enough from Uncharted to become its own thing with its optional tomb puzzles, collectibles, and skill/weapon upgrade mechanics to be a fun time sink."
450,StrangeFlames,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021726329/,7,,1,24.5,April,"1,",604,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a fantastic action adventure game with beautiful and explosive (literally!) setpieces. There are many moments where her surrounding is falling apart while you are traversing it and this provides many tense moments in the game. Since this game is a reboot of the franchise, Lara Croft is reimagined as a young adventurer who gets trapped in an island full of dangerous cultists and throughout her journey she evolved from an innocent girl to a full fledged survivor who has no qualms about killing others for the sake of surviving and protecting her friends. This game does include a cast of likeable and interesting side characters to compliment Lara Croft in this game. From the main antagonist who is willing to do anything to escape from the island to Lara Croft best friend Samantha who has a link to the island they are trapped in. Throughout Lara's journey you can see her changed visually as well, since her character model would looked more damaged as the game progresses such as her clothes slowly ripping off and the increasing number of injuries on her. The weapons in this game does evolved visually and stats wise as every upgrade you add into your weapons does reflect on the weapons itself. I have to complement them for these great attention to details!For those who like collecting things, this game does have various collectables such as relics, gps caches and notes hidden throughout various levels. These collectables does give the player insights about the background and history of the island which is interesting and make the collection more worth the effort.There is also multiplayer in this game, where you can play as a cast of different characters from the story. There are also different weapons and gadgets that you can use for this mode. However, there are barely anybody playing multiplayer at the time of this review. So the multiplayer in this game is pretty much dead. However the main catch of this game is in it's story mode which I found to be fantastic! I give this game a 9/10 and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great action adventure game and it is good to have more female protagonist in the male dominated protagonist scene."

456,Pannox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/panno95/,9,,1,15.6,July,"29,","1,132",0,1,"I must say: I've never been a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and I've only played TR: Legends just to see some differences with that title and this one. And There are a lot of differences. But does that mean it got worse with the reboot? Well, since you see one big blue thumbs up of course not, but let's analyze everything pretty shortly.Il you have never played a TR game and you mostly care about the plot, this is not the game for you. For what I see, TR doesen't have much of a stronger plot, but it's all mostly about the gameplay. Still, it's very nice to see how they mix some archeology with paranormal myths.You'll be Lara, a teenager girl that just finished her studies, looking for a new adventure and tombs to explore. Even though she doesen't seems to be mich happy to go in a new adventure. She will be accompanied by some kind of ""father figure"", her college friend, Sam (no, she's a girl, glad they didn't add some random love stories), some fat version of Vaas from Far Cry 3, Uncle Scrooge, a black always-angry woman, a nerd guy and some scientist that wanna be a superstar. But we'll talk about the characters later on.After a huge storm hits the boat they were on, they crashed into this misterious island, full of weird people that want them all dead and expecially, wants Sam for some kind of ritual.We can split the game in 3 parts. Don't worry, I won't spoil you anything.In the first part of the game, you see how much SquareEnix must hate Lara Croft. They hurt her in the most possible way possible, probably to punish her and the old dev for the bad titles like the 6th one. Also, this part shows how she's new to all this. Before playing, I've heard that she looks like a whining small girl for the very first hours of the game. Fortunatly, is not like that. Yes, she have a lot of ""hysterical"" moments, but most of them are pretty justified. I whould call this part of the game ""You can do it"". Cause it's what everyone keep telling her. A lot.The second part of the game is still good as the first one, there is not much to say. You can clerly see here that Lara has changed. Not very well done, but I'll save it for later.The third part is all what I was afraid of: this game turning into a generic third person shooter. Yes, the exploration kinda dies after a while, and the hord of enemies impossible to stealth get most of the game. Fortunatly it get better with the ending.The gameplay itself got way better since TR:Legend. The controls works  fine, climbing is finally responding and more improved then the older games (maybe a little too easy sometimes?). One thing is for sure: they finally fixed the camera. If first was focused on Lara's bums, leaving 2 choises, try some ""leaps of faith"" or stop and enjoy the view, now actually works perfectly. And the introduction of the bow, shotgun and machine gun works good, even though the old games usually left you with a double pistol with infinite ammos.But here's the best part of this game that I really enjoyed a lot:  What may look like some dumb collectibles, actually will help you understand more about the plot, and expecially, give you exp points to use to acquire more skills.The graphic is fantastic, it seriously fools you in the way to make you think that Lara must stink like a piece of poo after all she's been going through. Seriously tho', it's pretty fantastic, and I was just playing on medium/high settings.The music is pretty generic, nothing really memorable, but still fitting. Can't complain.But here's probably the main problem of the game: the characterization of the characters, expecially Lara. They probably wanted her to have some changing, like Jason Brody from Far Cry 3, but here doesen't work good as that guy, expecially 'cause she have a breakdown the first time she kills a man, and a second later she's spilling blood everywhere.They didn't really much tried to make the secondary characters look less generic that they already appear. You don't really much care if someone could die. At least, that's what I felt like. They all looks so much cliche' and generic that they could be here just to fill some spaces into the plot.Final score: 7+/10It last for about 10 hours if you don't care about exploring, around 15 if you wanna unlock evething. If you want it now, 20€ is a fair price, but if you can wait for a sale, you can easly get it for 5€ (7€ with all the dlc).Not a Masterpiece, sure, but a great game."

The exploration and survival elements are minimalistic but functional to the game; it is the descent into the dark mystery enclosing this remote island that is so beautifully paced, and as gripping as the best Indiana Jones movies. The characters are a little cliché, but your attention will be focused on Lara anyway. She is such a beautiful positive presence, moving the story forward with her desperate will to survive and her sweet british accent.Maybe it is simpler than the ""true"" TR, cause it targets a broad audience, but nevertheless it is a beautifully crafted game in every respect and I had a blast playing."
462,Matrix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Matrixas/,13,9,1,21.6,September,"16,","2,162",0,1,"This is a decent game. But in some respects even below mediocre. If steam reviews had something in the middle between ""like"" and ""dislike"" it would be it.When you first start to play this game you immediately notice how it forces the camera movement in every single scene possible. It really makes you dizzy very quickly. And you can't turn it off completely. The whole game is a big, messy, jiggy camera wobbling thing. WHY DO U DO THIS?I really dislike quick events in games and this game has a considerable amount of those. There are some really bad Russian voice overs. Either do something correctly or don't do it at all. It should be a motto for every game.Alt+Tab sometimes crashes the game. But since the game saves the progress very frequently - it's not a big issue, just an annoyance.Lara Croft is more durable than the Terminator. Schwarzenegger would be proud.Funny thing: when you shoot a barrel with a normal arrow - it still explodes!70% of gameplay consist of Lara's constant groaning or heavy breathing.All puzzles are very simple. I don't say it's a bad thing, but more complexity wouldn't have hurt.The story itself is pretty good and interesting, but the dialogues are very generic and full of clichés. Some characters sacrifice themselves in the most stupid ways possible. Lara can kill 20 angry men in one go, but can't rescue a friend when 3 enemies are attacking. So inconsistent.Lara never gets cold in the snowy/breezy areas, even though she walks in her t-shirt. She is still as agile as in normal weather.At first I disliked Lara's voice, but after a while I started to love it. I think it really suits her. Apart from all these little and big annoyances, I still find this game enjoyable and fun to play. It's a good adventure game in a slightly-open-but-linear world."

I am really disappointed that other games didn't learn a lot of very good things that Tomb Raider did.Different than the Rise of Tomb Raider, I feel that this have more of a scary feeling as it poses Lara as still as unexperienced.

Her colleagues are probably all dead, Lara is injured and alone on this island. In the middle of nowhere…Unlike usual with Tomb Raider, exploring burial chambers or caves is not quite as important in the reboot, even if you can still climb around and discover secrets outside of the action levels in extensive areas. But if you keep your eyes open as usual, you can find USB sticks, various artefacts and maps that show hidden extras, treasure chests or flotsam.Tomb Raider now offers a talent system and weapon upgrades, and all you need is enough debris, experience points, and as so often, a campfire.As soon as you sit down at one of these campfires, the upgrade menu opens where you can exchange the points you have earned so far for new skills or health improvements and also buy weapon upgrades. It is also possible to fast travel to areas you have already visited from here. This saves you a lot of time if you have missed something, such as a burial chamber.However, the hidden burial chambers cannot always be explored immediately, as often a piece of equipment is missing that is only obtained in the course of the game. But even if you can open a burial chamber, the secret inside is not always that easy to reveal. You often have to find the right switch combinations, cleverly climb to other levels or balance platforms in order to uncover well-kept secrets.At the start of the game, the still quite “whining brat” who often complains about how bad everything is right now, quickly mutates into a killer bride who does more than just skilfully. Lara automatically seeks cover as soon as she can and shoots at the unclever AI from behind cover. Unfortunately, this means that Lara's transformation is somewhat lost in the actual story in combat and explosion overkill. As the saying goes, ""and that's where the dog is buried"". Action is by no means bad, absolutely not, especially not in such a spectacularly staged cover shooter. However, without all these explorations through dark caves in an atmospheric world, a Tomb Raider is somehow still not a Tomb Raider as you know it.However, the strengths and weaknesses are more or less balanced and if you don't really like tomb robber activities and can do without other things like challenging jump passages, you will definitely be rewarded with a pretty good action spectacle. This is probably mainly due to the last third of the game, in which the demands, the puzzles and the tension increase noticeably and Lara just seems a bit more authentic as an archaeologist. Nevertheless, I would have wished for more exploration, less collecting mania and more survival.✅ living jungle✅ great optics and light effects✅ smooth animation✅ good mix of action, puzzles and exploration✅ Different levels of difficulty✅ Outfit and weapon optimization✅ Side missions✅ fantastic sound✅ New Game+❌Tutorial overlays cannot be switched off❌Flashlight cannot be used manually❌Backtracking for collectors❌too few survival aspects❌weak AI❌too much killer bride❌redundant skill system"

473,disttikon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/disttikon/,11,1,1,970.8,January,"30,",182,5,1,"StoryThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.OverviewThis is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.Level Design/GraphicsSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.GameplayLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.ConclusionShould you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."
474,Trippin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/trippixn/,6,,1,55.1,December,"20,",217,0,1,"The game that made a spectacular return of the greatest videogame heroine of all time.A sensational reboot of Lara Croft into the gaming world. This game is an action packed thriller with explosive set-pieces and a storyline to root for.The Lara Croft we know is absent. Long gone the duel wield weaponry and the unbeatable killer machine of a women we love, instead we get a timid and frightened young lady who is stranded in a japan-ish bermuda triangle.Hunting for her life are the fanatics led by an intriguing character named Mathias who wants to resurrect the fabled Sun Queen who used to rule the world ages ago. However, Lara is not alone in her journey, she has her mentor & friend along with her best friend Sam and a group of rag tag explorers. The atmosphere is beautiful and horrific at the same time. Equally, gorgeous is the lead heroine Lara, who instead of over-sexualized in previous games, is depicted as an average explorer who when faced with the mortal dangers quickly sprangs into action. Camilla Ludington the voice of Lara has done an amazing job!The puzzles are few but very intelligent and realistic, Lara dont have to push a button to solve everything like in past, here she has to manipulate surroundings in order to solve the puzzles.This game is amazing, I have already played in 4 times and yet havent explored everything. After playing its sequel (Rise of Tomb Raider) and the series finale (Shadow of Tomb Raider) I conclude that this one is by far the most superior of the trilogy.For Lara worshipper like me it was a mandatory game to play, however I would encourage every action/adventure lover out there to try this amazing masterpiece."

479,Slowacki,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slowacki/,6,2,1,14.1,December,"14,","2,932",0,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) is a reboot of the series letting us witness Lara Croft growing up into the badass explorer we know. It's a rather linear Action-Adventure game with some degree of freedom of exploration. It shows us Lara's very first expedition, which is to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai. Stranded and trapped on an island entombed in storms, Lara has to find the way to save her friends and escape, while solving the mysteries of the Queen Himiko and the aggressive tribe led by a madman Matthias who took control of an island. I must say the very beginning of the game really threw me off. Immediately you're being forced into a Quick-time event galore, which means for the first 10-ish minutes it's mostly running and mashing some random keys on the keyboard to progress through the story. Fortunately, the game gets much better afterwards, although I'd say it's still a bit oversaturated with QTE.Most of the time we spend climbing, jumping and traversing ropes to get from one point to another, often under pressure of time and by time I mean while trying to escape crumbling buildings, bridges and ladders. The movement is smooth enough most of the time, however, from time to time, especially when climbing I've managed to repeatedly jump into abyss in the same place, just because Lara was still stuck in the horizontal movement while I pressed jump to actually get higher. The game also doesn't have an option to sprint, which might feel a bit weird as it's usually a crucial element in all of the modern games, but it didn't bother me much in the end.There are some puzzles to solve in order to reach the 'treasury' of each tomb. They are not too hard, but also not completely trivial, I found them to be enough to make me stop and think for a second, but not something that completely stops the player in his tracks. Precise timing is often required and I can gladly say the movement and controls responsiveness are good enough to never be the blocking factor in solving the puzzles.With stunts and puzzles being one of the two most important elements of the game, the skirmishes and gunplay (and sometimes stealth) is certainly the other one. There isn't much choice when it comes to firepower in Tomb Raider, there's five weapons available, but they do get upgrades and alternative fire modes as the game progresses. They all have their pros and cons, like bow being best for long range stealth kills or rifle being great for mowing down the hordes of enemies. Which leads me to the next point...The enemies in Tomb Raider are no brainiacs, on normal difficulty they'll happily stand in front of you and unload a whole magazine in the air around you or hide behind obstacles that don't cover even half of their bodies exposing themselves for easy pickings with a bow. They usually employ a Zerg tactics where most of them die before they can even get close. You can find yourself in real danger only if you let yourself get surrounded, especially if the enemy group consists of a few big shield guys, who are pretty much unkillable without going melee and dodging.This means that most of the game Lara is basically Rambo and to be honest, it's pretty cool. Sometimes you just want to slaughter hundreds of enemies while scrambling from cover to cover to avoid molotovs and machine gun fire. It does however mean that stealth is very optional and barring one mission where you are disarmed I just went guns blazing most of the time.In the end, the game keeps you fighting and running under pressure most of the time and it's just fun. Action-packed, high-voltage fun.I've got to say, Tomb Raider aged gracefully when it comes to how it looks, especially Lara's model, which is seriously well done. Apart from that the game has some nice, majestic views from the mountain tops and murky tombs with beautiful statues. But I think the best area in terms of visual design is the Shipwreck Beach. The combination of wrecks of modern ships, galleons, tanks and planes is simply amazing. My favourite area by far.Sound-wise the game is okay. The soundtrack is not memorable, but it does a good job in building the atmosphere. Music is pretty important in making you think that something is waiting just around the corner, therefore building up the pressure and Tomb Raider's music does that well.One funny thing though is the two sounds which Lara make when opening the treasure chests in tombs. They are always the same and I couldn't help myself but mock her every time she opened the chest (Oooh? Aaah...)Definitely the weakest part of the game. I mean, the setup is pretty okay, some imaginary, forgotten kingdom with a supernatural queen, okay I can buy that, it's just how the story is unfolding that gives it horribly unrealistic and just straight up silly feeling. The greatest mystery of the game is not the secret of the storms or what are Solari, or Oni, but what the hell is Lara made of? After playing Tomb Raider, I'm pretty sure that if you tore Lara in half, both halves would regenerate into a full Lara or crawl and merge back together or something. She can be impaled, beaten up to pulp, she can fall from HUGE heights, hell at one points she , yet there she is ready to run and kick ass in minutes. This unfortunately is a trait of Lara and Lara only. All other characters injure as easily as a normal person and get killed even easier than one. And what the hell is wrong with all the buildings on the island. Like yes, I get it, they're mostly old, but apparently there's a basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ army living there and everything is fine, yet, as soon as Lara sets her foot on literally anything, it all starts crumbling to pieces. Lara looks pretty petite although considering she's an unkillable behemoth maybe she is indeed made of steel and incredibly heavy. I mean, one thing is sure, Lara is pretty thick, she finds all those notes and ritualistic imagery, but it takes her almost the whole game to figure out why Matthias has kidnapped Sam. She says it out loud and I'm just sitting there like 'duh?', not like it was HEAVILY implied throughout most of the game...One last thing that grinds my gears is the Oni. On the bright side, collecting diary entries is pretty interesting as it presents some history of the island. I actually made an effort to collect all of them, because I got hooked up on the stories they tell.Tomb Raider is a good game, it aged gracefully and it still is very much playable in 2019. It offers 10-15 hours of solid, action-packed fun. The story is a bit of a hindrance to the game as a whole, but it's digestible when you not take it too seriously. All in all a great reboot and great buy for a few bucks!"

482,THE EX-PRESIDENT,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SeboSlav/,7,1,1,40.1,December,"31,",179,7,1,"Tomb raider (2013) is and adventure game that is mostly about exploring and following story. It was also my first game of this type and I found it rather enjoyable from my usual list of games taht are mostly co-op experiences. While I will not go into details I will give you general summarised verzion of it widout major spoilers. Lara and her friends end up on a abandoned island in middle of nowhere. As they are stuck on it they realised that the island is not abandoned and there is bunch of crazy cultists taht are tryign to kill you and your friends becasue reasons (they are later expalined in game) so Lara has to rescue them and fight off the cultists in order to survive.That is really the best, spoiler free summary I can give and I will tell that story is... certainlly not the best since there are quiet of few instances that will make you go what. Luckly, the missions, combat sections, world exploration etc. make up for the decent (not subpar but just not great) story.The gameplay consist of variety of combat, stelth, quick time events, puzzles and exploration of the island in search for resources taht you use for crafting. What this game does right is that it combines well those aspects to not make them a chore and make them interesting trough whole playtrough. Gameplay mostly consist of exploring the Island for resources and collectables. You will also hunt animals to get materials for upgrades and xp. Probably my favourite parts of game was exploring the hiden tombs to find hidden treasure which reward you with weapon upgrades that you can now craft and xp. Combat and stelth sections were also interestign and majority was well designed and you knew where you needed to go, altought I will admiit some of those sections are very linear. The combat and exploring has dedicated skills which you can unlock by leveling and spending them at camps which make gameplay more diverse, in additiion you will unlcok new tools while you progress trought the game. My biggest issue with gameplay would be how upgrades for weapons all cost is too high (I was pretty much looting everything and I did not manage to get enough salvage for all upgrades), how for upgrades you only need salvages and no any other material. Anothere annoying thing is there are are essencially no any enemies left once you beat the game to fight in free roam. In adddition the enemy AI is kinda predictable and not the best. And sadly, the endgame or reason to replay a game does not really exist (except for missable achievement).Good thing about this game is that it tries to make each area stand out as different from the previous ones you encountered, tho I will admit it does not always succeed. The visuals are nice (for 2013) and game runs smooth (at least it was for me unlike Rise of Tomb Raider) so game can feel immersive most of the times. And now lets talk about how this game likes to make Lara survive over the top situations that will make you go  and trust me when I say taht there is A LOT of these quick time events and cutscenes where Lara is getting hurt. But it sure is entertaing someitems to see that or Lara die after you fail in unique way.If there is soemthign bad I can say bout this game taht is trully awful it sure is its Multipalyer gamemodes (that are dead). I will not even bother to say why multipalyer is bad in details but I will give one example. In multipallyer you can choose between 2 team: Cultists and Survivors. Cultists  and Survivors do not have access to same weapons. Cultists have 1 pistol that 1 taps you on headshot and 2 taps you on body. Survivors dont have any weapon that has weapon taht can do taht that fast on any range. I really did enjoy overall my time with this game despite me not usually playing games of this type. As I said before, the best part of the game for me was exploring and doing Tombs becasue they felt unique and different from rest of the game. I very much recommend people to try this game and if they like it to then try the next instalment in the franchise."

I'm not just talking about the original playstation games, even the most recent releases. The Game is heavily story driven. You get a large cut scene, followed by some QTE, explore the area, collect items, kill a few enemies, repeat, but the game does it well. The shooting and combat is very solid. It's weird that a Tomb Raider game has Multiplayer, but it's a decent addition. It's not very populated, but It can be entertaining for a while. After a handful of hours, it kind of gets stale. If you like to collect achievements, most are fun to get. The lvl 60 and buy all the characters and upgrades achievements starts to feel like a grind fest once you hit lvl 35-40."

492,limon_pepino,https://steamcommunity.com/id/harnic/,11,,1,12.5,June,"7,",375,0,1,"If this game came out today, in 2020, IGN's review would no doubt read ""8.5 out of 10 - Tomb Raider's strong female lead doesn't do anything new... but what she does, she does well."" Which I'm pretty sure are exactly the kind of reviews it got back in 2013. Playing it for the first time now, it's tempting to say that Tomb Raider has aged beautifully. It feels like a modern game. And *it is* pretty much - because third-person action games haven't progressed far, if at all, since this game showed up on store shelves. You have your semi-open world that you can fast travel through, your optional side content, your pseudo-RPG progression, your weapon crafting and upgrades, your notebooks that double as audio logs to flesh out the story, your uninteresting side-characters, and so on. And, cranked up to ""Ultra,"" it still looks pretty great on the graphics-side of things, too, in that early 2010s kind of way. If there are any flaws, Tomb Raider leans far too heavily on being a female-pain-simulator in it's first act - Lara spends most of the opening hours wheeze-crying and nearly getting brutalized to the point where it's more unsettling torture voyeurism than a compelling survival story. Additionally, the combat is a bit dull, with enemies being able to laser-focus on Lara from across the map and behind walls after you get your first borderline-scripted stealth kill of the encounter - you never really feel like the predator the game's tool-set implies you could be. It boils down to wait and shoot, over and over. Maybe it's because I played it on hard. And the artificial game-lengthening mechanics - oh man, get ready for some thrilling X-mashing. Mash X to open a door to mash X to open a chest to mash X to open a locker to mash X to pull a rope to mash X to ascend faster - but, I can forgive this simply because of Tomb Raider's age (we probably weren't as tired of this mechanic then as we are today). That all said, it's worth playing now simply because it's nearly as good as everything else on the market for a fraction of the price. But, it begs the question: in seven years, why haven't we gotten past all the trappings of this genre? Where's the next big leap in third-person action games? It seems like the industry is just spinning its wheels. Maybe there's nowhere to go. All in all, 8.5 out of 10, Tomb Raider's strong female lead doesn't do anything new, but what she does, she does well."
493,enzod43,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041103079/,6,,1,38.7,February,"11,",47,0,1,"THE GOOD-It's a fantastic reboot of an absurdly long running franchise. The game looks great (even against other titles of the era like The Last of Us), it runs exceptionally smoothly on modern hardware, and the gameplay lives up to the promise of what is best described as a casual, 3rd person, action/adventure shooter.Scouring the corners of every room and tomb for ammo, supplies and relics is the hallmark of many games in the series, and this one exceeds expectations in that regard. I love the new-ish mechanic of readying weapons with one trigger, before firing with the other. Admittedly, compared to other shooters, it seemed cumbersome at first, but the fluidity of the animation, combined with the responsive firing dynamics, ultimately makes for a great pew pew experience.Another masterfully done aspect of the title is the platforming. The animation timing and transitions create a believable leap, grasp, climb and repeat experience, even up against the tech in the newer Assassin's Creed games. Though it doesn't seem to be a massive part of the game, in part because it is done so artfully, the platforming integrates as a natural, and welcome, addition to the gameplay. Even if you're not a fan of platforming in a 3rd person shooter, you'd be hard pressed to fault it here.THE BAD-This is a tough one. Every game has faults, but in some they are hard to find. In others, it's nearly impossible. Splitting hairs, one could argue that the collectibles in sidequests are too hard to find. Spending extra hours carefully combing the same cliffs, buildings and crevasses can become quite tedious.Another minor irritant was the daylight and weather systems. While I absolutely adored the contrasting feels of day, night, rain and snow, that beastly overcast mode was most obnoxious. It removed all the shadows, making it practically impossible to judge depth and distance, which is a mite important when flinging Lara off one cliff for another. There is a rudimentary attempt at alleviating this with SSAO, but it's no VXGI solution. Again, I'm really reaching here.THE VERDICT-Upon playing the first level, I was worried the game would be hardly more than a series of QTEs, something that I got from the first gameplay trailers. I was never happier than to be so wrong! It is very much a playable game, through and through.If you are a fan of the franchise, or of any combination of the genres (action, adventure, platformer, shooter), and you (somehow) haven't yet gotten around to playing it, do so. You won't regret it."

This game is like an action-packed blockbuster with more than ever realistic violence (that death sequences!). Lara Croft from the frightened girl quickly becomes a deadly predator who kills dozens of enemies with her machine gun (however, that transformation is too drastic in my opinion). Action sequences quickly become pretty absurd, but all of that provides so much fun! The game is less linear than the previous parts. It offers an open world divided into smaller locations, which are unlocked during the plot's progress. Also, learning new skills by Lara creates a good reason for revisiting previous locations with new abilities available. Each location provides some optional tombs with nice platform puzzles. The plot is pretty solid, but to fully appreciate it, it's worth finding all of the recordings/journals. The graphics look good even today.

Game.Say what you like about games that have been out for a while, but there is always someone experiencing something for the first time, and to them I say, if you enjoy high-class action-adventure video games, you can't go wrong with this one. Big thanks to Feral Interactive for providing Linux support, without which I likely would not have played the game at all.Visuals, of course, are absolutely stunning. If your machine can handle better graphical settings, crank them up! The game is perfectly playable on lower settings, but it is noticeably more enjoyable with higher settings.Gameplay mechanics are solid but not overly complicated, with good on-screen cues for the most part - timed counterattacks are tricky to learn but easy to accomplish once you know how the prompt works. Most other cues are reasonably intuitive to gamers both old and new. And Lara Croft is impressively capable! The insane jumps and combos, going from zipline riding straight into axe climbing, and generally getting into places nobody would expect her to be able to reach play a major role in the overall enjoyability of the game.I have been experiencing a very annoying bug in which I cannot look to the right beyond a certain distance while looking left is unrestricted. I have a multi-monitor setup but haven't tested turning off my secondary monitor. This bug does make gameplay awkward at times as I have to turn left 270 degrees, but I did finish the game so it's not a complete deal-breaker.Cutscenes are well-presented, apparently being fully rendered for best immersion, though sometimes I lose my bearings after a cutscene, especially if said cutscene includes a change of scene. Contrasted with classic games like Half-Life, this does somewhat impact the immersion but if effectively keeps the plot ""fresh"".A word of warning to parents: apart from the violence and destruction in the game (which you should be fully expecting), there is more than occasional swearing by many characters, though in my opinion it is not gratuitous or overdone.The music is amazingly well-written, especially for plot-significant sections. Those feelings when you defeat a boss or escape by the skin of your teeth or get a great powerup are in no small part due to the music. It is also highly effective at tear-jerking, at appropriate moments.All of which leads to the most important factor of the game - the story. I have not at this time played any other Tomb Raider games, before or after (though I hope to play Rise Of and any sequels in future), but this story stands alone quite well. The progression with the gradual exposition of background plot is directed very well. Lara starts out inexperienced and weak, just trying to survive and get back to her crew members, then transitions to doing what she must to get home, and finally becomes a warrior, a champion, coping with loss all around her yet determined to never give up. When she calls to her enemies in defiance, you know she is not to be trifled with.If you haven't played this game, honestly you should give it a go. It is a very gripping game that, like a good book, you won't want to put down."

I didn't like it at first, with all the cut scenes and scripted moves plus all the button mashing, but it grew on me along the way. I have some things against it, like how the main character takes dozens of bullets, a lot of beating and not dying, all her moaning etc.. also how there are so many enemies on that forgotten island, but I'm enjoying it.

If there is anything that i should nitpick on it's the fact that (believe it or not) this game has a Multiplayer mode, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that that multiplayer never really took off, much like attempts at multiplayer in games like Bioshock 2. Still, that doesn't mean that it ruins the Single Player experience, which delivers lots of exploration, weapon customizations, interesting story and interesting maps that are sure to get any history interested people curious to investigate the fine wreck filled scenery."

Extremely well done reboot of the franchise. The story is enticing enough on its own that I kept going just to find out what happens next. Mixed in with some satisfyhing tomb raiding and weapons/upgrade system, I enjoyed every minute that I've played. The attention to detail was very noticable. Loved all the little nuiances (pics in the credits, nice touch!), that when put together such as this really sets it apart. Graphics look amazing, When does the sequel come out? I'm buying it."

518,Ruby³,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RubyCubed/,7,,1,11.0,October,"18,",769,0,1,"I feel that this game has gotten alot of bad reviews for good reasons, but I believe that the actual game itself is amazing. Some of the views thanks to some amazing graphics are completely mind blowing, and the character creation was, in my opinion, not the worst. Problems I have is how Lara Croft is nothing like what you expect. For example, the first time she kills something, she completely regrets it, theres a 2 minute scene (hyperbole) of her 'opening' a deer, then 3 seconds later, she is capable of doing it in like 1 second. I will admit, I have not finished this game, but I feel that the story so far is superb. The main problem that people have with this game is that it isnt traditional to the collection. Tomb Raider used to be all about platforming, not cover shooting and quick time events. The only puzzle elements in this game are in tombs, which are all optional... The game... Is called... Tomb Raider... And they made the tombs optional... Even then the puzzles are so simple they dont feel awarding at the end, especially when all you get is a tiny amount of scrap and 1/3 of a weapon upgrade (sometimes). Furthermore, the dlc... I haven't bought any of it because im not a fan of the online side to this game, but you can but things that can be unlocked by playing the game. I have never approved to this for it completely ruins the game... Furthermore, there is one singleplayer dlc, other than outfits and the upgrades, which is another tomb... I must point out that all of these tombs have no enemies inside them, not even animals, even though their entrances are so obvious, and are indicated everywhere with white paint. I completely understand why people hate this new style of Tomb Raider... But i quite like the combat side of things. The AI isn't as bad as you may think and the upgrade system is great. I for one am a fan of this change, but I completely understand if you hate it. I bought this for £3, though I would have paid alot more, but if your reading this review and the game is cheap, grab it now. If it isn't, go and watch some gameplay and see if you like it. This game is all a matter of personal opinion...Finished the game now and I feel pretty dissapointed with the amount of tombs. Without even realising, I had completed all of them just by exploring mission locations... I feel tempted to buy the DLC but I feel that it would be a waste. The game still lets you view the missions last area so that you can get all the collectibles you miss. Enemies are still around so things like scrap can be still used to upgrade as well as earning xp easily. I must say, the final missions were absolutely great, all of them looked amazing... The side stuff was just a massive let down. Still worth a play, but maybe worth checking for a low price on ♥♥♥."

It is restart for the story and it takes different route. I liked it tho. I am sure that you will like it as well. Anyway the story was built up pretty darn good. She started as a weakling and built up to a badass b*tch. Which was quite interesting and logical. Could play the story in one go. Not too long and it kept interest up.There is also a skillsystem. Which lets you choose what you want to get better at first (can farm all of them ""exp, lvling system""). Can learn relic hunt, just animal hunt, different killing methots and much more. Pretty cool.Puzzles were not too difficult. But I loved the exploring and challenges the game offered. After finishing the story you can go back to old places and look for relics, documents and do challenges to finish game 100% and earn achievement. Graphics  were beautiful. Couldn't go all maxed tho, since my baby is not so powerful. *cries in the corner* Game has lot of possible death scenes, some were quite scary but it made the game more interesting for some might be disturbing.Character movement was on spot as well, did not have any problems with it. Had nice animations. + wall climbing.Combat system was perfect. Bow, rifle, pistol and shotgun. In game you earn some salvage and with it you can upgrade your weapons to give them better stats. Game gave a chance either play in stealth or jump into gun fire and take it like a boss, which was nice. There is also Multiplayer, which is sadly pretty dead. To earn all the achievements you do need to do lot of farming which is possible to solo and for some you need help from others, because some modes are not played in regular basis, which can headache with earning them. Anyway I strongly recommend the game. I enjoyed my time with it.Reviewed by xTzharkz."

She is very tough indeed, when most people would've given up, she presses on, gets hurt, endures...The game takes you into a harsh environment on an island where it seems there is no escape, an ancient mystical force prevents you from leaving or being rescued... as Lara, you play the game in a 3rd-person view, just behind her... when aiming your weapons, you have the option to switch which shoulder you want to look over as she aims, left or right... you have a powerful bow which can be upgraded with various arrows, from normal ones to fire arrows, explosive arrows, rope-lines, etc... you also gain a pistol, a shotgun, and a rifle along the way, all of which can also be upgradedThe environments, the atmosphere, the visuals are absolutely stunning... looking off into the distance, seeing the sky, the clouds, the sun, the stars, mountains, trees, rivers, it's all quite breathtaking... it almost makes you forget how hard it is to survive at times when taking in the views, very immersive... the locations vary from mountains, to forests, to the beach and ocean, caves, ancient temples, dirty bloody pits and prison, etc...The story was not incredibly deep or thought-provoking, but it was entertaining, somewhat predictable, a member of your castaway group is not a very good person, and it's obvious, and most of the time you know what's going on before Lara even says anything about it, but again, it's quite entertaining regardlessThere are plenty of collectables and challenges to complete, if that's your thing... myself, personally, I'm an explorer, a scavenger, I like to find every item I can, and I enjoy achievements...

Considering this game was released in 2013, the game itself overall is AMAZING. Fascinating story mode. It's immersive, very straightforward and practically no distractions. Animation and graphics are amazing and notably well-synchronized (considered the technology level in 2013) Story theme based on the legend of Himiko, Yamatai (Ancient Japan) Simple and intuitive playstyle. Story itself is relatively short, roughly ~20 hours depends on how fast you rush the story. Literally no side missions that is relatable to story mode which is the main reason caused the game so short. Less challenging, super easy ancient tomb puzzle compared to its sequel ROTTR.I like both Tomb Raider and ROTTR many ways in a nutshell even the 2018 movie. I indeed enjoyed the game very much, playing it slowly and immersive. I spent a lot of time with this game during offline mode too (that's why I have a relatively short gameplay hours record). Definitely worth its full price for what it is (you may wait for it on sales if you don't want to pay full-price for a 6-year-old game)."

Well, I don't think so. Every tomb is optional and very straight forward, every puzzle is a lot easier than the previous game, I personaly like this way as well because this improves the pacing of the story which is (combined with the awesome gameplay) the main focus. The game, like the first three games features great visuals. Great voices action specialy from Lara Croft (Camilla Luddington) and Roth (Robin Atkin Downes). This is the kind of reboot that any game would want to be. Not to be forgotten that this game has a competitive multiplayer component and it's not that bad.Score: 9/10."

This game is amazing, starting out with the graphics and the world itself. Both are just perfect, the number of detail put into Tomb Raider is great and the graphics look absolutely gorgeous with some beautiful locations! Right from the start the game grabs you and makes you want to explore the world to find out what happened! One thing you encounter alot in the story are cutscenes/ scripted parts where you'll ask yourself, will i survive this? And unlike alot of other games this just works. Something else done right is seeing Lara grow, from an insecure little girl to a monster killing everybody on her path. Even though they could've done this alot better, it's nice to see your character grow instead of him/her beeing a hero right from the start. This way you kinda build a relation with Lara. The story can be predictable at times but overall is fun and immersive with a satisfying ending.Tomb Raider has some fun mechanics like distracting enemy's to lure them away from certain locations, climbing walls, pulling objects with your rope and much more! Upgrading your weapons is fun and addicting as well! Throughout the world you find weapon parts and salvage to upgrade your gear and unlock skills.I highly recommend Tomb Raider to anyone who likes action games with a taste of exploration and RPG-like elements."

Now, I wasn't really a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise until this one..... this one took the series to a whole new level.This is the origin of how Lara Croft became who she is....  This game is not about the making of an action hero but a story of a girl doing everything she must in order to survive. She is faced with challenges along the way as she discovers the secrets of the island....The story of the game is just splendid ^_^ It's  well written and easy to follow, with lots of twists and turns that will keep you on edge.... I can't spoil it so you'll just have to find out for yourself. The character development is also very well executed and so is the superb voice acting.The visuals are beautiful. I can't get enough of how rich the environments are. Every place feels different from the last one and it doesn't feel repetetive. Partner that with the amazing musical score of Jason Graves and you've got a Masterpiece....On towards the gameplay..... smooth movements, no camera issues, auto-crouching when enemies are nearby, aiming is easy and well done and it's so satisfying to perform headshots on enemies :D You also have survival instincts which points out enemies, animals (for hunting), artifacts, and crucial items you need to progress... Difficulty is just about right. On easy, Lara is pretty much indestructible :/ so you need not worry about dying all the time XD although you need to be fast during the QTE or she will die a very gruesome death -_-Overall Experience: Wow.... Just wow!!! If it seems like I'm giving out too much praise for this game, it's because it deserves it. You have to experience this for yourself to get what I really mean.

But this doesn't change the fact that not only is this a great and entertaining game, it is also the first Tomb Raider that made me see Lara as more than a pair of polygonal boobs doing stuff. For the first time I actually felt that she was a full-fledged character, not a mere game-mechanism or worse still a caricature. Fans of the original game's sense of exploration shouldn't be disappointed either. The game may take place in just one island but the areas you will find yourself in are nothing short of stunning. If there is one thing to complain about, it is the dissonance between the player's actions and Lara's feelings. Lara is portrayed as green, struggling to place her life above those of her assailants and visibly tormented the first time she has to kill a person. At the same time, the player is encouraged to employ increasingly ruthless tactics and kill with abandon. It just doesn't sit right. Also I suppose the multiplayer experience is, I guess, a bit underwhelming. If it matters to you, its another thing to consider. Personally I'm not interested in multiplayer, so for me this doesn't change all that much.All in all, this is a great game. And it's highly recommended."

The story is great, and really attracts the player into the game and never bores.The hidden items and optional tombs help make the game more adventurous , there are small scenes and chases which make the game more intense and keep you on the edge of your seat as you do not know what to expect ahead. , the aiming  in this game is a bit off,  always in third  person mode, and have to constantly press 'C' to switch sides while aiming which is a pain in the as* as it does not lock the side which you last used and makes it hard to peak corners for one taps later on in the game or on the hardest difficulty as you will get punished severely if you expose yourself for too long. And, the Multiplayer servers are never online, which kind of makes it useless. But, the aiming system is really easy and almost anyone can adapt to it, and the wall climbs and jumps are very forgiving which kind of makes up for the flaws of this game.In the end, I would recommend this game, because of how fun it really is, and this game is the closest we can get to Uncharted for PC."

Calling it a game would be stretching the definition a bit too far. It combines none of the things you expect in a Tomb Raider game...with controls that have about as much finesse as the original ""Dragon's Lair"". In fact, that's what it often feels like when your playing. Move->Cut Scene->Move->Cut Scene->Move and mash buttons, struggle with terrible control scheme->Cut Scene. The story is also pretty craptastic, and whoever wrote it does not foreshadow so much as telegraph later events. Pretty terrible. Got a refund within an hour or so of playing."

With multiple artifacts and GPS tags scattered across the world there is always something to find. The story is well paced and stays interesting, graphically the game holds up very well with a plethora of visual options to keep it relevant many years after release. The game runs well on modest hardware provided you don't enable tressfx, which in my opinion is buggy anyways (Much better implemented in the sequel both visually and functionally). Never cared to try the multiplayer but on a sale this game is a steal and well worth it for the single player experience alone. The game takes anywhere from 10-15 hours to complete and is well worth your time."

The way you watch as Lara grows into Lara Croft, The Tomb Raider is completely perfect. The game makes you feel her pain and her suffering as she is hardened in the wilds and in battle. It makes you feel so much compassion por her that you can't help but get yourself into the story.        The battles are really good, you can choose to either go full stealth with your arrows, or you can go full LEEROY JEEEEENKINSSS with your rifle and make it rain blood! (Yours probably).       But anyways, I find myself trying to collect everything and spending more time hunting in the forest than completing the storyline. (It is THAT beautiful). Recomend completely, no regrets. 10/10 Would totally buy again."

Single Player is lengthy (13 hours i got trying to get as many collectibles and tombs done) and i mostly like the gameplay. Some puzzles here and there but not too hard. Lara Croft was a great character, but the others were lacking.Keybindings was bad. When i just started the game it showed me a hand symbol (no idea why they can't just show me what key i had to press) when struggling against an attacker. Had no clue what was the corresponding key. Took sometime to find it in button mapping and a couple frustrating deaths. This game has too many QTE events unfortunately. Now the multiplayer is garbage. You find hardly any matches and often it's against prestiged players who often are also hackers. I was once shooting a guy, he quickly disappeared in solid rock, then when i passed by he shot me in back.So play this only for Single Player and make sure you know all the keybindings before you get to your first QTE. Game is often on sale for less then 5€ so get it when you get the opportunity."

555,Lavernius Regalis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/therealregalis/,12,,0,10.7,July,"15,",265,2,1,"I had never played a Tomb Raider title throughout all my years of gaming, nor had I touched the Uncharted series for the longest time. This is thus my first foray into this type of game, and I wouldn’t have likely started with these titles if Tomb Raider hadn’t been available for the low price of $0.00 on Steam a while back. So how does this 2013 title hold up in 2020?For a 2013 title, Tomb Raider doesn’t look bad, though I would hold it is also far from being a visual leader for its time. 2013 also saw the release of visually impressive titles like Metro: Last Light, Crysis 3, and Battlefield 4, all of which  edge out Tomb Raider in visual fidelity. That being said, Tomb Raider was a high-budget production at the time, and it is visually consistent and decent looking in the typical AAA-game fashion, even if its gritty, realistic style prevents it from standing the test of time as well as more visually stylised titles can. Tomb Raider does seem to take issue with modern hardware, however, as water surfaces seem to consistently bug out on an RTX GPU. Beyond that, there are no other visual artifacts or issues to deal with, so Tomb Raider offers up a sort of middling AAA-tier performance in the visual department.Audio design in Tomb Raider is generally acceptable. Voice acting is done well enough, even if the characters themselves leave something to be desired, and said actors deliver their given lines respectably. Combat sounds were far from memorable, but were not bad, and ambient sounds also did the job. Music was also present but forgettable, ambient in the vein of the 2016 DOOM reboot but nowhere near as distinct. Still, I should at least commend the weapon sounds, as many other third-person shooters wind up with distressingly weak weapon sound design, a fault which Tomb Raider mostly avoids.I found performance to be generally good, with Tomb Raider running at an uncapped framerate easily and with no crashes at any point. I did encounter a single bug that necessitated reloading from a checkpoint, but this set me back barely 30 seconds, and I had no other issues throughout apart from the aforementioned visual artifacts with water surfaces.Unfortunately, Tomb Raider likely won’t keep you captivated with its gameplay. The shooting mechanics are tolerable if unimpressive, and the climbing system is similarly decent, but they are rarely employed in particularly interesting ways. There is a hilarious and disorienting amount of camera shake while running, and strafe-running also forces the camera to pan in the direction you are moving (both needless issues that were fixed in the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider). Still, the weapons are serviceable at first and later become somewhat entertaining, as your shotgun gains the ability to fire incendiary rounds and your pistol receives a suppressor. These mechanics are fairly run-of-the-mill, and they are not entirely good or bad in their own right - it lies in how the game employs these mechanics that the gameplay becomes either good or bad, as I will explain further below.Critics have lauded Tomb Raider for its story. Imagine my disappointment, then, to discover that Tomb Raider’s plot falls completely flat, suffering from glaring pacing issues, an overabundance of cutscenes for sections that ought to have been implemented as actual gameplay, and a protagonist that has supposedly been humanized compared to past incarnations but who instead comes off as a dual-personality, military-trained killer, acting like a wet noodle in cutscenes and gunning down and  droves of enemies during actual gameplay. The game opts in many sequences to force the player into quick-time events, pyrotechnics-filled linear pathways, and mandatory slow-walking and/or crawling hallways, not to mention shooting galleries full of cultists. Those cultists serve as an utterly irredeemable antagonist faction, unlimited in number and both comically evil and ineffectual, all in a supposedly gritty and cinematic game.Between gameplay sections, linear or otherwise, Tomb Raider overwhelms the player with cutscenes, wherein Lara continually fails to learn from virtually anything that has occurred throughout the plot. The game seems to relish in injuring and punishing Lara, leaving us with a whimpering, bleeding protagonist seemingly constantly on the cusp of death if not for their Wolverine-like constitution. These injuries and this constant disempowerment of Lara seem to be for shock value more than anything else, and they nearly feel like playing out someone’s sadomasochistic fetish in a video game, seriously contributing to the game’s sense of ludonarrative dissonance - the gap between narrative and mechanics.While the gameplay in those less linear sections is bearable, the enemies you fight become more aggravating as the plot progresses, with the island’s improbable hordes of lemming-like cultists donning metal plating for armor, turning themselves into veritable bullet-sponges. Thus, the singleplayer component of Tomb Raider - the only reason to play it - fails to leverage its mechanics in an interesting or enjoyable way, fails to craft a compelling narrative, and fails to provide the player with any reason to suspend their disbelief and actually take the game seriously. I pushed through and completed the campaign, and even the supposedly better latter third of the game was eminently frustrating.There isn’t much to speak of with regards to multiplayer content. Tomb Raider did include a multiplayer component, but it is less than stellar, and virtually dead as a result. There are several game modes, including more typical deathmatch variants and objective-based modes more relevant to the Tomb Raider theme. Still, I would compare this to Far Cry 3, which had a multiplayer community for a while, but which has basically fallen off since then. It was arguably a mistake to devote development time to a multiplayer mode like this, as Crystal Dynamics has clearly not found a hit comparable to those of EA or Activision.Tomb Raider features no support for community content, and this is much to my chagrin as one of the only user-created ""patches"" for the game is no longer maintained and does not work with the latest version of Tomb Raider. At least a few of my gripes with the game - such as enemy armor and camera controls - might have been fixed through community content, but Crystal Dynamics has not deigned to throw us a bone here, and Tomb Raider’s engine is fairly uncooperative for community content when compared to others. The lack of support for community content here isn’t quite as insulting as it was in DOOM 2016, but it still stings a little when there are easy fixes that could be implemented by the community.I’m still trying to figure out who Tomb Raider was made for. The ludonarrative dissonance in this title is overwhelming, and while the game seems to want the player to take its plot seriously, that plot is so contrived that I often couldn’t help but roll my eyes and wait for the cutscenes to end. There are inklings of something good in Tomb Raider, but they are often overshadowed by the game’s aggravating linear sections and absurd pyrotechnics. Thus, the overwhelming praise this title has heretofore received is curious to me, when it seems to be more in the vein of Mirror’s Edge - a flawed title that had some good ideas, but which is still deserving of criticism as a result of its flaws. The difference is that Mirror’s Edge is short, while Tomb Raider overstays its welcome. I paid zero dollars for Tomb Raider - and I’m content with that price tag, because I wouldn’t consider it for more than $5 USD as a result of its faults."
556,Antwog,https://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/,17,,1,10.0,April,"18,",280,0,1,"Tomb Raider is an adventure-action third-person shooter released in 2013. Tomb Raider was developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The game is set in an island within the Dragon's Triangle, which is south of Japan. Tomb Raider is an excellent and extremely entertaining game for any gamer that enjoys adventure games combined within a beautiful and tight environment. You, the player, play as Lara Croft, who is an archaeologist that travels to the Dragon's Triangle on an expedition with several other individuals. This review will cover the campaign, which includes missions, characters and voice acting and the story, features and gameplay, the graphics, sound and performence, and the issues within each category.Campaign: The campaign is excellent. The campaign is intense and has high-action scenes in a tight environment. A tight environment is essentially a very small environment instead of a wide open space. This fits in with the overall setting and story, as the game is set on an island, so other than the beach there is very minimal open landscapes. So, while travelling to Dragon's Triangle, you end up stranded on the island with Lara having to uncover why and how to overcome it to get off the island. The campaign has plentiful variety in its missions, as each mission is different and accomplishes something different. However, the game is linear with its missions. Despite being linear, the route to complete each objective has alternative routes that take you to places to collect relics, treasuries and learn more about the backstory of the island. Speaking of backstory, the game's side-quests, for instance, collecting journals, add to the story because they provide new insightful information within the island, meaning the side-quests are not filler. These side-quests, which are also in the main missions, have puzzles, which are challenging and fun. I played this game on normal difficulty, which is the middle in easy, normal, and hard. I found it to be relatively decent in difficulty, with it progressively becoming harder. I completed this game in around 9.5 hours.The characters are extremely well-done. The characterisation of many characters fit in with the overall stranded on an island storyline. For instance, from the start of the game and progressing through the game one of the members in your crew starts to get crazy and very on edge. Likewise, the characterisation of Lara showcases her toughness and courage. All main characters within the game have a strong sense of purpose and throughout the game add personality elements, which make it easy to invest into their characters - especially the antagonist, Mathias. These characters and their personalities are also accompanied by the brilliant disparate voice acting of all characters. The voice acting fits in perfectly with the variety of atmospheres. For instance, if it is raining and Lara has to yell out to another character you can tell in her higher voice tone, likewise, if she is in extreme pain, you can notice it when she talks. Gameplay/Features:This game utilises a character progression system. You can upgrade your skills and can upgrade your weapons, which prove beneficial. There is three sections in the player upgrade system, which is survivor, hunter, and brawler skills. The hunter and brawler skills prove the most useful and the survivor tree has some nice skills, but mostly is pointless. The survivor tree is not useful because the game is linear, so while you encounter animals, you do not encounter them enough to warrant upgrading those particular skills. The game has plentiful supply of ammo. The climbing is solid. The game is relatively unrealistic in parts. There were cutscenes in which Lara severely hurts herself, but the next day she is miraculously healed. It is somewhat minor, but annoying. The game, as mentioned, has a tight atmosphere, which means the movement can get clunky, slightly disturbing the experience.Graphics, Sound and Performence:I played this game on max settings and what a refreshing experience. The graphics are extremely beautiful. The environment and atmosphere within the game's various weathers are excellent. The game has strong destruction elements that align with the action-packed game. The camera angles within the game are superb. I love the different angles that the game portrays the cutscenes from, which allows for a higher quality gameplay experience. The graphics incorporate very neat and deep touches into the characters. For instance, if Lara falls and slides across rocks, there is grazes and dirt on her body, in amazing detail. Performence is very optimised and I love the fluidity of the game with a constant framerate. I hit a constant 30-45FPS, which had no noticeable performence drops, FPS drops, and the typical stutters when there is a drop in FPS. The sound is beautiful. The light sounds of the wind contrasts the heavy action and it allows for a nice balance.Overall, this game is superb. I really enjoyed this game and the story within. There were several positives such as the campaign, the content, the graphics, the sound and mostly the gameplay. I did not notice many issues within the game other than what was noted in the gameplay section. This game has a nice length and packs in explosive action. This game is $19.99 and I highly recommend it at full price.Campaign/Characters: 9.5/10Gameplay/Features: 8.5/10Graphics, Sound and Performence: 9.75/10Overall: 9.25/10Thanks for reading my review! If you have questions comment below or post in Antwog's Analysis (Reviews) general discussion page. If you liked it, give it a rating. PS. Join my review group titled above."

Even though the cutscenes tried to be as dramatic as possible, the voice acting was just okay to me.Besides that the graphics looked fine and the controls were simple to play. Whether I played on a keyboard and mouse or a controller, I was suprised how smooth the controls were. The gunfights were good and the map was quite big to explore different areas on it. By collecting different sorts of tools, you are able to upgrade your weapons and become more resistant towards your enemies and learn more about the cult. I had a lot of fun exploring the different areas and solve puzzles, too. The puzzles were not always simple, but fun to play and every fan of the Tomb Raider franchise will definitely like it.Unfortunately the multiplayer mode of this game is barely played by anyone nowadays. Even though the multiplayer was quite fun, I still wish more players would be playing it.Overall the game created a good combination of gunfights and exploring/ solving puzzles for me. The balance between these two aspects was done really well, so I do recommend playing this game. If you are a fan of Tomb Raider, then this will be a different side to Lara that you might not have witnessed before and experience her own progress during the game."

I always had a special fondness for the gameplay - mixing puzzles, platforming, and action adventure.  Just that it had gotten rather stale over the years.  I cannot express my gratitude enough in bringing this newest Tomb Raider to the world.  Excellent gameplay mixed with a very entertaining story honestly makes this shine.  It could have gone bad in so many ways, but it manages to mix the old style of play with a new take without becoming a grind or cheesy.  YES, there are scenes that are super-Rambo inspired, but it's a video game after all.  We all need that bit of escape.  Well acted, well directed, executed flawlessly, and really very accessible compared to previous games.  Lots of achievements and hidden items to find too.  Love the map!  Normal difficulty might be too easy for battle hardened gamers.  There were not many spots to get stuck on and I'm terrible at shooters.  I love the action button for basic melee combat and it was hard not to use the arrows for everything as it's much better than guns.Never had so much fun before jumping through the action sequences.  Flaming buildings, exploding bridges, and hordes of undead soldiers, yay!  She's a survivor in more ways than one.  Glad this ""reboot"" will  change the franchise in it's new direction. A fine adventure and can't wait for the next.  Will have to go back and finish my old Tomb Raider games now to get my TR fix until the next is available on steam."

Music and design remind me in a way of Uncharted more than Tomb Raider which was more reminiscent of the Prince of Persia series. Also, the system of upgrades suits the game perfectly, combat feels more dynamic and it is enjoyable to find stealth options for solving various situations.What is more, the locations of this part bring a unique feeling of discovery and enjoyment of beating, which somehow brings me back to the feelings when I experienced for the first time Resident Evil 4 (2005).Music and atmosphere have also changed from the old parts, for sure it works as a better experience which holds you to the end of the game. For sure I cannot say that story is the strongest aspect of the game, but cutscenes, monologues of the protagonist and progression of character development through experience are visible.Without a doubt, I recommend this part of Tomb Raider simply because it is a great adventure bringing you to the Indiana Jones experience, yet when you are in his role, and playing as a pretty lady.reVote 9/10"

Until today that is. Plus, not to mention I have the other two games from the series in my Steam library so it was only right that I completed the trilogy. I have to say, for a game that came out 6 years ago the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. I'm a sucker for hair fx when they're put in games and it's crazy how insanely realistic everything in this game looks regardless. But, then again I did play this originally on console so it's absolute eye candy to me even if I put all my settings on low lol. Anyway, the story is just as great as I remember. You'll find yourself lost in it pretty quickly to the point where you binge. If you're anything like me you'll end up saying things like ""well let me just do ____ real quick before I get off."" Then next thing you know, you end up playing for another hour of more. I think Square Enix really did this rebooted Tomb Raider franchise the justice it deserved. After all, there's a damn good reason why it's rated overwhemingly positive. I absolutely recommend this, especially for the price. Even at $20 it's worth it in my opinion."

They try to make it into a movie, which is nice and all. But most of the time you feel less like the director, but more like the guy who presses the play button - and that makes the game very boring.You have very little freedom or even challenges. I found this game to be very simple to complete.I guess the ""fun"" is supposed to be in completing all the objects and collecting all the relics. But this seems only to appeal to people with compulsive disorder a la ""I need to have them all"", but there is no fun in that. It seems more like work to me.If at least the story would pull you in a bit more. Relatable characters or maybe a love affair to spice it up. But none of that. it's simply a linear movie where you push the play button and try to get high on collecting items.Big PLUS for supporting Linux. I really appreciate that, but in the end this is a game review and not a laudation for supporting alternative, free and open operating systems.Thus I can NOT recommend this game."

It had only a few minor stability issues but other than that it's damn near close to a perfect game. Too bad the multiplayer is dead because the single player story takes it high up on my top 10 best games I ever played.   Graphics and sound are great.   Gameplay works just as the developers intended.   Lots of collectibles that reward you with lore, gallery images, models and pretty much everything is rewarding enough.   Took me 20 hours to see and collect just about everything the game has to offer. It would probably take half that time to complete it without being as thorough as I've been, and the game lets you free roam after the story is done.   Couldn't ask for anything more but I could have asked for something less. DLCs.   The Tombs were a bit disappointing. They are not as challenging or as long as I would have hoped. The Tomb of the Lost Adventurer DLC took me less than 5 minutes to complete and that says it all.Still, I recommend this title without any reservations and even if the DLCs are sort of bad, for a AAA title that offers so much and got -80% offers you should really get the GOTY edition. No reason not to."

What's more is that this game ""Overwhelmingly Positive"". There's no way that people will read my review objectively.This was not a bad game. No crashes, bugs, nor graphical anomalies. Indeed this game does look rather impressive.For me it was the gameplay. It was just a very linear story. You will move from A to B to C. Somewhere in between those you might be able to collect a few Easter eggs--literally, there are eggs you can collect--but they don't serve any purpose. There was vague story but it just be seemed to bloated with fetch quests. You had only one thing to do, and only one way to do it.To clarify a bit: when I say linear, compare this to two other games that take place on island environments: Just Cause 2 and Far Cry 3. In both of those games the Island is yours to explore and do what you want with. In this game you don't have that option. Often the puzzle you just solved will block the way you came leaving you with one way forward.This is where I wish Steam offered an ""It's alright"" option. Doesn't make it a bad game, just makes it a game not for me."

Gameplay is limited, with at least 4 out of my 6 hours played comprising of nothing but QTE's and cutscenes. When the game allows you to take part in the action, it plays like a poorly made third-person shooter with rudimentary mechanics, and firearms that operate like nerf guns. The games set pieces are gorgeous, if only to provide a backdrop to the repetitive climbing segments. The last 3 hours I spent in game, I was looking out the window and playing with one hand. On a keyboard. Its that mind numbingly simple.I had such high hopes for the product, with nothing but 9/10 reviews. I can't even bring myself finish it.

You don't need a lot of time to finnish it, tho'. Approximative 8-9 hours of storytime (without many checkpoint restarts), but without all the collectables available on the map (although, 72% completion from the first try).Anyway, I don't even know from where to start this review. This is the best action game I had played so far. Just go on and make your bags, you'll go on a feels trip more or less, as soon as you start the game. My review doesn't contain any spoiler, so it's safe to read.This game has it all: action, stealth, killing enemies in full Lara Croft style (with your bow), EPIC AND TOUCHY STORYLINE (although it's on the SF side, it's awesome, touchy and emotional), graphics and Lara Croft in HD :D.- Going over the storyline, there isn't many things I could say without spoiling stuff. It's well made, although it's linear, meaning you can't make any decisions, you just go as it was developed. Environment and map movement is nearly the same, you can't really make any mistakes missing the main quest or getting lost around. It has many emotional moments, cutscenes and brings up in first place, beside the main reason of the storyline, Lara's transformation (play the game and you'll see :P).- Mechanics are well made, and beside two times when I pressed 'W' to jump up on a ledge, and Lara decided it might be a better idea to jump towards the right, right off the mountain and die, there's nothing more to say. There are hardly any bugs around, and it's all well made. You can either be one with the shadows, and stealthy go and kill people with your bow, or just go full rambo. You choose.- Graphics are nice and detailed, played it maxed out on 1080p, on my GTX760. That TressFX hair effect makes Lara Croft look even more real than it already is. Overall, Tomb Raider 2013, is an amazing experience, and it sure is a great revival of the series (which to be honest, I didn't played, only watched on YouTube). So, you can say it was my first Tomb Raider experience, and sure felt in love with this game. Best ~9hours I spent in singleplayer gaming so far.And let's face it. Why don't you want to play this game, when you are playing as the lovely Lara Croft?  :D10/10"

Our main character is a young woman, just beginning her work as a researcher, who decided to go on an expedition in the team of a well-known archaeologist. However, the ship that our heroine is sailing is sinking and we find ourselves on an island that will not let us leave at any cost.What is important is that the game allows us to explore the open world and I admit that it worked out very well for the creators, because the locations are interesting, dark and looking for various secrets is really interesting. And of course the open world, which looks beautiful. All locations complement each other and fit together.The game offers us an arsenal of weapons, although the main weapon of our heroine is definitely a bow, which serves us throughout the game. In addition, we have a wait, thanks to which we can climb the walls. We also have firearms, like pistol, shotgun and rifle, but nothing gives us such satisfaction as shooting from a bow. A bow can also be used to confuse your opponents.The graphics in the game are made carefully. Noteworthy are the cutscenes, which are made very well.  The creators have also made a lot of effort in terms of detail. Sometimes, if something doesn't go our way and Lara gets hurt, the developers didn't let us not see it. And the views are very pretty.It is also worth noting how good a soundtrack is in the game. Pleasant songs are interestingly composed with the sounds of the island. We also have the opportunity to listen to the dialogues of the opponents, which are usually related to the current situation.One of the worse things in the game is multiplayer mode, which is not very interesting.However, this is not the most important element of the gameTomb Raider is a very good game. The 18 hours I've spent in the game I consider well used. Interesting storyline, nice graphics and nice soundtrack are some of the biggest advantages of this game.

Some times your enemy asked you to forgive him and keep him alive so that was supreme.Perfect voice acting,as same as real life character making noise in hard works.I don't know how to explain gun fires and nature noises like wind,just can say it was awesome.There wasn't any problem like low frame rate while playing game and I reck on old PC can play it with out problems.As I alude to short story you can finish game in a week but you can have one of your best adventure.It's worthy and you won't regret ,so add it to your cart now.Its bundle is worthy too you can have all of Tomb raiders with all DLCsI definitely recommend buying this game.Total Score: 8Thank you for reading my review."
596,timɘ_bendeя,https://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/,7,,1,25.2,March,"12,","4,375",1,1,"As a casual Lara Croft fan this Tomb Raider reboot was the game I had been waiting for. With a more modern, down to earth but still adventurous look and a smaller breast size this Lara would complement her adventures instead of taking away from them due to her sexualized appearance. She’s still incredibly sexy, mind you, but she fits the tone the game is aiming for and blends in nicely with the scenery.Since this is a reboot we get to see Lara anew: she’s a little different than before, but deep down still the same Lara we always knew. She just has to learn the ropes again. She doesn’t have that killer attitude like she had in the first series of games. In fact, Lara hasn’t killed before the start of this game so it’s a real reboot indeed.We’ll see Lara grow into a full blown gritty survivor and archeologist during this game’s journey. And it’s the reason the game begins rather slowly and linear. It’s all about the character’s development. And it works: being stranded on a mysterious island will change Lara in many ways during the course of the game. She’ll has to survive by killing animals and, eventually, humans. Her first human kill naturally has an emotional and devastating impact on her. However, and this is unfortunate in my opinion, not much later she’ll be viciously slaughtering tens of enemies, which gives off somewhat of a mixed feeling. From that point onwards the character development seems to shift to story development. But in the end it’s all for the sake of survival, naturally.This new Tomb Raider fittingly plays out in a Metroidvania type of manner. In hindsight you’re wondering why they didn’t come up with this before as it feels like such a natural fit for the series. Like a true Metroidvania you start with some basic weapons and tools and continually you’ll acquire more with which you can access new or previously inaccessible areas, treasures and more.You will quickly acquire an climbing axe and a handmade bow, a valuable tool and weapon. Later on you’ll also be able get an assault rifle or a shotgun, for example. The guns feel good to use, but I myself preferred the bow because it allows for stealthy kills, and I am generally more a fan of using stealth. But if you’re the type that usually goes in guns blazing there’s also the possibility to do that. These choices, although simple, give the game a fresh and, unknowingly, much needed element. Enemies and objects can also be highlighted by the press of a button, as we’ve seen in many other games before.Almost everything you do will earn you experience which you can use to level up. Together with the materials you find you’ll also be able to craft and upgrade weapons and tools. All of this is done at the many different bonfires you can lit across the island.Speaking of the island; it’s a big open island where you can go into multiple directions. It looks amazing with a ton of setpieces for the story itself and some breathtaking scenery for when you get to take a breather (or when you have finished the game, since you can then continue and look for missed treasure). And since it’s a Metroidvania the world is also connected in an amazing, logical, but still natural way.New to this Tomb Raider are the tombs. And in similar fashion to the older games the island also houses quite a few environmental puzzles. But let’s get back to the tombs for a minute. These are self-contained, sometimes devious, puzzles that can be solved in a few to 15 minutes and will earn you treasure for your already growing collection. These are fun to do, but I wish there were more *and* that they were bigger.The game lasts about 20-25 hours if you want to do everything.I can’t really think of any cons for this game, except for maybe the fact that it sometimes overuses the quick-time events (QTE). And obviously the tombs that would’ve been much better or at least fun if they were only a few sizes bigger. Thankfully, the sequels fix this issue.Other than that, I found this game to be pretty much perfect fun, 100%ing it entirely (and later its sequel: Rise Of The Tomb Raider).As far as the graphics are concerned Tomb Raider still impresses with excellent lighting and physics. Lara looks realistic and moves with grace, as you would expect, and the details on her clothes and body (especially when in and out of the water) will almost make you think she’s real. Almost.Camilla Luddington does an amazing job at portraying a grounded Lara. She reacts like one would expect. The other voice actors do an equally good job, but Camilla stands out without a doubt.This Tomb Raider reboot exceeded all of my expectations and then some. It’s just a game that is such a joy to play. The new Lara Croft is grounded and realistic and the Metroidvania-like gameplay fits the series like a glove. Unfortunately, the newer titles aren’t build the same way – they’re great games in their own way, however – but that makes this one even more special I think. Highly recommended!"

It's an origin story showing Lara transition from a young and inexperienced archeologist to a hardened badass.Lara and her friends get shipwrecked on an ancient island full of mystery. The crew soon encounters the island's cult inhabitants called the Solarii. Some of the crew members are killed and Lara is separated from the others. She has little choice but to fight to survive.Positives:+ The story: Engaging and has great pacing.+ The setting: Yamatai is both gorgeous and deadly.+ Good graphics.+ Experience system: Unlock skills in three categores (survivor, hunter, and brawler) as you level up.+ Combat: Use either a bow, pistol, shotgun or a rifle. It's really fun and tense especially when you're against multiple bad guys.+ Great stealth and cover mechanics: It's fun silently picking off badguys with your bow.+ You really feel the tension in some scenes.Negatives:- You can walk off damage during and after combat.- Besides Lara, there's little character development: Most of the character development comes from documents you find scattered throughout the island.- Too many quick time events: Even the final battle is a QTE!- Ending is too short.Score: 8/10"

Most of the time you'll just be waiting behind cover until some guy pops his head up from where he's hiding for an easy head shot.The puzzles are good at times, but they tend towards the easy side. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for some challenging puzzles you won't find them here.The story is not that great. You can guess the ending very early on. The game is filled with cutscenes that are usually longer than they should and at times it feels more like you're watching a movie than playing a game. Probably the worst part of the story is the number of times Lara gets hurt, stabbed, falls, etc... and how she's still able to run, jump, climb, shoot bad guys, etc... as if nothing had happened.The game feels more frustrating than fun."

Had the presets set to ultimate so seeing each strand of Lara's hair moving about her head was mesmerizing. Game play was fun. Between combat and puzzles it kept the flow of the game interesting. The melee was a little funky to work out but once you knew how to time the hits it worked out fine. Zip lines, mountain climbing, gun play, it all felt natural. Story line was decent. There were a few times I had to question the plot choices but there wasn't anything I'd consider terrible. Dialog is funny, especially listening to enemies talk to one another.I took a little over 17 hours to play the campaign, max out all of the skills and guns, find all of the maps, gps caches, documents, and relics.

I can't imagine a more ludonarratively dissonant experience.""Crystal Dynamics: ""Hold my beer.""Part of me wants to recommend this game as it genuinely made me laugh out loud, due to how bizarrely the story it wants to tell clashes with the actual things it asks you to do. The speed with which Lara goes from her very human, anguished reaction at her first kill, to mowing down scores of enemies with nary a hint of remorse (while dispensing the odd ""BURN IN HELL!"" towards the corpses of her victims for good measure) has to be seen to be believed. But I just can't do it.The most obvious comparison I can make with this game is, as alluded to above, the Uncharted series. Like those games, this is a heavily narrative-driven experience which makes liberal use of cutscenes, QTE's and the odd bit of borderline cheating game design (for example, you do not have to be at all precise with your jumping in platforming sequences - the game will correct for you if you're veering off-course) to ensure an experience which is as cinematic as possible. The casualty of this design philosophy is the actual experience of play - it's hard to feel the thrill of overcoming a tough and exciting challenge when the ""dramatic building collapse"" sequence you've just played through could have been beaten playing one-handed.In its defence, this is better and more interesting as a game than the Uncharted series. Combat is actually pretty good and does not feature the awful bullet-sponge enemies that plague all of Naughty Dog's games. The puzzles are a bit more interesting than the braindead ""look at your notebook for the answer"" ones Nathan Drake is presented with. And there are customisation options and optional extra sections I don't recall being a feature of any Uncharted game.On the flipside, I don't think this is the kind of game you'd pick up if you were looking for say a rich, mechanically-sound and deep ARPG. This is a story game first and foremost, and it's on these terms, its own terms, that it's only right to offer a final evaluation. The Last Of Us kept me playing to the end, despite being a far worse experience than this, a straight-up turgid abdominal distension of a game, because I genuinely liked the characters and wanted to know what would happen to them. By contrast, the only character in this whose name I could remember was Lara, and the main emotion that had been stirred up in me by the time I decided to call it quits with this game was revulsion at the horrifically gruesome torture porn treatment of the protagonist in cutscenes and quick time events.I'm not opposed to linear story-driven experiences in general, I just think this is an example of the wrong way to go about making them. As an alternative to this I would strongly recommend Batman: Arkham Asylum."

It baffles me why it's regarded as a great one, why there are so many fans and so on.It's simplistic and shallow, it borrows elements of Arkham and Uncharted series, but (beside being unoriginal and stepping away from the genre Core created with the Tomb Raider) it never even achieves their level.Some scenes are cool (like that puzzle in a wooden temple of storm or something), but it by far never achieves superb level of the Underworld. Crystal Dinamics and Square Enix weren't even aiming at that. It's just safe and marketable third person shooter, fine in that regard, full of overused hollywood movies and TV shows cliches. Overall plot is stupid, the lore and its use are laughable, exploration is non-existant.Well, visuals are good and it's polished, it's fine while it lasts. Good product in that regard, I guess. But then there is the sequel, and then there is the franchise sprawing endless horde of sequels based around good old formula ""more of the same"". And that's not even something that really saddens me. What saddens me is the fact, that the genre I loved is dead and this Tomb Raider reboot was the last nail in its coffin.

618,Theoran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theoran/,6,,1,172.0,August,"19,",66,0,1,"Tomb Raider is the first Tomb Raider game I’ve played, and I love almost everything about it. Lara is an innocent, smart, resourceful, determined, faithful, confident, and doubtful character. She’s not perfect. She makes mistakes. She experiences setbacks and she doesn’t always succeed. Lara is not a Mary Sue; she has flaws; she’s doubted and challenged by the Endurance crew members; she’s not loved and respected by everyone; she’s a fully realized and interesting character. Through the game, Lara faces challenges that make her stronger and more capable to handle what the island throws at her, and the island throws a metric ton of stuff at her.The story is engaging and the island is packed with interesting details that encourage exploration. The more you explore the grester your desire to understand the island's lore, history, and inhabitants. Everything about this game hits on the things I love most; action, adventure, atmosphere, mystery, discovery, ancient cultures, tomb raiding, shipwrecks, history, and a female protagonist that you don’t roll your eyes at every moment in game.I completely recommend this game for the single player story. For the multiplayer piece of the game… it is as dead in 2021 as it was in 2013 when I first completed the game. Getting friends to be able to join your game is difficult and consider yourself lucky if all players are able join your lobby while you grind through multiplayer achievements. Thankfully, the Tomb Raider community is very willing to help those wanting to complete the multiplayer achievements. The last few were brutal as the multiplayer XP grind is a slow and boring slog of private Rescue matches. By the time I hit rank 60, I had forgotten all about how much I enjoyed the single player story. At the end, I felt only disdain for the multiplayer game."
619,Mama Bugg,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heatbugg/,5,,1,44.4,January,"4,",810,4,1,"I've been playing Tomb Raider games since I was a child. At first, I thought they were too scary and I watched as my Dad played the first, second, and third games on his brand new Playstation. I was moral/puzzle support mostly. I'd help him find guides on the internet (no easy task with dial-up!) and we'd have a great time.Since then, Tomb Raider has grown up a bit and so have I. The last generation of games (Legend ,Anniversary, and Underworld) were a great step in a new direction. They sometimes faltered in terms of mechanics, but in overall feel, I still felt the old Tomb Raider vibe I once did with the original style of the game.Now, with this latest reimagining, I've come to find that Lara has taken a lot of influence from Nathan Drake. THIS IS NOT A BAD THING. I once scoffed in this game's direction once I saw what kind of of ideas Crystal Dynamics and SquareEnix  were looking to implement. I am so happy I was wrong.From the very start, there is a real sense that this game was built from the ground up by a team who loves the series as much as I do, as much as any veteran of Tomb Raider does. At times it does go over-the-top with gore and viscera, but it's all there to set a tone that doesn't falter throughout the experience. Yes, that is a lofty word, I know. However, giving this game a chance to entertain you and engulf your senses will give you the best understanding of what it has to offer. There are wildlife that roam many areas, intense weather of all kinds that beat Lara to a pulp, and some of the most incredible mood lighting I can say I've ever seen.Normally, I am not impressed with graphics alone as a measure of a game. Here, I will make an exception. Even on my modest PC, the details of the open-world of this island in the fabled Dragon's Triangle were enough to make me gasp and awe more often than I ever imagined. The scale of the world is something to behold, and once traversed is worth a revisit.When it comes to combat, the series has always been known for a certain ""run and gun"" style. For a long time, that worked well. Now, in the post-Gears of War age, cover shooting has become the new normal. Tomb Raider does adopt this combat style, but with a few caveats. Much of the cover you take is destructible in real time. No more waiting behind walls while your health recovers (at least, not for long). Instead, you have to be fast, accurate, and have a decent idea of what you plan to do to the next enemy who comes your way. Further, the combat has not lost that old TR intensity or dread. On the hard difficulty, combat is frantic. I played the vast majority of the game using only Lara's new signature archery set. Once I got closer to the endgame, I couldn't really hold that together much. I found I began to rely heavily on the assault rifle with the bow on back-up for a bit of fun with the lesser enemies. There are types that go from weak to strong, unarmored to full riot gear (including shields), and they all pose a major threat in one way or another. Many times, it's from one of their well placed fire arrows or sticks of dynamite.Finally, you have a choice to make. Often times, you must face enemies head on in a seemingly insurmountable wave. Other times, you can practice stealth. When given the choice, always go stealth. You can distract guards Metal Gear style by shooting arrows near them so they will investigate. You can also shoot out any nearby light source. At first, you'll have to take them down strictly with arrows. Later, you do get special stealth kills that make this more fun and far less daunting.Moving on to mechanics, Lara's new style of environment traversal varies so much throughout the game, it is a staggering feat that I could even keep up. Mechanics are constantly introduced, and with such frequency, that I never felt as though jumping, climbing, or sliding ever become routine or mundane. From shear face rock climbing to transporting up a zipline, this game has a great sense of keeping the player involved in the movement forward.The upgrade system doesn't feel as rough or tacked on as I thought. It even makes sense within the context of the story. Since Lara is freshly graduated from university and off on her first trip, she knows nothing of survival. With time, she becomes a force to be reckoned with. The cost of such strength, you ask? That would be salvage, the game's currency. You can gather it from caches strewn through the environment and from felled enemies. Depending on what skills you have obtained, you'll get a bit more, especially for special kills. I was sure to spend it all as frequently as I could, and I would recommend the same to anyone. Touching again on the story, this game does a very good job of showing the progression of Lara as a character who truly grows due to her experience on the island. At first, she's as green as she could possibly be. But near the end she's calculated, aware, and daring. The other characters serve to drive her towards greatness. A few feel a little flat. However, I will admit to choking back some tears and feeling some chills once or twice. Yes, it may evoke emotions in you, too.Now for the bad news. In what I feel is a major oversight, the devs decided to go with regenerative health for Lara. Yes, I can understand that health packs are a bit outdated for the newest generation. However, there's no real reason they couldn't have implemented some kind of self-care system ala Snake Eater. Since salvage is currency, finding bandages, salves, or other medical supplies on your kills could have worked great! It also would have added a lot more tension to combat. Conversly, I can undertand why they didn't do this. Stoping the frantic pace of the action so Lara can heal herself is unrealistic in a more visceral way than Wolverine powers. It was in Snake Eater as well. I only think it would have made a great story device.Next, upgrading the weaponry seems a little forced, but it's not tacky. I just don't understand how someone like Lara, with no combat experience, could figure out how to fashion a better grip for her pistol or a more efficient slide for her rifle. It is a matter of video game logic, but it's not totally glaring.What is very in-your-face, however, is Lara's sometimes inconsistent behavior. This is especially true during cutscenes. Yes, we've all heard of this issue in other games (Uncharted) and it remains true here. After already being a total bad-ass via my control in gameplay, Lara (late in the game mind you) gets squemish and shy to the point where it causes an unnecessary character death. A bit of refinement or better reasoning would have helped in these situations.Overall, Tomb Raider is a fine addition to the Library of anyone who loves strong character action games. It is fun, gorgeous, and worth the time it takes to complete, which I'd estimate is ~15 hours if you don't search for many extras. Pick it up when you can, and watch as a new kind of Lara is born."

622,Twistor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/,6,,1,23.1,August,"18,","12,084",0,1,"Story of how the legend was born? Sounds promising, huh? In large part, this anticipation turns out to be true.When reading this review, note I didn't play any other Tomb Raider games before this one. I might now though, inspired by this prelude.Game begins with the very green heroine Lara Croft shipwrecking on a mysterious island with her friends. At first she's helpless, with no weapons nor other equipment to get by. Combined with the circumstance that almost everyone is out to get her, this brings about a unique feeling of vulnerability that diminishes as she grows to become an effortless killing machine.First thing that I noticed was the near-photorealistic graphics. Awe-inspiring, I spent some moments just looking at the scenery and studying the nature and architecture, though this was hard because I was also constantly distracted by feeling danger all around myself. The atmosphere was very well done. You could even experience it in 3D with the right hardware, but unfortunately I don't possess that and couldn't try it.By gameplay, Tomb Raider is a combination of third-person shooter and 3D platformer with minor RPG elements. Then again you can take most enemies out by sneak attacks if you prefer that. You have to deal with different quick-time events from time to time both in-combat and in the more traditional way during scripted events within story. That's actually one of my few complaints: it's sometimes difficult to deduce which keys you are supposed to press during these events, as apparently the key tip disappears under the screen. Fortunately this matters less later when you learn to identify between the events.Edit: Oh, I totally forgot. One thing that bugged me for the whole game. There are ammo literally everywhere! You have to actually be shooting like crazy to run out of ammo.Another minor inconvenience is that one of Lara's many skills is climbing. This is cool. However, she can be stiff and stubborn at times and decide to jump into the direction she was going before instead of jumping up during climb unless you take a moment to calm her down for the maneuver. This led me to many an untimely awkward death, though number of which reduced when I got used to the controls.Single player story is engaging. You get to meet Lara's friends, read (there are notebooks scattered around) about their dreams and doubts and then hope to save them all to get safely back home. Story can be ruthless and sad at times. Along with the story, Lara gets to exercise her archeologist training to study the various artefacts and scriptures found around the island (each provided with an insight from Lara). For the completionist, there are also a number of challenges (basically ""find hidden stuff"" missions) and puzzle-like optional tombs to complete. These are also useful sources of experience points and salvage (used to upgrade weapons).Unfortunately, for the said completionist, about half the Steam achievements are granted by multiplayer. MP is, at the time of writing, quite dead, i.e. there are no active, permanent lists of servers. However, you can find a player community at  who regularly play (as of 18th Aug 2014) or asking on the forum.While I've heard MP is awesome, I've not actually tried it yet. However, I can recommend Tomb Raider for its single player story alone. On Hard difficulty (that I found to be okay if not challenging) it took me over 20 hours to complete 100%. The present price of 20 € is about half the original price and it's good, but you could probably get it for 10 € or less during sales if you wanted to and the lack of MP kind of justifies that too."

I started the  series with  I loved it so much that I saw one of my friends get this one last week, and while it was still on sale, I caved in, and got it yesterday.Not surprisingly, it capitivated me just as fast as RotTR did. The graphics, music score, and story are all well done. The music score is really something else worth additional mentioning. It's almost like watching a scary movie, and by that I mean, the music grips you subtly, and then something jumps out at you, as the music turns from subtle to a skin jumping leap of fear that makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. I fell for this each time so far, and will probably continue to do so.Lara Croft, is an easy character to feel for. You can't help but to make sure nothing bad happens to her. More so than any other character I've ever played in a RPG. I could go on, and on about this game, but I don't want to get too long winded.Currently the game is on sale for 75% off, so if you've never played any of the series, then start with this one. I don't think you'll regret it. It's addictive, atmospheric, and certainly immersive."

Crystal Dynamics did a stellar job in creating Tomb Raider's atmosphere, a cinematic beauty that actually manages to transfer the excitement of discovering a lost civilization into the hearts of the player. The puzzles are fun, some aspects of combat entertaining, and the collectibles are one of the few that I actually bothered to gather.That being said, the game does come with it's flaws. Overabusing quick-time events is, without a doubt, the largest problem as it constantly snatches control away to create something more similar to a movie than a game. There is too much emphasis on combat, whereas the puzzles, which ought to be the focus, are more or less shoved to the corner as optional tasks (Its called ""TOMB"" Raider for god's sake). Character development isn't that great. While most characters get at least one scene in the spotlight, they never get enough screen time for the player to fully understand them (Ahem* Sam). Finally the game is short, with a storyline that lasts around 15 to 16 hours. Nevertheless, a solid game that should definitely be considered for purchase.  8/10"

I mean , it's open world, but you don't feel like you're playing GTA,Saints Row,Skyrim or any open world game where you really feel the ""freedom"".That isn't a problem, but after you finish the story and complete some tombs, collecting some things, there is NOTHING left to do."

The whole game and its sequels are focused on a story that makes absolutely no sense, and arcs that take away from the appeal of the game in the first place.  If you like action games with lots of whiny characters, this game is for you.  It's also strange when the story is telling you one thing and the game is telling another story.  Serious dissonance in this game.  Nonetheless I've played it through a few times and there's something fun about the energy of it.  Still wouldn't recommend it unless it's on a discount deal."

I played the original Tomb Raider 'back in the day' and loved it. As an adventure gamer by trade, however, I was never coordinated enough to survive to the end.After playing Horizon Zero Dawn and improving my stealth/action skills, I was looking for my 'next game' and someone suggested the Tomb Raider series.I've really enjoyed this first game. I love traveling with the 'new' Lara and exploring a diverse and detailed world. I set the difficulty level to 'Easy' and managed to find collectibles, progress, and survive up to the ending 'big boss' (who I have yet to kill). The platforming does not require perfect precision and I found the controller configuration easy to work with and intuitive. For major battles, I resorted to my keyboard/mouse which gives me better aim.This is a great game for adventurers who want to try their hand at stealth and combat. There is a story, likable characters,  collectibles, and an occasional ambush.  Survival is based on taking cover and keeping your adrenaline in check.  For those new to the franchise, there is an invaluable set of guides on ""Stella's Tomb Raider Site"" that provide tips/techniques and survival strategies. Achievements include multi-player challenges so 100% was not on the table for me. This freed me to enjoy the experience without being concerned with perfection!"
637,TopS,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198169900590/,10,,0,4.2,April,"19,",192,1,1,"Rarely do you see a game that is bad in almost every regard. The gameplay is unappealing, littered with quick time events that tear any weight from every situation. Lara is constantly falling down cliffs where you have to press a button or the correct direction or something. The combat is boring and uninspired, taking the worst from Uncharted and Gears of War. There is a skill tree, but the skills hardly feel like upgrades and dont change the flow of gameplay at all.I also have some personal nitpicks, starting with the loading zone caves. When transitioning to a new area, Lara's already slow walk speed is reduced in order to load in the new area, as you squeeze through some dark cave or crevice to let the new area load. I would rather have a loading screen than watch Lara whine and struggle slowly to walk through a hallway. Another nitpick, they MISPRONOUNCE HIMIKO THE ENTIRE GAME EXCEPT FOR ONE GUY. The main antagonists name is mispronounced with the exception of the Japanese speakers and the white dude with brown hair. The only fun parts of the game for me were unintentional. The way Lara ragdolls after death creates some funny moments, the fastest way to move is to roll everywhere, in the caves that I mentioned you can spam shift and she will do a sort of dance, if you spam roll during any interaction Lara will say ""I cant do that now"" in a monotone voice, and many other small thingsTLDR: Knowing nothing about Tomb Raider I expected this game to be good but was very disappointed.PS:I would hate to be the unlucky guy that is forced to use the machetes and run up to get slaughtered"

639,Reck,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Reckonist/,6,,1,6.9,November,"28,",513,1,1,"Tomb Raider PCIs the Tomb Raider reboot a welcome one? Does it make Lara more than just a triangular bosomed sex object for slightly pale bedroom lurkers? Has Square Enix made another excellent PC port? Well lets traverse the conveniently sized blocks and handily placed ammo packs for the start of a new era in archeology.What's the premise?The origin story of Ms Croft taking you through her first adventure. Shipwrecked on a mysterious island with no supplies or experience, Lara must learn to survive by any means and rescue her fellow crewmates from the stir-crazy inhabitants who, for some reason... cannot leave.Is It a good Port?The first thing I did when loading up Tomb Raider was to peer into the normally depressing graphical setup menu. Depressing, as games released on both Console and PC usually neglect the needs of the modern PC enthusiast in favor of the easier to please and more numerous console gamers with their aging hardware. This usually stops the game from fulfilling its technical potential. Upon entry, I breath a sigh of relief. ‘Options, Thousands of them!’ I yell in my head in a really convincing Michael Caine voice. There is more choice here then I know what to do with. Tessellation, Aspect ratios SSAO, Motion Blur, V-Sync Exclusive Full screen Mode to avoid immersion spoiling Steam popups. Options galore. Square Enix are the forerunners in making excellent PC ports such as with Sleeping Dogs, and I think this is the best thus far. No restart needed to change anything making it very easy to optimise the settings for your rig. The newest feature is something called ‘TressFX’ A realistic hair option which makes Lara’s hair move naturally. Also worth mentioning the Key Mapping area. Not something I'll use but giving the players the option of using a keyboard is welcome. The only thing that pops out as missing for me, is the lack of a FoV slider. Not a huge issue in a Third Person game, but I'd still like to have that option.Tomb Raider been ported over with more than due consideration to the PC platform.How does it look?Upon starting a new game I am immediately stunned by the quality of the visuals. This is a very, very pretty game. Lighting is excellent as the random flashes of thunder and torch sequences will testify. Everything you expect to have a shadow does and reacts to multiple light sources.  Character models are well animated and Lara herself has some excellent animations in particular which are worthy of mention. She reacts to fire and wind by raising her hands and shielding her eyes. A simple yet, very welcome consideration which does well for immersion. Lara also reacts to unstable terrain by leaning on walls where possible. The cutscenes are rendered in the actual game engine for quick transition which is a good thing as this game is cutscene happy. More on that later. Some issues with slowdown in high clutter areas when using  the torch as the game struggles to show multiple shadows on multiple objects from multiple light sources but runs very smooth at a high resolution for the vast majority of the game. Textures are well done and the landscape design is really convincing. In the open world areas, nothing seems to have the straight lines of the old Tomb Raider and helps the immersion a great deal.The game is very pretty. Animations are excellent and Lighting is near perfect.How does it play?The first hour of the game finds you playing nothing more than an interactive movie. Your led from point A to point B with ease and the monotony of pressing forward is only broken by quick time events which lead directly into cutscenes. And their are hundreds of them. Cutscenes which explain something which could not possibly be done in the game are great but, this game seems only too happy throw cutscene after cutscene at you and that actually affected the pace of the game and ultimately, my enjoyment. The QTE’s are just as prevalent as the cutscenes but they have an interesting twist. If you fail a QTE, Lara usually dies but how she dies is usually brutal and genuinely shocking. So much so, you start to fail them on purpose to see what gruesome end Lara meets. But its ok, after failing a QTE, you're transported back to the start of it. So not much time lost.Outside the Cutscenes and QTE’s you do have an ‘open world’ to explore. Now, thats in brackets as its not a true open world. This is by no means a Far Cry open world. You're given the illusion of freedom like lots of games and this game hides the fact its not a true open world very well. Giving you long sprawling scenery to look at is great, just don't try and go to it. Invisible walls are usually well hidden. But you generally find that their is only one way to reach your destination and thats the way the developers want it. I don't like the hand holding.While exploring your ‘open world’ you are introduced to filler. This usually takes the form of collectables and hidden places in open world games and this is no exception. Collectables include scrap which you can use to upgrade your weapons. Experience and unlock system to provide boosts to certain abilities. Books and diaries which do a real good job of enhancing the major characters’ stories. Achievements in the form of ‘set fire to X amount X in this area.’ And my favorite. Discovering the locations of Tombs. (Think Assassins Creed)‘Survival instinct’ is a spammable ability which, like a sonar, pings the area around Lara and highlights anything of interest. And I mean ANYTHING. Scrap, chests, enemies, food, ammo all made very clear to you upon the press of a button.... where is the adventure in a system like that? Granted, some of the times its a very useful feature. identifying enemy locations for example, But being able to use it at anytime, any place is really upsetting to me. Surely, part of a Tomb Raider should be to find things via exploration?So far, you may have realised that the game is not the Tomb Raider of old in a new suit. It is like a lot of other modern games with an established franchise thrown in. But here, inside this QTE/cutscene fest of linear, plot driven action you find a nod to the great Tomb Raider of old. In this Tomb Raider, raiding tombs is optional. You can choose to revisit the puzzles of old and traverse the tight ledges and activate the pulley systems in search of collectables or new items. These puzzles are generally quite tricky and easily the most difficult part of the game but most will be solved with a simple trial and error approach. A very satisfying inclusion.Also worth mentioning is the A.I. The enemies react well and even call for help before approaching you. The game has an auto cover system which, when you approach a low wall for example, Lara will automatically use it. Great. The AI also try to burn you out of cover using Petrol Bombs. Great too. A stealth system also makes an appearance, but for me the third person camera is too close to get accurate feedback on the surroundings. There is also no in game minimap making it a bit more difficult to make a decision and any correct decision making in stealth just feels like luck.There is a near infinite amount of ammo. You're almost tripping over the stuff. For a mysterious island in a game billed as a survival/action, there's far too many arrows and bullets just lying about. Another example of hand holding.What's the writing like?Lara’s development from scared little girl to master tomb raider is the best part of the game for me. It happens a little fast, however the way the storey, voice acting and animations have been designed is to make you realise, Lara is desperate. She isn't ready for this. You empathise with her character and situation to a very highlevel making you genuinely care for her safety. Its a level of writing rare in RPG games, let alone an action game. For the way they portrayed Lara, I commend the writers. TLDR: Thumbs Up!"

Ending seems rushed and incomplete, too many loose plot points.Gameplay wise is where the game does shine, although it does have some issues.QTE's for explame, are a joke, as if someone said ""hey, most action adventure games have QTE nowadays, let's add some"".They ultimately add nothing new or fun, and if you add this to choppy cutscenes and lag, it actually hurts the experience.I arrived late to the TR party so I could not experience mutiplayer games at all. I tried several times and found not a single soul in any of the game modes,  but I must admit they sound like it would be fun, as combat and stealth action is probably the best of this game.It took me some time to complete to %100, and achievements are fun if you like to explore the game's vast environments.I definitely recommend this game if you are craving for a ""movie like"" action adventure with some amazing production values that you can spend some time in, just don't expect to be blown away by it's story or legacy.

Both graphically, and in style, the game is very, very pretty. Particle effects are everywhere, water looks like its really flowing, and the long draw distances create landscapes so beautiful that you will consider just stopping and staring at it for awhile. This game will definitely be a definitive graphical benchmark for the next year or two.The gameplay is familiar enough; a traditional third person cover shooter. You eventually develop a standard arsenal of firearms, any of which you can pull out of your ass at any time.  Occasionally you will run into a physics puzzle, but these are rarer than I would've liked. Most of them are genuinely interesting and clever, and the game doesn't seem to be aware of that. The shooting is good enough, but this is not the draw of the game.Firefights only make up a small portion of the approximately 20 hours playtime of Tomb Raider's single player. Most of the time is spent traversing  Crystal Dynamics' well-designed environments. There are plenty of secret tomb areas (they serve as some kind of collectible) that a player could completely bypass, and discovering all of these areas significantly extends playtime. Lara acquires skills over the course of the game, allowing her to climb cliffsides, jump up walls, and slide down ziplines to access new areas. In addition to skills, Lara also upgrades her weapons and tools throughout the game through the use of scrap metal that she finds across the game world.If none of this sounds especially new or original, that's because it's not. But everything is Tomb Raider is so polished that it stands above all the other games it borrows mechanics from (including its predecessors).My only big problem with Tomb Raider is its convoluted story. Lara's journey starts out simple enough; an archeaology expedition finds themselves in the middle of a storm and is washed ashore a mysterious island. Lara wakes up captured by...someone...and escapes to save her friends and get off the island. Some mysterious forces prevent her from doing so, and then the story takes some weird directions. No spoilers, but I don't think the story really goes anywhere meaningful, even though its main story points could've been put together into an epic tale. It instead comes off as kind of all over the place. The whole game has a very self serious tone, but the story gets so ridiculous that nothing really fits together. The voice acting and dialogue is passable, but nothing noteworthy.I didn't touch the multiplayer modes. I didn't hear very good things and the one time I tried them the servers were abandoned. Tomb Raider took me around 20 hours to beat, and for a $20 AAA title that is routinely on sale for <$10, I highly recommend it.There is no need to purchase the GOTY version or any of the DLC, as it is all multiplayer skins/weapons that cannot be used in single player."

The game seems like it's forcing you in a certain direction (the end of the game, of course) but you entirely have the option to go back to past camp sites and explore secret tombs as much as you want (until the last camp site). I haven't played a Tomb Raider game in a while but I was really excited to see how they incorporated Fast Travel, and it is awesome.The upgrade system was perfect for this game, collecting all of the weapon parts and salvage to fully upgrade your weapons for maximum damage and effectiveness was impressively fun. Especially getting the upgrades that allow you to find more salvage! I still don't think I've found all the secret stashes. They come in a few different varieties and are in some pretty imaginative places!The combat system was spectacular, not only shooting enemies but using the environment. Pulling down cover, knocking over towers, and blowing up barrels! I didn't end up doing a lot of melee fighting, I only used the special melee attacks a few times against regular enemies, mostly against the heavier targets.  The bow and really any of the weapons in their final forms are just awe-inspiring. The death scenes are pretty realistic and on the more graphic side, or at least I didn't die until I was going through the river rapids and a tree limb went through my brain.The climbing system was perfect for this style game, nothing had to be 100% accurate, as long as you hit the wall you were jumping to you would usually grab it unless you needed the pickaxe. I really enjoyed the game and got almost 80% completion on my first play-through. The camera and the gameplay work perfectly with a keyboard and mouse, I'll be trying it with the 360 controller on my second playthrough.I really had a great time playing this game and it was one of the few games that hooked me to the point where I had finished it within a matter of days and was ready to keep on surviving!"

656,Kaedwenii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaedwenii/,10,1,1,25.3,July,"4,",155,1,1,"I came to the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot as someone who never really played the old Tomb Raider games. I'm not going to be comparing it to the old Tomb Raider games because: a) I feel I'm not at liberty to do so having never played them, and b) I believe that a reboot should stand on its own, seeing as how the goal of a reboot is to forge a new path. With that said...Essentially I was drawn to it simply because of the premise: adventurer archaelogist girl crash-lands on an old mystical island and has to find a way to survive the experience, and get off the island.The premise is indeed here, but it's sort of lost in the over indulgence of gore and survivor-torture. There were many points in the game where I was like, ""Okay, I get it, she's a tough survivor but holy crap! That fall really should have killed her, honestly!"" And you'll have a lot of those moments, moments of ""oh...okay, not dead yet."" Now, the incredibly intense cinematics within this trope the game follows are honestly super impressive and one of my favorite aspects of the game. You'll have to run for your life to escape from a crumbling, burning building, dodge huge chunks of falling debris while hanging off the side of a mountain with only a pickaxe for stability, push a wolf off your leg before he gnaws it off - and the list goes on and on and on. While self-indulgent, these are the moments where Tomb Raider shines, where you don't quite realize how fast your heart was pounding until you get out of the treacherous situation in question. Where else does Tomb Raider shine? As a game from 2013 and what can truly be considered the first ""current-gen"" Tomb Raider, the island environments and gorgeous vistas they provide are really stunning. I experienced the game at highest graphical settings, and there were really some moments, staring off into the distance, that really took my breath away. The lighting is rich and varied, the weather systems are, for the most part, fairly dynamic. Environmental effects, such as fire, frost, and thunder, could be maybe just a little more intricate to match the incredible island areas as a whole, but that said, they do hold up nicely. The rain effects really should be commended, as there's already a lot going on, and even when there is, the rain still feels - and hinders your sight and abilities - as rain should. A lot of games around this iteration's conception have kind of missed the mark there, so... well done! Also commendable is Camilla Luddington's voice acting work, which was rich, varied, and nuanced. She does a great job at making you really feel like you're in Lara's shoes as she goes from scared, timid archaeologist to hardened survivor. Which brings me to the areas where Tomb Raider, unfortunately, does not shine. While Luddington's voice acting is nearly impeccable, the voice acting where other characters are concerned just really doesn't feel up to par. Maybe that's why Lara was the only character I felt truly invested in. The game clearly tries to show you which characters you should care most about, and does a lot to try and make you care for them, but in actuality, it just falls short. In the game's most pivotal moments, when my friends' lives hung in the balance, I found myself more excited about getting past this new development so I could get back to camp and upgrade my weapons, than I cared about my friend being in mortal danger. And this is where the cracks in Tomb Raider start to show. You don't really play it for the story, and I wouldn't dare tell someone to pick it up for that; you play it for the incredibly gorgeous views, the environments, the gripping interactive cinematics...As I've seen other reviewers note, the story is indeed lacking. I do think Tomb Raider got a little ahead of itself and tried to be an FPS, slightly open-world, action-adventure-exploration epic all at once, throwing in exploration itself as a last-minute thought, and the nuances got lost there. Exploration and upgrading is pretty standard for those familiar with upgrades in any other linear FPS game. Collect resources, upgrade your weapons, rinse and repeat. I did appreciate that there are a lot of choices presented in how exactly to take down your enemies as you approach late-game arsenal. In this way, having to take down hordes of enemies never really gets boring. Climbing and related activities actually work really well, even though I thought it'd be awkward trying to do so in third person, it's actually...not. Just... get ready for button mashing. And I mean button mashing.Playthrough (not going for 100% area completion, but taking time to see the sights, so to speak) took me a little over 19 hours. Overall, I think Tomb Raider can be recommended even though my review probably makes it sound like a mixed bag. I think you just have to remember that you came for the environment and cinematic moments, rather than the storytelling and oversaturated character development. So long as you remember that, you should enjoy your stay on Yamatai just fine. Well...maybe enjoy isn't the right word considering you'll be trying to survive... heh.Definitely worth a pick up if on sale, and maybe also even if not, if you're a Tomb Raider fan looking for a new take on the series with a good dose of an adrenaline rush."

A good story with great voice acting, good graphics and decent mechanics. There is little replay value, and multiplayer is dead. You can .This is meant to reboot the Lara Croft franchise. Lara's a young lady here, and the theme of this game - “how to survive” - sees her transition from a timid archaeologist to someone with confidence in what she knows. The transition is completely convincing, and makes the story ultimately compelling. Which is good, because a number of other factors don't work quite so well. Lara has a near-breakdown after killing her first human, but then proceeds to kill dozens of soldiers without a second thought (more stealth levels would have been great, but stealth only works in a few areas). Tumbling into a dusty vault and finding a body, she at one point declares, “I hate tombs!” (lol wut?!) The ending monologue has her say, “My father was right about so many things,” when her father is barely mentioned in the story.And don't think, because the game is called Tomb Raider, that there is actually relevant loot in the tombs. There isn't. The tombs themselves are a massive disappointment, being platform challenges for no obvious reward. All end with Lara heaving a chest or container open, giving a little gasp of surprise, and putting something in her pocket. We never get to see what. You do get a Salvage reward, but that's it.If you were looking for a fresh take on the older Tomb Raider games, well, you won't find it here. Lara only wields her dual .45s for a total of ten seconds. If you can accept Tomb Raider as reboot prequel of a bigger (and hopefully better) game to come, it's a fun shooter. But that's pretty much all it is.On DLC:The amount of DLC for this game is frankly ridiculous. $0.99 for the pistol silencer? How about another $0.99 for a burst-round mode?

675,Victor!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aliksy/,29,3,0,13.6,October,"21,",861,0,1,"Tomb Raider is at times a fun game, but I don't think it's a good game.   The pieces that are fun (murder) don't sit well with the story, and what should be the defining parts (puzzles and tomb exploration) are barely present. The parts where you shoot guys are reasonably fun.  You've got the usual sort of tools you'd expect in a murder game. Pistol, shotgun, rifle, and a bow that acts like a silenced sniper rifle. There are plenty of people to murder in lovingly rendered ways.  (Honestly, there are so many healthy, gun-toting men on the game's island it stretches credibility.)The parts where you explore the environment aren't very fun. There also aren't very many of them. There are very few parts where you need to puzzle out how to climb up someplace, or how to get past a trap.  Most of the things you can climb or interact with are clearly marked in white, and the routes you're expected to take are pretty straight forward.  When the game asks you to get to the top of a building, it's not very satisfying when the wall you can climb is highlighted for you. I don't feel like I solved anything.The story isn't particularly great. The plot isn't especially bad, but the execution is pretty deeply flawed. The biggest problem is the gap between Cut Scene Lara and Gameplay Lara.  Cut Scene Lara cries when she has to shoot a cartoonishly evil villain (They wanted to make sure you really got he was a bad guy, so they added some unwanted sexual advances. Subtle!).   Gameplay Lara gets bonus points for headshots and ""brutal executions.""   The touching scene where she cries over what she has done is comically undermined by this contradiction.  It is literally minutes between crying and cold blooded headshots.  Setting people on fire so they die screaming does not make her flinch.  This really, really undermines the character they tried to sell in the cutscenes.The game really does want you to murder people, too.  If you kill people, you get experience points, upgrade materials, and more ammo.  If you sneak past them, you get nothing.  There aren't really any non-violent or non-lethal options, either.  Conveniently, Lara is an expert with all the weapons she finds.  I don't think this was explained in-game, but she is capable of flawlessly reloading every weapon she finds even while under heavy fire.  She can aim perfectly.   I think she's supposed to be an archaelogist, not a special ops soldier.  This makes the shooty bits more fun, but it's also lazy and kind of stupid. Oh, and Lara is pretty much immortal as well.  It uses the same kind of health system as Portal.  There's no health UI, and you're good-as-new if you stop getting hit for a few seconds.  Considering how often people are shooting at you, that's probably the better option. I kind of hate backtracking for supplies in games anyway.   Still, it makes the combat pretty easy and that makes it a little unsatisfying. Lara is capable of some impressive gymnastics, of course. They do make a token effort at the start to show that it's scary for her, but that quickly goes away. I get that it's for gameplay purposes, but it isn't very good storytelling. There are also quick time events.  They are bad.  They are introduced poorly, too. I died a few times during the intro because I couldn't read the on screen prompt fast enough, and then because I misunderstood what it wanted me to do.  When you fail one, it's usually game over and a reload.  Not enjoyable.  Some of them also result in the graphic death of Lara, and that is not fun to watch.Sometimes the story forces you to do stupid things. There's a part that made me roll my eyes and walk away from the computer. It was a bad decision Lara made that was also unecessary, and the game didn't even pretend to it was a player choice.  Sometimes the game wants to be a movie, I guess.That's all the complaints I have about it for right now.  It's a murder sim with some very light jumping action, and a story that doesn't match the gameplay.   The shooty parts are kind of fun, I guess, but overall the game is unsatisfying.  I keep thinking about what else it could have been."

I have played several games from Lara Croft in the past, compared to them this one is more centered in the story and action, for me pretty good decision being more for general players. The combat reminds me of Last of Us wich I played a little ago, but wiht a lot less stealth (at least in Normal difficulty) and exploring is really interesting. So a con for this game may be that if you are looking for puzzles like before games you will be a little disapointed, there are some, in form of optional locations, but are pretty easy.Good things:- Beautiful environment, graphics, art, etc, you can see it.- An interesting story, with cutscenes, talking.- Is an open-world, you get experience, weapons, skills as you progress to not be repetitive. A lot of collectives to explore and a good movement system.- Good action, with melee combat, stealth and tricks.- There are QTE events BUT they are not random buttons, they are predefined so they have more sense. They are cool and actually loosing them for seeing the death animation is pretty impresive.Bad things:- I would like real challenge puzzles but well it has been really fun.P.D.

698,SDF-7,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032159884/,16,,0,37.2,October,"19,",389,0,1,"The Good:    The graphics for the time were very good and to me still hold up today.    The story (if you try to find all the little hidden items) fleshes out nicely and sets a good mood for Lara's evolution from a more recognizably ""normal"" young woman into the nascent Tomb Raider we expect.    Gameplay mechanics are introduced in a reasonable fashion, tutorials are pretty obvious but do their job of guiding you given this was a reboot and a fresh interface.    The tombs that are there are atmospheric.The bad:   Quick Time Events. Expect to see Lara die horribly a few times because you don't have your controller layout memorized or just weren't expecting a QTE at that moment.   Not enough / not complex enough puzzles. For a puzzle-based franchise at its heart, making this much more of a shooter is disappointing. (The next game Rise tried to bring in more puzzles and did a little better, imho Shadow slid back a bit -- but none of the new trilogy is really puzzle / exploring centric to me).Overall, I enjoyed the game back in the day and on a few replays. Same with Rise - and while I never finished all the DLC on Shadow it was fine.So why the ""Not recommended?"".... well, there's now The Ugly:    Multiplayer in the whole trilogy (including this game where MP was really never a focus) has been converted over to a framework using Epic Games. You'll be encouraged to link your Steam account to a EGS account.That's not inherently bad, and I'm sure there are reasons for it (supposedly more cross platform, etc.) -- except that you can't start the game in any fashion that doesn't talk to the EGS servers (Offline mode, using hosts files to redirect the IPs to localhost, etc.) Which means that this game I've had for years and only care about Single Player... now would always ping EGS if I want to play it. And doubtless passes basic system information / identifiers to check in. And who knows what else, as EGS doesn't have the best reputation when it comes to data integrity.Also concerning is that post-EGS patch, the game now consumes 100% of a single core (where it did not before). Which strongly implies either it is really persistently checking MP / network state or otherwise phoning home a *lot* or doing some data mining or whatnot... either bad programming or bad ethics. Don't really need to know which one.Given The Ugly - I'm afraid I can't recommend the game, and have uninstalled the trilogy. I can't support such a radical change in behavior and functionality forced onto existing customers. Yes, EULAs and the whole ""you only own the copy you have to make transfering from your drive to RAM!"" scheme makes it legal, but frankly I find it unethical to change such things. As such, Square Enix has now joined my personal list of publishers I won't be considering in the future."
699,Lord Weh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/,4,,1,16.7,August,"14,",464,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a reboot of the popular franchise, an ernest attempt to set it back on track. The resulting game feels like 'Uncharted' by way of 'Lost', marooning Lara on a mysterious island covered in the wreckage of dozens of other wrecks from ancient wooden boats to giant metal tankers. Separated from the other survivors, Lara attempts to reconvene with them and come up with a plan to escape, whilst uncovering the truth about the island.The story is fairly simple and a little predictable, but moment-to-moment it is interesting and engaging. The environments, whilst not particularly varied, feel interesting to explore and there are many hidden secrets that can be found with a little investigation and lateral thinking. Whilst the game itself is notable in the lack of tombs to raid, there are several tombs dotted about as bonus secret areas that you can uncover and complete, and whilst these are small, they each have an interesting puzzle inside that needs solving to get the loot.As a character, Lara is a little more real here than in any previous game, more grounded, more relatable. This means that the struggle to survive, to uncover the mystery of the island and escape feels more engaging and a little more personal. There are a few moments where the game stumbles from this grounded reality and falls into action movie / game trope territory, but it generally recovers and leaves you invested in Lara's struggle to survive.Tomb Raider feels like the relevant reboot the franchise needed, a welcome change to what came before, and has the potential to become a new classic series in its own right."
700,PixelGrotto,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PixelGrotto/,6,,1,20.4,August,"6,",659,0,1,"Good reboot that brings Tomb Raider to the modern era by making Lara a more believable character and checking off all the boxes for a game in the 2010s - (semi) open world, lots of doodads to collect and plenty of huge set pieces which are basically straight from Uncharted, which is funny because Uncharted was originally codenamed ""Dude Raider"" or something like that, and now everything has come full circle. (Both Lara Croft and Nathan Drake are grandchildren of Indiana Jones, who is himself a grandchild of the pulp heroes of the 30s, so it's all good.) There are a few issues. The story, with Lara getting shipwrecked on an island and BECOMING A SURVIVOR (!!!) starts off interesting but becomes very predictable, and Lara's crewmates kinda made me think of the Scooby Doo gang after a while, which probably isn't a compliment. The Quicktime events can be tiresome, and Lara takes so much punishment over the course of the game as a means of making the player care about her that it starts to become ridiculous, especially when she shrugs off falling down a river and getting every bone in her body bruised like it's nothing. In general, though, the Japanese island environment is interesting and combat is great, which I think is a first for a Tomb Raider game. Crystal Dynamics also worked very hard at moving Lara beyond her old characterization, which was essentially little more than ""hot British woman who's badass in a 90s comic book kind of way."" Sometimes they don't quite succeed - Lara occasionally feels like the typical female protagonist in a horror game/film now, which is also a trope. Overall, though, she's much more relatable than she was before, and a scene near the end where she gets a certain weapon and begins mowing fools down is very empowering. Also, she has her own equivalent of Detective Vision, which made me lol. Games in the 2010s!"

The game pushes you along at a great pace, when it wants you to feel safe it'll let you explore and can fill you with a sense of dread and need to move forward with a sense of urgency when needed. The enemies even on hard mode are very dull, and don't pose much of a challenge but there's a lot of ways alloted to the player to progress through the story, be it stealth or charging through the front with an asortment of weaponry. A majority of the game involves some sort of parkour element attached to it which can be fun to explore with. As you progress in the game you can salvage resources and gain exp which are used to upgrade equipment and skills. Like most exploration games, you can expect a lot of side missions and collectables in which the game can be expanded for a few more hours. This is almost essential being a Tomb Raider franchise, it'd be inherently nonsensical to not have collectibles littered everywhere, but the game does a great job of letting you use your survival skills and map presence to be able to locate and find them without feeling like a giant backtracking sidequest. Achievements and collectibles let you go back to them later on in the game, so you won't feel like you're missing out.Honestly I really didn't pay much attention to the music. The voice acting on the other hand was amazing. The voice actors really made the game. They brought a sense of depth and life to the characteres that made them feel real.Now here's where the game really shines. Gorgeous graphics, even on the little tiny details placed throughout the world, from incidental carvings thrown away in a fleetin gmoment as you run past, to the way Lara interacts with the environment, how she shivers from the cold and crosses her arms or the way she shakes from exertion. The environment is riddled with beautiful movie-esque quality shots everywhere, giving you a plethora of opportunities to turn regular screen shots basically anywhere in the game to background wallpapers. Characters are well fleshed out, yet none more specifically than Lara, who's modelled after the real life hottie Megan Farquhar. She will give you plenty of times to hit that screen capture button, that's for sure.Pros:Replaced:    Cons:Fast paced action-adventure-exploration game with gorgeous visuals. I might've liked this game a lot more when it first came out 5 years ago but it definitely has held up to the test of time."

710,Pointnclickster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/,12,,1,45.4,January,"28,",486,1,1,"This was a really really fun game. Infuriating at times, but still fun. First the positives. The game is gorgeous. The island is wonderful to explore and the environments are very distinct. It is obvious a lot of love went into creating this island world. While the opening cinematic is a tease, since the rest of the game isn't nearly as photo-realistic, it's enough to hook you into the adventure. Another huge positive is the amount of shinies! There are relics and documents everywhere to flesh out the history of the island. Honestly. I think they could do a DLC off the strength of one of the documented stories. The controls for the most part are very smooth and it is easy to manage Laura over the rough terrain she faces. I loved the blend of adventure and action. You get to solve puzzles and shoot stuff and look for shinies! Something for everybody!      Now the negatives. While I did love this game, I don't have a blinding love to all things Lara Croft. My first problem: the title. Lara is no tomb raider in this game. She is a young woman trying to survive a shipwreck and save her fellow shipmates from a cursed island. Yes, she does visit tombs, but they are optional tombs, and they are not nearly as elaborate as the tombs from past TR games. More on that later. The emphasis in this game is ""you are a Croft, Lara."" If anything, this game should have been called ""Croft: The Makings of a Tomb Raider"" or something like that. This a personal gripe, but I feel that the title does not show the true emphasis of the game. A mixed positive and negative is the almost superhuman pain threshold Lara has. Its truly amazing what she lives through, and she's only wearing a tank top and cargo pants! On the other hand, she is very human. SHe is sometimes daunted by the trials she faces. She even states at one point, ""I hate tombs."" When she jumps, she doesn't always land perfectly. So, in some ways she is very human. The next moment, I am wondering why she hasn't had gangrene or hypothermia set in. Now the tombs. They are pathetic. As if running across tribal markings wasn't enough, the game feels the need to tell you that a tomb is nearby. All but one of the tombs are optional, and they are small, and usually have only one puzzle to solve it. when Lara opens the treasure chest in the tomb, I get the feeling of Link opening a large chest from Ocarina of Time. It's the same vibe. A game called Tomb Raider should have tombs that aren't optional. So there are my negatives: Lara can't decide if she should be a super hero, the tombs are laughable, and the title does not fit the emphasis of the game.     A long review for me, but I could talk more about it, but thats what discussions are for. The story is a bit cliche'd in places, but it is so fun to play that it really doesn't matter. As I said, the negatives are really personal. If you don't have a problem with them, then this game is pretty near perfect. It's a lot of fun and I'm glad this is the first TR game I have played and beaten. I would say this is a good intro for those interested in the world of Lara Croft."

(GTX970, FX-8370)+Amazing atmosphere /w prerendered and ingame cutszenes+Gripping story and vivid characters+Leveling system and weaponmodding+Open world+Great level design makes for a very fluid gameplay+Intuitive controls+Different climbing techniques/equipment+Playing with mouse/keyboard works fine+Additional side-dungeonsCons:-Very low difficulty. I played the game on hard (highest dif.) and enemy combat strength also on hard but aside from 2-3 instances I never felt the need to switch from pistol and bow to a more powerful weapon. Even when using just the pistol you won't even come close to running out of ammo.-This also makes leveling system and weaponmodding almost a non-factor.-Even though the game is technically an open world game, gameplay is very linear. There are no sidequest or different story paths so the only reason to go back would be to 100% the game by getting all collectables.-Occasional low res textures in the open world-Directed camera while climbing will cost you a few lives in some situations-Few puzzles compared to older titles of the franchiseConclusion:While not being challenging the Tomb Raider reboot is a fun game to play nonetheless. The marvelaous graphics, story and setting make for a gripping experience almost like playing a movie.PS: Multiplayer in a game like this is irrelevant to me which makes most of the DLCs in the season pass irrelevant as well.

However, this game is totally different from what I played from Tomb Raider series and I loved it.So, instead of a mature hot looking woman, we see basically a student girl which accidentally must grow up and survive on an island full of monsters. But the thing is that these monsters are not cliché monsters – like in previous games, instead – they are human beings. That reminds me of an idea from Scooby Doo that “the real monster are humans”. The game has elements of a shooter with few tombs full of blood and skeletons. What I also liked about the game is that we can explore background of Lara’s crewmates, how the cultists from the island became who are they now and historical relics.  However, sometimes the amount of shooting and killing overtakes all the satisfaction from tombs and relics exploration. The screenplay of the game was a little predictable, but very enjoyable and emotional. The adventures of Lara Croft no longer look easy-going like Indiana Jones style, but instead became dark and serious. For those (like me) who aren’t fans of shooter games and especially who expected typical Lara Croft games, the process of acceptance and understanding of the interpretation of Lara Croft character will take some time. What I can tell for sure, is that the creators perfectly could show all the despair and hopelessness of Lara: whether it is her first kill of a deer or literally all the skulls which she needed to step on the way to salvation.If you are fine with blood and brutal elements in games and ready to discover for yourself a new redefining of Lara Croft character – this game is for you."

But any gamer wud recognize the most popular female video game character of all time in an instant. This reboot gives her a much needed Origin story & Camilla Luddington does an excellent job of bringing a highly likable protagonist to life. + Graphics are Incredible - this is High settings on 768p & FB reduces Pic quality - so u can Imagine how better it cud look! + Story - Perfect blend of Adventure & Myth. Lara's origin story is dark and gritty yet fun at the same time. The character development shown throughout is believable. + Gameplay - Controls are fine, Great Auto-Cover system, Exploring the island for Tombs & Rewards is satisfying which acts as the catalyst for the well thought out Progression system, Enemy AI is good, basically just traversing the area with custom ziplines and killing bad guys with Lara's trademark Bow is fun! - - - :- Multiplayer - Pretty generic with Few maps and modes. This game doesnt even need MP in the first place. - Charted Territory - This game certainly reminds me of Uncharted in terms of almost everything. There's not a lot of original content in this.

Multiplayer is deader than dead, and given that almost 50% achievements need this mode, yeah, good luck with that.Now, on the bright side, this game is great! It's not too short or too long to make you desperate. It has cool gameplay mechanics, and the updates you pick up on the go makes you feel stronger, and with the new acquired tools, you are able to backtrack and unlock certain areas to 100% them. Puzzles are rather easy, but i do get it, since this is an action-adventure game.I totally recommend it, especially how cheap it is nowadays (on sale ofc)...BUT, I don't suggest you to pick up the GOTY edition, since most of it are multiplayer-only and just one single tomb, not worth the extra money IMHO."

The camera just wobbles in a rather weird way and combined with the FOV, it makes it unplayable for me instantly. I had to install some shady patch/trainer to fix it.Despite that, and a terribly boring intro sequence that almost made me fall asleep with cutscenes and never ending tips and tutorials, I was enjoying the game after that and I wish I could play it without feeling nausea, but the fix I was deleted by my antivirus and I would rather not install weird things just to play the game. I was rather interested into playing it since I played a lot of the original Tomb Raider 2 when I was a kid and others, but just remember that this is a way different experience with all the cutscenes, map markers, highlighted items, tutorials, experience system, cinematic and all of those, that modern games have."

728,arrekkusu-,https://steamcommunity.com/id/katal1nnn1/,10,1,1,68.9,November,"25,","1,288",0,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) is Crystal Dynamics's reboot of the ongoing franchise with the same name. Unlike any previous installment, the reboot is something of a departure from the classic ones putting more emphasis on the survival genre than the exploration-puzzle specialty Tomb Raider was known for.This is Lara Croft's origin story presenting her starting career in the arts of exploration. Lara's first journey leads her to an island called Yamatai in the Land of the Rising Sun, Japan, where her objective is to save her friends and escape from the island while being hunted down by a malevolent cult known as the Solarii Brotherhood, worshipers of Queen Himiko, former ruler of Yamatai.Gameplay wise, Tomb Raider presents elements of platforming, puzzle, shooting, quick-time events and one of my favorites, stealth. While you can play most of the game stealthy, there are moments where the game forces you to take the pew pew path.  For the old fans of the franchise one of the biggest disappointments were the puzzles and the challenge tombs that felt like some cheap upgrade collecting hubs. You won't go in this reboot expecting to find the same challenging puzzles that the previous installments offered. The game also incorporates rpg elements,  this enables players' skills and abilities to be upgraded in specific ways. Besides the main story the game includes exploration of the island, revisiting certain locations and collectibles.Putting aside the game graphics which are really stunningly beautiful, the small attention to details made me fall in love with this game. For instance, Lara being covered in dirt then walking in a pool, you'll find a lot of the dirt has suddenly been washed off or being wounded at the start of the game, holding one of her hands on the wound and the other one using it to support herself on the walls of the environment, that made the game feel more alive and responsive to your actions.In summary, Crystal Dynamics created one of the most enjoyable and gorgeous games in the action-adventure genre, that appealed to veterans of the franchise and the new fans, a true masterpiece, presenting the evolution of one of the most loved characters from the gaming world, Lara Croft."

In fact, the tombs were optional. OPTIONAL!!! Not to mentions they were single rooms with one dinky puzzle that a chimpanzee could solve blindfolded. Are you kidding me??No, this game is pure shooter. Murder, murder, murder. Granted, Uncharted has a lot of this, but it's balanced with interesting puzzles, unique environments, great characters and compelling stories. Guess which one of these elements Tomb Raider is missing? ALL OF THEM. This game has NOTHING going for it, unless you're in it for the violence. The worst part: the violence. Now, I love gratuitous violence in the right context (Mortal Combat? Dead Space? Resident Evil 4? Grand Theft Auto?) but in the wrong context, it can feel exploitative. In this case, it feels like torture porn. It made me physically uncomfortable. No, not just because I'm a woman and Lara is a woman, although she DOES get sexually assaulted in the beginning of the game (I'm sorry, WHAT? I came here to raid tombs FFS). Not to mention the cheap/tacky/lazy trope of a woman being sexually assaulted as part of her progression to being a badass fighter, like just stop. Who is letting men write characters like this?? The death scenes are too much. They are rendered in so much detail, and some of them are very lengthy. All of these terrible things happen to Lara throughout the entire game, it's nonstop, neverending, the time spent animating these things. The expressions on Lara's face during some of these scenes, and the voice acting... it often doesn't read as pain, and reads more as sexual. It feels like someone's sick fantasy. Keep it in your fanfiction, thanks in advance.It doesn't help that the director said, ""When people play Lara, they don't really project themselves into the character. They're more like 'I want to protect her.' You start to root for her in a way that you might not root for a male character."" Gross, man. I certainly don't feel that way. I don't see Lara getting impaled in the neck a tree branch, seeing the life drain out of her body, and feel the need to ""protect."" I feel my skin crawl. As a woman, I wouldn't look at Nathan Drake being impaled on a spike after missing a jump and say ""these horrible death scenes inspire me to protect him."" Sexist trash. Besides, no one needs a ""reason"" to prevent a character from dying in a videogame, because screwing up and dying means you don't progress. Literally the entire MO of most videogames.I'm not saying a person can't (or shouldn't) enjoy this game, but I sure couldn't."

Its a third-person shooter, which involves combat with numerous enemies, but includes stealth and climbing. The game plays a lot like Uncharted, and I think that it is just as good, if not better. You play through a surprisingly lengthy story mode, where you are stranded on island, attempting to escape the dangers that lurk there. You shoot and climb your way though the beatiful landscape, enhaced by astounding graphical performance. Along the way, you can upgrade your weapons and abilities, helping you overcome some of the tougher enemies in the game. The need to upgrade your equipment forces you to explore the vast island. And even though the island is filled with hidden tombs and areas, the story is still pretty linear. You can choose wether you would like to challenge yourself with the difficult puzzles of the hidden tombs, or you can simply play through the main game. Either way you play, your bound to be satisfied. I played through the main campaign, exploring two or three of the tombs, and searching for a a few artifacts here and there.

Not that it was a bad thing for either your heart is pumping or you mind is racing, but I suppose that would be my one criticizing of the game; so much happens that makes it hard to believe Laura should be walking up-right, let alone shooting dudes with one hand while zip-lining with the other, while carrying one of her companions on her back, while making archeological remarks about a shiny penny she found on the ground, while falling head first into a ravine (and coming out unscathed), etc. It IS a game, and a fictitious one at that, so it isn’t a big problem but I’m just addressing an aftertaste I had after reaching the end credits.Overall it was an exhilarating experience with a tinge of sci-fi that can quench any gamers desire for being a badass archeologist who would burn down an entire island to the ground before seeing her useless-in-combat but emotional-baggage friends die at the hands of macho thugs who believe in wind fairies. Typical Laura stuff.Oh, and there’s samurais."
748,CorvusCorax,https://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/,7,,1,43.8,March,"20,","1,442",0,1,"This is a different Tomb Raider. It is important to say this at the very beginning as those expecting the same Tomb Raider are in for a not very nice surprise. I guess approaching it from the ""origin story"" perspective makes more sense than saying this is a reboot. Why? Because when the word reboot is articulated people start believing this is exactly the same TR game they played 15 years ago - a game with a lot of running, climbing and puzzle sequences. This ""reboot"" put a lot of emphasis on telling us how Lara became the fierce explorer, the femme fatale we got to know years ago. But all this is told via an action-packed story. So, most of what you'd expect from this game are there: next-gen graphics and voice acting, unnecessary and mediocre multiplayer mode, collectibles, dozens of achievements and oh, next gen graphics. Really some of the scenes look stunning and the pictures posted on the store page are not taken from rendered cutscenes if you believe that.You still climb a lot. And run and jump. And there's also ziplining. Still, combat is also there and some people may hate the Quick Time Events that nowadays more and more games use. We do not, however, have many tombs to raid. There are artifacts we can find there but really we only have half of dozen such places to explore. The rest, well, they are varied and you will later on return to gather some extra collectibles with the new abilities you have obtained. There are some minor RPG elements here as you receive XP and level up and you can also ""salvage"" which acts as the ingame currency. You can also hunt some animals.I liked Tomb Raider. I realised 15 years had passed and did not, therefore, expected the same experience but with next-gen graphics. Also, I believe the trailers speak for themselves. You may not like the new TR if you are the fan of the franchise due to its puzzles. If you can accept a more action-oriented version of Lara Croft I'm sure you will not be disappointed, though."

This game is much less about raiding actual tombs and more a cover-based shooter built around exploring a mysterious and dangerous island. Lara isn't the wisecracking badass she is in other games here, instead she starts off as a newly-minted Ph.D on an expedition that goes terribly wrong. The game makes her transformation into a hardened warrior very convincing and for me, a compelling experience.There are downsides - I was annoyed by periodic quicktime events that seemed ill-suited for mouse and keyboard (the game was definitely designed with a controller in mind). While you can fast travel between areas you've discovered already, the game is fairly linear, and the few tombs you actually raid are brief and not particularly challenging. Certain boss-type enemies required silly ""read-the-onscreen-prompt-and-mash-the-matching-button"" sequences. And for a Tomb Raider game, you do spend a lot of time shooting bad guys.But all that aside, this prequel/reboot to the Tomb Raider franchise is a lot of fun. The scenery and spectacle are frequently amazing, it looks very good and performed admirably on my mid-range laptop, and it kept me engaged through to the end despite occasional and minor annoyances. If you're new to the franchise, I'd say this would be a good time to jump in."

The graphics are beautiful for a 2013 game and the game machanics are simple and easy to pick up. Some problems I have(maybe because I play alot of games) is the game itself is to easy. I didn't feel like I was being challenged hard enough by puzzles and or enemys. It all just came across as simple and mindless to play. There are alot of points in the game you literally just spam out a button at the right time. The other problem I had was it felt short and the beginning felt much more dense then the end. I just felt like it was more of a story experience then actual challenging game. The written story was good and the characters actually fit in well with their roles, it just didn't create that feeling of accomplishment when I finished it.Online Multiplayer:Horrible don't even think about buying any of the dlc for online, if you do find players they are usually online because they want to try it out for the first time and leave or play for achievements. There was literally no point of putting this rip off search and destroy/team deathmatch COD rip off in the game. The maps were literal scratch from the game and it was an excuse to make extra money. The devs made another big mistake with the multiplayer by making 15 of the obtainable achievements only accessible in multiplayer. Since the tiny playerbase only is on for like 4 hours every day you have to find friends in the community to help gain achievements.....And they added a ranked mode which has literally no rank just a identical copy of the casual mode called ranked. I had a painful time playing in private lobby for hours upon hours just to get all 50 achievements, just make sure you go into this game with knowledge of the garbage multiplayer because this game was meant to be single player.Final Score: 7/10 Not the best"

Play it anyway, and man up!The game is a visual treat from start to finish. The scenery is lush and detailed, the character models and animations are superb and everything about it is just wonderful to look at. Audio is also equally fantastic, the soundtrack is perfect for the situations it's used in and the voice acting is top-notch. It runs smoothly and plays just fine with PC controls, but you can also use an Xbox 360 controller at any time if you prefer."

767,Sweet Baby Carrots,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetbabycarrots/,4,,1,27.8,January,"9,",174,0,1,"Disclaimer: never really played the older Tomb Raider games before.Awesome game. The visuals are gorgeous even though I have to tone down the graphics settings a fair bit due to having a potato laptop. It's fairly linear and I agree with reviews that say it plays a bit like a movie as there is a fair bit of scripted sequences. I probably spent 3x the amount of time completing the optional objectives compared to the main story. The optional tombs are kind of easy, except for one where it took me some time to figure out where to jump. Solve one puzzle and you're done, so it feels a bit underwhelming. A feature I appreciate is that you are allowed to backtrack to complete accomplishments that you weren't able to complete in earlier parts. That said, some of the things are really hard to spot even if you use survival instincts. In general, the puzzles are quite easy which I suppose makes the game accessible to newcomers to the franchise like me.I find the QTE parts quite challenging, probably the toughest part of the game. For most of them I usually end up dying once or more times since you are given such a short time to react. There were also some parts where it wasn't clear where to go and I have to fall to my death several times before I figured it out.I'm a bit surprised at some of the encounters where you face waves of enemies. Sometimes it feels more like a mass-killing machine type shooter game (don't know what the correct term for that type of game) rather than a survival action. I like the variety of weapons, alternate firing modes, and the finishing moves. I like that the enemies will scramble and take cover to make it harder for you to hit though sometimes they seem to have bad aim, expose half their body when taking cover, and take a long time to fire so mostly the fights are fairly easy. There's also a health regeneration system so as long you don't take too much damage in a short amount of time you'll fully recover. Seriously, Lara is probably a superhuman, jumping and climbing around like nothing given the insane amount of injuries she sustained throughout the game.I like climbing around and exploring the terrains and structures. I feel like going ""wheeee~"" whenever I slide down a rope.  The view when you climb up really high is just breathtaking and at the same time triggers my fear of heights. There were some parts where I spent too much time figuring out how to solve until later on it turns out that the required tools have to be unlocked by plot."

It's amazing !After the game had been released I always talked bad about this ""new Lara Croft"" What is this, it's a shooter and not a Tomb Raider game anymore (judging by gameplay videos and watching friends playing the game a bit)But then, about two weeks ago I saw this game in the Midweek Madness section and said to myself - hey, for that low price, you could really give it a try at least.And now, about 20 hours later ...

Not too much shooting, and it's really kinda fun to shoot them dudes up :D+ Great upgrading system for her skills & weapons+ Controls & movement+ Voice acting+ Length of game (every player is different, took 20 hours for me to complete with all the side quests)+ Different weapon modes and stealth kills---------------------------------------------- Could be more puzzles in this game, like in the classic games 1-3- She cannot swim- There's a glitch, that you cannot finish the game with 100 % I didn't get one document so I'm stuck at 99 % :(Besides that, I ain't got nothing bad to say :)If you were like me and you are hating this game and didn't play it for at least 2-3 hours - try it out !

774,mendel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mendelde/,5,,1,41.2,April,"25,","4,205",0,1,"You will love this . It's a huge departure from previous TR games that had you control a Barbie Doll with shooters along a fairly linear run. Granted, Lara is still shimmying along ledges and shooting baddies, but large parts of the game have lost their linearity and are now open areas that you can scour for story content and loot. The enemies are better, your own tactical possibilities are better, the physics and the physics puzzles are better, and the storyline is vastly better. This game is an adventure and a shooter and an exploration game, and it does all of these things well. The graphics and physics have improved enormously, and together with the competent voice acting (extraordinary in the case of the German voice for Lara, Nora Tschirner), it all comes together to make a huge immersive experience that took me over 30 hours to complete 100% -- on easy. There was never a boring moment. (Some of the boss fights have something of the old TR, you need to do a special move and then hit him just right, and that three times in a row; also, some of the quick-time-events break immersion, but we're talking minutes out of many hours of gaming.)I've played different versions of Tomb Raider before, and don't recall ever making it to the end of the first level. This one, I couldn't put it down. If you own it and haven't played it, you don't know what you're missing. Do play at least into ""Coastal Forest"" (you should get at least to the part with the wolves) and ideally up into ""Mountain Village"", which is the first really huge level. (You will realize how huge later, when you learn to shoot and traverse ropes.) If your computer supports it, do turn on ""Tress Effects"", which makes Lara's hair appear as single strands. I played with all settings maxed (except for AA) and a resolution of 1280x720 (reduced for framerate) on a 24"" monitor, and the game looked gorgeous. But it's not the looks, it's the gameplay that kept me hooked."

The gameplay is a mix of classic Tomb Raider exploration (in the best possible way) and more modern and intimate combat systems. The visuals are frequently incredible and certainly underrated.  Strong voice acting drives a great story that will have you transfixed up to (and past) the game's final cresendo. 10/10 from this reveiwer - I couldn't imagine it being better.As an added bonus - the multiplayer is actually very fun and has a small but dedicated community.

778,Valtheknight,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029852280/,5,,1,11.5,April,"6,",528,0,1,"TOMB RAIDER.Firstly, i must let you know that i only played the original series, on Playstation at my friends place which was mostly just faffing around and the.. Chronicles Demo on PC. So i'm pretty much unbiased when it comes to Tomb Raider series. Since most people nowadays totally ignore the legacy where certain game comes from, closest notable (in my opinion) is XCOM. The Firaxis  remake and the, eas it 3rd-person shooter.. Which i heard was.. MEH at best. But i'm getting sidetracked.Tomb Raider follows the exploits of Lara Croft on her first expedition to seek an mythical tomb of an ancient Empress. And i cannot say anything more about the plot because i try to avoid spoilers.On the subject of storyline, i finished it in 10 hours if Steams playtime-meter is to be trusted. And this was with SOME faffing around some of the optional tombs an collectables. I finished the game at 77% Completion and that in 10 hours, might show some padding towards its length. However since i can somewhat give the optional time wasting on EXP-Grindings part, i think if you just blast the main storyline i'm sure it can be done under 7 hours. And since the story is (what i can see) about Laras development into the iconic heroine as portrayed in the original series.. So blasting through the story, might cause you to ignore the character development and other fine details altogether. The story was.. Okay. And i really cannot explain it that well, this is like trying to explain the storyline of any of the movies to someone. So with that excuse i shall escape stage left...Into the second part, which is the gameplay.Standard 3rd-person affair. Jump, climb but no crouch for some reason, unless you are in a fight situations. Which i will get to in a bit.. Basically, the gameplay consist of running around the area, climbing on those certainly obvious ledges and wall-kick jumps. But the heavier part of this is the combat, of dear...Combat, like in the previous paragraf. is the standard 3rd-person action affair. Taking cover in some conviniently placed chest-high walls and stuff.... Although the game somewhat tries to urge you to do it stealthily, which i did not succeed, even with intense trying. Since it kinda looks like that stealth is viable to a certain point and then you are forced to pull out the big guns and pulverize some fools. And speaking of weapons, the bow... I noticed that it might be possible to pass the game with just the bow, i'm pretty sure it can be done. Since the enemies suffer from the same ""I'm sure in perfect cover right now""-Syndrome which caused the halfwits to position that way that their head is visible. And they give enough time for you to aim and fire the bow. Some of the enemies rush you, which when you get the counter-maneuver can be gotten rid of with a matter of seconds.. But lets get rid of the tangent before i say something offensive...Visuals and music are.. somewhat forgettable. I cannot at the time of writing, about 15-minute after competing the game. Remember any part of the soundtrack. Other that the pounding music during combat...Visually, the game is also semi forgettable. Although you would think, that a semi-tropical (or atlest in the Tropical climate-zone) Would have some vibrant greens and lots of foliage.. Instead you are treated so somewhat bland sortie of bleak forests , broken down bunkers, decaying villages and other equally imaginative areas. I might sound a bit biased, but that is because i have been playing FarCry 3 recently.  And after playing other bleak visual games i just get easily turned off.Otherwise, passing some of my pet-peeves. I feel that the game is good. Even if i'm turning a bit naggy with it.The strongest part of the game, is the storyline. And nothing much else, everything else feels... Hmmh.. I think the only way i can portray my thoughts is, to say that everything else feels unnecessary. Not really contributing in any way, like i said, i felt as the games length was padded. And like i also said, everything else pretty much only serves EXP-Grinding and nothing much else. But can that be an excuse ? Not really, and can the soryline carry the game ? Yyyyyyes ? I think. Although thinking about the story just made me remember some of the the obvious plot twists...ARRRR... Me brain!Anyway.. Tomb Raider is a reasonable story experience, even with some of the minor quirks it has. Although some friends of the original series might find this SECOND reboot, (Yes i DOUBLE checked that if i was correct.) A bit more in tune with the originals and also making some newer generation compromises a bit... Meh.Trust me, there is a treasure at the end of this Tomb, this, renmant of the gaming culture wrapped around is a see-trough vale of next generation graphics.Tomb Raider get a rather reasonable: B, as in BUM."

I've never cared about the Tomb Raider franchise or Lara ever before. This game made me feel some empathy for her character and adventure.This game, while riddled with problems, is pretty fun for the most part. The story plays out like a bad early 90's movie. The side characters are horribly written and annoying as hell. I crossed my fingers for them to all die. The only good characters are the Crofts. It doesn't really make sense to have these annoying characters since they do nothing in the game and Lara is the main focus. There are action moments that are bordering ridiculous and entertaining. I found myself either laughing at or laughing with the game. You'll know what I mean with you encounter them. The game only fails when the game tries to make take these scenes with a straight face instead of humor.The gameply is a mix of boring boring boring faux-exploration and fun firefights. It's similar to the Zelda or Batman Arkham games. It's a linear game with an open world feeling. You'll open new areas depending on the tools/weapons you're carrying. The puzzles can range from overly simplistic to convolutedly difficult. None of these puzzles are at the very least realistic.Tomb Raider steals a lot from multiple games yet it does a lot well. The cross bow is maybe the best cross bow action I've ever played. You pretty much start with the cross bow yet later in the game you'll have access to other weapons and guns. But I mostly stuck with just the cross bow because it was so much fun. The game is at its best when you're in peril. Either horror-esque moments, survivalist-danger moments, or firefight-action moments. There are several jaw-dropping gorgeous scenes that combine great art direction and scenery that I really did not expect. It's kinda amazing these scenes made it into this game.For all the similar game design pitfalls that this game duplicates from other franchises, Tomb Raider builds on the action-adventure platform and makes it its own. Lara is finally cool again. But please make the side characters interesting (or non-existant) and stop with the horrible 90's story-line."

I had sort of high hopes for this title and it filled those, and even more. In the game, you are Lara Croft, an adventurous woman that wants to know the secrets of the island called Yamatai and escape from there. But how did the game turn out?I don't want to spoil it too much, but just be aware that there will be many emotional parts. Main character and his friends feel meaningful to the story. You can sense that they are people too and don't obsess some super powers that makes them immune to danger. This keeps the game interesting and makes you to want investigate the lore even more to progress the story.After you have beaten the game, you can go back to the island and explore the places you didn't check out. I'm pretty sure that there is replay value with higher difficulty. Also multiplayer is a thing but I didn't like it. It took fairly long to find a match, and when it found one, both enemys were level 60 (I belive it's the maximum or pretty close to it) and my team mate was around level 40. When the game started, I and my team mate just got rekt by the enemy. Maybe the game is just too old to have enough players for multiplayer.I really liked the graphics in this game. Visuals had a really good ratio with quality and performance. When the sky is clear, you can see really far and still the fps dosn't go down that badly. There are some places that can hit the frame rate but those are rare. My Intel HD 620 had an average of 30-40fps with normal-high details 720p resolution (Ambient Occlusion, high precision and FXAA disabled). Don't even bother using TRESSFX hair quality if you don't have more higher end computer. Enabling that dropped my fps like 65%. It may look cool but is fps hungry.There are a lot of sounds in this game. There are different sound for walking on different surfaces etc. You can really feel immersed into the place you are at currently. Dungeons have their own ambient sounds that make them feel like dungeons or tombs, how you wanna call them. When heavy music with high bpm kicks in, you know there's something really cool or dangerous happening. The soundtrack is epic and meaningful.I didn't notice any major bugs in my playthrough. No camera clipping or physics bugs. The only small annoyances were with some walls you could climb. Lara just didn't want to climb on top of the wall and I had to reload a checkpoint to get further. Also the game didn't crash even once and alt tabbing is a breeze.Now after playing the game, that long list of awards is easily explained... It's a great adventure and leaves you to want to play more Tomb Raider games.The game is kinda gory and includes disturbing scenes. It also includes a lot of intense situations with some things that can scare you. If you don't like those, I recommend skipping this one. Otherwise, give it a go! You won't regret it! I promise ;)"

The strange thing is, I don't replay games, only a few games have a replay vaule for me and one can count them on about the average finger count of a persons right hand.This game is one of my all time favorites on the PC, and since I passed it twice it's most certainly on my top 3 or 5 list amongst Jade Empire, TES IV Oblivion (the game I completed more than two times) and CoD4:MW. The other two games, I'm not even going to mention since it took me more than 5 years before replaying them.Tomb Raider (2013) gets a 10/10 in my book. It has a story, has good graphics, runs fine on many systems and the most important thing - is really interesting -> offers some replayability."

Like I said before, the last Tomb Raider I played was Underworld when I got my Xbox 360 back in '08 so I was unsure that I would like this. However, it was a lot different to that game. But however it lacks things.The story line is fantastic. You're Lara Croft who isn't really experienced with combat and agility (other than climbing mountains and things) unlike the older games in the Tomb Raider Franchise who is on a ship looking artifacts with other crew members, and it crashed by mysterious storms leaving Lara and the team shipwrecked on this strange island. With Lara separated with the rest of the group, she must find shelter and start hunting for food so she can survive the night. Within the island witness danger with a mysterious cult who were men who was also shipwrecked on the island for years and cannot leave due to the mysterious weather conditions that stops rescues from leaving. It's up to Lara to discover the mystery of the island and save herself and the crew into safety.I like the combat in this. Like I said about Lara, she isn't really experience. She finds a bow and some arrows and starts hunting with it. The bow and arrows are my favorite weapon in the game. I would use over powerful items like the shotgun and assault rifle. It's a very stealthy weapon and it feels fantastic when earning a headshot without someone noticing that his 'brother' got killed. It's rewarding!There are a lot of collectibles in this game, some are very simple like GPS caches which are very small and well hidden and there are very complex puzzles like the optional tombs that I've mentioned below. They are very rewarding to find these and earning around 5 achievements for them. Although, I didn't collect them all within my playthrough, I decided to continue the post-game which is just the island in free play. I am very thankful the developers did this since I was worried when I got to the last camp site and it said 'No return point' and I will have to replay the game from the start.The optional tomb challenges was one of my favorite things in the game. The discovery of them was so interesting and I will always head on in them when I get the chance. The problem is.. they are really small. It takes around 10 minutes. 5 minutes to look around the area and 5 minutes to actually complete the tomb. You get a treasure map for that area and that's it. You leave it. They are around 6 of them and that's it. It's a shame about that. I would loved some more challenges other than the 'Press X to light statue' or 'Press X to pick up egg'.The other problem I had with this game was that the enemies was too generic. They were 80% Cult followers men (I'm guessing they were from the same cult since they have the same models) 15% Wolves and 5% Temple Guardsmen which only appeared in two levels and that even had Cult followers in them as well. I didn't see any other dangerous animals other than wolf and man. Well, at least they are no spiders in it! (other than Underworld).I haven't played the multiplayer yet but I heard from others that it isn't really worth trying it out. I'm unsure if they are anyone who stills plays it.  I mean, I should try it out but nah. Maybe later..I would still recommend this game. Definitely. I'm not a big Tomb Raider player but I didn't stop playing this game. I would love to play a sequel if It had similar gameplay to this. Thank you Crystal Dynamic and Square Enix for this reboot."

816,Dirk Dickbutt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DirkDickbutt/,4,,1,8.8,July,"16,",780,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a remake of a game about raiding tombs. Now its even more about murder.You play as Lara Croft, the world’s most durable woman. Lara is in search of an ancient kingdom that is supposedly in the pacific near Japan. Hey look, its real, and suddenly the ship she’s on, the Endurance, is caught in a storm and actually breaks in half. After being knocked out by a stinky man, Lara wakes hanging from the ceiling, escapes by lighting herself on fire, and then takes rebar to the side.Hey good job Lara, 5 minutes in. Lucky for us, Lara is a genetically engineered super soldier capable of shrugging off most wounds and also possibly being the greatest mass murderer since Genghis Khan.Hey, its not murder, they started it.Now Lara must find a way to get off the island, and not die horribly because this game is weird with the game over screens. Like, I feel like someone got a little too into animating Lara suffering. Please don’t hurt my beautiful daughter like that, I care for her deeply. Tomb Raider is a remake of 1996 action platformer: Tomb Raider about Tomb Raider. Only this time the Tombs are kind of a side thing and its mostly about platforming and shooting people that deserve it. I mean, thats what the other games were about, but now you kill significantly less hostile wild life while you go about your business. Lara is armed with a plethora of weapons, like a pistol, machine gun, shotgun, mandatory girl bow, and a climbing pick that can also pick human brains. As you play the game, you also gain skill points that gives Lara more abilities to work with, like literally throwing dirt into peoples eyes and also stabbing them with an arrow head like she’s in TF2 or something.Oh yeah, the combat is fantastic.Every weapon has a nice OOMPH to it, and Lara is such a nimble and mobile character that you’re basically always on the offensive, safe for a few scripted instances. The combat areas are just open enough that you have full reign to just go nuts. Lara climbs fast, moves fast, and dodges fast. As long as you’re moving and know when to use cover, you can basically fight circles around the cultists chumps that though they actually stood a chance against a rich girl in her 20s. A lot of gameplay I’ve seen have people playing it like a cover based shooter, popping up to take shots on enemies. But the problem with that is, if you stick around in one place, you can get overrun pretty easily. There is enough enemy variety to keep you on your toes after the first combat encounter.And, I mean, you can play Vanquish as a cover-based shooter as well. You shouldn’t. But you can. If I do have some complaints about the game its that sometimes the platforming doesn’t agree with you.   Lara won’t grab on to what you jump at or just flat out slide off to your death without a chance to save yourself. The supporting cast is basically just toast. They sort of just exist to move the story along, there’s some drama but its drama the same way American cheese is cheese. Except Grim.Grim’s cool. Tomb Raider was a surprise, I wasn’t expecting it to be such a blast. I don’t remember where I got it, I think it was from Humble Bundle for free, all I know is I didn’t pay for it.I don’t pay for things if I can help it. It usually goes on sale for sometimes as low as three dollars, which is kind of a steal. I had a good time if not just how good the combat was. Pick it up, or else.I didn’t mean to threaten you, I’m sorry.Tomb Raider gets an 8 out of 17 or something. George Lucas’ daughter is a professional MMA fighter."

However, I think that's the only real highlight of this game. I'm a fan of linear singleplayer games, like Half-Life, Wolfenstein the New Order, and Max Payne, but the reason I didn't like this game that much is because it felt like the game was holding my hand through the entire experience. There really isn't much interactivity, and there are way too many quick time events. I liked the stealth parts of the game, but the combat just isn't very good; the weapons don't handle very well. It feels like they tried mashing realistic weapon combat with a video game style, and it just doesn't work. I don't recommend this game at full price, but pick it up on sale. It's not bad, it's just mediocre."

At the beginning I found my heart pumping and my head racing as it would put me in scenarios that felt very real and very exciting. The idea that I was getting my adrenaline pumping from a game that wasn't a multiplayer shooter was quite different from what I was used to. This left me feeling great about completing missions and tasks. I really enjoyed the crafting and modifying of all the tools and weapons in the game as well. The system they used and the progression at which you were able to add things to a weapon seemed to flow very smoothly as the difficulty of the game increased. Even though these modifications were quite unrealistic I still found myself thinking ""Well it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Lara Croft. She can do anything on the spot."". As far as story line goes it was a little confusing at first with all the gods and how the storms tie in with everything. I found though that this confusion wasn't due to a lack of explanation but was more to immerse the player in the game with Lara as she fights to find out what the island is all about.I really loved a lot about this game and can't think of many things that I didn't like. 9-10/10"

This review comes from someone who has little idea what the Tomb Raider series are about. Having said that, this game is a great (and easy) way to get acquainted with Ms Croft.I must admit that I enjoyed the game much more than I thought I would! The thing I like the most is exploration. Although the plot is quite linear (it feels like watching a film), the places we travel to (which are accessible at any moment via ""Fast Travel Camps"") are admirable. This is not only due to their design, but also thanks to the amazing graphics. I can only imagine how tremendously good this game looks on ""high"" settings... The story is told in a multi-dimensional way. Throughout the course of the game, we can find various documents which show the events through the eyes of different characters. I definitely recommend taking the time to read them.The game is designed for consoles and, in my opinion, the gameplay suffers greatly from it. To begin with, there is an abundance of QTEs (Quick Time Events). Some swear by QTEs, but I cannot stand them. Second, the gunplay is characterised by little to no recoil and relies on random bullet spread. I know that many people prefer to just point and shoot, but I prefer having recoil as I believe it increases the skill ceiling in multiplayer (the one who controls the gun better wins). Weapons are overally well-balanced, but the shotgun has more bark than bite. And last but not least, the controls feel clumsy and are not responsive enough.Although the story is presented really well and there is a lot of area to explore, the game gets slightly repetitive. Also, it is very easy (at least on ""normal"" difficulty). Some riddles are more challenging than others, but finishing the game is almost effortless.A few words about multiplayer: it is decent. My favourite mode is ""Rescue"", which is an interesting variation of the good old Capture the Flag. One team (The Survivors) has to grab a few med-kits (their location is mostly random) while the other (The Solarii) has to execute the opponents. The multiplayer may be laggy, as it relies on peer-to-peer connection.To conclude, this is a very solid game and I can definitely recommend it to everyone, not just to the die-hard fans. There are some shortcomings, but overall I am fond of the game.P.S. Please check out my other reviews here: My curation page:"

The gameplay is enjoyable, not tough (playthrough on hard) and very linear if played by the game's rules. The story takes place on an island known as Yamatai and features the queen Himiko. These two topics are Chinese and Japanese legends (Yamatai location even being discussed and argued about within Historians), and the writers of Tomb Raider (2013) had run with it and created a TR game just based off of the names. The gameplay itself is moderately simple as I had stated above only if you play by the game's rules. There are a lot of minor time savers (roll jump cancel and out of bounds), but those would be for speedrunning the game. If I could compare this game to something else I would say it is very similar to Last of Us. You can switch between 4 weapons, customize and upgrade them. You are also given the options to buy skills with skillpoints you earn which give you better combat options, survivability and exp gaining. The game can be played in a guns blazing style or a more stealthy approach. Depending on situation one may be more favorable than the other. I think what really stuck out to me were the characters themselves. You can really feel the transformation that Lara goes through from when you first start controlling her to how she's almost a different person by the end. Each character that you meet is defined well and you will have love-hate relations which each one. Overall it is definitely worth a playthrough as it is a very stress free game and has a good story."

And they were right, there was too much of it compared to the originals. This one is even worse in that sense, it doesn’t really have anything in common with the original beside the name. It’s an action game in the vein of Uncharted, and where there were puzzles before there are shootouts here. It doesn’t even have tombs, not really – the optional ones that are there are a complete joke. Unless if, of course, you consider whole Jamatai as one giant tomb. Which isn’t really far from the truth. An old school fan, and I always considered myself as one such, of TR really wouldn’t find much for him here.I came for tombs and puzzles and got shootouts and set pieces.And I found myself not caring at all, the gameplay was so fun, the graphics were breathtaking, even collecting all the additional crap was fun. As nostalgia is a curious thing, nothing will probably ever beat the likes of San Andreas, Mafia, Allied Assault, Most Wanted, RE4 etc. of my favorite games list, but this is honestly one of the best games I have ever played. And besides, Lara is nice to look at."

Tomb raiding and puzzle solving are fun optional missions that more for the core players who don't like to like to run and shoot their way through a game and actually strategies on how to solve whatever is in their way.Play the game in hard difficulty because I believe it gives the best experience out of all the lower difficulty modes.The good:AWESOME GRAPHICS! SET IT TOO HIGHEST SETTING AVAILABLE IF YOUR RIG CAN SUPPORT IT!!!!Great mechanicsGood plotSmooth controllsMinimal bugsMinor QTEs, they're mostly just in the first 2 hours of the game.TressFX anyone?Awesome variety of graphic controlls for those with lower capability computersThe bad:Poor character development.Too easy, yeah a rifle burst and a molotov can easily kill you but that's not what I mean.Restrictive at times, with how the game forces you to move a certain way go a certain way to playout a cut scene scenerio.Cuts scenes, there were more cut scenes that the game really needed. A lot of the cut scenes could've beautifully been done in gameplay instead of those cutscene."

The gameplay is VERY satisfying, scoring some headshots with a bow has never been so good. As some of you may know, the new TR includes some interesting elements, like the ability of upgrading Lara's skills and upgrading her weapons at the cost of XP and salvage. I didn't find the story perfect or awesomely written but it's pretty decent and the things that happen will keep you hooked to the screen and making you want to play a little more to find what happens next. I payed 15$ for this great game, and it is worth every single penny I have spent. I give this game a 9.5/10. Why not a 10? Just because of the story, everything else is amazing."

Its clearly dumbed down to the masses, so its very easy and linear entertainment. I like collecting stuff, so that was fun. The gameplay and story is pretty mediocre and nothing you will remmber for long. With everything maxed out and TressFX enabled the Game at least looks pretty good, but TressFX kills the Performance pretty hard, even on my R9 280x. I spend about 14hours with the Game, so for 5$ you can't argue. But not a Game I will remember.And well the Multiplayer is: Well lets not talk about it. The Game has a Multiplayer - enough said. :D"

Very fun game with engaging plot and well built up world.Controls are good on PC, and seem to find the perfect balance between movement assist (ie for consoles) and completely free movement (ie for PC) such that you hardly notice when the camera/movement guides you in any one particular direction. Janky controls are one of the biggest dealbreaks for me, but I'm glad to say the mouse + keyboard controls for this game are great.Graphically it looks really nice, and runs smoothly too.Optional stuff (ie optional tombs, challenges etc) are included, but not forced on you, and the entire game could easily be played ignoring them, or partaking in them to the extent that you want to.I recommend this game to anyone looking for a good, engaging singleplayer game to spend 10+ hours on."

In the end I've given up the temptation and decided to give it a try and it definitely worth it.The game is well optimized and incredibly fluid (managed to play it on high settings with a constant 35FPS). The graphics are good and the world is well done and same goes for the sound and voice acting.As for the gameplay I can only say that Tomb Raider = Assassin's Creed + Far Cry 3 + Lara Croft.At a smaller scale, of course.It has a cool Far Cry 3 atmosphere and the skill/level up system as well as the weapons upgrade/mod system are similar but not that complex. The platforming is very similar to the one in AC series and that's definitely not a bad thing, What's really cool about this game is that Lara is now a more human now, not overconfident and expressionless like it seamed in the old games. Oh, and she definitely gives you a better view of the...game than Altair or Ezio. From any angle. :D"

Some fans felt more betrayed than Henry Hill's friends did when he ratted them out at the end of Goodfellas (spoiler alert), but I for one applaud this risky tactic and I genuinely enjoyed the gameplay. The story was alright. There was some sort of magical force that would kill anyone who tried to escape or enter the isolated island. I wasn't really paying attention to it because I was too distracted by Lara's accent. I think it was either Kiwi or South African. The characters were a wide variety of personalities. Some friend of Lara carried around some stupid camera recording nothing relevant while the rest of the cast worked. For some reason the enemies in the game call her the ""Sun Queen."" There was this one nerdy guy though who totally wanted to bang Lara, but she had him laughably deep in the friend zone. Whoever wrote the parts of the story where he tries to flirt with her deserves a promotion. Some Scottish guy was also in the storyline somewhere and for some reason he had to make it clear he was Scottish at every given opportunity. He died from falling off a cliff, probably because he was drunk off of Guinness. Overall I would give the game an 8/10."
851,Adio,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AdioPL/,5,1,1,25.4,November,"10,",214,8,1,"Far and away the best single player game I've played in a very long time. The most refreshing part of this game is that no two mission objectives are alike. Ever. The gameplay and puzzles are always fresh, and the platforming elements were pristine.The transition of gameplay to cutscene back to gameplay was seamless.The story is so good, that if it were a book or a movie it would STILL warrent the money spent for the game. It is so gripping and the action constant. Normally when I play games and am looking to take a break for food or sleep or what have you, I always say to myself that ""I'll just finish this segment and then quit as soon as the action dies down,"" but the action NEVER died down. I was constantly compelled to keep moving; one session, i started at 9pm and by the time I felt the need to check the time, it was 6am.The voice acting was simply stunning. The design of the combat was so good that with it one could make a standalone game in league with the best shooter's available.Apart from my wish that there was a harder difficulty available, the only thing bad about this game is that it ends."
852,marmih,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marmih/,4,,1,77.2,October,"7,","1,004",0,1,"9/10A great start to a new reboot of the classic franchise. As a fan of action-focused RPG games, I found the gameplay quite enjoyable, especially when you have collected a few upgrades for your weapons. The constant GPS cache and artifact collecting can get dull pretty fast, but thankfully, they're not essential to the main plot and game progression. The storyline itself was decent enough for a modern game (even though it is really linear) and definitely better than what the original games had. Lara and the rest of the ensamble have distinct personalities this time, and that makes the story more captivating and lets the player get invested in the plot as a whole. The graphics are really good for the year the game was released in and Lara's hair physics is quite a joy to watch.This is a great game for one or two playthroughs and even offers a fun multiplayer. I would definitely recommend the game, especially since it's constantly sold at a discounted price."

When it came out, it was a breath of fresh air for the franchise. The new Lara was easy to empathize with, and I found myself caring about her.Gameplay: 9/10There are a few moments where you have to wiggle Lara around to get her to crouch into a hole or slip into a crevice but overall the game plays well and feels good. Apparently, the game suffered from a lot of crashes when it released, but I hadn't noticed many at all from 2014 on. Just don't alt-tab out unless you've paused the game. Exploration was a little iffy in some places, especially the Challenge ""Previous Inhabitants"" where the last poster is in a ridiculously hard to notice place, but overall the exploration was a bit too easy. A few of the achievements will likely require you to replay the game once; the requirements for ""Chatterbox"" are not obvious unless you are very close to the target and you will probably miss them in the first map area. You can probably get all the other single player ones in about 20 hours.Controls: 9/10The dodge/counter mechanic feels a little clunky at times, I often missed the counter early even though it felt like I was hitting the button at the right moment.Graphics: 10/10The graphics feel a little dated after 7 years, but are still beautiful enough to stand up against modern titles.A beefy card is needed for this game, using a RTX 2080 @1080p I had to set Anti-Aliasing at 2xSSAA as opposed to 4xSSAA, but everything else was maxed out or turned on and I managed 119-200 FPS with V-Sync enabled even in heavy combat sequences. A 2080 Super could probably run it with completely maxed at this resolution, but should tone back the Anti-Aliasing at higher resolutions.Music: 10/10The music is superb. Suspenseful during tense moments when your trying to sneak or kicking butt and noticeably calm when you've cleared an area.Sound: 9/10There are moments where Lara will start talking at the campfire, and if you accidentally used the fire you'll probably already exited before realizing she was saying something. Thankfully, you can review these at leisure. Just open the Map and click on ""Documents"" in the upper right area of the screen. This is thankfully the only issue I've noticed with this game. Shots from weapons are real enough to feel right and directional ques come across correctly. Caverns have echos of water drops and flames roar and crackle.Overall: 9/10A score of 9/10 is my minimum for a Game of the Year nominee, and this game certainly was mine for 2013. It's a good game, and if you like action shooters with a bit of exploring, this will keep you content."

I have to tell you, given the thought that I bought it for 4,99€ on special's discount, money more than well spent. This game is AWESOME and overall best tomb raider game ever. What more one of best aciont games ever. I mean yes, all games have flaws but this game's flaw (yes, singular), if it has it, you have to really really really try to find it. Ok, now if you're still with me, upthere is true...mostly...Honestly, good this game ofers really puts shadow over bad but there are some anoying stuff with this game hardly worth mentioning.

What is that good for EVER? you're not buying this game for multiplayer, if you are you're sane..but fortunately I don't focus my review or grade on this part of game. So ye... I would need 19999999 more words to spit on MP...you get the picture. I'm only playing MP here cause I am an achievement w#0re, and I want every single achievement I can get. Yep, suffering...I know I know, having a disorder is a b1tch. Four years ago, when I first played this game I was running on Athlon 64 X2 3000+, 4 GiG DDR2, and nVidia 8800 GTX. Had a good game experience, but I wished that I could see the game in it's full glory. So having lara's TresFX hair was out of the picture. So was SSAA4x or some of thos nice high end graphics settings. I mean gaming with Lara's fancy hair (where every other enemy or ally have nothing similar...unecessary option if you ask me), you hardly notice difference.. Who does give a S#1t if her every hair behave differently and who has time to notice that, once you've seen it initially? Point on this : Now I have replayed this game on Intel i5, 8 GiG DDR3, nVidia 660 Ti, fairly stronger than before and as i recall i had same settings as before.. so quite of upgrade for nothing? Difference? While before I had poor framerate when running high settings, now game runs fine but my DCII on GPU was louder than my mother in law stepin on a dog's pop in the middle of her living room. Now you don't know the sound of that..but trust me...ANNOYING!!!! I had to turn down graphics settings again to have bareable gameplay. Don't get me wrong, I don't think my config is High End now, but it's quite alright for the time, and I have no problem with other games. I'm just saying they could do bit more effort into fixing this aspect of the game. Game looks very good on lower settings too though. Can't wait for the sequel. ""Rise of the Tomb Raider""So everything considered, and I know i did b1tc# a bit about it, I still give this game solid"

I have come full circle and finally brought the game to completion in regards to the side challenges, which prompted me to write a review for this wonderful game. A doughnut who mainly enjoys multiplayer games and seldom singleplayer adventures, I was blown away by Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider grappled me with interest, quite literally, from the get-go and I was sold. If you take a look through my gallery of screenshots, it is quite apparent that the game started out beautifully and evolved into one-heck of a diamond mine by the end of the tale. I remember quite a few times in the game just standing and looking around spamming [F12] while Solarii soldiers made quick work, attacking me in my transfixed state.Although Tomb Raider's scenery is fantastic, that is not the only area where this game shines. You are  Lara Croft. Immersed into a vast world of assassin-like game play, you must use your survival instincts and various weapons to progress throughout the story and attempt to conquer the zealot by the name of Mathias. With pristine and seemingly realistic graphics, you will venture through a mesmeric experience with puzzles, obstacles, parkour, fights, take-downs, and more.I snagged the GOTY edition during the Summer Sale, but this game is worth the full price. Prove your survival prowess and step onto the ominous island of Yamatai. 9/10 - Challenges are a bit onerous. 8.5/10 - Not the best final boss fight. 10/10 - Not confusing, easy to learn, and extremely fun with variance in take-downs. Nope, more so eerie. None 10/10 Not easy. 16/50 achievements are multiplayer based and are tedious. Hidden achievement (Called Chatterbox, look it up before you begin).  10/10 This game was created for singleplayer. One and done sort of campaign.

You will love this game. I do not. It is a quick time event on a leash. I hate to say it but even though this game is very polished and seems to have a good story the hand holding and the quick time events make it on my not recommending list.(And one of the least favorite games I have played in a decade.) It breaks any immersion. I will keep playing to see if it gets better. As its not a bad game but for the money I would look else where. So I kept playing, but this game is not getting better. It is very average with no replay value. Are people paid to wright good reviews for this? I mean you don't raid tombs, and you just do quick time events, meshed into cut scenes. I bought this for 3.99 and would rather have my 3.99. I think people are to envolved in how Lara looks to notice the poor attempt at game play. The story is average as well. Seriously the first Tomb Raider wasn't great(get over it, it wasn't) but the fact this is claiming to be the same in the series is just wronge. You would think they would branch out like Tomb Raider 2 did, but no. There are less options on how to do something then back in Laras PSX days. At least there you didn't get ""PRESS A!!!!"".... PRESS B, oh you're dead. Retry? With visuals better in open world games that can't be why people like it. Maybe it's the story? No... With Bio Shock Infinite proving this is a trash cliche TV movie story. It's not the gameplay. It's just aweful. The only thing I can think of is the SLI/Crossfire scaling, but seriously are you running it at 150+ FPS? So if you like average games that run well, with lazy quick time events. This is for you. I am ""Overwellingly Postive"" that this game is average at best. Xbox One is getting a timed exclusive on the next game. I say let the One have it and contain this mess. Why? Why? Why, do people like a lack of choices and sub typical third person gameplay. And for any one who want's to argue.... QTEs! QTEs!!!! QTEs... QTEs... They should not exist"

A truly amazing reboot of the series.That being said, it controls better with a controller than with K&M, though K&M is perfectly manageable for the most part.Some of the quick time events are poorly telegraphed, as are some of the cut scene like missions where you're on a set path and they take control of your view. Also, around half of the achievements are for multiplayer, which kind of sucks for a primarily single player game.Still highly recommend this game for the story alone."

So I just finished Tomb Raider, what a fantastic game!I remember really enjoying the original Tomb Raiders way back when but over the years I began to find the games increasingly boring, stale and frustrating. In the end I gave up on them and stopped buying. I saw all the great reviews this new version was getting but I still held back, it wasn't until many friends began recommending it that I decided to revisit Lara's world and I'm very glad I did. For me it felt less like a improvement on the series, more of a complete reinvention. Gone was the cute, ridiculous, big boobed caricature. Instead was this more believable human with emotion, detail and fragility. No game is perfect but I find it hard personally to find faults. The graphics were beautiful, the contextual animation of Lara amazing, the story decent, voice acting good, level design fab and action and gameplay great. Lots of fun almost every step of the way and shockingly brutal at points. Look forward to more, bravo to Crystal Dynamics.9.5/10"

This is 3rd time playing this as i'm writing this. The first 2 times i played it as a kid :) ( obviously i played it cracked ) now that i'm grown up i got it on steam and why ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not! completed the story. Thank you Games :)Actual review -The story takes place in an island where Lara Croft and her colleagues are trapped in an island because of a shipwreck caused my natural disaster. They initially came to this island hoping to find something with historical value ( i wont spoil dw). But later on they discover that they are not alone in this island and the shipwreck wasn't a ""Natural Disaster"" Our goal as Lara Croft is to explore the tombs and find the secrets of the island and find a way to ESCAPE! on the way you will face a lot of powerful enemies and a lot of puzzles and ♥♥♥♥ yea expect a lot of parkour :).Game play review -Is this game even 2013? The story was amazing the graphics were gorgeous the game was soo ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smooth ( always has been even on my old 10 year old pc ) puzzles were not that complicated unless you do the optional tombs which can be quite challenging but not complicated ( 12 year old dumb me did those common guys XD ) it takes 10 hours to complete the story and i think after completing for me the progression was 62% and to get to 100% you need to do all the side quests and complete all the achievements ( cant be bothered zzzzzzz. i have a life :D ) yes buy this and play the story what the hell are you waiting for :) i don't care if your'e 13 year old or 69 year old grandpa play it this a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ movie but you know what you will get to experience it rather than sitting on your couch with ur chips and coke XDp.s. the character Samantha ( the one who got chosen to be Himeko's vessel ) is 100% my type.

900,Fear,https://steamcommunity.com/id/connorwu/,6,,1,15.6,December,"6,",160,0,1,"Amazing visuals and environment, absolutely stunning. Graphically, you can rarely fault this game. It offers a massive variety of environments, from deep dark caves to beautifully sun bathed landscapes, and captures the idea of being stranded on an island perfectly. The vast mountains and asian inspired scenary is almost flawless. However, is it a different story when it comes to gameplay?To start off, this game offers a lot of things in bucket-loads. The first is combat. The combat feels fluid and the guns give some meaty kick which is nice compared to other third person shooters which can sometimes be lacking. There are also a wide variety of weapons, which in turns means that different situations can be dealt with in many different ways. The upgrades system can also provide some variety to combat, offering different attachments for weapons which can be obtained in order to suit your needs as a player, such as the silencer you can get for the tactical pistol, which can be a life saver in situations in which a quick silent ranged kill is in order, since the bow takes some time to get to maximum accuracy. The second is exploration and discovery. I feel like this part can be linked back to the fact that the graphical fidelity of this game is mind blowing, because exploring different areas of the map and seeing new things generally feels very rewarding, although in actual fact, you're often not rewarded at all. Platforming feels responsive and accurate, as well as genuinely satisfying.The third is the stealth element of the game. In the periods of time in which stealth can be used, it is effective and satisying. This is largely due to the absolutely brilliant minimalistic UI. It aids in immersion tenfold, rather brilliantly.However, this game does lack when it comes to key elements of the game. It is up to you whether you think these will bring down the enjoyment of the game to you. Tomb Raider, in it's legacy, has always been about platforming and exploring. Unfortunately, large parts of this game are dedicated to combat sequences which are both much too long and much too repetitive. Although there is a large array of weapons, it is often the case that enemies are just far too bullet spongey, and take far too many shots with any weapon in order to go down. This gets especially annoying when it comes to long combat sequences which cannot be avoided with stealth and are entirely scripted, as that offers even less variance. Linearity is also a problem in this game, as well as the scripted nature of some sequences in the game. I felt like I was being pushed down a road that I didn't particularly always want to follow, which not only ruined some areas of the game but also broke immersion. For instance, there is a scene around 35% of the way through the game in which there is a shooter hiding behind a shielded gun. In order to take this shooter down, you have to manoeuvre your way through the garden to a rope. However, I saw various times when I could get a good shot with weapons, but it was just scripted to not allow that paricular outcome.Another problem is the storyline. It's not anything special, nothing we haven't heard of or seen before. And characters, while initially interesting, are somewhat shallow and superficial, and often don't play any role other than to cause problems for Lara and generally extending the length of the game where it is not necessary. I will however give props to the fact that the period of time when Lara is alone and cannot find her crew, her character, through the emotions she displays, is really tested, and I feel like it was honestly one of the better 'character gets stranded on an island and has to find safety and a way home' kind of situations since Lara has to deal with the fact that she is alone. Desperation really hits home, and her emotions were so well presented that you genuinely feel pity for Lara and her situation, and you really want it to all be okay. I also have to give props to the sound department and the voice actor too, both having done amazing work with the various emotions from anger to sadness and desperation.This honestly feels like the type of game in which after completion, you may be able to hop into and just admire for it's beauty. It has faults, of course, but smooth gameplay and beautiful scenary create a masterpiece of video gaming. Lara starts off as a panicked hopeless character but as progression continues, she turns into a feared ruthless killer willing to do anything and go to any lengths to save herself and her crew, even if it means doing so alone."

If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.You will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.Weapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.This game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)My only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpointsfor DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend Tomb of the Lost AdventurerAgility SkillPistol BurstPistol SilencerAnimal InstinctHeadshot Reticuleall these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price."

Great characters, environment and story!I need to admit that the last time I played this game long term or rather played the story was back in 2013 when the game just came out, so unfortunately I don't remember the story properly and therefore can't write a constructive review about the story but I know that I've enjoyed it a lot.About a month ago I decided to complete the game to 100 %, cuz I still had it at somewhat like 75 % or so. Guess what, it took me ""only"" around 10 hours of playtime to get the remaining relics and GPS caches and do all the challenges.The only negative things I could bring up, would be that the switching of weapon mods is a little bit unfamiliar (for me), that you can't run (why they didn't implement it in the single-player but in the multiplayer is very confusing), and while we're at it, the multiplayer is dead (you can't find anyone playing this game in multiplayer anymore, so all the multiplayer achievements got unachievable but luckily enough I played it back in the days) and also the graphics may not be the best if you're comparing it with today's games (obviously), but for a game from 2013 you really don't need to look at that point and be real with yourself, do you really care about excellent graphics if the story, characters and overall Gameplay is superb? No, I don't think so.I'll play the sequels for sure!Ooh, and a quick note, if you're planning to do for example the achievement ""Deadeye"" or ""Boom Goes the Dynamite"" after the story mode like myself, don't even try cuz guess what.. you slaughtered everyone on this poor island and nobody is going to respawn just like in real life... damn.. realism at it's finest.But it's worth the 20 bucks... You got it for free (during this one particular event in quarantine time) or on sale? Even better!"

I just realised, while typing this review, that that moment was a little more than 14 years ago :)Since then I played and finished all the Tomb Raider games (multiple times), so you can say I'm an expert and a big fan of the franchise.This remake of Tomb Raider is excellent, and this is why:- Gameplay: easy to learn and master (if you played the older TR games, you are as happy as I am with this)- Graphics & maps: even on low graphics it looks stunning, but on max graphics/tressFX you'll be blown away. The maps are gorgeous and have lots of detail, beautiful lightning effects etc. (and sometimes the well-know invisible walls ;)- Story: it's an engaging story, I didn't want to stop playing. Sometimes a little predictable, but I didn't mind- Music & Voice acting: The music and voice acting is great! As a musician/singer I think those elements are also very important in a game. - RPG elements: Lara will evolve during the game, you can spend skill points on her, it's a nice change, but it could have been done better. In the end there's only one way to 'build' your Lara character. It's also nice you can upgrade your weapons, but that's also very linear, you can't make your own choices.- Secrets/lootable items: I'm a big fan of lootable items in games and acompletionist. I loved searching for all those GPS's caches, relics, documents etc.- Multiplayer: It's fun to be able to play as any character in the game, each will say their own line when you start a match or kill someone. Unlocking Lara is tough, you need to get to lvl 60 and it will take a lot of time. Especially with bow-snipers who will one-shot you :) But before you get there you will unlock lots of guns/pistols/bows and will be able to create your own playstyle.I can recommend buying the DLC maps and DLC Hitman-guns.I can't wait until the new Tomb Raider game comes out, I can't imagine it won't be available for PC. We'll see..."

I remembered being amazed with the fact that not only was it a boy playing a game with a female protagonist, she also kicked ass. He had all the games that had come out (this was like 2004) and I watched with envy as he played a cool game that was ""too grown-up"" for me. Now, buying the 2013 game (after it came out for Mac) I'm glad I got to experience this amazing adventure.The graphics are amazing. Although the lips aren't always in-sync (especially when you are talking to other members of the Endurance), the scenery is breathtaking. The animals scurring across the grass, the Tombs, even the blood river scene are detailed perfectly. The dialogue is really good in this game. It doesn't feel forced and it doesn't make you cringe. The music is just right for each part of the game.The story is just as good as the graphics. Although the secondary characters are given little character development, it doesn't feel like each one is flat and is only there just because. You feel for the Endurence crew. The gameplay is entertaining and thrilling. The combat can be a challenge at times but that just makes the game better. Even the stealth parts can be exciting. You can either try to quietly shoot the enemies and make your way through the area, or you can say ""screw it"" and attack them. Either way works (most of the time. However, there are some areas that you need to rely on stealth only).Tomb Raider has that way where it feels like you are placed in Lara's own shoes, not just an outside force controling her. This is a game I will replay again and again. 9.4/10"

The parts that do feel like traditional game play are good but there's just not enough of it for my liking.

This game's story is about Lara, trying to find a mysterious island in a very dangerous zone. Lara and her team goes to the ocean to find the lost island and their ship gets rekt. Lara wakes up on the island and someone kidnapps her. In this adventure, Lara will need to discover the paranormal secrets of the island. And now pro's and con's:Pros: 1. Good voice acting. I loved the voices of the characters, that's all.2. VERY well detailed textures / details. The devs did a really good work with all the little details, Example: when you jump in water (as Lara) some of the mud on her disapears wich is reallistic.3. Soundtrack is made perfectly with the locations / story parts.4. Locations are beautiful, and even more if you play on the highest resolution.Cons: 1. After finishing the storyline, there's nothing to do.2. The story line is too short :DI recommend this game to anyone who loves adventure / TPS (third person shooters).

918,Dugunthi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dugunthi/,134,,0,16.6,December,"12,",334,0,1,"If you want a good *adventure* game, this is not the game you are looking for. It has its strengths and especially the first half is mostly very enjoyable, but the second half is pretty much just an interactive Hollywood action movie with a teaspoon of adventuring thrown in. You get more adventure pleasure by orders of magnitudes for the same amount of money if you buy some LoK or older TR titles at once.The immersion is mostly very good, with gorgeous graphics, well-done level design and a convincing soundscape, sometimes dented by the clichéed characters and story. ""Magic"" is a pretty lazy deus ex machina, and it's thrown around very liberally here.The game seems to have been designed with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in mind, because activating Lara's ""instinct"" negates all need to think about what to do and where to go, and the tombs are mostly a joke. The first three are moderately challenging, the last ones are actually amongst the easiest aprts of the game. Calling them puzzles is an insult to puzzling really. They're really more of an afterthought to justify the title, as the tacky ""Tomb raided!"" congratulatory text shows.Looking for the collectibles provides the main bulk of adventuring challenge, because a minority of them are hidden well, but mostly the way to them is just ""complicated"" to stall time (run up there, jump down there, slide down there, climb up there) instead of hard. Because of Lara's instinct finding out which is the right way is also a no-brainer. So unless you're very disciplined and never use the instinct function (the hardest difficulty does not deactivate it), this game has next to no adventuring challenge.The weapon upgrade system is interesting in the beginning, but overall it's pointless and won't noticeably affect your playstyle or combat success. Upgrading for the sake of upgrading.As mentioned before, the first half is mostly adventuring with a bit of fighting, like you're used to from TR games, but in the second half you will have many moments where enemies just constantly pour down on you like you're playing an old school arcade shooter, and some stationary wave-challenges. The last one in the monastery is the biggest and also the most infuriating one. It was actually the last straw that made me decide to write a negative review."

This game received a lot of press and lot of attention. From Tomb Raider is back, to who the model for Lara Croft would be, to changes in Lara Croft in general. I initially obtained the game to play when it was released as the press and the hype for this game. Tomb Raider right from the get go engaged me. The opening was packed with action and done really well. The initial story grab your attention and grabs hold of the player within the first half-hour. You learn your abilities to the get go and realize there is more to the story beyond the story. You find your first tools but also the first archeological finding. The story of the island and story of other characters are told through these items as you travel through the mysterious island to find a way to escape with your friends/crew.The story moves at a steady pace, leaving it quite easy to keep up with the story and catch back up if they put the game down for a few days. Though as the player, I felt a bit annoyed at times it took time for the story (Lara) to catch on to the plot The game developed you (Lara) as needed. Providing power ups ability improvements, enough scrap to improve and better make Lara and her tools into stronger items. It was easy to play with both the controller and the keyboard in single player mode. Did not have difficulties in timed events or with aiming in either fashion.Though the story moved, I ended up not going for 100% or anywhere close. I found it a chore to find GPS caches and some of the items. I decided to continue with the story as I was more interested in what happened to Lara and the gang as she tried to solve the mystery rather then go hunt and find items towards the last 1/3 of the game. I still ended up with about 16 hours of actual game play, which I find is respectable for a game today.I even tried the multiplayer. Though it was alright with team deathmatch type set-up for what I tried. I think the production of a multiplayer was a waste on the developer/designer time for a Tomb Raider game. I found though the controller worked well in single player on PC, was a handicap in multiplayer.Most of my time in the game was enjoyable. After a while though I just did not feel like searching for all the items and move on with the plot for the game. I expect there to be a sequel or series of games after this revamp was really well made and received.I highly recommend playing if you have not already. It was a very good revamp of a series and I expect more to come."

It shares a lot of the same ""protagonist miraculously making it through the heaviest application of Murphy's Law possible"" action sequences while pausing a bit more in between to let you catch your breath and puzzle-solve-platform your way around collecting every possible achievement token that isn't nailed down.The graphics are impressive, the guns are weighty, the hero is likable (even if she does repeat ""I can do this"" a few dozen times too many), and the enemies are moderately challenging (in more of a ""occasionally we throw 5 guys at you at once while someone off in the corner is unloading an automatic rifle in your direction and some other sneaky punk is lobbing explosives you should probably dodge"" than in any sense of individual prowess).  The story is fun, the backstory to the island and your crew is interesting to read through as you gather it up via collectible journals, and the omnipresent ""hint view"" button is there should you ever really be left scratching your head on a puzzle or lost in the woods.Only con: some QTEs that are rather unforgiving, but if your system is fast enough to play this then the reload times are negligible and the checkpoint system is very supportive."

It runs very nicely for the most part, potentially better on AMD cards especially if you run TressFX. Display support is great as long as your display is wider than 16:9. FOV is not adjustable outside of CheatEngine which breaks the aiming zoom. It's playable at a standard PC gaming distance, but it's still a pretty significant problem, the biggest the game has in this respect.Overall, it's quite good, just as the other recent Square Enix titles. Hitman, Sleeping Dogs, etc. All 3 look and run great, and all have incredibly satisfying mouse and keyboard controls. People will insist that 3rd person games are just meant for controller, but that's just not the case with ones with such an emphasis on aiming, especially not when they're configured this excellently. The only issue with the control are that while not aiming, the camera auto-turns to follow Lara's movement direction. I'd really appreciate the option to toggle that.I'd never really played the old Tomb Raider games in the past, and that seems to be a major point of criticism against the reboot. I later purchased a few of the older games on steam and played them for a bit. Even in such a short period of time, I can confidently say that their raw mechanics pale in comparison to modern videogames. Concept and gameplay ideas are very different from raw execution of those scenarios and mechanics. The controls were clunky, the combat was pure auto-aim and it doesn't make any sense to the competent modern gamer, though the game's puzzles were compelling. Tomb Raider 2013 is absolutely a better game overall by far, but they've clearly changed their focus. I would have enjoyed more in-depth puzzles and I hope they do that for the sequel, but the combat and general movement systems feel far nicer in the modern reboot.The raw shooting and traversal feels excellent, and the environments are relatively diverse for the single island it's restricted to because of the plot. I'd like to see more places in an Uncharted style, traveling all over the world, and it's possible from this point onward now that they've established the origin story. On that note, the whole concept of Lara really becoming the iconic character wasn't really done properly, as the ludo-narrative dissonance is immense between the bordering on tears helpless emotions in the early cut-scenes, and the act of ripping through 20 heads a minute with arrows in the next clearing. If you play with a controller or are really bad at the game it might be more reasonable, but it's still notable. I remember that that was the second most common point with the initial reviews of the game. I went in just wanting satisfying gameplay, and I was more than satisfied. The story elements and hits of history/myths helped keep interest up, but I certainly didn't find it the primary draw.The visuals are high fidelity, but it's relatively monotone in terms of palette. You can improve it significantly with SweetFX, but it needs a pretty dramatic change. (I'll link the custom preset here if I ever perfect it) It's a nice atmosphere, but I've never been a fan of overly strong grey fog or washed out colors in games.General audio is fine but not particularly memorable. Voice acting, particularly from Lara, is great overall. Sadly however, most of the characters lack complexity and growth. The most memorable bits are Lara's voice, and the various areas and set-pieces throughout the game. The story itself is compelling enough, though it ends on a weird note that I'm unsure of whether or not it paid off.Going in, I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. I don't think I liked it quite as much as Hitman and Sleeping Dogs, but its definitely up there in my AAA favorites of that year (2013). It's a very solid port and the shooting mechanics are quite satisfying, particularly the Bow, which was by far my most used weapon. The ""Tombs"" are few and far between, and are relatively basic/lackluster when you do find them, but as a shooter, it's still quite competent."

It even automatically saves mi-puzzle or after finding each collectible. So the penalty of death is only one or two minutes of retrying.+ Four weapons to choose from. Bows are such a pleasure to use!Pros or Cons, depending on your taste:+ The player is very well guided. Some examples are given by the three next points.+ ""Survival instinct"" allows you to see enemies, interactable objects, climbable walls, places to advance the story, and collectibles in your surroundings.+ The world is mostly linear, so it is not too difficult to find your way through the map, even though the texture of objects from the same location is very similar and not that distinguishable. In fact, most of the time you just keep moving forward, which is the only possible direction because the other three is blocked by insurmountable objects. On the other hand, exploration is very limited since paths are mostly prescribed.+ Puzzles are very light-weighted, including those in the optional tombs. Besides, Lara gives you verbal hints about how to proceed.+ Metroidvania influence. Some places or collectibles are only accessible when you have the necessary gears. So getting new equipments also unlocks more ways to explore the map.+ By well-balancing and interspersing puzzles, free roaming, action events, and cutscenes, the game keeps players engaged.+ Depending on how much time you spend on collectibles, side quests, and option tombs, a typical first playthrough takes 10-20 hours. IMO, this is just the right length to avoid being dragging or repetitive.* Your skills and weapons can be upgraded. You will be fully (or almost) upgraded at the end, even without much farming.* Very few side quests.- Quick-time events are such a pain, even on Easy mode. And some puzzles also require jumps with good timing.- The plot is meh and contains supernatural elements. But I like the depiction of how Lara grows from a feeble lass to a strong and independent  tomb raider.- You are still free to roam after the end. However, apart from collectibles and optional tombs, there are not much else to do, and enemies rarely spawn. The whole island feels empty, bleak, and lonely.Serious Cons for completionists:- Highly missable achievements that require a second playthrough to get.- Tons of difficult-to-find collectibles necessary for certain achievements, some have no sense at all in the background setting of the game (I am looking at you, ) some are even not shown on the in-game map.- 30% of the achievements are related to the multiplayer mode, which is dead on arrival and not even available on MacOS.Final words:Tomb Raider is a great game. Its story, gameplay, design, characters, graphics, all go very well together to give you a leisurely enjoyable experience, even for newcomers to 3A action games. Provided that you are not a completionist, I would say that it is a no-brainer to pick up this game. Besides, Tomb Raider is the first title of the second reboot (aka the Survivor Trilogy) of the Tomb Raider franchise. It has modern graphics, aesthetics, and gameplay design.

It is one of the most detailed character models I've seen.+ Great level design+Great sense of pacing, the game does a great job of mixing up the combat,exploration and combat, and it never feels stale.+Combat is solid and fun, shooting mechanics feel good + Great use of set pieces, its always exciting to see what the game throws at you next. + Finding salvage allows you to upgrade your weapons The Bad:- Some of the story elements are a bit stupid- The game provides a lot of skills for you to upgrade, the problem is most of these are pretty useless and don't seem to make that big of a difference in terms of gameplay. -Multiplayer is all but dead now Conclusion:This is a fantastic game that I loved from start to finish minus a few flaws mentioned above."

952,Soulkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/c9soulkey/,100,9,0,46.8,December,"25,","1,698",10,1,"Tomb Raider? More like 'Horde Killer'! Most of the time  instead of looting tombs and exploring, you will be killing never ending waves of enemies, as one shoot-out scene is followed by another. And while the graphics are looking great, the shallow gameplay outweighs all the positive aspects of the game.Tomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise, taking you back to the very beginning, when Lara Croft wasn't the experienced adventurer we know since 1996.Following the shipwreck on a Japanese island Lara is fighting for survival, while going through a journey that changes her forever…At least that’s the concept on paper. But let’s see how it actually looked!When you first take control of Lara, the first thing you will notice, that how vulnerable you are, and you can’t help to feel empathy for her for being in this desperate struggle for survival. The game starts out great, as your main objective is to regroup with your friends while trying to survive against both nature and hostile survivors. During this section of the game Lara’s tools and weapons are very limited, but as the game progresses and your arsenal grows, the character development suddenly stops. After the infamous attempted rapé scene, where Lara first kills a human being, the game almost instantly turns into a brainless shoot-them-up. Up to that point you tried to sneak upon enemies or evade them, after this point you will be killing them in group of dozens.In order to progress you will be FORCED to kill everyone you see, else you will be swarmed. These „horde” sections happen very often and they get increasingly frustrating as the game progresses. By the end of the game Lara transforms from an unexperienced survivor into a battle-hardened killing machine. Seems like somewhere during the game development the Crystal Dynamics guys lost their focus...The swarm events paired with dumbed down puzzles deliver a very shallow gameplay. The platforming sections of the game are great, and very creative but sadly there are not too many of them, and they are simply not enough to compensate the mindless shoot-out sections.The graphics wise Tomb Raider is one of the best looking games on PC and it’s fairly well optimized: it provides you with stunning visuals if you have a good rig, but it runs on weaker hardwares too.Overall, Tomb Raider 2013 is a mediocre game at best, and I would only recommend it for fans of TPS action/shooting. If you are looking for good adventure game, then play the older Tomb Raider games and avoid this one as far as possible!  -Gorgeous graphics.-Environment and level designs are very well done.-Platforming sections are very creative and fun, but sadly they are overshadowed by the shootout sections which fill out the majority of the game.-Handholding gameplay: the „survival instinct” skill shows you everything, including waypoints, object you can interact with and even highlights the enemies for you-Puzzles are obnoxiously easy.-Barely any tombs to explore. There are around 10 of them in the game, some of them are even DLC content, but most importantly they only require about 5-10 minutes each to complete.-Repetitive and extremely frustrating gameplay. While the game starts out great, it soon turns into a mindless shoot-em-up as you will encounter hordes of enemies every 5-10 minutes."

This one I started and played it through with a lot of passion in about 37 hours of time, to make sure to get some achievements.Based on this experience I can say that this game deserves to be played. The game offers a great athmosphere, stunning graphics (played maxed out on a 670 GTX), great audio / music and while you play it, most of the time you feel like you are hired as an actor to play the first role in an action movie.The whole story in this game is consistent and of epic scale. I really loved to see what's comming next.Well but there are some drawbacks I do not want to hide either in this review:- the events are triggered which becomes really annoying- the AI is quite good but often enough you find some ways to exploit- fights against bosses are annoying because most of the times there are cinematics or scenes prior the fight that you cannot skip so in case you are dying you have to view these again and again and again... and again.- the puzzles are easy most of all times- a few fights are really challenging e.g. those with the bosses or hordes of enemies that try to kill you- the levels are linear and quite ""tubes"", I prefer open world games to be honest- Lara is quite indestructible and invulnerable.- It would be cool if the dirt / crud on her skin would be more dynamically, e.g. would clean up if  he is running through rain or water.Despite the drawbacks I found, I still I think that this game deserves a fair score and I consider it to be the funniest and most enjoyable first person ""adventure""  I've ever played. Thus I rate Tomb Raider with a 8 / 10 score and can highly recommend it, especially to those that might enjoy the good story placed well in an asian scenario.If you are interested into it I have collected and posted my impressions of the game in a ""Tomb Raider Photobook"" on :"

970,SORO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sorophx/,5,,1,18.6,September,"17,",671,0,1,"There are three things in this new Tomb Raider that I really liked.1. Big open maps, designed with exploration in mind, cleverly broken into several parts that you uncover as you go, with the help of new tools you find along the way. Each map promotes exloration by having several secret areas with short puzzles in them. I'd spend hours making sure I got to every corner of each map. 2. Enemy AI. Human enemies use cover, flanking maneuvers, suppression fire, pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails to force the player to move and think on his feet. 3. Most platforming sections are really fun, with short in-engine cut scenes from time to time to make traversing maps a bit more interesting.There are two things I didn't like.1. QTEs (Quick Time Events) - these should've never been included. I have a feeling it was implemented under pressure to make the make more ""cinematic"". Which only manages to make TR look like an Uncharted knock-off. What's more, some QTEs are scripted so badly that a quick load would go straight into the QTE I just failed without giving me any time to gather myself. QTEs were by far the biggest source of frustration for me while playing TR.2. Gunplay. For some reason shooting in this game feels weird (probably because of the fact that the game's controls also support gamepads and their sensitivity is tweaked with them in mind), it never felt saisfying to shoot any of my guns (shotguns have terrible range, rifles have terrible recoil, and pistols are generally useless when facing groups of enemies, without the extended magazine and increased damage). Fortunately, most locations allow a stealth approach.Overall I loved the game. It could've been better, but I think it's a worthy addition to one of the most popular game franchises."

From start to finish the game kept me at the edge of my seat. It strikes a good balance between shooting and parkour/climbing/environmental puzzles. The story is top-notch and loved the semi-open world nature of the in game island. You cannot traverse the whole island directly but you can fast travel anytime to a campsite and explore the surrounding area to find the missing collectibles or just exploring. The game has lots of set-pieces and QTEs though but they're quite enjoyable. The game nicely depicts the conversation of Lara Croft, from a young archeologist to a capable survivor. Overall I can give it 9/10. The only downside is the lack of tombs.  Crystal Dynamics should definitely add more in the next installment."

And it really is, each of the parts that make this game are working flawlessly, and despite the usual ""Day One"" technical issues, the game works really smooth, even on older hardware. Story wise, there isn't a strong premise, and actually you're going to get your early bit of storyline after the introduction. I can see why it has been a choice, maybe this along with other choices make the story feel a little less convincing than it should be. But of course, it's a story about something unearthly.Where this game really shines is in the artistic design and in the sound quality, the overall degree of atmosphere for such huge landscapes (and a good variety, too), is nearly perfect and truly remarkable given the size of them. The controls (funny enough for a game that's also published on consoles), are well put together aswell, nothing really feels out of place or redundant. Making your way to that rock you're trying to reach is going to be dead simple once you understand the basics.Speaking of things you're trying to reach, there's one thing this game is clearly trying to get you to reach: the countless bullets packs, rewards and maybe even less rewarding little things (GPS caches) that don't add a lot to the game.

1008,Reverend Ragu,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992909722/,25,,0,20.0,June,"29,",830,3,1,"There are things to like about the game - it's quite pretty, and the way Lara can take a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reminds you of some of Indiana Jones' knock-down drag-out fights.  But the game itself doesn't have much respect for you as a player, and everywhere it could be trying something new or bucking a trend, it just doesn't.  It's loud, it's flashy, and it's completely toothless.  There are countless scenes where you're escaping something exploding or falling apart by the skin of your teeth - except it's not by the skin of the teeth, because you're not actually doing very much; it's, for all intents and purposes, a cutscene with the occasional need to press a button.  Like a very, very easy Dragon's Lair.Now, certainly this is preferable to a normal Dragon's Lair, where there's absolutely no tolerance for error.  But it feels like the more cinematic a game gets, the less comfortable it is actually being a game, and we wind up turning the clock back to Laserdisc times.  One of the biggest things that bothered me about this game was how it was a game about being a ""survivor"", yet it's far more ""First Blood Part 2"" than ""First Blood"".  There's one very good scene in the first half hour of the game where Lara is attacked, and winds up killing a guy.  A few minutes before, she tells someone that she'd rather not become a murderer, and there she is, just having killed a man, and she just about throws up.  It's one of the few times I've seen a game actually acknowledge how serious the act of killing is - then she immediately proceeds to brutally kill a dozen more guys without so much as batting an eye.I feel like if the game really wanted to show Lara's transformation from someone who is scared, battered, and alone into a hardened survivor, it really should have left the mass slaughter out, or at least left it until much later in the game.  Fighting should be hard, supplies should be scarce, and you should be trying to avoid combat as much as possible.  Instead, you're constantly being assailed by guys coming out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥' walls and having to shoot the hell out them en masse.  If they had maybe saved something like that until the end, to show the raw determination that Lara has, that might work.  But it's so constant that it becomes routine, and lacks any sort of emotional resonance.  The fights are very easy - so there's no tension, no panic, nothing to justify their inclusion beyond ""you have an AK so we have to give you something to shoot with it"".And the puzzles - the game has great mechanics and clever design to tell you what you can and can't interact with, but it has no faith in its design.  If you get stuck for more than a minute or two, the game will prompt you to go into ""Instinct view"" where Lara will basically tell you straight out how to solve the puzzle.  Saves you needing to run to GameFAQs when you bang your head against something obvious in retrospect for an hour, but completely excises the revelatory joy of discovering anything on your own.The game is enjoyable in a ""let it wash over you"" kind of way, but it's too timid and conservative to be great.Oh, and when Lara got that chunk of rebar through her side at the beginning of the game? She NEVER GOT THAT TREATED. I'm surprised there's going to be a sequel because that's going to get so infected..."

I never liked the seres that much or its main character-Lara Croft. She felt like a character, she felt artificial, she felt too unreal for me to care. This reboot is an  UNcharted stlye kind. The gameplay and pace is Uncharted. The stroy is good. It depicts Lara as a young woman that was forced into a horrible situation, and  she made the choice ot survive it. Screaming, crying, kicking while doing it. A Suirvivor truly is born .Shes the first really good female lead ive seen in a long while. Not npc, not companion, not love interest. LEAD. No one will say she was treated  like a girl. To be  honest , its the only game where i actually was kinda pshysicly feeling sorry for a lead beacuase of it. When a male lead gets beaten badly he has a few wise cracks and moves on, a woman in that place is a little more brutal sight to see.

And that approach has worked really well.Story: You play a younger, more inexperienced version of Lara Croft here. She is far from the confident and sassy adventurer found in previous games. Lara and her crew embark on a perilous journey to find Yamatai, a lost island forgotten by most of civilization. They travel there on a huge ship known as the Endurance and before too long, things spiral out of control. A heavy storm erupts, tearing apart the ship and separating Lara and her companions on this strange island. Lara is then left to fend for herself, frightened and vulnerable. It's here where the story gets really interesting. You try to return Lara to her friends and as you progress through the game, you meet dangerous foes and unravel the dark secret behind Yamatai. The pacing of the story is brisk and I always felt compelled to play through the next chapter of the game. (It took me roughly 11.4 hours to beat the game, including about 4 optional tombs).Graphics: Bumping up the graphics to Ultra settings is really a sight to behold. The game looks stunning. Environments are lush and full of life, the way the sun shines it's rays is splendid and the characters are near photorealistic. The developers Crystal Dynamics have really gone above and beyond in creating a game that looks this good.Sound: The sound of weapons firing and bones crunching as you melee your enemies is captured brilliantly. The voice of Lara, Camilla Ludington portrays her in a way that makes Lara a believable and realistic character. The fact that you can feel the fear behind Lara's voice is a testament to how great her voice actor is. The rest of the characters in the game are voiced well, with the exception of Sam who I felt sounded too corny and forced.Gameplay: This is where the Tomb Raider reboot excels. In the previous games, I felt like controlling Lara was too floaty and that there was no precision in her movements. This has changed dramatically in the reboot. Lara now feels like she was some weight behind her and moves in a way that feels realistic and most of all fun. The gunplay has been revamped to include a cover system and the shooting of guns and especially the bow, is alot of fun. I can say that the gameplay in this game is very similar to the Uncharted games (which I feel is a good thing, as they are one of my favourite games).In summary, Tomb Raider is an amazing reboot and game. The story is an interesting one and the gameplay is just thrilling.9/10."

It 'packed with goodies and various things that only masterpieces have.There are plenty of things to find, exciting and never repetitive in the events.The forest is alive, wraps you in its vibrancy and dynamism, as well as for all areas of the game.Everything about the graphics and amazing DX11 here that are exploited and above all very well. So the game is not overly burdened by this, as they did with Batman Arkham City, just as an example.The tesselation here makes a difference, and have it turned on makes the environment and all those rocks (and there are many) really fantastic, deep and realistic, so in this game like few others the tessellation just beautifies the whole, and it seen.Unlike games like Deus Ex Human Revolution, where he perceives even a minimum, take away tessellation here, and you immediately realize the change in the negative.An outstanding job.Even the AO (ambient occlusion), here is implemented very well in my opinion. When Lara approaches to a climbing wall or climbing and putting upward leg reaches the top, you realize how important it is to the AO and perfect in this case. He manages to make very real lighting which also determines the space between the surface and the character.The static AO is not excessive, as is the case for Far Cry 3.In short, graphically is really something extraordinary, I did not expect, and instead I was literally surprised.The game entertains and engages you to continue the adventure by passing the hours without one noticing.About the choice of the movements a little awkward, at least initially, I personally think that the ""style"" proposed (not so decided, a bit uncertain and somehow even a little uncoordinated) is integrated very well into what is the actual ""being"" of the protagonist, or a helpless that he finds himself in an unknown and largest of its capacity.Imagine that this is the beginning of everything (mostly referring to those who know Lara from the beginning, but not limited to), and that she has become what was to be a result of this ""prologue"" .... it becomes even more exciting.The affected enemies fall to the ground in many ways, and especially in believable ways, there is a meticulous work for that too. Another point in favor, because remember, it is not a shooter.When he lit the torch in his hand and turning the camera around (near) Lara passes the light from the opposite side.That's nice.It seems that she reacts to every environmental event (even minimal) .... as she passes, it always turns to look at whether there is a bas-relief, or at least if there is something to look at, walk near the fire and raises his hand to shelter from the heat, falling into the water and she has a small gesture of ""anger"" because she's wet .... in short, is full of these goodies that make you closer and closer to the protagonist, considering it ""alive"" than ever before.Ultimately, this game was a big surprise, because it stand out from all the others, putting a lot of quality from all points of view.If someone would define it as a masterpiece, it would be a label that would not large at all.8.5/10"

1018,Cassynder,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cassynder/,4,,1,114.5,March,"26,","2,810",3,1,"Tomb Raider is the 2013 reboot of the venerated series and is the first game of a second reboot trilogy by Crystal Dynamics. Their first three games at the helm were all successful but what does this new reboot offer us? This is what I think of Tomb Raider. This game simply blew me away. As a big fan of the franchise, I was naturally excited about a new Tomb Raider game before launch but after seeing some criticism in early reviews about it, I was concerned. I needn't have been, this game is incredible. Offering up a fresh take on Lara Croft, this origin story pulled out all the stops and left me eager for more. The story was great, the characters were good and Lara herself was excellent. And the combat does not suck, a Tomb Raider first ladies and gentlemen. This game also wears the influence of Uncharted on its sleeve and is, in my opinion, the better for it. To story then. Our tale starts with Lara and her friends on an expedition to find the lost land of Yamatai, which predictably goes wrong in the opening cutscene. Caught in a storm, they end up shipwrecked on an island. A bunch of a crazy psychopaths inhabit the island and things go from bad to worse real quick, with Lara getting put through the grinder from the start. A rude awakening for the young student, who must learn to fight for her life and that of her friends, survive the dangers of the island and uncover its dark secrets. Easily the best story in the entire franchise, this new take on Lara before she became the Tomb Raider was brilliant and it was very satisfying to see her triumph despite being so ill-equiped to deal with the island at the beginning. Expect 10-15 hours to complete the story, depending on how long you spend doing the optional challenges and finding collectibles.  Since Crystal Dynamics have been making Tomb Raider games, Lara and the supporting cast have all improved considerably and this game is no different. Lara herself is brilliant, voiced by the talented Camilla Luddington, bringing a much more human and vulnerable side to Lara than has been seen before. What she goes through in this game would break most people and her character is just so well done. Supporting characters also impress, with tough father figure Conrad Roth helping her throughout the game, her best friend Sam, wise cracking Alex, the funny old Scottish guy Grim and Jonah, all round nice dude fleshing out the cast. Seeing Jonah's role in the next game makes me appreciate his character all the more as well. Mathias, mad and dangerous leader of the Solarii is also a compelling villain, something Tomb Raider games don't always manage to nail. Fantastic all round. Gameplay has changed from past titles. No longer focused on exploration, Crystal Dynamics decided to double down on the style that served Uncharted so well whilst also making it their own thing. Tomb Raider no longer has dodgy and mediocre combat, instead it's now fluid and slick and very satisfying to play. Lara doesn't have her iconic dual pistols but she rocks the bow and arrow, as well as some other weapons you obtain throughout the game. Movement and platforming is great, although much of the trial and error has been taken out from previous games, which is a good and bad thing. It's no longer frustrating but it's fairly easy now, relying more on explosive set pieces and lots of falling, Nathan Drake style. I love the Uncharted games so I think this is great, but I know not all fans feel that way so bear that in mind. In terms of level design, I have no real complaints. The game is a series of connected sections, each with a few campsites that you can use to fast travel across the island. You pass through each area as the story unfolds but you are free to return to each area to finish optional challenges, find collectibles or return to finish the ""tombs"" found throughout the game. You unlock new gear and equipment as you progress through the story, some of which is required to access some places in the earlier sections. I'm personally a fan of this type of design, and it's great going back to clear each area. Yamatai is also an interesting place to explore, with old crumbling Japanese ruins, shipwrecks, a sprawling shantytown and World War II bunkers providing variety. Graphically, the game looks great. Despite releasing in 2013, it still looks decent today. I wasn't a big fan of the look for Lara in this one, although it's a relief to see her as a normal, more realistic heroine rather than an overly sexualised playboy model with big guns. Not that I'm complaining too much about that! The soundtrack in this game is very good, Jason Graves providing both epic and sombre tracks to a terrific game. Not quite as good as the original soundtracks but a fine effort. The voice acting was great all round, with a great cast. Particularly enjoyed Luddington's version of Lara. Now onto some negatives. I enjoyed the switch to a more action oriented experience with more combat sections but there is so little actual ""tomb raiding,"" with only some small puzzles in six tombs scattered throughout the island dedicated to this side of the series. Much effort is made to show how tough it is for Lara at the beginning, struggling with taking her first life and bringing out all the raw emotion that comes with that. But over the course of the game, she takes so many lives it conflicts with the early struggles. This is of course a video game and so I can look past it but maybe less enemies and more inventive paths past enemies would have been better for this title. Also, multiplayer. A mode that should never have been in the game and the less said about it the better.All that said, Tomb Raider is still a fantastic game and is my second favourite of the series, right behind Rise. It's still a joy to play through and although I do miss the old exploration aspects of older Tomb Raider titles, this action blockbuster of a game is a magnificent ride and I enjoyed every second of it. With a kick-ass story, great characters and perhaps the best interpretation of what Lara would really be like after going through what she does makes for an unmissable game. Play it and play it now."

They made Lara Croft infinitely more likable and relatable. She is just an ordinary who reaches for extraordinary under ridiculous conditions. This a change from the Buxom Lara's with infinite resources at hand as previous Tomb Raider games. It actually is an origin story that I quite. Though it's not much of an origin story as it is more of a reimagining of the Tomb Raider universe. Now to the game itself. You play as Lara Croft (duh) a fresh young archaeologist. You are traveling through the what I believe is the South China Sea, looking for the lost land of Yamatai. There is a group of you including your best friend and film maker Sam trying to make a tv show based on the adventures in finding Yamatai. Lara has a realization of where they should be looking for this lost land. The catch is it's in an area where all boats and planes go missing. AS they approach the island a storm hits and wrecks the boat and they are stranded on the Island. However, they are not alone as there is now a cult of people living there and following the Sun Queen.  AS you try and fight your way off the island it becomes evident the Island itself is trying to keep you there. Now what could be causing this phenomenon? So you start the game alone with nothing and you must rely on your survival skills to make weapons, forage for food, forage for supplies and improve your chances of survival. The weapons are all upgradeable and you can find parts to permanently upgrade your weapons to a better weapon ie makeshift bow to a long bow. The weapon controls are a bit wonky but once you get used to them they are not bad at all. Not great but they are not bad. You will have to climb, shoot, balance, and zipline yourself across the map. You will explore ancient tooms, unearth relics from years, and discover journals for lost peoples who have stumbles onto this mysterious island before you. The game is truly gorgeous there were many times during which I had to stop and just take in all the beauty they added into this world. It was a place I actually wanted to get out and explore. I was immersed. The voice acting is all pretty well done. The ambient sound is great, enjoyed that immensly with headphones. The game is difficult enough to be challenging without being soul crushingly so. Though if you ever do get lost you can always use your survival instincts. Some people thought the game was boring and held your hand but whatever to those people. I think it is a very well done adventure game with amazing visuals. The Bad:I am not entirely sure why there is a multiplayer. It seems like such a waste of resources. I couldn't really get into it. TR should always be a singe player adventure game. -The story can be a bit much. - Some controls are a bit wonky and the finding of random ass campfires can be a little weird.- a few too many QTEs-Glowingly obvious one of the characters is nefarious from the beginning. Not much of a twist. Final rating.8.7/10 - Pick it up. It's fine for a full price release. But if you are still undecided, pick it up during a sale and give it a go."

Never I have found something so intense, under the graphics aspect, as well as development of the story, and the perfection of almost every tiny detail within the whole game.For some incredible circumstance, I remember one day of some years ago simply putting it in my macOS Steam library almost by mistake (also to be on the safe side!), so I recently found it in my 'possession' for free. I then decided to give it another run so I also bought some DLCs. The Steam offer - some 70% off - is simply irresistible!My personal vote is definitely 10 out of 10, !"

There have also been a ton of games since a long time back, but this edition the Tomb Raider 2013 GOTY(which i own) is really great, this apparently was the first game to come out with Tress FX (AMD users will benefit from this, Nvidia cards will suffer unless you have a powerful card), So for people who don't know what tress fx is and what it does well let me explain it in short for you, Tress FX gives Lara's Hair a really Natural look, that meanss during the time of wind blowing her entire hair wont move, only certain parts of her hair would move, just like Natural hair, and this is not all the graphics level for this game is insane, even my computer had certain trouble running this game at Ultra at 1080P, so if ur getting this to play it on Ultra make sure to get a decently powerful GPU. Coming onto about the story, well the story is also really great, the way it has been based on how she got shipwrecked on a certain island and then till the time she managed to get out, everything was a challenge. One great thing i like about this game as well is that it is Third Person based so you can see the entire world as well, cause at certain times in the jungle Wolves tend to come Finally onto how the gameplay was, the gameplay in my opinion was great and if you are a fan of Tomb raider then you would like it even more. I would recommend getting this game on a sale with the DLC's as well if you want to enjoy the game fully"

There was definitely less puzzle solving and more combat than I expected, but once I got into it, it was a blast. I found the exploration challenging (in a good way), and there is lots of space to explore the world at your own pace. Personally, I am not a fan of lots of back tracking so that was not great for me, but that is more of a personal preference. The story was interesting (if a little weird), the voice acting was good, graphics are excellent (for 2013), and the game ran very smoothly for me. Overall, it was very enjoyable, and I can see myself giving the single player / story mode another go some time in the future.Multiplayer: a complete mess. Here's the short version:- cheating and hacking is widespread - that is really not an overstatement; it is so rampant- no cross-platform support- no matchmaking between people with DLC maps and those without, even when playing in a non-DLC map (I bought DLC and can't even tell you what those maps look like - virtually impossible to find matches there)- frequent lags, crashes and glitchesI know this is a 2013 game but it is galling that the company continues accepting money for DLC maps that aren't really used and with no support to make multiplayer a more enjoyable experience. When it works, MP is a real blast, but you have to wade through the cheaters and errors to find something good.Overall, I definitely recommend this game, but get it on sale."

And this is the Tomb Raider reboot. While LAra Croft may remain the same in some ways, her persona seems to have changed quite a bit. Instead of making Lara a fearless heroine of the Tomb Raider game, she instead seems like a normal woman, who is pretty much forced to fight for her life, quite literally. From the get go, Lara is battered, bruised, and beaten, from both the elements that surround her, and this mysterious new bunch of protagonists who seem to be in a quite large and deadly cult. Gone is the trekking from one world locale to the next in the form of levels. Instead, the game opts for a more seamless flow, where the game takes place entirely on an island. A pretty damn big one at that, out in the middle of nowhere. It's an island full of history wrapped in mystery and occult type stuff. Typically a good place for raiding some tombs :) It's gritty, it's dirty, it's completely rotten to the core. And I love it! Now while in previous Tomb Raider games, the game was 90% platforming, and 10% gunfights, you have a much more even mix here. The fire fights are plenty, and there is just enough platforming involved to make it a Tomb Raider title, not just in title. Lara will do some amazing leaps of faith, and usually not by choice. She'll be doing it to survive. Not to find that buried treasure.The entire theme of the game has gone from the relaxed indiana jones-lite feel from previous games, and adopted a much more sinister and adult tone. It's completely satisfying. It may turn some purists off, but it's their loss. As for the combat side of things, you will find various weapons that completely the theme of the location Lara is in. A bow, which is made from a makeshift set of sticks, and a string, which works with deadly accuracy. A worn hand gun. A world war II era machine gun. And more. And with the salvage that Lara scavenges, you can even upgrade weapons. Combat is fast, quick, and enemies are ruthless. And yes, there is going to be some QTE involved, but not much. Not enough to be considered overkill at the very least. Can not comment on multiplayer yet, since I have not played it. But I've heard no issues with it. Anyway, I can not recommend this game enough. The visuals are amazing. The gameplay satisfying. And Lara went from fearless to just plain badass in one reboot. Buy this game now!"

Was consistently impressed with the scenery from the Mad Maxesque shanty town to a shipwrecked beach. I'll never forget fighting & escaping my way through the burning mountain temple, an astounding set piece. The game nails the use of the bow & arrow (flaming arrows FTW) as its control mechanics are very satisfying to use. The platforming is excellent too as you find yourself jumping from ledges, zip lining down mountains, & scaling cliffs. My main gripe is the frustrating switch of weapon mechanics to button mashing in some boss fights & not being able to replay levels is stupid, but I still can't wait to play the sequel!

This game has beautiful graphics, really detailed backrounds, objects and much more. It's also very hard but fair combat (unless you play on the lower difficulties) as you have limited ammo and have to lote your enemies often to find ""Salvege"" that you can use to upgrade your weapons with. The story and the lores/objects you find in the world are often worth while looking in too as they can hold useful information as well as sometimes give you some XP! The enemy AI is very realistic (for being maniacs) those with guns don't just rush up on you but always take cover and makes comments about what they are doing and what you are doing. Even those with melee weapons don't always recklessly rush you, they often stick from cover to cover until they are so close that they can rush you. One complaint about them tough, when you find yourself in a situation of few covers and they have molotoves (did I spell that right?) they constantly never run out of them so you have only a few moments where you can shoot them. It's also fun and rewarding to hunt animals in the wilds, as the map is pretty much an open world, but the animals sometimes are pretty stupid but I won't complain about that. Sometimes you also find Tombs that are totally free to explore if you want, in the begining they are pretty easy but as it goes on they become very hard. They give you a lot of salvege as a reward! Now I have not played the entire game but I have tried the multiplayer and let's just say that it doesn't bring out the strong side of this game! But it hardly brings down the experience of the single player as you will spen hours there of hunting, sneaking, exploring, looting, upgrading, and dying horrible deaths in this game!

What I got was a fun action game with interesting characters and an engaging story.Don't get me wrong, I understand the distrust coming from the hardcore fans, but in all honesty, the reboot turned out much better than expected. Regardless of some linear sections, there is a good deal of areas to explore and things to collect.  The fighting could be tense, though it is way too easy on the normal difficulty. The story has a nice arc, and the places the game takes you are truly breathtaking.I enjoyed the little touches like Lara needing to collect salvage in order to upgrade her arsenal of weapons, and the new equipment you need to find in order to unlock new areas of the map.Some of the downsides of the game are the following:- Some collectibes are mindless ones like the GPS caches. Throw me some more info about the world and let these pieces you find through genuine exploration carry some weight.- Raiding tombs, while enjoyable, are extremely short. You just solve a puzzle in ten minutes and you're done.- The tone of the game does not always suit the game's theme. The game's tagline reads that a survivor is born, but there is little surviving to do, gameplay-wise. From the first two hours I thought that I would need to at least hunt to get some food but nope, that was only for Lara to hunt down a poor Bambi. Lara also likes to climb snowy mountains without a jacket...I know these are small things, but this aspect of the game could have been handled so much better!- The characters could have had some additional layers to them. There is a huge disconnect when Lara is portrayed as this broken hero but the next scene she just mowes down ten bad guys with assault rifles and bombs against her. Have the game fight you 2-3 guys and gradually move up the numbers, and then you'll have a more believable arc. (Not to mention, there is a scene later in the game when a character sacrifices himself to save Lara because...THEY ARE PINNED DOWN. Why didn't she just shoot back and save the day?)Overall, a fun action game with an interesting story and breathtaking visuals. Do give it a try when it goes on sale!(Also, be aware the the GOTY edition is just a bunch of skins. I was looking forward to the tomb that came with the DLC but then I finished it in 10 minutes, so there you go...)"

The graphics are excellent and realistic (there's a graphics option specifically for the quality of Lara's hair, as you've probably already heard).  Lara's actually a character now, with personality, a realistic body shape, practical clothing, and dirt and wounds from the beatings she's taken, rather than a Barbie doll with guns.  The new combat system is reasonably good.  There's a story that's more than just a brief series of cliches (okay, maybe not  much more, but it's a hell of a lot better than what the original  had to offer).It's not all good news, though.  There's a bit of dissonance in the story, for example, where Lara has an emotional breakdown over killing a man, and not long after, guns men down by the dozen without batting an eyelash.  Lara's incredibly slow to figure out a 'twist' that seemed a little too obvious to me.  And... there seems to be something... missing from the gameplay.  What could it be?  Oh, yeah: tombs, and the raiding thereof.  Sure, there are a few 'optional tombs', but they're short and simplistic compared to the puzzles from the old .  Aside from those few optional areas, the gameplay is even more dumbed down: all exploration and shooting; no puzzles whatsoever.  Maybe from a marketing standpoint, it makes sense to turn  into yet another bloody shooter, but it still comes as a disappointment.  In keeping with the commercialism, they've also sunk resources into a multiplayer mode, but it's buggy and nothing to write home about, and the lobbies are often deserted.  The final nail in that coffin, of course, is all the DLC, some of which is for abilities and weapon mods that can easily be earned in-game, some of which is for multiplayer goodies that aren't much good when hardly anyone plays multiplayer, and some of which is for extra optional tombs (I haven't bought any of those, but if the tombs in the base game are any indication, they're a ripoff).In conclusion: by all means, buy this game, but be aware that you're buying a  that has forgotten that it's supposed to be about raiding tombs, and don't bother with the DLC."

Imagine my surprise once I found out, that this is one of most linear, on-rail, dumbed-down, scripted and QTE-driven pieces of garbage I have ever laid my hands on! You're not the player/adventurer/puzzle solver - you're a spectator of a cheap action flick. Press ""W"" to run forward, tap ""Space"" to jump across obsticles, shoot bad guys and occasionally solve a ""mind-bending"" puzzle which involves shooting rope arrows or burning something with a torch. The only survival element is hunting. You hunt critters and larger game and collect SALVAGE. Then you use salvage to upgrade your weapons. Makes sense, doesn't it? Oh, I forgot a few more elements: Lara gets cold and hungry. One cutscene of Lara making a fire and cooking and that's taken care of for the rest of the game. One of the most useful weapons is the bow. Wouldn't it be great to craft your own arrows and conserve ammo, taking time to plan an attack and effectively applying a more stealthy approach, since we're like... surviving? Yeah, would be great, but sadly, large amounts of ammo crates and arrows are placed on every step of your linear path. Cranking the difficulty up to Hard doesn't help at all. The only times you die is when you fail to ""press ""random button"" not to die"". Lara runs, jumps, shoots, taunts her enemies while everything around bursts into flames in slow motion. If that's your idea of an adventure / survival / open-world game - flip off. Pros: Graphics and bouncing Lara's breasts. Cons: Pretty much everything. I remember myself playing the original Tomb Raider  on PlayStation - now that was a great and challenging experience. Somewhere along the line the evolution of games came to a complete stop. 4/10"

1065,Aarontu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aarontu/,4,,1,13.9,July,"26,",878,1,1,"Crystal Dynamics has taken their old and beloved series and made a reboot with nice graphics and semi-stealth-action gameplay mixed with some mechanics either lifted or inspired from the older games (reminds me of other games published by Square Enix that received similar treatment; Deux Ex, Thief, Hitman). In the case of Tomb Raider, the amount of polish and the presentation is very impressive. It's a very cinematic 3rd person shooter type game with lots of platforming and climbing around environments. It was very well done. Gaining new gadgets and weapons that let you access more areas, including spots of previously completed areas, give the game a slight Metroidvania feel, though it's still linear and backtracking to previous areas is only to collect missed collectibles. If I had a nitpick for the game, it would be that there is entirely too much combat. This mysterious island seems to have hundreds of people living on it (and that's just the guys that you run into!). I highly recommend it if you like cinematic action games."

These are the moments I always want in games but seldom experience…when Gordon picked up the super gravity gun and went OFF…when Commander Shepard walked the line at the end of ME2…when Shoeless Joe Jackson tells Ray Kinsella “Build it and HE will come” (sorry…not a game).  At some point half-way through I really started to care about Lara Croft. I stopped analyzing the game for its merits and started playing it enthusiastically. So much so that when I knew I was on the last quest I stopped and went back to all my previous locations to pick up any remaining things because I wanted to prolong the experience…not “level up”.  That should tell you something.The game really isn’t that hard, the puzzles are not complicated, the side missions and searches for ""stuff"" are not totally integral to the story...but I was having so much fun I finished all the core mission’s w/100% of the non-essential stuff I had to find. I spent hours looking for mushrooms, flags, and Buddha’s. It really was that good (far better than mining planets in ME2). I identified with the physical locations in the game (remote island w/lots of Japanese WW2 stuff in it), I identified with the hero in a way I haven't since Portal 2 and Mass Effect 2, and I thought the voice acting was excellent. Even though your compatriots don’t do much but die (in solid QT sequences), they add to the sense that Lara is in way over her head and maybe somewhat out of her head. Tomb Raider was the most enjoyable game I've played in a long time. Although technically a reboot, this is an entirely original game that should appeal to anyone.  The level design was original and very vertical, some of the QT sequences are totally implausible but incredibly fun, there’s a LOT of gore early on (and in some of the later missions), and although the story is only slightly above average…it’s told exceptionally well.In a nutshell…best gaming experience for me since Mass Effect 2 and Portal 2. Notes: Most if not all the technical issues at start have been corrected with updates and new video drivers. The much vautned TRESSFX hair effect is, more or less, a foo-foo add to get you to run their benchmark...but it is a cool mini-benchmark and you owe it to yourself to try it (if for anything else than to see your gaming rig crawl to 16fps or slower at max settings)."

The tombs are my favourite part of the games and I have to say they were extremely mediocre I done 4 of them within 10 minutes (collective). And multiplayer should have no place in a tomb raider game in my opinion.

First lets get the pro's out of the way:+The game is visually appealing. The atmosphere is set perfectly for each moment of the game.+Lara, the player's character, is well developed throughout the story of the ""game"".+Voice acting is good.That's it for everything good about this game. Now for the con's:-Even though Lara is a great character, almost every other character is boring. You don't feel any connection with any of them and after finishing the game you don't even remember their names.-Way too many cut scenes. Also, there are some sections which severely restrict the player's control. This isn't fun.-The quick time events. There are also too many of them. You never know if it will be a cut scene, or a random quick time event. They aren't built into the combat system very well either. Also, did I mention they aren't fun?-The ""platforming"" is ridiculously easy. This is the one area they could have went crazy with, but they decided to play it safe and make it so easy even a toddler could beat it.-Simplistic puzzle elements. Once in while, you get puzzles. Needless to say, most of them require little to no thinking on your part. There's usually only a few elements to the puzzle, and even if you get stuck, you can use your ""survival instincts"" to help you point out the elements. A monkey with autism could understand this game's simple and easy mechanics. -Music is forgettable. I don't think I need to explain this further.-Story is average.-Multiplayer mode... I don't even want to get into this. Tomb Raider has always been a single player game.Overall, this game is just too generic. It looks pretty, but that's about it. I am disappointed in how it turned out."

1089,Aconithorn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aconithorn/,5,,0,29.0,November,"18,",22,0,1,"This is a mediocre game and a terrible Tomb Raider. I'm a big fan of the series and this just didn't make it for me. I don't even know where to start. .The story is interesting, great setting and great premise, but I hate the way it's executed. You have little time to get attached to the characters before they're killed off. Only Roth gets a decent treatment through the story you can read on the documents you find around. This could be solved weren't you constantly separated from the rest of the crew, then reunited, then separated again. Which brings me to the pacing: you're constantly rushing. There's always someone to kill, something to run from, proper exploration is relegated to tombs where you only get one chamber for most. Exploration through the areas is boring as the path to follow is extremely straightforward and eventually reduces everything to a collectibles hunt. It's like the BoTW Korok Seed quest, except for the whole time you're not shooting.The shooting is not good either. Keep running forward (not like there are many directions to run towards), take cover, shoot. That's it. Your health is almost infinite (except when trying to make reasonable jumps, in that case it's instant death). Keep staying covered and you can kill everyone without a problem. You  get to the end of the game overpowered and never ever running out of ammo.There is very little variety in the enemies you face: wolves, soldiers with three different type of armors, and samurais that for some reason appear only in the very end of the game, giving the illusion of finally getting something new only to behave exactly like the soldiers, except they speak Japanese this time. You can shoot everything and you're done. It's boring and repetitive. Giving credit where it's due, the finishers are pretty gruesome and it gets my adrenaline rushing. This lack of variety further manifests in the complete absence of proper bosses, who are replaced with slightly bigger soldiers you can all defeat with the same strategy, attacking right after dodging. You don't even get the satisfaction of a proper last battle with the main antagonist: it's a quick time event.The quick time events, they're everywhere. Playing the first part of the game will feel like watching a movie where you sometimes must press a key for it to proceed. QTEs will cut you some slack in the middle only to triumphantly come back in the finale to replace what could have been a good battle and ruin everything.After all of this you don't even get to interact with the environment the way you did in older Tomb Raiders. Forget the intricate puzzles from Anniversary. Just do this very easy to guess set of actions fast enough and any riddle will be solved. Looking for collectibles? Lost your way? No more reading the room for clues or hard to see ledges. Just spam the ""Survival instinct"" key. For the most part, you'll find no hard places to reach to get that special relic or secret. It feels like an Easter hunt for chocolate eggs and it's still less thrilling than that.Then you have the bugs and glitches. Stuff not spawning where it should (a collectible in a certain area will only spawn if you fast travel to a precise camp), stuff despawning (I had the whole floor disappear under my feet in Cliffside Bunker), getting stuck in trees because you dared try to explore too much, cameras panning god knows where for certain battle finishers...if you're lucky enough you might end up with a 100% complete game according to all guides -with Steam achievments to prove so- telling you you only have 98-99% of the game complete, good luck figuring out why since the developers have never looked into it since 2013. Have a look at the forums if you don't believe it. Hats off to you if you have the patience to go through all of what I've mentioned above again just to -hopefully, if you manage not to trigger the bug again- get a 100% savefile.There are a few good things in this game. It's satisfyng to see Lara's character develop throughout the story. The finishers are awesome. You can tell a lot of care was put in the bow mechanics. The lore is great; the way the Solarii were built as a concept, queen Himiko, and so on...however, to me, all of this does not overcome its problems.I only recommend this game if you plan to play every single Tomb Raider in existence or if you particularly care about Lara's character. Otherwise, there are better exploration games, better shooting games and definitely better Tomb Raiders."

Took me this long to play it because of severe running issues on my old computer (refused to even start due to my Nvidia graphics card that was certainly good enough to run it), but it ran like a dream on my gaming desktop and looked stunning.The direction and animation in this game is phenomenal and the redesign of Lara is much better than she used to look (will look? Prequels, eh?). Despite uproar over gameplay changes, this was a very fun game with plenty of exploration but still linear enough to find your way and move the story.The writing is pretty good and the voice acting is above average; it's refreshing to hear a realistic British accent even if she does say 'elevator'.The game can be a bit heavy-handed with the QTEs, particularly at the beginning, but hours of playing around and exploring is enough to drown that out.Also worth mentioning: the death animations. God, this game has a lot of death animations. No simple ragdolling for Lara Croft. Enjoy watching a few particular ones again and again as you fail to get past the damn quick QTEs.Nonetheless, this is a very polished game with only a couple of bugs (worst was when I did a combat roll and slipped through a rock into the void).I heartily recommend this game."
1096,Kunal239,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137364421/,5,1,1,16.5,June,"28,",249,2,1,"Tomb Raider was released in 2013 developed by Square Enix and is one of the three games which were released by this franchise.It is a masterpiece of a game featuring Lara Croft ,daughter of the Late Richard Croft whose expeditions and discoveries were world renowned.This game is a reboot of the Lara Croft character after using her in some classic games.The game focuses on the painful and horrorful journey of a common adventurer to become the legendary survivor we all know her to be.The game starts off with Lara and the Endurance crew in search of an hidden and mysterious island in the troubled waters of the Pacific Ocean.Nearing the cursed island sudden storms arrive and take down the Endurance ,crashing it and seperating the crew.Left stranding on an unforgiving and a ruthless island filled with dangers of all kind.Its upto Lara to find her inner survivor to save the people she cares about and escape from this ancient cursed island.Its a story of loss,suffering and realisation towards the greater goal which Lara has towards the Croft family.Players play as Lara in third person where the basic objective is to do anything to survive.This requires players to jump,climb porous-looking rock faces and rough stone,loot animals and also perform some close death defying action sequences.The main mission starts with Lara getting herself accustomed to basic chores step by step needed for survival.This includes hunting animals for salvage,learning to ignite a fire and dodging wolf attacks.Pick axe and the weapons are gradually acquired as the game progresses.Salvaging is extremely essential to earn perks which are extemely helpful in tough situations.Supply crates ,dead bodies of insurgents and animals account for salvage points.Greater the salvage the better.Apart from the story mission there are some non story quests like raiding tombs (which needs certain puzzle solving skills) ,burning enemy flags,stealing eggs from bird's nest and lighting up shrines.The whole island is scattered with ancient relics ,documents and GPS caches which unravel a certain mystery associated with it and adds variety to the game.The main mission doesn't disappoint at any point and constantly improves at every passing phase.I wish the same could have been said for the side missions.Let's have a look at the combat portion of the gameplay Combat for this game is truly satisfying and extremely smooth.Combat can be approached in two ways which are Stealth or All Guns Blazing.This actually depends on the number of enemies a player is against.As a case ,if the enemy party is small they could be taken out with guns and grenades and if there is a large group its better to take out as many unsuspecting enemies as possible.And also there is an option of close combat using the pick-axe along with dirty tricks.Timed dodges can be converted to instant kills but all these require spending points earned through salvaging supply crates and dead bodies. Tomb Raider has stunningly beautiful imagery which makes the players take notice.Particulary the monstrous cold winds storming through the island and the howling seas are a sight to behold.The tombs ,documents and relics are well crafted and does give the feeling of them being very old.The island's inhabitants and oppressors are well done but they could have been better.The trees ,shrubbery ,abandoned buildings and caves manage to do justice.Lara's attire shows wears and tears as the game progresses. The game doesn't disappoint at any point as far as the game sounds are concerned.Players could hear the fearful sighs of Lara and the approaching footsteps of enemies clearly at the same time.The exact sound effects required for the heavy storms are well incorporated.The rushing sound of flowing river water,rustling of leaves with winds ,ringing of bells near a tomb provide a wonderful experience.  There was a huge hype regarding the expectations from this game keeping the characters long gaming history in consideration and its safe to say that it managed to live up to the hype and maybe even get over it.There is no issue if one doesn't have any idea about previous Tomb Raider games as this is the best possible game to know the Lara Croft's legacy.Its a wonderful piece of work and i would highly recommend playing it.I loved it and i hope other players will love it too.I give it a 8.2 out of 10."
1097,Gramps,https://steamcommunity.com/id/virgingrandpa/,11,,0,13.5,January,"10,",113,0,1,"This is the most ""Hollywood"" game I have ever played. It feels more like watching a 10+ movie then a video game as you literally have almost no choice whatsoever, and I'm not just talking this from story perspective, I'm also talking about gameplay-aspect too.Game introduces some kind of stealth, but don't be fooled, it's simply not possible to be stealthy in this game as there are lots of places where enemies are scripted to automatically notice you so that game can turn into hollywood-movie-type escape sequence where everything is exploding, bullets on all sides, you are jumping on this that, buildings exploding... pew pew boom boom ... standard hollywood movie stuff... One aspect that the game does really well in my opinion tho (aside from graphics) is is the platforming stuff (raiding tombs + collecting hidden collectibles). Through game you earn interesting gadgets and when you combine them with decent physics that this game has it's really fun to use brain and solve puzzles :)Overall I think this game is OK, but if you are a fan of sandbox/stealth/choices-matter games like Hitman, Deus Ex, Witcher 3, ...  then maybe you should skip this game (or grab it on sale), as it's REALLY linear (and combat is not really that fun you just go from cover to cover and shoot enemies :/ )It reminds me a lot of AC Black Flag for some reason (but without tailing missions, boats, and working stealth)"

1100,Macho Fantastico,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MachoFantastico/,3,,1,15.7,March,"17,",607,0,1,"It'd be easy to look upon Tomb Raider with a cynical eye, one tinted with the knowledge that the men and women of Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal had at some point, played the highly successful Uncharted franchise and said 'hey, let's make that game but featuring Lara Croft' and to be fair on face value that's how Tomb Raider appears, a less captivating Uncharted as it attempts to reboot a franchise many would called outdated.However, stop and breath in this 2013 reboot of the much loved Playstation One franchise and you'll discover an action packed adventure that's worth experiencing. Whilst it leans heavily on the fundamentals first seen in the Uncharted franchise with it's mix of over the top action sequences, ancient tomb puzzles that need solving and gun antics that feel all a little to familiar, Tomb Raider is able to hold it's own thanks to some splendid visuals and some memorable if flawed character development, even if Lara's origin story feels hampered by the fact that it's a video game at the end of the day.On an expedition to find the mysterious island of Yamatai, Lara and a group of adventurers seek the truths of the Sun Queen, Himiko only for things to go awry. On this expedition Lara's joined by her close friend Samantha, of Japanese descent whose love for the story of the Sun Queen Himiko is what drives Lara to make it on her own, following in the footsteps of her father. Other members of the team include Conrad Roth, a friend of Lara's Father, Dr James Whitman whose driving need to rejuvenate his dying TV career puts him in constant contrast with Lara and the other members of the expedition including Alex, Angus, Jonah and Joslin. While the interaction between cast members is done as much through documents found scattered throughout the Island then cut scenes, they do a nice job of highlighting Lara's constant inexperience and innocence to the true dangers she might face on her journey. The only downside to this is that there's a little too much story and character development done through these collectible documents.The Island of Yamatai is as beautiful as it is mysterious, with some stunning landscapes that feel varied enough as Lara ventures around the island. Speaking of travel, whilst it might seem that Tomb Raider offers up an open world for you to explore, it is instead a collection of separate locations that feature a wide array of collectibles and tombs to discover. These locations provide more than enough open space for you to never feel like you're being linearly driven about, but it can still feel limited. Lara controls well thanks to responsive controls though you won't be making any impossible jumps as the games pretty forgiving when it comes to traversing the island. Gun play can feel a little loose at times and isn't always the high point of Lara's adventure but it works for the most part and the ability to upgrade your numerous weapons by collecting scraps is a welcomed addition. Speaking of which, Lara will gain access to camps which allow her to upgrade her skills, fast travel throughout the island and as previously mentioned, upgrade weaponry.Upgrading Lara's abilities feels justified by Lara's tale of maturity as she faces the many dangers the island of Yamatai as to offer. Seeing Lara develop from a somewhat frightened and scared women to the strong almost reckless individual willing to face any dangers to rescue her friends is when Tomb Raider is at it's best. Unfortunately this being a video game an all, the need to throw enemies at Lara's feet, constantly contradicts some of the early story points as it feels weird that Lara goes from killing for the first time in a state of fright and shock to gunning down twenty to thirty men without a single sign of regret or expression. Don't get me wrong, this is fine as we see a more mature Lara face these dangers constantly but they highlight a flaw in Tomb Raider's storytelling in the early hours. All that said, Tomb Raider provides a decent tale and a fine framework for Lara's development as a character, a reinvention that the franchise needed more than I'd thought and in this regard it does a fine job of setting the scene for future games.Did Tomb Raider really need multiplayer? The simple answer is no, though it's not necessarily bad the whole mode feels like an after thought and one most won't return to all to often. That said, I'm playing the PC version of Tomb Raider many months since it's release and I was able to get a few games in so at least some people are still playing. To be fair to the multiplayer, it benefits from the fact that Tomb Raider plays great with responsive and fun controls, even if the gun play remains as spotty in multiplayer as it does in single player. However I'd still rather play Uncharted's variety of multiplayer modes over Tomb Raider's any day. But taken as a whole, the multiplayer doesn't exactly harm what the game as to offer as package, it just doesn't feel necessary.So, was this Tomb Raider reboot needed and is it worth consideration? Well yes it is. That's not just because it's a fun Uncharted copy and paste experience, but that it also attempts and succeeds in adding value and depth to a character that's been often seen as nothing more than eye candy in the past. Lara Croft made waves as a video game figure back in the PS1 days, but looking back now she appears to be a thin and lifeless figure that's a lasting reminder of how far we've come in character design in video games. Thankfully the folks at Crystal Dynamics and Eidos Montreal have reinvented Lara for the modern age, creating a character that feels more human and yet venerable despite her numerous strength. It sets up the building blocks for what could be a fascinating franchise in the years to come and it's started off strong with this fun and well paced action adventure."

I just have a  single additional comment about Tomb Raider, and it's not about graphics, gameplay, story, or anything along these lines. My comment is about what Tomb Raider really is....or was.As a hardcore Tomb Raider fan (Tomb Raider II was the first Tomb Raider game I've played, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation was my first PC game.), I was describing Tomb Raider as an absolute peak of dungeon-crawling mystery-solving action-advanture games. All past Tomb Raider games had many consistent things; unique geographical/mythological concepts for each game, amazingly hard puzzles, masterful characterizations of both Lara Croft and side characters, and a lot more, which in total makes a signiture for Tomb Raider games.On the other hand, ""Tomb Raider"" don't have any of these. Cliché concept of being trapped in a cursed/abondoned island, containing easiest puzzles sutiable for little kids, with generic/simple characterizations of both side characters and Lara. In my opinion, we are living some unfortunate times right now, all games with special mechanics are being casualized: Hitman (Other games vs. Absolution), Splinter Cell (Other games vs. Conviction), Max Payne (Other games vs. Max Payne 3), all these games with unique concepts and mechanics are now 3rd person shooters, just like Tomb Raider (Tomb Raider, on the bright side, did it a lot better than each of these games.).Don't get me wrong, Tomb Raider is an amazing game. Would I reccommend it? Hell yeah, to everyone! But, sadly, it actually is not a Tomb Raider game.This review is based on my inner sadness of expectations, and doesn't actually say anything negative. Good quality game, buy it and play it, if you are intrested in exactly what the game states it is."

It was just sitting there minding it's own business while observing the waves of the wide ocean and I thought to myself   I then came to the conclusion that I needed to kill this crab for the xp that I was in great need of. Right as I let go of the arrow on my bow and it penetrated the crab's outer shell, an achievement popped up saying ""Crab Cakes"". As I read the description of this achievement I started to feel signs of remorse and fear knowing that I just killed FeeFee the crab (According to the achievement). The almighty FeeFee the crab was dead because of my choice to take his life for my own personal xp. So, to avoid this situation getting any worse, I quickly used my acrobatic skills to reach the top of a tall mountain and jumped off. I knew that the only way to make things better for both me and FeeFee the crab is to take my own life as well. As I was falling, my life flashed before my eyes. I remembered the time I could walk for the first time and all the happy moments I spent with my family and friends, but I knew this all had to come to an end right as I hit the ground. Lara Croft, the terrible crab killer, was no more... Until I respawned. -.-14/10   Would recommend to anyone who likes third-person shooter/action games............. And who likes killing crabs.

Tomb Raider's new origin story lacks a bit of exploration and adventure when we look at how many the combat scenes are. The tombs are literally optional and even the optional tombs are quite short, but instead of this, the game is really cool and has easy mechanics on every platform. This is a great game for nice combats, enviroment and story but shouldn't expect raiding tombs as much as the old Tomb Raider games. The game feels like an ordinary action game."

A young woman shattered and struggling to survive. No more otaku looks; here's a normal sized Lara, dirty, bleeding  more realistic than ever.The gameplay is classic 3rd person  mechanics with cover shooting, hiking, platforming and  excellent puzzles. The side missions are adding extra fun. The arsenal is classic except the bow, which is by far the most fun weapon with authentic mechanics. The background is so well made. As you progress into the hostile island, you learn its history through cues,  collectables and journals  you earn, with several side stories.Graphically, Tomb Raider is beautiful, with all the merit going to its jaw-dropping artistic direction - you will never see ancient temples like those! + Good universe+ great storytelling+ Stunning artistic direction+ Truly awesome realistic version of Lara Croft+ open-world platform game + THE EFFIN BOW- animations make some moves tough to handle"

1158,Tether,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tether7/,4,,1,17.3,June,"29,",506,0,1,"There isn't much to say about this game that probably hasn't been said before but nonetheless the reboot of Tomb Raider couldn't have come any better than it currently has. The game has about 15 - 20 hours of single-player play through for 100% completion rate depending on how fast you want to play. (Took me 17hours.) The story is more along the generic side but the characters feel very real with different characteristics. The game also has quite a nice progression that doesn't level out until the end of the game. Every time you move along the story, you unlock something new and it doesn't become stale. There is a lot of backstory you can learn from the documents and relics that are hidden around the world. I'd recommend finding all of them if you are interested in what each character thinks or want to learn more about the world.There aren't many cons in this game, but I was quite annoyed with Quick-time events that were included in the fights some of them were decent (like the the unlocked skills) but others that were forced (like the boss battles) seemed unnecessary and also out-of-sync. The puzzles were quick, short, and easy and not much variety. I would've preffered variety of puzzles but I guess it fits the game's speed, for the game moves along quite fast. Overall, if you are contemplating whether you should buy this game or not, don't. Buy this game and you probably won't regret it. After I've bought the game it took me 2 days to playthrough it,  a 8 and 9 hour playthrough sessions as I was hooked in to the world of Tomb Raider and Lara Croft."

I found the dialogue to not be as cheap as I thought it'd be and all of the game mechanics worked well. Also the game world and art direction was of high quality. Gun play was fine and actually most importantly, the use of QTE's was well done and kept the pacing of the game fast and thrilling. Would definitely recommend for the price-point, as well as the well edited and polished narrative. Am definitely looking forward to the sequel already.P.S.

1169,Shona (vincit omnia veritas),https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shona1337/,3,,1,9.4,September,"26,",744,2,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) Review by Shona (c) 2015-2020How I began...I think with the past :)I grew up with Tomb Raider and I played all games since today (I bought the games on Steam again, that's why the most have no playtime). I really like all of them and the best for me is still the first as well as Tomb Raider Legend.So the first time I heard from tomb Raider (2013) was in 2012. I saw this picture of young Lara and thought ""Oh my fu***** god, what the hell is this"". But I waited and waited, until the first trailer was released and then I thought again ""Oh my fu***** god, what the hell is this! It is definitely not Tomb Raider, what the hell are they doing!""After the release I didn't change my thoughts about the game and now we have September 2015 and I got the game as a gift so I played it and I am definitely not happy about the game.It was good but it is not Tomb Raider and it should not have the name Tomb Raider. If you follow only the Story you raid not one tomb or collect treasure. Everything is about the friends of Lara and in the last hour all about Himiko and how Lara can stop her.I really miss the Tomb Raider feeling I get if I play one of the old games. :/So that's the start and here are my PROs and CONs.- Flowing transition from gameplay to cut scenes- Detailed faces- Weather system (Sun, Rain, Storm, Snow etc.) - Really good Voice Acting (English)- Weapons and the Upgrade System- Controller Control (XBOX360 and XBOX One Controller)- Autosaves (Sorry I love them, if they are perfect and they are perfect in this game)- Her death are more beautiful than in the old games xD- Quick-Time-Events- Lara is a ♥♥♥♥♥, really! 65% of the game she screams and cry...yeah I know it is the beginning of Tomb Raider but it is annoying- Story bored me. After 20% you can imagine how the game end- KI is sometimes stupid (Stay/Sit on a grenade instead of running away O.O)- Auto Healing- Riddles to easy and they are not much (Tombs excluded)- No real survival because there is to much ammunition everywhere- Kill and raid animals - I found no point why you can kill and raid animals, because you don't need it at all- Too much shooting, yes it is Tomb Raider but why the f*** is there so much shooting?- Stealth isn't really possible and if I can play stealth I play the complete game stealth but here you can't.- No diving, why? I loved it in Legend, why can't I dive in this game?- Multiplayer! Sorry but Tomb Raider is a SP-Game since 1996 why the hell is there a MP?- Really short, needed only 9.4 hrs :/If you are like me and love the old games, stay with them and don't play this game. It has nothing to do with the old Tomb Raider games!I read on some pages it is also called  ""Reboot"" but it is not a reboot...So don't think you get the old Tomb Raider with new graphic! It is the story of the young Lara Croft and how she became the Lara Croft we know.The way they go is in some thoughts OK, but the story of the game is really boring if there is one. The only thing I have done in 65% of the game was rescuing the friends of Lara Croft and then after some minutes they gone again or they died. Why? Is there any good reason why I have to rescue someone the complete time and then he/she/it dies so I played 1-2 hours for a person I can't rescue because Crystal Dynamics said he/she/it have to die.OK, I understand it in some way, because if someone close to you dies it can make you stronger and I saw with every dead friend Lara gets stronger but the Story repeats  after every dead friend.So if I could, I would give the Game a ""It was good but only for one playthrough"" but I can only say if I recommend it or not.So I recommend it only to players they never played the old games.6/10PS: I really hope they go a other way in Rise of Tomb Raider, but I read about ""In the footsteps of Assassins Creed"" in some previews and it makes me really sad which way the series goes."

The game did many things well however there are a small handful of things that could have been done better in my opinion.- This version of Tomb Raider has all of the traditional gameplay elements that were in the previous Tomb Raider games, such as the ability to freely explore the available caves and other things discovered as you progress throughout the story.- The combat is good, however the AI makes some petty dumb moves at times which can possibly break the immersiveness of the game if it is something like running into your gunfire of facing a wall.- The upgrading and abilities system works well- The atmosphere that is created is very good- The graphics are awesome on the highest settings- Rarely any graphical issues, if not any- The main quest story is very interesting- Keeps your attention for the entire game because it always seems like as soon as you discover something, immediately there is something else to be discovered- The quicktime events are sometimes uneccesary and it would be better if it were just a normal cutscene or you had full control over the character. However on occasion the quicktime events felt like they were placed well.- For a first time playthrough it is quite fun, however at times the gameplay feels just a little basic at times so that the game does not provide much challenge.Definitely play this game if you have the time"

1173,Bum,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsabummer/,4,,1,19.2,May,"20,",150,0,1,"I was skeptical at first; this game had an all-sizzle-and-no-steak vibe about it. It never interested me until it came on sale recently for super cheap, all (albeit pointless) DLC included, so I thought I'd give it a shot.I was pleasantly surprised! Despite my initial scoffing at the cheesy Hollywood story being played completely straight, by the end I cared what happened to the characters and genuinely wanted to see where the story would end up. The combat is fast and fluid, the jumping and climbing is serviceable, and despite being set on a fairly small island the game conjures up a great adventure vibe with plenty of locations to explore and good visual payoffs. There are fun apocalyptic logs to find, and a rich backstory to be found just from looking at the ruins of past inhabitants.That said, this game is far from perfect. Firstly, the RPG elements are barely there; you have more than enough money and experience to buy the best skills and upgrades without even exploring too extensively, and if you're like me and have to OCD 100% every area then you can purchase literally every single upgrade and ability by the end, half of which you never need to use. Make no mistake, this game is a linear adventure and the upgrades are completely linear as well. I would much prefer the game deny you resources and force a degree of specialization, but as is there is no remedy except a self-imposed challenge.Secondly, the game has a number of quick-time events. Usually these are fine, and in combat you can be rewarded with good timing. However, there are several sequences in which you're tumbling down a hill or a river and have to dodge numerous instant kill hazards without any warning. In one parachute section I did not even realise I was in control coming out of a cutscene, and then as soon as I did died to a tree (?). I fancy myself as a FPS veteran with quick reaction times and I don't think there was a single one of these tumbling sequences in which I did not die.Speaking of tumbling, the third major issue with this game is the themes. Lara does a lot of tumbling, groaning, wailing, and general angsting. The game goes out of its way to have moments showing Lara as vulnerable, something the developers specifically intended. But instead of subtly showing it, they occasionally have a scene of Lara shivering and saying ""you can do this"" followed by sequences of the player massacring people. And it's not self-defense either; between Lara silently sneaking up and hacking at someone's brain stem or the boss encounters in which Lara dismembers the foe's skull from the front (and I mean DISMEMBERS), I find it hard to sympathize. Lara is a cold-blooded and vicious killer in combat, and a fragile ""you can do this"" little girl in cutscenes. It doesn't match.The supporting characters are somewhat annoying too, with the best two relegated to nothing but an intro scene and then their death scene later in the game. The ones that remain are: a woman who hates Lara for no particular reason and ""calls her out"" on making it ""all about her"" after Lara has literally killed hundreds of people and jumped across lava pits to save them, one of the most obvious traitors in video game history, a girly-girl best friend who's only feature is being a walking plot device, and then the other big guy who has almost no discernible traits (I think he had a name?) who is nonetheless the voice of reason in this inane conflict ball.So yes, this game is not without flaws. I didn't even mention the frequent crashes or pixel-hunting collection quests (one collectible is a GPS beacon; almost literally a pixel on the ground) or the laughably easy puzzles that still insist on peppering you with hints, because despite all the flaws this game is a package I enjoyed. It plays like an action movie with a script to match, and once you accept that behind the gritty serious wrapping is a swashbuckling adventure full of cool set-pieces and a spunky female protagonist, it's good fun."
1174,shaseki,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978024377/,3,,1,22.4,December,"21,",394,0,1,"Being one of those old disciples to the release back in 1996 of the most iconic female gaming character, Lara Croft, I looked forward to get back into her skin again, not forgetting that she was designed to be a male fantasy from the get-go. It was the equivlient of playing an video action game with a barbie doll and see all her bits move in sequence. Yes you missed the lip of that jump just to see her boobs bounce in one of the 10 sequences it was designed to do.Since then we have seen her being recreated in more releases inclusive of the fact that her pop-culture identity made it to the big screen with a well placed Angelina Jolie capturing her image, except both movies were pretty bad anyhow.This game looks to reinvent her image as the younger niave and perky version. It's the prequel of Tomb Raider one would say. The basics is that you are trapped on an island, finding your way out through a number of ways, and being hunted by some crazy hillbillies (think 1,000 Tom Hanks' from the movie Lost and you just stole Wilson). The game has linear leveling system that adds to the come-back-and-play-me chemistry, inclusive of weapon upgrading system which works by collecting easter eggs throughout the level. Realism it is not, as I finally concluded that her bones must be made of titanium, due to the constant scenes which puts her demire frame through some brutal contact with every possible material on earth, seriously I would have been hospitalised from within the first 5 minutes of this game. (the kill scenes are good by the way in the cut scenes - well worth dying to watch them)The game itself has a well driven storyline. The action scenes have you moving from cover to cover so you can place a well fired arrow or bullet into the forehead of your six-fingered adversary. The easter eggs and relics you pick up throughout the game reminds you of Lara's profession.... which at times questions why she would bother picking up valuable items when she could possibly die of infection any moment now because you just trawled through half of mile of blood and excrement.What did disappoint me about this game was the lack of puzzling quality oh which truly defined the Tomb Raider series. Where each level was a puzzle in itself, and was all about timing, pushing and pulling blocks and counter balancing platforms to get to the next level (maybe also kicking a tiger in the face). This game has it's side puzzles which is solved by basic inituition, rather then google searching a walkthrough after dying for the 50th time. The levels themselves have a raw element which could have been rather challenging if the publisher put a little more time and focus into it.In all - its a good game and look forward to the next release. I reccomend you play this at the hard setting if you want some overall sense of challenge. 8 out of 10 bobbling boobies."

One big part i really missed were some more 'monsters'. As dumb as it sounds i missed something like the giant serpent from Legend or the mummy's from Anniversary. Exploring the grave's  and the island was also pretty cool but there were nothing except some climbing parts/puzzle's and those were way too easy to clear. I really liked that this Game was way more brutal and bloody unlike the other Games.But all in all it's an awesome game which every Tomb Raider fan should have played.(sorry for bad english^^)

This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience.And what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered.Tomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us."

There's lots of little bits and pieces to discover to help form the backstory, and I love that kind of stuff. I was only disappointed at the end, when the credits rolled and I felt as though they had left me with some gigantic plot holes in terms of the worlds backstory.In terms of gameplay, it's a pretty standard run-of-the-mill third person shooter, which isn't good or bad, I suppose.

I felt that there was a little too much in the way of cutscenes to the 'movie' and perhaps that the game was over quite quickly; the main storyline was very straightforward and easy to get through. I would recommend playing this game on hard if you have any sort of gaming experience, as medium is very easy. The game ended up being slightly repetitive towards the end (secret tomb > puzzle >  jumping and ziplining across enemy infested shanty towns > big boss > repeat) but as somebody who has had no previous interest in the whole TR franchise, I did enjoy it. I completed it at about 68%, having missed several tombs, but have little interest in going back to complete the smaller tasks. The tombs have little impact upon the main theme of the game, and the map has little influence either, due to the game being (despite the mapping efforts) very linear."

The length is more or less just right, the gameplay never truly feels stale, and the story is serviceable.

You never feel invincible, but you always feel capable."
1199,Wolf Revo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/,3,,1,14.3,November,"26,",461,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a single-player cinematic adventure game (there's a multiplayer portion as well but I ignored it). It is so cinematic, in fact, that about two hours into the game I turned to a friend and jokingly said ""Well this has been a great 3D movie.""As a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, it follows a young Lara Croft who is fresh out of college and has never really been on an adventure where everything hits the fan. Obviously in this game it does.Lara goes through a lot of hardships on her journey to becoming a badass, and a lot of it is pretty gruesome. The most gruesome are the many death animations for Lara, which become short scenes of their own.The game is a third-person shooter with a lot of climbing and puzzle areas thrown into the mix. The climbing sections are very well put-together with lots of visual clues on where you need to climb next. Unfortunately there is almost always only one way to get to where you are going.The combat is pretty challenging for a variety of reasons. The aiming isn't very tight, even with mouse and keyboard. It seems to me that this may have been an intentional decision by the designers to convey the fact that Lara is not an experienced shot through gameplay. Lara also does not run around with her weapons drawn all the time. She only pulls them out when you right-click to take aim. The game is not a proper stealth game, but I enjoyed trying to go for as long as possible without being detected and getting stealth kills with the bow.As you progress through the game you acquire more gear to upgrade your weapons and tools with. That is the most tangible reward for exploration, but even if you don't explore at all there are still fixed points in the story where you will receive new gear. I was squealing like a little school girl when I got that compound bow.Also optional are the tombs scattered just off the beaten path. Each tomb features an environmental puzzle and no enemies. The only reward that I noticed was some experience and the personal satisfaction from completing them. I think there might be an achievement in store if you finish all of them.I felt that the story was well-developed and it was refreshing playing a game that wasn't afraid of killing off a few characters for the sake of Lara's growth as a character.As far as graphics go, this was a gorgeous game. It was built with 3D in mind, and despite the fact that Crystal Dynamics partnered with AMD for things like Lara's ""fancy hair"" technology, Nvidia's drivers caught up by the time I started playing the game. I experienced very few performance issues, and I didn't find any other technical issues with the game.I'm always happy when my favorite moment in the game is the ending. An even better sign is when I am shouting ""YES! YESSS!!!"" During the final battle.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone with a system that can handle it. It took me 14 hours to get through the story, but I didn't explore quite as much as I could have. It costs $50 currently (worth it), but it shouldn't be too hard to find it on sale; I remember it being $12.50 during the Steam summer sale."

Its one of those games which you actually enter the hero's heart and understand his/her personalities and emotions, kind of reminds me Katniss Everdeen in the Hunger Games movies.* Graphics are intense in full HD, and overall looks like Crysis 3 for me.* You got autosaving like in Borderlands.* Many 'side missions' to do like in the GTA series (mostly finding information logs and ancient relics).* An Open world game, again, just like in the GTA series.Cons:* If you're looking for intense puzzles like the older series had, you wont find them here. This game is more of a mystery 3rd person shooter than a puzzle. If i could measure the difficulty of the puzzles, I'd say they are Half-Life ish, which means simple logic will get you through them in a minute or two.* Lara's boobies got a bit smaller, But she does looks sexier, i'd give her that (check my pics on my profile if you like :D ).Overall I'd give this game 9.5/10, its not 10 mostly because the puzzles arent that challenging. A 'must' game whether or not you are a fan of the TR series. Totally worths its value!"
1208,Marce,https://steamcommunity.com/id/crystalteardrops/,3,,1,14.4,November,"11,",364,0,1,"- A very enjoyable ""Unchartedlicious"" game. - Everything turns into debris, everything explodes...Lara cries :V- Overall the pace of the game keeps you in. So if you play to have fun, go for it ;)- Even if is lineal environments are fun to explore.- Technically speaking, decent for 2013. Nowadays and compared to Rise of the Tomb Raider (2015/16) maybe lighting looks a bit outdated without IBL and more realistic shaders.- The first Tress FX game and is not expensive for many different rigs. Something that is not happening with The Witcher 3 for instance with NVIDIA Hairworks.- Is not the Tomb Raider we played since 1996. Is lineal, don't have the best locations as we did on the past with many different countries on one same entry.- Optional tombs.- QTE are boring.- Sprint is a only-multiplayer feature.- They could have take advantage on the ""survivor"" theme to make more interesting crafting items and weapons. Not only fire guns. Don't get me wrong some of them are ok...Fire is good ally on this game. But maybe we could had been more Naked Snake and less ""Nathan Darke-Rambo"".- Puzzles are not as challenging as on the original games. They're not bad but they are standard for a TR.- The story is dull. That's the most sad thing from my perspective.- They didn't release the updates they made on the ""Definitive Edition"" from Xbox One and PS4. Aside that, If they release a paid updated like Dark Souls II Scholar of the First Sin I hope the  bring back the original 2013 Lara's face. Oh...now I remember, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter made it's Redux version for free. That was a good move but different than Metro games which needed more investment and work on those new versions...at least TR dev team should think about giving PC users the Definitive Edition. For free or a payed update... ¬¬"

It seemed to me that the focus of the series shifted too much to action and combat. True, the action of the reboot is sometimes over the top, but in a good way I have to admit. The game manages to find an almost perfect balance between action sequences, puzzles, story, crafting, exploration and light RPG elements. Graphics, controls and the gritty atmosphere are top-notch. Along with modernizing the gameplay comes the inevitable move to an open world with all the usual collectibles and the addition of a multiplayer mode. Nice additions, but certainly not the strong points of the game. All in all, Crystal Dynamics took quite a few risks with this reboot and succeeded all along the line."

1222,Unrest,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thePoark/,3,,1,19.6,April,"9,","2,151",0,1,"(NO SPOILERS)While there are some popular criticisms of Lara's inner struggle to make moral decisions, and the early ""survival"" aspects are not as impactful as publicized, Tomb Raider is a very memorable, toucing experience that's not only compelling, but fun.   COMPLETIONI had a great time; enough to do it somewhat completionist with my playthrough completed at 96% of the content (collectibles, optional objectives, etc.)  I took my time to look around and enjoy the environments, so the optional content was fitting for me.  Steam shows 19 hours of time played, though I expect reality is closer to 17 given my tendency to leave the game running while I take short breaks.GRAPHICSThe introduction of AMD's TressFX real-time hair technology lent well to the picturesque environments, and naturally integrated (but optional) tombs. Production values show a strong focus on storyboarding, with interesting level design, and nicely executed story cutaways.CONTROLSI tried both keyboard/mouse and gamepad controls, and settled on kb/m.  Movement felt responsive and natural, and was not frustrating despite some minor issues with button labeling (iconic) for keyboard/mouse; I still preferred it to using a gamepad due to gain precision aiming with weapons.STORY IMPRESSIONThe story went in an unexpected direction, but that is not a criticism; it serves as a good reintroduction for the well-known heroine's reinvention.  Storytelling seems to be careful to introduce elements that may be eyebrow-raising, so I felt eased into the ""unexpected"" parts I alluded to.  It does establish what we might expect from the next title in the series (assuming it continues), and I'm looking forward to it.GAMEPLAY (No story spoilers, but minor ""gameplay spoilers"")The gameplay felt varied enough to stay interesting, though the tomb puzzles we might normally expect from a Tomb Raider game were a little sparse.  The weapons are varied and interesting with good utility, though I personally stuck mostly with the bow, despite having other options for silent takedowns.  The skill system is about augmenting power that has small changes on gameplay decisions, or gaining conveniences with passives; while not incredibly deep, they options are still interesting making for meaningful choices.  While it is possible to learn all skills (I did), it will likely require being vigilant with maximizing xp gain and/or exploration.The weapon upgrade system offers similarly interesting choices with meaningful impact on gameplay, though unlocking them will also mean lots of exploration or completing certain parts of the story.  This upgrade system is also partly responsible for my bias toward using one weapon more often, since I felt it was more more strategic to make one weapon more power/versatile before upgrading new weapons.  However, story progress and optional exploration does address this issue somewhat, as you are left with more currency to upgrade items than what is unlocked, and different weapons do offer utility for advancement in certain cases; switching weapons is encouraged, but not imposed.Movement, jumping, and all the land traversal mechanics felt fluid and connected.  I rarely felt like the control window (keyhole) was too narrow to keep a steady pace while scaling terrain, or moving between jumping/climbing puzzles.  For frame of reference, it felt a little more natural/forgiving than the Assassin's Creed games.MULTIPLAYERI attmepted it once after completing the story, but quickly saw it was derivative and wasn't going to offer anything I was interested in repeating.  My experience was being repeatedly killed by a spawn camper in a 3v4 match, while hearing some critical ""trash talk"" by the opposition."

(Small spoilers and tips ahead!)The game still has some bugs (tree stuck in the plane, shoots arrow instead of rope when clicking M mouse button, Lara jumps/turns elsewhere out of nowhere), but overall it's an amazing experience and it's even better with the DLCs.I played on normal mode, and there was only one part which I had to do like 30 times (the longer water-sliding part where you can't see sh*t from the water splashes on your screen), but other than that, when I failed, I failed only 1-2 times, then I could advance. I also had a bit of a problem with the Geothermal Caverns because I didn't have enough arrows and ammo on me, so I had to die 3-4 times collecting arrows to be able to kill all the enemies.Storywise it was good, I just didn't get the death of some of Lara's companions because they could've been easily prevented.A bit back to the collectibles: I got about 30% of them without even trying to look for them, but you definitely have to go back later to some of the earlier maps to be able to do a 100% completion since your skills/weapons won't be strong/high-tech enough at first. (And watch out for the Cliffside Bunker map because there aren't any fast travel opportunities there, so either you complete that part at your first try, or you have to go back there from the Shipwreck Beach by foot.)TL;DR: Really good game, long and exciting gameplay, nice puzzles, high chance of replaying it. Didn't try the multiplayer yet."

Keeping in mind the game is 6 years old, the 1996 Tomb Raider was better in my opinions. The puzzles in this game weren't even puzzles. None take less than a minute to solve and more than 2 steps. There is 1.5 boss fights(unless you call an occasional wave of basic enemies a boss fight). One of which takes less than 20 seconds and other being suitable a first boss fight but not a final. It feels as if they completed the game and realized they forgot the tombs so added some tombs that are no bigger than my apartment and are all completable in under 3 minutes. The acrobatics in the original were more fun and more skill based as this was the easiest game I ever played. The 100's of little items hidden around the environment force you to constantly mash the instinct button the whole way through if you want 100% completion. The game gives you no chance to do it on your own before giving hints. If something requires an arrow, there will be enough arrows outside for an army and so on for any other task. The graphics and sceneries were done well but no eerie or amazing dark temples, mainly slums. The game had so much potential but it was just too tedious. A decent game but a bad Tomb Raider"

I played the original tomb raider years ago, and I don't care for those games where it's just puzzle after puzzle and getting lost after getting lost.  I also wasn't looking forward to lots of first person shooter type, or over the shoulder type, combat.  I finally got this when it was on sale for like four dollars.  I finally tried it out, and I was blown away!  I'm running this game with max settings, and it is absolutely freaking gorgeous!  Holy freaking cow this game is beautiful!  As for the game play, I'm at about 40-50% and so far it's not what I expected as described above.  I'd say this game is more action/adventure as opposed to puzzle solving.  It's fairly open world, but not so much that you get lost easily.  There is shooting combat, but it's not like a fast paced FPS.  The combat is more like you hide behind stuff and have a shoot out with groups of enemies, or you can sneak and do stealth attacks.  Additionally, to my surprise, there are RPG elements.  You get skills to put into skill trees and you collect parts and stuff to modify weapons.I would highly recommend this game for anybody who likes adventure games."

One of the coolest graphical techniques, in my opinion, is the water effect on the player's ""camera lens."" I legitimately thought someone splashed water on my computer when it was really just raining in-game. Also, Lara's hair. Hohmahgahd. If your computer can handle it, turn the Hair Quality in graphics settings to ""Tressfx.""Combining the graphics with the storytelling and appropriate-but-not-outstanding soundtrack, a large chunk of the game feels like cutscenes. Some of the exciting parts of the interactive cutscenes become lackluster after you've seen them multiple times, but they luckily never get too close to being annoying. The first few hours of playthrough, however, were very involving and amaaaaaaaaazing.The puzzles in this game--plentiful enough--are just challenging enough as brain teasers to be fun and entertaining. The downside is that you sometimes have to realize that Lara's anatomical strength only loosely follows physics.The combat system is decently fun, just because the few different methods of elimination reward different amounts of XP (if that's enough incentive for you--it was for me). However, combat is also very simplistic (in a good way), tying Lara to cover when you go near it, but not gluing you to it such that you die because the controls suck.The actual story is not that good, in my opinion. I've just finished, and it feels like it probably has a lot of plotholes (although I haven't thunk any up yet), a lot of what happens in the game is preposterous (i.e. Lara never dies), and the characters aren't developed enough for you to be much attached to them, so don't buy this game expecting a Bioshock Infinite or Mass Effect storyline. However, this game was infinitely more fun to play than Bioshock Infinite.Also, this game has a moderate amount of camera motion when you're peacefully running. Beware of headaches during extended play."
1257,ПΛᄂDӨX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NaldoX_the_real_one/,3,,1,20.8,March,"6,",549,0,1,"of all: It's a reboot. You  see it as a reboot.The graphics and animations are smooth and amazing, the story and dialogues are quite good and the game really catches the ""survivor-flair"" due to scavaging, hunting and not being a superhero.There is a level up system, where you can improve your skills in three different skilltrees. You can also collect scrap from dead bodies or crates to upgrade your weapons like making them stronger and mounting bigger magazines.For additional experience you can find collectibles around the ""world"" and in some tombs which is pretty cool.I put  in quotes because it tries to be an light open world game but it fails due to it's linearity. There are some sections where you can explore a small forest or a beach, but especially in the beginning it's like ""press forward -> cutscene -> press forward -> cutscene -> press forward -> cutscene"". You can also replace the cutscenes with many quicktime-events. The cutscenes and quicktime-events are really good looking and exciting, but I dislike an overuse of it. It's like someone is taking the control from your game.Another point I dislike is the dumbed down platforming and puzzle sections. It could be because I really liked the challenging predecessors (Tomb Raider I to V). On the top of this review I wrote """" but I don't think it's okay to ignore gameplay mechanics which were vital for the whole Tomb Raider series.There are only some puzzles and they are very easy to solve. Maybe it's because I rarely got frustrated in the old series because it was so rewarding after I have solved them.The same for platforming sections, you don't really have to try hard for example to get on a higher ground or crossing dangerous canyons. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy I won't ever break my fingers again in those sections (keyboard players of the old series will remember) but it really felt strange when there is only one possible way to progress or you don't need to position Lara in the right way to make the jump.I really like how the game catches the survival-flair but it's a little bit shallow. For example you can collect fruits but there is no real use except some xp or the high amount of ammunition lying around. There is some wasted potential here. but not least I really enjoyed Tomb Raider. And I really hope there will be more Tomb Raiders of this kind. It's a fresh and good reboot. If you never got into the old Tomb Raider games you should definitely check this out. If you really liked the old ones, you should also give this reboot a chance and try it out."

You step into the shoes of Lara Croft in her first adventure, attempting to uncover the mystery of a strange island.  You're guidance of a young, innocent girl to a full-fludged killer is really a joy, as odd as it may seem.  There is no end of amusing ways to dispose of your enemies, and the terrain always ensures that it stays fresh.  The game is rife with insane platforming combat and action sequences, as well as puzzles for the more mentally inclined.   When combined with the compelling and dark story it really makes for a wonderful experience.  Buy it."

Here I will break down things people might enjoy this game for and write why this game doesn't hold up for any of those reasons.Story:There is no plot points besides ""save your friends from being sacrificed"" and there is 0 character development. So it can't be the story people enjoy unless they enjoy literrally anything that has a begginning, middle, and end.Action: Well its literrally just a basic 3rd person shooter with no interesting mechanics thrown in. 0 innovation and nothing we haven't seen before. I can't see anyone playing this game for just the action alone as its mostly just filler content (and there is a lot of it).Puzzles:Ok to be fair I'm not a big puzzle guy, but these ones were fairly easy and not terribly interesting. Maybe people can get a kick or two out of a few of them, but they don't feel very interesting or complex. I never got a sense of ""hell yeah i finally figured it out"". This is probably the game's strongest point in terms of mechanics, but it isn't a very strong one.Graphics:The games graphics are really pretty and the character models look great. There were a few moments in the game where i just sat there appreciating the scenes. However, graphics alone really doesn't make a game worth playing in my opinion. So unless you are into just looking at pretty rendered objects I can't say this is a big plus. Summarry:I don't think I missed anything people could possibly enjoy this game for. Its a lackluster game and not worth spending the time into. I was left forever wondering when the actual story would begin and didn't realize I had been coming to the conclusion until I was at the last mission. I have no idea why this game is so highly rate and I don't plan on playing any of the other ones after this borring game."

She's more incredible than any person, woman or man and there's no space for Nathan Drake(Uncharted) in the game universe. He never experienced anything like Lara did in this one.  Never liked the series too much, but this really got my attention. They gave a real feeling what danger and pain is, and most important, what's the meaning of an adventure. The story is not a ''realistic'' one, and that's nice because give the game a mystic vibe and not common one. There're things that you can probably say ''what the hell!?'', because the impossible chance or way os doing things, but it's nice to remember that is a video game, take it easy. One thing that i really like are games with a bunch of story content, like items description and journals, and TR does well. Anyway, the game is good and the chance to hate it is really low. :)"
1280,King Bradley,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShitBackInLimbo/,4,,1,26.0,February,"28,",418,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a pretty old franchise, that started back in 1996. Lara Croft is a rich girl that is good with guns. Her father was a famous explorer and she is following his steps. In all other Tomb Raider games before this one Lara used 2 guns. It's her symbol. In this game however, we go way back in her past, before ""survivor was born"". In this part she is basically becoming ""Tomb raider"". Lara will get hurt a lot, fall from high places, get her butt kicked many times, but she will also kick back too. It's like Rambo except she is a woman. I felt like playing some Murican action movie.Story starts with Lara and her friends going straight into the heart of the Bermuda Triangle, and eventually they find themselves in the big storm that causes shipwreck. Lately they found that island is cursed, and that nobody can leave the island because of unnatural storms. What is the cause of those storms? I won't spoil that, but I've found whole story pretty bad and generic. It's really boring in my opinion, making game feel really shallow. Gameplay is just incredible. It's super smooth and super fun. Shooting feels too satisfying. Game is not very hard, but not easy either, and I've played it on hardest difficulty. You have bow at beginning and lately you acquire gun, rifle, shotgun, and bombs. Bow is the most fun and after that rifle. Bow is also used for platforming(ropes etc.). Platforming is too fun also, like in all other Tomb Raider games. What's missing is that there are almost no puzzles, like they were in previous games. And those puzzles that exist are pretty simple. But what's new is that every area has items that you can collect, and collecting them and clearing areas can be really fun and addictive. Since in this game Lara has ability to uses instinct, you can track those items easier with it. At every checkpoint you can improve your skills and tools/weapons. Overall gameplay is almost perfect. Atmosphere is just incredible. Tons of explosions, platforming, shooting, it's constant action. It's gaming in it's purest simplest form. Graphics wise looks amazing even today. Level design is incredible. Multiplayer exists, but I don't think anybody plays it anymore, so goodbye to a lot of achievements.- Incredible gameplay- Beautiful graphics- Amazing atmosphere- Amazing level design- Lacks puzzles- Story is really boring and generic, so whole game feels pretty shallow It's damn fun game, with a lot of action scenes, explosions, shooting. Big problem is that story sucks, making game feel really shallow. It's pretty good Tomb Raider game, but I would still vote Tomb Raider: Legend as the best part so far."

Was a big fan of the original  Tomb Raider's. The first 3 at least. There are few downsides to this game, the biggest being that the actual Tombs are a ridiculously minor part of it. Very short. A tricky entrance to get past, then you open a large chest and see the same Lara animation each time like  from the Zelda games. That's it. The combat was fun, but I wish there had been less of it and some actual large complex tombs to explore and solve. The story was well written, but every decision Lara makes seems to get everyone killed....Anyway, all this is nitpicking. An excellent game, Well worth playing. Will be happy if  has more tombs, less murder, and a T-rex."

While exploring Lara's origins and letting us see how she became the intrepid adventurer she is known for was a fun ride it falls just short of being a Tomb Raider game. I think the kill-cam execution upgrades are something that was not needed, they really didn't add anything to the game, other then an incentive to get out of cover (again Uncharted) and put an enemy down for more XP. I would have liked more of the tomb puzzles to do and more exploration. Overall I would say if you like action and adventure games you will probably find enjoyment in the game as long as you go into understanding that this reimagining is more in-line with Uncharted and its cover based shooting then the Tomb Raiders of old. You might find even more enjoyment if you get the game on sale."
1285,Yarry.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yarry/,3,,1,11.4,January,"1,",163,0,1,"(This review contains spoilers, does not contain multiplayer assessment.)This game is like a neverending Michael Bay movie. Action packed, fast paced and loaded with explosions, demolition and a gorgeous scenery like I've never seen in any other game. Lara Croft has never seemed more bad ass, everything about that woman just screams ""tough as nails"".The amount of torture this woman goes through is astounding, almost every climb in this game involves with the thing you hold onto or stand on to just break and fall off, rushing you to react quickly and to hang onto the next brittle bar or ladder upwards, towards the next checkpoint on your journey to uncovering the mystery that lead you and your crew to end up on this becursed island. Without spoiling too much of the story, let's get straight to the gameplay.As mentioned earlier, the game is just straight up action at a rapid pace. You hang onto a cliff, a rope or a collapsed bridge? Better hurry up and grab onto the next best thing, who knows how long it'll stay in place like that. Coupled with snappy, on-point controls you navigate Lara through the unforgiving terrain of the island. Each ascend comes with it's own required technique and approach and what Lara Croft game would be complete without having a bunch of bad guys stand in your way of reaching your destination?The combat system in this game is quite well done, you get the option of going close range with your trusty climbing hook or shotgun or keeping the baddies at bay with the pistol, machine gun or your deadly bow. Either way your preference may be, with the inventory system you also get the option of upgrading your weapons, as with each upgrade the guns become much more effective at taking out the approaching assailants.In addition to the upgrade system, you get experience points with every kill, secret discovery in the map and each raided tomb which, once enough has been collected, results in skill points. These skill points can then be used in a variety of skill trees, be it survivor skills, combat or weapon handling.The world of Tomb Raider is just beautiful. As if all four seasons and every color nuance were captured on the island. In each of the discovered tomb chambers there's a puzzle to solve in order to get to the relic, each with its own individual approach. The buildings as well as the exterior of the buildings are decorated with ancient statues and candle light.To chime in the grim background and the madness of this strange retreat bones of the deceased, corpses and signs of death cover the sacred chambers of the tombs and the kingdom's architecture.Being thrown into an unknown place at first, all seems hopeless and lost. But after every wound, every scar being whipped into your flesh and every maniac being neutralized by your ever deadly will, you get stronger and advance further, on your path to uncover the big picture behind the forces that bind you to that isle.If you're into discovery, an intriguing plot and action packed gameplay, this might be for you."

I remember first getting it as a demo on a CD that was mailed to my house via a video game magazine subscription. I still have the demo disc to this day. Had another game called, Gex enter the Gecko, Which was another favorite game.  Tomb Raider (2013) takes place on the island of Yamatai, She is yet to become battle hardened and in some ways is still very innocent. Her journey which is focused on survival constantly challenges her to adapt and overcome. Her main antagonist comes in the form of a man named Mathias who was marooned on Yamatai at some point. You later uncover that he kept to himself at first fearing other survivors as they could have been hostile. Though along the way he eventually became their leader. Ill try to keep the two following sections equal.Pro's1. Yamatai, From the moment I landed on this island I felt immersed. Loved the attention to detail from the WW2 plane wrecks, to the crumbling structures. 2. Ambiance 3. Character development.4. Adding layers of story through the investigation of artifacts. Con's (Which have been fixed)1. Early release riddled with graphic issues and further plagued by game save problems. There is defiantly way more to say about this title but I have not played it in a while. A friend asked me what I thought about the game and if he should purchase it. I told him to go for it.

A lot of this touches on what I said in [1], but it is important enough to merit its own section.You can't crouch in this game, ever. When you get close to an enemy, the game turns auto-crouch on and after you leave that area or kill all the enemies, auto-crouch is turned off.Basically, the game is telling you that you are only allowed to be sneaky when it wants you to be sneaky. If you want to sneak up to a rabbit, you can't. If you want to walk up to enemies and say hi, you can't because the game wants you crouched.4. A bit too many scenes where the game forces you to squeese between two walls, just to give the player another close-up of Lara's curves.If you are going to have a female protagonist in your game, don't turn her into a piece of meat. Try selling your game with the use of great gameplay.:The game took a lot of short-cuts removing things that it decided you did not need, removes or limits your controls, auto-corrects you, and throws QTEs at you, but is still a nice game.I don't dislike the game and would in fact encourage people to get it when it is on sale, but I feel like it is important to list some of the things that it does very wrong."

Yes, the visuals are still nice, but that's where my praise ends. There are glaring problems with the singleplayer mission; there was such promise in the opening sequences, such as finding shelter, heat and food on this unforgiving island.

However if the campaign doesn't satisfy you enough, you can go back to previous areas of the game and complete optional tombs. There is even a Multiplayer mode for you and your friends to shoot it out on the battlefield. During team deathmatches there are serveral maps to choose from.-------------------------  Cons -----------------------Tomb Raider is a very short game.

I was wrong! Although, obviously, it is very different to the original TR games there are elements of it which feel really similar and I appreciated that. Particularly the way you traverse the environments and some of the level settings (hello sunken boat). The ratio of enemy fights to puzzle solving / tomb raiding was also a good balance, leaning more toward the latter. I was able to explore tombs freely without worrying about being jump scared by an enemy, for eg.Environments were stunning, storyline was captivating, overall a really fun and immersive game.ONE downside, which I'm sure most people probably don't care about, is that I have found at least one missable achievement which would require me to replay the entire game.

I would say the biggest frustration is the modern 'consolification' of the game with all the cut-scenes and the quick time nonsense. I miss the puzzles and locations along with the general mystery and magical atmosphere even if the older games were clunkier. I think the previous aristocratic Lara Croft was a lot more suitable and interesting character to play with as it gave better grounds to the story and locations. The current Lara and her constant, pseudo damsel-in-distress drama is a mockery in itself let alone compared to her previous games.If this game wasn't called Tomb Raider I think most of the people who're upset wouldn't be, which is obvious.They've used the name to carry this game, it seems the people who've enjoyed this the most are those who've never played Tomb Raider, only other consoles games, which is what this game is trying to be...This iteration completely destroys Tomb Raiders edge and its magic and mystery, which is what made Tomb Raider what it was for me, it's only made me appreciate the previous games even more.It's got to be the biggest crock of drama crap I've ended out playing to the point where I just uninstalled the game half way though."

With that said shall we look at what the tomb has to offer ?StoryThe story begins with lara and crew at at crewship, while their almost reach the forbidden island the crew got separated by high tide that cause the ship to wreck down and then the adventure begin.The story part is kinda simple and straightforward but this time around we don't have that old lara style like shoot n run,dodging enemy,etc. Instead we have a more realistic approach to our main character, in this time around she is just some ordinary girl that have a will to survive and becoming strong woman.GameplayJust as i mentioned before this is not some shoot n run and dodging like back in the day. This game is about adventure, exploring the island and tomb, and search for the way out of the island. The shooting system in this game now change into cover and shoot system, although you can just shoot n run if you want though but u can't dodge the bullet like lara used to back in the day. The platforming and puzzle part is still in the game but is not really that hard and challenging if you have the logical way to solved it, it will become easy puzzle. Also this game has some QTE, is not that bad and hard as you think, whenever the QTE part appear the game give u a couple of times to push the button or mash it.GraphicAs alvvay's Square Enix game has this crystal clear grapich design, the forest and landscape is really a beautiful sight to see. And lara physical touch whenever she injured on the adventure is also detailed as well.SoundSound is okay but it also lacking ?, whenever you visited the place that has been explored the music is absent completely, is not that i hate an absent music but it's just kinda ruined the experience to revisited the part that you just explored or found a while back. The ambient sound is great too and so the voice actor... except now lara is alvvay's moan when she get hurt.Did i reccomend it ?Of course if you want to revisited the series again, this reboot is worth checking out pick it out when it goes on sale because this game is really cheap when it got a deal, although i'm not reccomending you to pick up the multiplayer dlc because the multiplayer is already dead."

There are no points in the game that I enjoyed after 3 hours, it just gets stale so quickly and the story is utter garbage.- Combat is very simple and has pretty much no depth to it whatsoever. - Puzzles are way too easy.- Voice acting ranges from super tacky to bad.- Music is fairly generic - Upgrades that don't matter after the first 10 minutes of gameplay.- Characters make the most stupid decision in almost every situation possible. Leading to the deaths of characters that have you facepalming how retarded everyone is instead of caring about their death. - Also characters are just boring and onedimensional, you don't get to learn anyone or what they mean to Lara, or who even Lara is as a character.- And ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the story is bafflingly bad. It takes itself far too seriously for how stupid it is. There are no points with some lightheartedness.- Dialogue is trash and feels very unnatural. + Pretty much the only well-deserved plus point is the traversing of the terrain because it feels surprisingly responsive.Again, I don't get how people find this such an amazing game, story is whack, the gameplay is too simple for how much it takes place, puzzles that don't even count as puzzles, depthless characters, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue, and voice acting, and so on.

Of course they are NOT the only advantages... Finally Lara is more a girl instead of a rude and mindless killing robot. TR2013 has one of the best-looking Lara model (date of this review: 2016). And in TR2013 Lara does NOT have esotropia... TressFX hair are simply cute. SPOILER: And the hunting mode... <3Multiplayer mode is the advantage of this game. You can do various things during multiplayer (not only mindless shooting).In Team Versus you can: shoot enemies using pistols, riffles, melee them, snipe them, camp & set pyro-traps, thunder-traps, etc. And this is only one of four modes there.You will be never votekicked without a valid reason. And AFK players will be kicked automatically.Multiplayer community is rather very small, but mostly positive. Don't even try to compare TR2013 multiplayer community with L4D2 multiplayer community... TR2013 is like a heaven when comparing to the other game...I loved all those mazes included in classic TRs, but I believe they are unfortunately thing of the past.

So, maybe if you’re a hardcore fan of Lara Croft you might be disappointed, but at the same time this is still a good game with beautiful graphics and stunning cinematography!However, while I do appreciate the intention of innovating the series, I feel like it fails to be truly original as it doesn’t really add much to the adventure/action genre: it’s basically Uncharted with a muuuuch darker tone and a protagonist in constant survival mode (...so like the beginning of Uncharted 2 lol).This isn’t strictly a bad thing since that game is one of my favourites, but I was hoping for something different and unique - especially after reading the extremely high reviews. Because of them, I was also expecting a very strong plot, but instead it’s quite linear (same goes for the characters).Still, this reboot is very good fun and definitely worth playing!Final verdict:7/10."

Crystal Dynamics did it again only this time with a Reboot to one of gamings most popular characters. unlike older installments of the game that focused more on puzzles and less on action this one is the exact opposite. yeah you'll get puzzles but this time around their in the for of QTEs (or Quick Time Events).  i cannot recommend this game enough having beaten it twice on console and once on PC. if you get it get it for the story. it is the best origins story ive played in a long time. yes it has multiplayer but it feels like a tacked on after thought and in my mind is not all that fun or enjoyable. this is one game i will be playing through again for a long time to come. story is one of the best the TR franchise has had in a long time. the combat is slow at times but it never felt like it was getting old or stale. the voice acting is some of the best i've heard in a long time. you can definately tell Crystal Dynamics took their time on the game. during my time on it i felt her fears and pain as if they were my own. and i have never felt that way over a main character before now. this is one game where you want to urge her to continue on and to push forward. again i cannot recommend it enough. that's why i am giving this  a 10/10.

1375,ProtoMarcus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ProtoMarcus/,3,,1,16.1,December,"3,",116,0,1,"I have to admit, being an avid Tomb Raider fan, this little review may be a little biased. This game is fantastic. Of course, if you're already familiar with the Tomb Raider franchise, this game may be quite different from what you've played in the past. Obviously labeled as a Reboot, it is not the same Lara Croft we've known and love. This story is an origin story, her first adventure, so its a much more 'vulnerable' Lara Croft, but of course, by the end of the game, she's a changed young lady. As a modernized Tomb Raider game, it is much more gritty, brutal, visceral. The story is pretty good, voice acting is great, Camilla Luddington does an excellent job at portraying a new, younger, inexperienced Lara Croft. The gameplay is really great, they dropped the auto-aiming system and the health bar mechanics to more modern manual aiming controls and health regen (which I don't exactly like, but don't exactly hate either) and added cool melee mechanics and some RPG elements (unlockable skills and upgradable gear) In short, this is pretty much a mix of Assassin's Creed, Uncharted and Batman Arkham Asylum, which is a perfect mix for the action-adventure video game lovers (like moi). In short, if you're already familiar with Tomb Raider, you may have to adjust a little to the newer mechanics and new Lara, and if you've never touched Tomb Raider before, you might want to try this one out.

1376,rjmacready,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048974498/,7,,1,18.7,November,"27,","2,862",0,1,"In case you were wondering just HOW radically the Tomb Raider franchise had been revamped for a ""new audience"", the answer is...A HECK OF A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOT.  Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to the individual...personally, I'm mostly in favour of the changes.  I'm certainly 100% for a grittier, darker, more brutally violent Lara Croft - think Tomb Raider meets ""survival horror"" by way of the last Rambo movie - but in all fairness, that's just me.  If criticisms were to be made, however, they would go something like this:    First up...Quick-Time Events.  While these occasionally work in video games - the Walking Dead Telltale games, for instance - they by and largely are a pointless ""innovation"".  I understand the idea was probably to make what are essentially CUT SCENES into something more ""immersive"", but really...they're a PAIN, mostly.  In fact, I'm sure I'm far from the only gamer on the planet who believes that having to repeat such a moment, over and over again, is more liable to take you OUT of the game and therefore qualifies more as ANTI-immersion than anything...am I wrong?  For those people who find cut-scenes (i.e. story) excessively ""boring"", there's always the ESC key, and in the meantime the rest of us can enjoy a break from keyboard-mashing and sit back and enjoy a brief bit of cinematic storytelling.  This is a reasonably amicable compromise, is it not?  LESS OF THE QUICK-TIME EVENTS, PLEASE.  It's a tedious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to die six times in a row, before you finally realise that the ""F"" button is the one right next to the ""D""...cheers.   What's next?  Oh, dearie me: Puzzles.  Another controversial subject.  I'll be as honest as possible here: As much respect as I have for the original Tomb Raider games, I actually find them too HARD.  I've only managed to complete the first one or two, as I recall...beyond that, I really couldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ spending forty-five minutes searching about for that one elusive, cleverly-hidden ledge which I didn't even know I could get to until I tried (and, quite possibly, died).  So I'm mostly in favour of the dumbed-down puzzle-solving in this reboot, though I can understand why the old-school purists would have a complaint here.  Hell, even I found the ""survival instinct"" button, while a mostly nice idea, a little overgenerous on the whole; for those who haven't played, it's essentially ""press the Q button and we'll show you PRECISELY WHAT TO DO NEXT"".     (There's a very amusing clip in the extras, I believe, of Indie Game: The Movie, where Phil Fish and cronies criticise the tendency of modern games to ""hand-hold"" players through each and every puzzle, 'cause after all, we're all ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dumb-asses who couldn't figure our way out of a plastic bag, were we to find our heads stuck in one.  Don't get me wrong, I'm a dumb-ass myself and don't mind the occasional HINT, but this ""Q"" button did make things just a tad TOO easy at times.  A compromise somewhere between the ""older"" and ""newer"" gaming styles may have hit a sweeter spot for me, but then again...that's just me.)   I could also mention that some of the AI and combat mechanics are a tad dodgy or awkward at times, but for the most part these things are fine.  The up-skilling and ""crafting"" systems also leave a little to be desired - there's a bunch of skills relating to the ""hunting"" of animals, for instance, in spite of the fact that after your first such kill the needless butchery of wildlife appears to be nothing more than a quick XP grab, rather than a storytelling necessity - but again, for the most part, these gameplay aspects are handled at least adequately.  As long as you're not buying it expecting a full-blooded ""survival"" game - it's an action-adventure game, first and foremost - you're unlikely to have any major complaints herein.    Anyhoo, if you've stuck with this review this long, you probably: A. Deserve a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ medal of some description, and B. Are getting the overall impression that enjoyment of this game is largely dependent upon your own personal preferences towards, and indeed PHILOSOPHIES ABOUT (!)...video games.  The developers of this particular product most certainly HAVE NOT gone out of their way to please the ""old-school"" Tomb Raider fans.  In fact, it's more of a firm ""♥♥♥♥ you"" that's been thrown in their direction, and what we essentially have now is a slam-bang, ultra-brutal, highly cinematic action-adventure game with minor elements of puzzle-solving.     Personally, I dug it...A LOT.  Not without reservations, but...A LOT.  But then again, the main thing I look for when I play a game is usually ATMOSPHERE, and this game certainly has that in spades.  It's undeniably more aimed at the ultra-modern, casual-gaming-with-light-RPG-elements crowd, and I'm sure that's heart-breaking for all the old-schoolers out there, but...we all have to move on with the times a little...right?  Even me.  As a matter of fact, to make it easier on all the bemused, borderline-illiterate young'uns out there, I'll offer two completely opposed, but importantly MUCH SHORTER and more conventional reviewing opinions, which can go something like this:    ""♥♥♥♥ TOPZ game.  U shoot lotz of thingz, and Lara haz BIG TITZ.  AWSUM.""    or:    ""Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥.  Almost none of the challenging platform or puzzle-solving elements of past Tomb Raider games.  Totally dumbed-down for idiotic modern gaming audiences.  The only consolation...is that Lara STILL HAS BIG BAZOOKOIDS."" Verdict: 9/10."

1378,Ranzer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RanzerArts/,3,,1,4.7,June,"29,",367,0,1,"This is going to be a really long review, so I'm just going to start off with an overview of the whole game. For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.The storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.Speaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.Last, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.Should you buy this game? Yes, it will provide you with a great deal of fun, and you will definitely enjoy the experience."

This game is about a shooting, oceans of blood and Lara's falling and complaining. No adventure and challenging puzzles. This is not a Tomb Raider, it's regular shooter with old famous name beyond which there is nothing. The QTE's outnumber the actual puzzles, the controls and camera are clunky way too often that is, when you do actually have control over the game (the game's AI will modify your trajectory so no precision is needed). The combat is repetitive, headshots basically line themselves up and you can dodge the AI's attacks damn near blindfolded. Boring linear gameplay."

1382,Erwin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/EwigerErwin/,59,5,0,8.7,October,"20,",248,5,1,"A great example of a franchise getting ruined by a Publisher shift.  Under Eidos this franchise was fun and energetic, there was variety in gameplay (the motorcycle level in Legends was more fun than this entire game) and the graphics by 2006 (speaking of TR Legends here ) were better, or at least more colorful and appealing to look at.  The characters pre 2010 were humorous and likable, now they all are constantly moaning and having emotional breakdowns.  Lara herself is no longer a smart and attractive adventurer, instead there are frequent cutscenes that try to shove her as this ""fragile stronggirl against evil white men"".  Speaking of white men, why is there an ""evil cult"" of insane white men on a Japanese-Chinese island? Also how come I at first sight knew the blonde professor was gonna be a traitor? The only members of your ""crew"", who consist of your ♥♥♥ college girlfriend, a hawaiian cook, a strong black woman, a nerdy white guy, a scottish captain, your english mentor, the aforementioned blonde professor, that survive are the first three. See a pattern here? Also you shoot not a single tiger,leopard or other endangered animal in this game. The games world is constantly shaking and the keeps falling apart... also theres a lot of quicktime events. Look Square Enix, I know you wanted to make this another movie but it just feels like a chore. Also whats with the mechanic of hunting a deer at the beginning but that never being any useful? Why should I loot rabbits or wolves, if I don't even need that?Why does everything looks so grey and dead, it really made me depressed.   The Eidos Tomb Raider games or even the Core games  were never this dull looking .. why didn't you just use that as a reference?   But I guess that wasn't your goal. You wanted to make another Uncharted, but minus all the color and fun that those games had.I really am disappointed by this game.  Even the artifacts you find all seem to be uninteresting things like hand fans.  The world in this game looks  a lot like Skyrim, but at least in Skyrim the world was vast and not as linear as this. In that game I actually felt interested to explore caves - in this I just ran past them.  Even looking at Lara's ass isn't great because she comes off as a whiney ♥♥♥♥♥ that hates men. It's like looking at the ass of a feminist. Maybe its the fact that these characters are just so unlikable that I wanted to get this over with.   Just stop pushing down emotions and telling me how to feel about these characters.  Unlike intended, the only one I cared about was that blonde professor who was discarded in a brutal fashion - but maybe just because he was so comical and unrealistic.Verdict:  Only buy this game if you want to play a forgettable, grey movie-like 3rd person shooter with bad characters and tons of quicktime events and SJW ""strong independent woman"" stuff .If you are interested about the Tomb Raider franchise I say you should pick up Tomb Raider: Anniversary or any of the older games, you will have much more enjoyment with those."

1407,Dodger37,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dodger37/,3,,1,25.0,August,"19,",149,0,1,"Tomb Raider is mostly the game you wanted Uncharted 3 to be. I've long thought of Uncharted 2 as the closest to an action movie a video game has ever come. Tomb Raider would be number 2 on that list for me. It's basically Uncharted minus the one liners, as Lara is the more serious sort.You'll find plenty of conveniently placed chest high walls alerting you to when combat is about to happen. The combat is fluid and crisp with good controls that plays out like most any other cover based third person shooter out today. It does nothing substantial or new, but it does the tried and true very well. The only complaint I have is that you can't throw grenades, but the enemies constantly bombard you with them. Not only that, they all have the arm of Peyton Manning in a non playoff game, so they will flush you out of cover often. I suppose that's a good thing that you can't just camp in one spot for the entire fight but literally the minute you get a new spot, they will forcing you back to the old one soon after.To go along with the over the top combat is over the top platforming. Much like Uncharted, Lara will find herself dangling over all sorts of perilous gaps and situations, and will have all manners of explosions and flying debris to dodge, often requiring QTE button prompts. It's action movie, the game, almost through and through.Not to keep going back to Uncharted but like those games the story is laughable at best. Though here they try to have a more serious time. Again, Lara isn't cracking wise after every other kill like many other heroes. She often implores her enemies at the start of an encounter that they don't have to do this. They make attempts to make Lara feel vulnerable but those quickly disappear when she turns into Rambo in short order for the combat. Like a good action movie, the story is silly and tests your suspension of disbelief, but damn if it isn't a fun ride. It doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but what Tomb Raider does it does well. A solid recommend. Tomb Raider has a few flaws, but it nails the fun factor and that's the most important part of a game."

Turns out I was hella wrong and I had so much fun I binged it...and now I've got this hole in my heart that I'm hoping rise of the tomb raider is gonna fill.So I'm gonna try and review this without spoiling the story: Basically, you play as this semi-immortal chick who can tank an ungodly amount of bullets and perform physical feats that even gold medal olympic athletes would be scared to attempt, such as: Falling and then slamming into the ground in a collapsing building...and then doing it again as Lara crashes into another collapsing building, making huge leaps and then grabbing a wall with one arm and twisting on it (which kinda should have dislocated her shoulder, but like I said, semi-immortal). Pretty badass huh? Well if that wasn't enough to get you to smash that purchase button, then maybe this will: Combat! Not only do you get to solve puzzles, but you also get to blow the brains out of gobs of enemies! Now it's spread out, so not too much combat, and not too many puzzles, kinda like ""Whew that puzzle took a lot out of me, I wanna go kill something"" and BAM! Something for you to kill appears! I love it! And for those who are part of the keyboard & mouse master race, yes, you can play easily with a keyboard & mouse and a controller is not required to have fun.And on top of that, the story doesn't suck! It's not too slow, not too fast, and the cutscenes are kinda action movie like, which is a plus for me. There's plenty to explore so you don't feel railroaded constantly, and you can go back to earlier parts of the game once you beat it to explore even more. The only downside is there are times early on that the game kinda holds your hand, but again, only in the beginning."

The gameplay is solid and offers and alright challenge on the highest setting.  The gear upgrades are actually fun.  The world is just the right balance of being open and guiding you through the story.It's well worth the full $20, but given that it's currently $5, it's an absolute STEAL.This is one of the BEST franchise reboots I've ever seen and I'm not even usually that into the adventure game genre.

The story, parkour and combat are all solid (though the melee combat is less satisfying, unlocking finishing moves later makes it more fun. Lots of collectibles and hidden areas to find, and hidden quests for areas which are only revealed when you complete the first step coincidentally.

1446,Major Fret,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notaselfhelpbookjustafuckedupkid/,2,,1,29.9,March,"17,",282,0,1,"I'm new to the Tomb Raider series. I can't say if this game does belong (like Deus Ex: Human Revolution) or doesn't belong (Hitman Absolution) but what I can say is that this game is good.TR is a prequel to the TR series, and is Lara's first adventure. She and a ship crew are left stranded on a Japanese island after been caught in a storm. She and the crew struggle to survive, fighting the elements, and a cultist group.TR plays like the baby of Hitman Absolution and Farcry 3. There are situations where stealth is a must, and times when you're gonna have to shoot your way out. Lara has four weapons to use, a bow, a pistol, a shotgun and an automatic. Although they all have there uses, they honestly don't feel that powerful. I know TR never been about shooting, but at times it felt like harsh language would be more useful than the guns themselves. I will say the bow was the only weapon that felt 100% right, and isn't an instant kill weapon (like Farcry 3) but isn't completely useless.On the subject of combat, the cover system feels okay. It wasn't terrible, but Lara automatically assumes cover, without any button to press. This works quite well for the most part, but sometimes it can be frustrating to get into a specific position. I also found that sometimes I was out of cover after coping a burst of gunfire. This was annoying to say the least.Enemies vary in strength, and weapons. They use molotovs, machine guns, bows, shotguns, and dynamite. They do a good job forcing you out of cover and flanking you, but to be honest, they still were pretty easy, even on the highest difficulty. It was also somewhat annoying that some enemies felt like bullet sponges, especially considering Lara does not take a lot of damage before kicking the bucket. I'm all for a challenge, but it just felt cheap. It is a minor thing, but it's still somewhat annoying.It also would have been nice to see more bosses. There were only two, and they both really played the same. It was a shame, and it could have been really cool throwback to the boss fights of older games. I hope this changes during sequels.There are also elements of puzzle solving and exploring. These puzzles are fun, and do tease the brain. They won't have you busting out a walk through, but they may take you some time. It is real satisfying solving these puzzles.A good amount of the game takes place in QTEs. These are actually pretty good. I'm not a fan of QTEs, but this game uses them right, and they heighten the action. I felt they could have used a few less, but they felt well used more than just put in there because of laziness.I also must say, this game has some INTENSE moments. It's hair-raising to see Lara climb an ancient building as it's falling apart, whilst on fire. It's also great to see that Lara does doubt herself. She isn't a badass spec ops soldier from Delta Team Six who's seen it all. She's still young, and scared, but she can pull her weight when push comes to shove, and doesn't feel like a complete ♥♥♥♥♥ like Jason from Farcry 3.There are various collectables for completionists, that have a lot of detail, and effort put into them, including back stories of the items. I must say, they were quite interesting, and go back to find them.The story feels like a Hollywood movie. It's fairly predictable, but it gets the job done. I would give credit to the developers for killing off some crew members, but it was a bit too predictable.Sadly, this game is short. I've finished the story within twelve hours, excluding some the collectable, on Hard. I'd guess, that it'd only take me, about 2-3 hours to get 100%.All in all, I am pumped for this game's sequel, and I hope it improves on this game. I'm giving this game 8/10 and I will recommend it at Steam's price of $20."

I'd take one great new Tomb Raider game over zero old Tomb Raider games any day. And that's just what this is - a great new spin on Tomb Raider. As far as triple-A games go this has everything that it needs to be considered good: a compelling story evoking emotion, fluid gameplay and little technical problems that would take away from the experience, pretty visuals. What makes this great though is something that is impossible to do without making some people angry: the use of an old, well known, greatly loved identity - Lara Croft, the tomb raider. I loved getting reminded of the good old days, while not being forced to compare this experience with that of then, feat only possible because of the differences between this game and those before it. Such a comparison is never fair because you're basically comparing your current state of mind with that which you had years ago, when you were younger, blissfully more stupid and happier because of it.Pros:+ great story+ fluid gameplay+ nice visuals+ dat ass, in HD (I'm sorry)Cons:- the multiplayer- the unsatisfiable die-hard fans of the franchise"

What are the positives if any? Well it looks pretty. But then this is 2015 and looking pretty is not a viable reason to by a video game.This game and many like it seem to treat the players with utter contempt inferring we are all to stupid to work our way through complex enviroments and puzzles. The gameplay is rediculously linear and the game steals control back from you at any opportunity it likes. Its like the game is going 'look at our amazing enviorment and all those details on laras backside as we control where your going right now'. Each linear area has a number of secret 'tombs' in there that you can apparently explore for added things. Now...this game is called Tomb Raider. Not linier short tunnel raider. A single room with a puzzle so easy its insulting. But that snot what annoys me the most...What annoys me the most is the DLC tomb...the lost adventurer. This is a DLC thing which means they expected you to spend money on this pile of drivelling bull. A DLC tomb where yet again the enviorment is linier, the puzzle is easy and worst of all it doesnt even give you any worthwhile rewrads! This game suffers all the worst excesses of modern day gaming. Excessive linieraty. More effort put into backdrops than story. A story so shallow and dragged out its like being hung to death. DLC that is rediculous and not worth the cash. Reboot?

I own this game since early 2014, In a period of 2 years, I started it three times and three times I simply left after 30 minutes or so because I couldn't handle the stupidity or I got stuck on a bug. Only now I persevered and while I have to admit the graphics are really good and the story doesn't suck so much in the middle of the game, I am still disappointed.

This game is very good and completely exceeded my expectations. The QTE's aren't that bad and are fairly easy to hit at the correct times. This, I was afraid of after hearing about it when the game first came out. However, they don't throw you off and aren't all that common compared the vastness of the game itself. This game simply reminds me of the old Tomb Raider games, the story makes sense but doesn't at the same time because it's just so bizzare. The story was very good and Crystal Dynamics did a good job at keeping it similar to the old games which is a much better turn compared to their silly top down titles. The puzzles are there even though there aren't many and they are quite easy in comparison to the older titles, they are still fun none the less. The collectibles make you want to go back and play the game and I will be doing so as to try and 100% the story. The one problem I face though is that I won't be able to get all the achievements. The reason behind this is that there are multiplayer achievements and unsurprisingly, it's dead. You can go back into the world after completing the story on your save so there's no need to worry about that.The graphics are stunning for a game from 2013, the hair physics thing is a bit gimmicky but it works and it's cool. On my 970 it runs flawlessly on the ""Ultimate"" graphics mode and there shouldn't be much problem running it on a cheaper card with lower graphics settings, I'm sure the game will look superb even on ""Low."" The game controls flawlessly and the control scheme is very good, I did play with an Xbox 360 controller and I recommend using one as it's easier with the 360 degrees rotation on the sticks. Playing with a keyboard and mouse should be easy enough though if you get used to it.All in all this game is a must have to a person who enjoys puzzles, story based games, adventure and collectables as they are all in this tightly nit package of a game. The only problem is the multiplayer achievements which can easily be fixed with some workaround. Overall this game gets an 8/10 for the graphics, story and nostalgia from past Tomb Raider titles.TL;DR: Buy this game!"
1479,FancyMetalCan,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062326689/,3,,0,9.1,March,"7,",73,0,1,"Let's get this out of the way, I've never played a single Tomb Raider game prior to this and I'm well aware from the reactions of fans that this game is very different and to some ""not accurate"" to the spirit of the original Tomb Raider games. I'm not writing about that, I'm simply stating whether or not I enjoyed this game. I did not.  Games like Tomb Raider, Ryse: Son of Rome, Order 1886 etc. represent a growing trend to make games look and feel like mainstream blockbuster films. The problem is this means gutting gameplay heavily for the sake of cinematic presentation, which is NOT the strength of an interactive art form. Tomb Raider flips back and forth so frequently between needless cinematic sequences and player control that it just became a frustrating chore to distinguish the ""QTE"" cutscenes from the ""sit back, shut up, and enjoy the film"" variety. Whats more frustrating is the gameplay that is presented doesn't mesh well with the character development of this ""coming of age"" Lara Croft story. ""Cutscene Lara"" is constantly feeling overwhelmed by the catastrophic situations around her and spends a significant portion of the game struggling with having to kill people for her own survival. The problem is ""Gameplay Lara"" doesn't reflect this, because after her first kill she turns into Marcus Fenix, with the player being rewarded for ""Killer Headshots!"" For a game thats trying to present the grim reality of violence in the face of survival, it sure does take a light-hearted approach to killing hundreds of unknown humans who, just like Lara, are simply doing what they feel is necessary to stay alive. The story itself is a pacing nightmare. Once the action starts it just keeps going to the point of exhaustion, and the few character moments that are presented tend to repeat the same beats of ""I can't do this!"" followed by ""yes you can!"" etc etc. In between those moments is just a constant slew of disasterous coincedences that make Amanda Ripley's adventure in space look like a casual sunday stroll. Significant story points are also figured out by the player 4-6 chapters ahead of Lara, which results in the ""reveal"" falling flat. I could make positive remarks about the gunplay, but for a game released in 2013 should the phrase ""well the gunplay feels decent"" really be all that is needed to recommend a game? Firearm gameplay is so rampant in the industry that it shouldn't be considered impressive for a developer to get it right. As stated before its also a mechanic that, while fun, conflicts with the story the studio was trying to present.So no, I can't recommend this game. I hear ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"" does address some of the issues of the first game, but for now I can't say this game presented itself well enough for me to consider purchasing the sequel."

1487,PlasticMatt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PlasticMatt/,2,,1,12.5,April,"17,",403,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a great classic action adventure game that does a good job of paying respects to the original series while making modern changes that increase fluidity and streamlines the gameplay. At the time of release, this game was visually top class and holds up pretty well in 2017. There are some instances where this game begins to show its age (with regards to some animations), but these can be easily overlooked unless you're one to break down and analyze every aspect of a game. The environments are excellent with great lighting and effects. There were several moments where I had to stop and view the landscape, just to admire its beauty. The voice acting is pretty good and the story is engaging enough to keep me interested, but I did not feel that I built a relationship or ""care"" very strongly for any particular character. I would agree with other reviews that the ending of the game was a little anticlimactic and did not sit well with the rest of the game.  The gameplay is linear with areas that give you a sense of an open world. There are a number of collectables, but it is not overwhelming. You are able to fast travel between campfires (save points) if you want to visit a previous area. The weapon selections is limited to a bow, pistol, rifle, and shotgun. The shotgun feels underpowered as it takes multiple shells to kill a man at medium/close range. The bow seems to be the favorite among players. I also enjoyed the pistol as well as it feels quitre powerful. The rifle is good too, although it burns through ammo quickly. The puzzles in this game are on the easy side and only stumped me on occasion. You shouldn't need a guide. The fail state of most of the quick time events usually puts Lara in a gruesome death animation. It is totally worth failing the quick time events just to see what happens to her, so long as you're not squeemish. The game ran well on my AMD R9 290 GPU & FX-6350 CPU on max graphical settings, with a few stutters on occasion. I also played more recently GTX 1060 GPU & i5-6600k CPU which ran flawlessly. I did not purchase this game as it was bundled with a R9 290 GPU.I would recommend this game for casual gamers who want to play in beautiful environments and who do not have time to invest in a huge open world game.

Interesting and sometimes challenging puzzles (a few counter intuitive ones too imo).Very interesting story, which for a while had me thinking of the early Lost seasons. Many ""on the edge of your seat"" cutscenes/quicktime events, which all had top notch production value. That poor girl REALLY has to endure an insane amount of hits/bumps/cuts throughout this game. And if this game was 1st person, I think I'd be torn in deciding whether this had even more vertigo inducing climbs than Far Cry 3. The 3d engine performs fine, enabling my old geforce 590gtx to deliver a great visual experience without many slowdowns.Sound effects and voice acting is also brilliant.The few complaints are that it's REALLY on rails in narrow map areas for a lot of the game, which is a shame because the engine more than a few times proves that it can handle quite big and open areas. I feel the game could have been even better if the gameplay was skewed just a bit more towards open world exploration.The amount of quicktime events should've been reduced a notch - and the odd unskippable cutscene right after a checkpoint also bumps the verdict down a wee bit - it's STILL such an unforgivably easy thing to avoid when designing a game.87%"

It wasn't what I would expect from a Tomb Raider game as it was more focused on killing then it was on actual puzzle solving. The older TR's where about trying to navigate your enviroments and trying to solve puzzles. There is still some of that in this version of the series but it's smothered under all the violence.I was almost wondering if the TR creators where jealous of the Drake Fotune series as, based on my brief impression of that game, this TR was trying to be exactly like it.  Why tho?  What was wrong with the former light hearted version of TR? Did they really want to shove a multiplayer into the TR series that badly?I can understand the need to reboot ther series to keep it fresh but this seemed a bit too unpleasent and gritty.  I perfer the idea of Laura having a nice backstory instead of a sad one. I hope they will consider bringing the former Laura back and get back into puzzle gameplay more.It's still a good and fun game on it's own but not with classic Tomb Raider expectations."
1495,zazeN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/conceptualself/,2,,1,16.7,April,"14,",68,0,1,"This was my first contact with the Tomb Raider series.First of all, I thought the graphics were surprisingly good for a game from 2013. On top of that, there's the story, which is actually quite simple (perhaps that's why it's so functional). Despite its simplicity, which I don't really think of as a problem, the plot is unraveled through a bunch of documents that you find over the course of the game. Diary-like manuscripts from people that are or have been on the island that Lara and her team went to explore. Reading those reports, you get to taste the story in its subtle details, so to speak, as you dive deeper into the plot through the perspective of a bunch of different people from different parties. It also compelled me to explore the map, since I wanted to avoid leaving documents behind. I really liked that.Tomb Raider isn't difficult. Personally, I am not a fan of games that are frustratingly difficult, as I see games kind of as an interactive, active kind of storytelling. Games that are too easy don't feel rewarding, so I don't like those either. Tomb Raider, like most games, falls in between those two extremes, which I appreciate. The puzzles can be a bit frustating if you're dumb like me and have a tendency to overlook things, but in retrospect, they're not really difficult as long as you pay close attention to the hints given by the game.Tomb Raider has beautiful graphics for the time of its release, a functional, charming story and fun mechanics. Taking that into consideration, it is definitely worth your time. It's not a life changing game, something that will blow you away and get you all hyped up. Nope. But it's solid fun, and for that reason, I recommend it."

The trademark 3D platforming is instead mostly replaced with running unfailable exploding/deteriorating bridges/castles/cliffs and the occasional ""OMG DODGING STUFF WHILE SLIDING DOWN SOMETHING/GETTING CARRIED AWAY IN A RIVER"" simulator. So if you wanted 3D platforming, you'll have to either find something else ot make do with the handful of puzzle-based platforming optional tombs.The story is neither bad nor good. A handful of moments stand out as good, and other inexplicable writing decisions, such as the young Lara Croft choosing to raid tombs for loot in the middle of deadly-horror-vacation, should leave pretty much anyone scratching his or her head. And why she'd do all of that and then each time take a single gold coin that looks exactly like all of the rest every. single. time... But that's just nitpicking. The ""I CAN DO THIS"" moments get a bit annoying about three-fourths of the way through, but I can accept that in exchange for the characters being written in a way that I semi-cared about them, even if they are just stock characters. At least the game doesn't try to make you or expect you to be sad when something bad happens to any of the characters -- either you will or you wont, but the game doesn't try to make a hard sale about it.I also think it's worth pointing out how weird the quicktime events where Lara defends herself from male attackers are. I know there was a big blowup about some of this around E3 2012, but the thing I personally find strange is that all of the attacks appear highly sexualized while they're occuring, appearing to be leading toward some kind of assault -- but if the player fails, it turns out to actually be some kind of gambit to slit Lara's throat or something. I find something to be really off-putting about the strange difference between what's happening when you press the right button and what's happening when you don't.I know some people hated on the graphics in this game, but I thought they were quite good. It ran well on the GTX 670 I had at the time. Lara looks quite good, but without trying to sound too prurient, I have a little bit of a problem with the way her butt looks while she's stealth-crouching. Normally Lara's character model looks quite soft, but when she crouches it makes her thighs and buns look a bit blocky and hard. I know it's nitpicking, but for some reason it always drew my attention and annoyed me. And I say this as someone who isn't some kind of creeper who can't take his eyes off of female video game characters while he's gaming.All things considered, it's a fun popcorn kind of game. If taken as harmless pleasure rather than hardcore gaming it can be quite enjoyable.Recommended to people who haven't ever played a Tomb Raider game, or people who didn't really enjoy previous entries that much."

But say goodbye to precision jumps, puzzle solving, maze traversal and tomb raiding, as Lara Croft has been envisioned as a bumbling, fumbling psycho killer hell bent on revenge. Gone is the sophisticated british and stylish acrobat you loved. And you will see her mangled and tortured beyond belief, in truly disgusting ways for no reason other than to, perhaps, satisfy the deranged desires of the game's creative director. Sure, Lara would die in brutal ways after failing jumps, landing on spikes or being rolled over by boulders, but this game reaches borderline Mortal Kombat levels of violence. Yet I doubt I would be annoyed by this if the game honored its roots, which it does not. It spits in the face of veterans by offering these optional ""tombs"", which are small rooms with brain dead ""puzzles"" that can be solved in a couple of minutes each, just to fill an achievement list.Very few reboots reach a level of disrespect towards its fanbase and origins like this one. If I had to mention a positive, it would be that the graphics are good and the performance is great, even on my subpar computer at high resolutions. Now, if you want to see a  much, much better attempt at reimagining Tomb Raider, check out Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, an excellent spin-off of the formula that meshes exploration, combat, platforming, collectibles and puzzles in a fun, balanced fashion."

(keeps you looking around)* Collectibles aren't required, to get enough XP to buy all skills.Cons:* Enemies are... very blind.

1509,LenMcHarriStar,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121395868/,4,,1,1.7,June,"4,",62,1,1,"Not having played any of the previous games from the 'Tomb Raider' franchise, I must say this 'reboot' of the famous series did not disappoint and I will definitely be  getting the previous titles in the franchise. This particular Tomb Raider game has our inexperienced heroine along with her whole team of explorers venturing on a ship christened 'The Endurance' when suddenly they are thrown into a scenario where they are shipwrecked on an Island in the Dragon's Triangle called Yamati. On this island survival is the key and this is where we witness Lara Croft's climb from innocent bystander to Lethal Survivalist.So for a newcomer like myself, this reboot series could not have been a better starting point for my introduction into this fantastic franchise. I do however have two questions circulating round in my mind. Question one: why have I only now started taking an interest into one of the most iconic games of all time? Question two: When's the sequel (fingers crossed there will be one) coming out? Come on Square-Enix, Chop-chop.As well as the buxom beaut herself, there is a whole array of intriguing and memorable characters within the plot. There are some you'll love, some you'll despise and some who will get you thinking ""Geez when are you going to die""? All these characters have their own motives and are not just throw aways, you'll definitely be finding yourself connecting with these characters for good or for worse. Personally for me there is one character who stood out amongst the rest and that is Conrad Roth, Captain of the Endurance. For some bizarre reason he reminds me of Merle Dixon from AMC's 'The Walking Dead' (Judge it for yourself) and for this reason I soon forgot his actual name and just referred to him as Merle. I'm not saying it’s a bad thing; it's just a personal observation.Onto the gameplay itself which is very compelling and smoothly done. The combat system is extremely satisfying and you'll probably find yourself using the game's signature weapon, the bow to exterminate the enemies encountered within the game, more than anything else. There's nothing more appeasing then bagging a headshot with the bow. The plot is guaranteed to keep you fixed and compelled from start to end, hooked, lined and sinker. The game is free foam which surprised me, as I was expecting linear levels where you could not return too, but Tomb Raider features an open world that you can revisit time and time again, especially to ensure you gather all the collectibles. One of the games mechanics that caught me off guard was the use of 'quick time events'. This particular experience is going to make it hard for me to forget when I reacted slowly to an unexpected occurrence, which lead to me being smushed by a tumbling boulder. Which leads straight into another one of my observations which is how graphic and brutal the deaths can be if you time a certain action wrongly or are just foolish (like me). Tomb Raider definitely has no mercy and when you die once you know not to let it happen again and you ENSURE that you are paying the utmost attention 24/7. Thanks Square-Enix for teaching me to pay attention, you've done a better job then all my Primary and Secondary school teachers combined, for that I salute you. I also wasn't expecting all the jump scares that featured in the game, I'm telling you this so you don't have to go through what I did......which was several pairs of boxers.And finally the best till last the voluptuous vixen herself, Miss Lara Croft (Can I get a Whoop-Whoop?) Square-Enix has done an outstanding job on making Young Lara look like an actual woman and not a sorta woman-thing that has two traffic cones for breasts. This Lara we have been blessed with is definitely a keeper. Everything from her looks to her voice actress, a big shout out to Camilla Luddington on giving us a performance that is so spectacular that she should get an award or something.(Take a hint, all you award givers out there) This is really the kind of voice you expect from England's finest Archaeologist. I also bet a mountain of money that some if not all male gamers will be constantly be stopping in their tracks and tilting their cameras positioning to get those oh so satisfying angles. (Don't be embarrassed, we've all done it, am I right?)I definitely without a shadow of a doubt rate Tomb Raider as one of my favourite games of 2013 and possibly even of all time. All who have read this lengthy review should definitely do it the honour and give it a look see. One last thing, the best piece of music to have on repeat whilst playing Tomb Raider is Jimi Hendrix's Foxy Lady, trust me it just seems so fitting"
1510,The Batter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Le_Batteur/,11,2,0,4.4,June,"27,",116,0,1,"Honestly, I feel that the single worst thing a game can do is bore the player. And Tomb Raider is boring.Even on the highest difficulty, the combat is mindnumbingly easy, resources are never an issue, and most of the skill upgrades are worthless. The puzzles are incredibly straightforward, to the point of being nothing but timewasters, and the game itself is incredibly toothless, despite putting the protagonist through 'high stakes situations' every two seconds that are instantly solved by a QTE or simply climbing sequence. It doesn't help that the devs seem to think that a strong female lead is made by constantly traumatizing her at every opportunity. She suffers so much it makes me uncomfortable, not with the actual violence, which you will be desensitized to very quickly, but how she never actually does anything BUT get the living ♥♥♥♥ kicked out of her. I got this for free and I still want my money back."

Little tip to any future players that have a logitech F310 controller - when I first started the game I couldn't work out how to change the set-up of the controls and on searching found loads of people had the same problem... The fix generally accepted was to download up to date drivers for the controller and add them to the game file in your steamapp, common folder... before you look into that though just make sure you aren't being a numpty like I was and check that the switch on the back of your controller is on X not D - spent agggges trying fixes for something that took 0.2 seconds when I engaged my brain d'oh!"

1515,Satire is Dead,https://steamcommunity.com/id/seannao/,4,,1,9.7,March,"8,",630,0,1,"It's a good game. Briefly comparing this game to the classic games. The way you approach combat is surprisingly grounded. You won't be double fisting micro-uzis shooting up baddies while leaping 10 feet in the air doing backflips. The story and Uncharted-style escape scenes are completely over the top though.It's not a completely cover-based shooter though, and you get a few tools to help you keep moving and get up close and personal. Melee's fun. The bow adds tension while charging it up and aiming. The firearms are typical. Lots of gruesome animations, from bashing people over the head with rocks to watching them flail around on fire for an uncomfortable amount of time.The story fits for a Tomb Raider prequel reboot as well, although wow was the supporting cast just not there. They get introduced through flashbacks in the first 1/3rd of the game, which felt pretty late to be reflecting on people who were personal to Lara herself. They handwave the hell out of Lara's survial training, and it doesn't truly get explained until some late scenes and collectable documents concerning Rolf, the Obi-Wan Kenobi Jedi Master of the Croft family's Batman-like combat training. Early on, he emerges through Lara's thoughts while she scrambles to remember how to, and then does, kill an army of mad cultists.This isn't a very deep game. It's a comic book with a pittance of real world grounding. I won't even begin to engage with that old argument about survivor believability as compared to Jason Brody because it's as asinine as wondering why Superman faces challenge."

That being said, I was always anticipating getting my hands on this game!The reason that I didn't buy it before is because it seems (and kind of is) as a linear gameplay. Obviously you can run around in certain areas, even after completion, to look for all hidden items such as GPS locators (Damn you!). However, the game is still quite linear with the presence of just the main quest and some hidden side-quest for a quick change of scenery.Nevertheless, the game feels awesome, and I have not been bothered by the linear gameplay for a minute. The graphics are absolutly stunning, especially with tesselation on. The gameplay feels solid, and who doesn't like using a bow!? I like the fact that there are long cutscenes and nice convesations, it really makes it feel like you are in an awesome kind of movie that you kind of control yourself. The only main drawback I have found up to now is the kind of short gameplay, granted I have not finished the game yet, however by looking at my total completion and the amount of hours I have player so far it seems like it is going to be a bit short. Then again, I'm used to Skyrim and such, so my opinion on long and short games is a bit biased.Keep up the good work Square Enix!"

Linear gameplay and paths, uncapivating and overly simple puzzles (if you can even call them puzzles). Being able to 'travel' back to other parts of the linear map does not make the gameplay any better. You spend most of the time fighting simple enemies and watching cutscenes. I loved the original Tomb raiders. One giant step back. This game should have... 1) been open world.  2) had complex puzzles that make you think out of the box.  3) focused on puzzles rather than killing simple AI.  4) lots of choices in the story to define your character. Graphics does not make gameplay fun. Graphics can add immerson. Linearity breaks immersion. Most indie games are more fun than this.For me this is a hugely disappointing AAA title.

Not because the game is bad... I can't really speak up on that because I am not able to play it at all. I usually love this kind of games and they usually agree with me, but for some sad reason the developers have gone with the cheap trick of having a constant shaky camera in this game to make it feel more dramatic or something and there's no way to turn it off. I guess a lot of people can actually enjoy this ""dramatic"" effect, but as a person with a bit too fine tuned sense of balance all this does is create instant motion sickness. I suffered through the intro hoping it was only part of the initial shock of being thrown into danger and that it would go away once you reached a safe spot. Unfortunately once I've unlocked the first campsite and the game has opened up before me, it's still there and only a few minutes of playing triggers such a severe motion sickness I have to lie down for a few hours to get rid of it.It's a shame, because I've been saving this game in my library for a long time, building up expectations for the day I felt it right to start out on a grand adventure.... only to end up in bed with severe nausea. Only game that I've played that is close to this bad for my motion sickness is Warframe and that's because insanely fast movement that jerks the camera around... a slow third person adventure like  Tomb Raider should never even be in the danger zone.For most people the game is probably safe, but if you're sensitive to motion sickness, you have been warned."

1542,MattyMcFly,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068801341/,4,,0,6.6,January,"26,",89,0,1,"Ok, let's make this short and sweet. This is a good game with very good mechanics. The game is designed so you don't feel as if you're on a set course to the end of the game, but actually exploring an island. The map is designed so that you'll always have to use everything in your inventory to move on. In most games when you get a tool, you use it once or twice, then its forever in your inventory serving no purpose because you've moved on to the next tool. But even close to the end of the game you'll still be using tools you got at the beginning of the game to solve puzzles. This really helps with the immersion of the game. Instead of stumbling on a puzzle and thinking, ""This will be easy I'll just use the last thing they gave me"" you'll actually feel genuine curiousity when looking at your inventory and the puzzle. But don't get me wrong, this game isn't perfect. Tools only work on certain terrain, for example, the rope arrows you use to zipline only work on white ropes wrapped around poles, and nothing else. Another example, is the climbing axe you use to save yourself from falls or climb up walls, but they only work on white spotty walls, and nothing else. So when you're falling and only have a couple seconds to make a decision instead of going ""♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥, what do I do?"", you'll go ""Oh, white walls, use the axe"". Also, this game is crazy unrealistic, this is another thing that breaks the immersion. Your character will be carrying 5 guns and a bow without a single holster. Another thing that makes it worse is when you switch from a bow to a different weapon, the bow just disappears, maybe it's a glitch but the only time she has a bow on her back is when she's about to use it. Also when she finds things on the ground she decides to keep she'll literally just grab a huge object and put her hand behind her back like she's putting it in her back pocket. This game's purpose was so that you felt immersed, you can tell this was their purpose because the game constantly has these moments of ""Oh you're about to fall better press shift a bunch of times"" or ""oh the board you're holding on to is breaking, wiggle your mouse to climb up"". These little quick time effects are cool every once in a while, but they are constant in this game. So constant that whenever you're about to climb up a wall with what appears to be rotting wood, you'll already have your finger on shift. There was not a single moment where I felt genuine concern for my character or where my stomach dropped because she almost fell. This game completely ruins the immersion at the start so it feels like you're wathcing a movie you've already watched a million times and can no longer get into. You'll know you're playing a game the entire time you're playing it. So much for making this short and sweet."

1559,Dangerous Saiga,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DangerousSaiga/,3,,1,31.5,July,"5,",445,0,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) is an interesting reboot of the well-known 3D action platformer that takes an ""origin"" story of how Lara Croft became a, well, Croft. When Tomb Raider was announced a few years back, I originally expected that the game would be mediocre and won't stand out as 2013's (or 2012's) nomination for most anticipated game or had reached audience expectations. By the time the game was released on early 2013 for the PC, I was wrong on how well the game selled and highly praised from critics, reviewers, and ordinary gamers alike. Was Tomb Raider (2013)  done right? Let's find out. The story takes place in the ""Dragon's Triangle"", off the coast of mainland Japan where Lara Croft and colleagues are trying to find the lost civilization of the Yamatai. Suddenly, Croft and colleagues got stranded on the island due to supernatural storms. The plot is very obvious to the player, but the best attribute in this game has to be Lara's character development from a vulnerable girl to a ""hardened"" survivor who takes extreme measures to resolve the supernatural ordeal. From the very beginning to the end, Lara's character development is an exceptional tale of how characters can be dynamic and highly praised. The visuals and environments in the game are well-crafted to the point that the player might well be taking a large number of screenshots. The soundtrack and music is pretty good as most music in the game has that ""get-on-your-feet-and-stay-motivated-to-achieve-that-objective"" mood. One example of this soundtrack would be when Lara climbs to the top of the radio tower. The last, best feature is how gritty, intense, and ""mature"" the game is. There's no limit on how violent, gruesome, and the menace the game can be. This took me by surprise and it probably would take you by surprise too.In summary for other positive features...+ Lara Croft's character development, including superb voice and motion capture acting by Camilla Luddington + M-rated content that takes no restrictions on its grisly nature and intense violence for a Tomb Raider game+ Collectables to gather that actually benefit you+ Excellent use of stealth, interesting upgrades for your 4 weapons, and solid platforming There are some negative aspects for the game as well. The game has an overload of QTEs that breaks the immersion and easily ""assist"" the player. It's upsetting that there's no real time mechanic of some sort. There are secondary characters in the game that you don't really care about, up to the point that you might thought of like ""Oh ****, they exist?"". Lastly, there's very little tombs to explore and solve. In summary for other negative attributes...- Too much QTEs that assists the player way too many times than necessary - Lack of character development for all other characters in the game, including a notable plot twist that is so easy to predict- Familiar plot and (few) typical cliches - A very notable amount of explosions that makes you wonder if Tomb Raider is, well, a Tomb Raider game - Multiplayer should not exist, at allTo be honest, I originally thought that Tomb Raider would be a major disappointment. The original Tomb Raider games were mostly ""like it or hate it"" kind of game, but the reboot can and will appeal to a lot of people if these positive attributes are taken into account. Was Tomb Raider one of 2013's best games of the year? It was pretty close and pretty damn good for the $25 dollars I've spent back in May 2013. Nowadays, Tomb Raider is now affordable for $20 dollars, but the -75% or more discount is a must steal. One of the best games in 2013 and a reboot of a franchise done well to sell millions of copies."
1560,WaxxFetish,https://steamcommunity.com/id/waxxfetish/,4,,1,39.2,January,"25,",173,0,1,"Well, so on the edge about this game.If you like streamlined, spoon-fed fun you'll probably love it. The graphics are absolutely gorgeous, if you have an ATI board you'll probably run it butter smooth.If you're on the greens than you'd better have a hefty one. I really can't praise the engine enough, the weather effects, the (in)famous tressFX hair, fantastic locations, all these things look really breathtaking. I thought that Far Cry 3 is going to hold the crown for the best facial and character animation for a bit longer, but TR dethrones it with ease. Contrary to FC3, TR's enemies are superbly polished, just on par with the main story characters. The voice acting is top notch. Mocap is outstanding, Lara is a treat to watch not only because she's a cutie, but also because of all these tiny bits about her moves. She'll never stand still, shake off water as she jumps round the rivers amd waterfalls, shake when cold, breath heavily after things get intense and a lot more. There's no clipping or any graphical flaw i can think off. You can hit that screenshot button and every time you do that it will look stunning.Controls are very solid and combat is really good as well. There are some nifty melee mechanics thrown in. And here is where the bad things start. There's really little gameplay to it and there's absolutely no challenge in the game. On the hardest difficulty it's a walk in the park. There's no death penalty, none at all. At certain point one of the main character tells Lara to trust her senses - read: trust predator vision. The atrocious hightened senses mode which highlights every interactive object in the surroundings. Even if you'd decide not to use it, a voice in Lara's head will tell you what to do and where to go after ten seconds of hesitation. Glowing landmarks. Godawful QTE that's not only a pacebraker but also comes with a hugeass marker, that feels completely out of place and obscures the visual beauty of the game. It's 2014 ffs, can't they learn that QTE is awful already ?The puzzles are abyssmal, there's no trace of the old, difficult puzzle the series has been known for.  No replay value, mp is both bad and dead already.Good game if you're into interactive movies with a generic story and shiny presentation. Unfortunately a bad reboot.Still recommended for the piece of art that the game is in the technology department. Game design is hardly refreshing though."

1568,Zephkiel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Allister_Damascus/,2,,1,21.7,November,"26,",935,0,1,"A somewhat new take on the tomb raider genre - a bit open worldy, a bit of rpg, a bit of action, wich contrast with the original chapters wich were very linear.The story is also more adult, the general ambiance is somewhat dark and grim, wich sometimes leads us to pity Lara. But on the other hand, you also wonder how she can take that much abuse...I think she is made of concrete.Also, despite being a gem in every aspect, there is one thing that i dislike : the game likes to make lara slide on makeshift tobogan with deadly obstacles (honestly, she seems attracted to that) while obscuring your vision and not really knowing if the next pointy thing is eligible to impale you or not."
1569,XINRA_68,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xinra68/,2,,1,10.8,July,"3,",354,0,1,"I've never been a fan of the previous Tomb Raider games, they just seemed to be missing a certain something that drew me into the story & action. Crystal Dynamics rectified that missing element with this title, and it's a fresh RetCon for the franchise. The story is far-fetched in many respects, but it's intriguing and riveting enough that it drew me in toward the very end.No longer is Lara Croft just a large breasted bimbo dual-wielding guns in tight-fitting shorts for the sake of titillating male audiences - she's a tough woman who goes through one hell of an ordeal, and struggle for her very survival & freedom; It turns her into the Tomb Raider by the end of the story. The graphics, atmosphere, and shocking scenery of the game add to the desperation of the story & character. I can't recommend this game enough to people who are into Action gaming, it gets two thumbs-up from me. It's a terrific game, and it provided hours of enjoyment that was well worth my time.I will warn you though, this game is incredibly graphic with loads of death, gore, dismemberment, and other shocking moments; It's not for the faint of heart. If you can get past those elements, you'll find an great game just waiting to be played.Multiplayer in this game is somewhat entertaining, but I found it severely lacking in any sense of fun or excitement. Unless you're going for achievements, avoid it altogether - it's mind-numbingly dull and lackluster."
1570,Ed Rooney,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977819693/,3,,1,14.5,December,"12,",461,0,1,"I didn't know what to expect with this game, and to its credit, it took me a few hours to realize which game this is a clone of. Of course that's mostly because the first few hours are a little schizophrenic. There's about a thirty second intro (where Lara introduces her game with the cringe-inducingly generic line ""I went looking for adventure, but adventure found me"") before you're immediately thrown into quicktime events. I guess they wanted to dump you into the action quickly to feel as lost and confused as Lara, but it was awkward and off-putting. I felt confused and emotionally uninvested. Then, one you're past the quicktime events it introduces the concept of hunting animals for food to survive, which makes it seem like it might be a survival based game (which actually sounded really cool), but that's really just a tutorial, you never have to shoot another animal again. Finally the gamesettles into thing and reveals that it's actually an Arkham Asylum clone.I don't have anything against a game being a clone of another game and Tomb Raider is polished enough to be fun and uses cover-based shooter mechanics as its defining element over Arkham's brawling, so it feels like more than a straight rip-off, but it was never good enough for me to forget that I was playing a game that wasn't quite as good as Arkham Asylum. It tries to have stelthy sections interspersed with the action like AA, but your guns are so effective that it's all pointless. In Arkham Asylum the stealth sections put you at a disadvantage and you had to use your superior mobility to outwit the enemies. Sometimes in Timb Raider being stealthy can save you from having more enemies pop out, but there was never a point where I couldn't Rambo through every thing, even with the combat set to hard. It has the same exact pacing as AA where you'll a lternate between more linear areas and those that offer a little exploration, but Tomb Raider's open areas don't really lend themselves to the exploration as well as AA's. They have a more natural and less crafted feel to them, but at the same time it makes it a slog to look around for everything.There are also too many sections that take control away from the player to try and simulate peril. In one section Lara has to shimmy her way up a crack in a mountain side. All the player has to do is hold up and she does all the work. Yeah, it looks like she's struggling and trying to avoid falling rocks, but there's absolutely no threat. Sometimes moments like that can work in a game, but when they fail, they're glaringly obvious.Once the story actually begins to develop at a logical pace it'snot terrible. Lara's fellow castaways all fall into archetypes, but charmingly so rather than obnoxiously. It goes for the hollywood action blockbuster approach rather then the slower paced survial thriller it feel like at first. There are silly moments that don't fit in with the gameplay, for example the game makes a big deal of the first guy you kill, as if Lara is traumatized, but fifteen minutes later, you're sneaking up behind enemies and choking them to death like it's no big deal. There's a moment late in the game where you get a grenade launcher and Lara starts busting ass like she's some avenging angel. It's clearly supposed to be a major moment in the storyline, but I was running through so many enemies early on that it just felt like I was doing the same thing I'd been doing all along.In any case the game's pretty, the gunplays solid, it's neat to discover tombs (even though most of the item collection is just picking up ♥♥♥♥ that's lying around). I'd recommend Arkham Asylum before this game if you haven't played it already, but Tomb Raider a'int too shabby if you can find a good sale price."

1579,sanitarian1281,https://steamcommunity.com/id/san1281/,2,,1,24.5,January,"14,","1,841",0,1,"Tomb Raider isn't exactly like any other Tomb Raider game that I've ever played. My experience with the previous games in the series is basically limited to some of the really early entries like 1-3, and those were essentially platformers with shooting elements with the heroine wielding dual pistols with an auto-aim feature that came in handy when she was dangling from a sheer rock face. The 2013 iteration is very much like an Uncharted game featuring Lara Croft instead of Nathan Drake and conveniently ported to non-PlayStation systems like my trusty PC.From my perspective, at least, this is a very good thing. I thoroughly enjoyed Drake's sundry adventures and likewise found this new Lara Croft adventure to be very fun indeed. The story tells of how a very young and somewhat naive research assistant on her first expedition evolves into a (somewhat) hardened and (highly) lethal thrillseeking, modern-day female Indiana Jones. Under the guidance of Dr. Whitman, Lara and the crew of the S.S. Endurance are investigating legends of the lost kingdom of Yamatai when a sudden and brutal storm shatters their vessel and the survivors flee to the island's shores. There they soon discover that they are sharing the space with a mysterious cult and equally hostile but more supernatural occupants.As soon as a wet and bedraggled Lara drags herself onto Yamatai's weather-beaten sands, she embarks upon a linear trek that will lead her to the heart of this mystery, along the way gaining a variety of lethal implements (bows, shotguns, pistols, and assault rifles) as well as more mundane equipment, and training herself in Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler skill trees. Lara gains experience points from completing parts of the story, finding collectibles, killing enemies, and hunting animals. When she levels up, she gains a skill point to put into one of the aforementioned skill trees, which range from things as trivial as highlighting animals in the environment to unlocking a variety of bonus-granting finishing moves in melee combat. Very early in the game, Lara gains her first bow and she acquires additional weapons and upgrades throughout the game. Upgrading weapons requires two things: parts and a sufficient quantity of salvage. Parts are scattered randomly in boxes and crates, while salvage is located in crates all over the game map and also taken from fallen enemies.Lara's adventure is a mixture of stealth, combat, and platforming with a (mercifully) few QTEs thrown in for good measure. All of these elements are blended fairly well and each controls fairly well with a mouse and keyboard, which is good because the game doesn't play well with the third-party controllers at all. However, the game on normal difficulty is well-balanced in all aspects.This being a Squeenix game, there are lots of collectibles to be located throughout the maps, mostly relics, documents, and GPS caches. The relics are graphical representations of items left behind by the island's former inhabitants and visitors, ranging from archaic Chinese fans to more recent items left behind by ill-fated Japanese soldiers during World War II. Documents include the ravings of the island's less-sane natives as well as personal diaries of fellow crew members, a Chinese ambassador, and the doomed soldiers. The GPS caches seem to serve no actual purpose that I could see beyond existing to be collected.Lara can save her progress at various campfires throughout the maps and certain camps (""base camps"", denoted by tents on the maps) can be used as fast-travel waypoints, and this is handy if you're skipping around the maps looking for collectibles you may have missed during previous visits. Tomb Raider isn't a particularly long game so a swift player can be finished with the story in about 8-10 hours but it will take another 5-10 to get all of the collectibles and single-player achievements. The game does also include a multiplayer mode that I frankly just didn't bother investigating. There are a few tombs scattered across the maps that are basically puzzle rooms that reward Lara with some salvage and maps that show locations of collectibles in that area.Tomb Raider is a very good-looking game and the incidental sounds as well as the orchestral soundtrack by Jason Graves are quite good (if I have a nit to pick about the sound direction it would be that some of the animals that Lara encounters in this island's jungle environments really don't sound right). Like many modern console ports, the game relies on a checkpoint save system; fortunately, the checkpoints are pretty frequent, so if you miss a jump or get nailed by a particularly well-armed group of Solarii, you won't lose too much progress.All in all, Tomb Raider does everything right and I'd love to see Crystal Dynamics using it as a template for future Lara Croft games. It's not the Lara that you used to know, but I think Tomb Raider works brilliantly as an Uncharted game and I'd gladly play another one."

The game has you exploring the island in search of a long lost civilization and then also exploring the ruins that many other explorers and persons have left behind.  You'll have to explore carefully to discover the secrets the island holds as well as survive many of the challenges the island holds.There may be some minor spoilers ahead, but I'll try to avoid any big spoilers.I think the best thing this game has going for it is the gameplay.  The levels/areas are all very well designed with enough interesting puzzles or environmental challenges in each location to challenge you as well as keep each new area interesting enough that you want to keep moving.  The levels are very linear but are well designed so you don't feel like it's on rails.  There are also areas in the game that are more open that others that do give you the freedom to explore a little and discover some of the secrets in the game.  The levels/areas also introduce enough new elements to keep each new area fresh and not just a reskinned version of the previous area.The game also mixes the adventure/exploration elements with some fun combat elements.  There is a limited selection of weapons but the upgrade system does give you the option to add some variety to each one.  The one downside I had to the combat was that by the end game, it was almost less about the adventure and more about being Rambo.  The early game was a little more about stealth and taking down some well positioned enemies and not alerting enemies while the end game was taking out your shotgun/Rifle and mowing down waves of enemies.The graphics in the game are fantastic.  Each new area is almost better than the last.  The buildings/environment/characters are incredible to look at and fit so well into the story.  The story is good, not overly complex and maybe a bit of a blemish compared to the rest of the game.  The story does manage to tie together a lot of little things into one big complex storyline.  There is a good bit of lore to find throughout the game that adds to the story.  The only big complaint I had was that by maybe 1/3rd of the way into the game you could figure out what the end game story was and how the game was going to unfold.  However the game is solid enough and some of the side story was good, so knowing how the game was going to end up wasn't a story killer.  One of my smaller complaints was how the story began after the ship crashed.  It had this weird creepy/horror vibe that just felt out of place and out of touch with the rest of the game.And lastly, my big problem with this game, the Quick Time Events(QTEs).  I think even the developer realized how crappy and unfulfilling they were because after a bunch of them in the first part of the game they became rarer and rarer.  With how fun the gameplay/combat was in this game, it was so unsatisfying that some battles because button pushes with instant death for missing a button rather than a well planned out fight.  There was some good use of them later in the game when you had to interact with the environment.  But the QTEs when used in battle just killed the tempo and were not fun when compared to the rest of the game.To sum it up.  The game is not overly long (~18 hours to 100% the game) but is a fantastic experience for what there was."

The scenery is just astonishing and the characters are very well designed. Throughout the levels get quite hard to read. The thing that I love about this game is that the game actually encourages you to go off the main path to discover hidden tombes and more treasure. The story is intense, and you will just want to keep playing because it is that exciting. 9/10 for no spiders so far. :)"

So much forced drama, no surprises at all and some of the most stereotyped characters i have ever seen. It's just a mess. And there are so many explosions and unnecessary action scenes. Like if you put all James Bond movies and all Roland Emmerich movies together and then add some more. It's like your standard action movie. You watch it and forget everything that happens as soon as you leave the cinema.Still. Exploration is great, but unfortunately there aren't many opportunities without anything exploding left and right. I really don't know why they called it Tomb Raider and didn't start a new franchise, because it has nothing to do with the old games. All the minidungeons and Tomb Raiding part is not challenging at all, extremely short and unsatisfying.Audio and Graphic is pretty good. Voice acting is ok. Fighting is fun. But the game is extremely linear.Oh yeah. Nearly forgot those awful QTE all over the place. That's just a annoying gameplay element. Should not be in any game out there.I got it for free, so i can't complain and i still think it's worth the asking price if you have to pay for it these days. Maybe better during a sale. Just too much action and not enough adventure for my taste. Overall a slightly above average gameplay experience.Gonna try out multiplayer next and check out if it's still alive. Ok, seems like ""Ranked"" is dead, but ""Casual"" is fun for a while. Groups are not balanced, so it totally depents on luck as well."

I have jumped into the Tomb Raider series not knowing a clue about what I was doing but during this clueless adventure I have never had more fun on a Adventure game ever.My only downside to this game is that if I want to play Mulitplayer with someone who is on Windows I can't do that because the game does not support Mulit-Platform Mulitplayer. If I try to do it I end up with a error saying that my verison is no supported.But other than that, if you are on Windows or Mac buy this game.

Running around, gunning down velociraptors with a shotgun like a badass.And oh, how far away those days seem at the start of Tomb Raider (the new one, not the old one, because names and numbers are hard). This new Tomb Tomb Raider no longer has a badass Lara, but rather a whiny, weak and constantly crying Lara, and here is where the downhill starts (big word coming up): ludonarrative dissonance.Here's an example on than and the reason why I give the story such a low score:8 hours into the game Lara opens a door. Behind the door are fifteen burly men with floodlights, sandbags, shotguns and submachineguns all pointing at Lara. Lara then proceeds to massacre these would-be ambushers without comment.12 hours into the game Lara is in a room with a friend of hers and several enemies are approaching. ""Leave me, Lara, you can't take them!"" -the friend says, and Lara turns away and just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LEAVES! Oh and then she cries some more, because women apparently do that a lot. I shouted bloody murder at my monitor.Other than the broken story, Tomb Tomb Raider is actually a pretty cool game. All but one of the Tombs in Tomb Tomb Raider are optional for some reason, but at least they're there. Gunplay is okay, enemy AI is fine and the overarching story is interesting enough even with the bawling protagonist breaking down immersion every ten minutes. The game is also gorgeous. The splashing waters, the fluttering leaves, the tumbling ragdolls, all of them are well rendered and believable.Playtime: 19+ hours (single playthrough)Ratings (1-10)Visual: 9Audio: 7Story: 6Gameplay: 8Overall: 8"

But I purchased it (one good man recomended it to me) and after finishing some chapters/missions I noticed that game takes me in and takes me deep inside, yes exactly. First time I played female character and feel myself as a main character, every thing around is taking you deep in to its world, cutscenes that synchronously moving in action and vice versa are making you part of all the actions inside, like you are in movie, like you are part of the movie, very beautiful and atmospheric world around you that smoothly changes from peaceful right up to the horror, makes realistic and deep feelings, every thing there is hostile but beautifully calming, whole world is against you here. Didn't expect see so many genre in so harmonious union with each other - Atmospheric, Adventure, Puzzle, Quest, Action, Stealth, Horror, H&S, Survival all with some kind of RPG elements spanning you in after every moment. Game is very active for what I was expecting from Tomb Raider game.For me TR becomes one of the best games that I ever played before, I didn't expect so deep and fun gameplay, but one negative thing that I didn't like in, is that game is way too easy for hard mode, but it have its good part too - you can relax and enjoy its deep, interesting and fun gameplay. (It's more like Movie for me more than Game, but anyway as I say before ""it's one of the best games I ever played"" or  ""movie I ever watched"" ..? Shortly, who cares, it's great so don't miss it).Game for me is 10/10, really big + to Developers. Also can say that game have quite good optimization, also looks great on tweaked settings. One more interesting thing that I find here was Multiplayer very fun, dynamic and action, but sometimes it have a little problems in finding matches, but more often match starts in 20 sec. So worth it, game is really Great-Super-Amazing...Thank you for reading and sorry for my bad English."

Due to various reasons and events, I had to play this game on a 13 inch macbook pro. The game ran superbly on normal graphics, with it getting 60 fps practically at all times. The story was quite good, I wasn't super invested in the characters, but that is probably down to me not playing any of the previous games. I did find the characters a bit black and white, and at stages, the story was a bit predictable.  I would recommend playing the game on hard mode, otherwise its too easy. The game had a nice mix of problem solving and action, but I wish the puzzles were harder. Most of the puzzles you could do using common sense and did not really offer any challenge. Saying this, I haven't completed all of the optional tombs yet, so maybe some harder puzzles were kept away from the main story. To be fair, the game does not categorise its self as a puzzle game. The combat was quite a bit of fun, although its a bit weird how an archaeologist can take on hundreds of presumably trained soldiers, but at the end of the day, it's a video game. Even on normal, the graphics were very pretty, and there was a lot of attention to detail.  I have come across a few glitches during my playthrough. The biggest one was my computer deciding to shut down when I booted up the game. This happened twice to me, but idk, maybe my macbook was just having a ♥♥♥♥ day. Another glitch was when I came out of the cut scene, and the camera deiced it wanted to be outside of the map. This fixed after a quick restart. The last glitch I came across was the hud sometimes appearing small and backwards at campsites. Overall, I really enjoyed playing through the game. It's fun and was a welcome break from more competitive games. I got the game for free in a giveaway, but I would have been happy with it if I paid for it."

Of course there are a few things that could have been done better, but the graphics, the atmosphere of the game, the landscapes, the cutscenes… they are just beautiful. I love the new portrayal of Lara Croft and I like how she looks more realistic than ever. She is smart, strong, fast and brave, but at the same time she’s also just a young woman doing her best to survive… and you feel for her. I really suffered whenever she got hurt, and I think that’s something the developers got just right. The gameplay is awesome, the story is certainly entertaining and playing this game feels like a super cool movie you don't want to stop watching.So yes, Tomb Raider gets an A+ from me, but let’s have a look at some of the things it could have done better, like for example including a bit more “tomb raiding”, instead of so much “island exterminating”. I also did not like how fast Lara changes from being an innocent girl afraid of shooting a gun into the secret lost daughter of Rambo and John Wick.Another thing I didn’t like is how I could never figure which key  they wanted me to press during the quick time events. Poor Lara just kept dying and I sometimes even had to open the key mapping menu just to see  what I was doing wrong. I hope they fix that in the next Tomb Raider. Give us a big “PRESS E”, or a massive “F” instead of a small red hand symbol. More small details that are not as good as they should have been: Some of the characters are too based on cultural stereotypes, which sucks. And Lara complains all the time about how cold she is, but she never figures that she could cover herself with the hundreds of jackets she comes by. Oh, and it’s also funny how even though she is an archeologist, all she does is destroy all the buildings and old artifacts she sees. But we love you still, Lara. You made me suffer a lot throughout these 20 hours of gameplay, but we had a blast together. Can’t wait to see you again in the next Tomb Raider! Ps: No, Crystal Dynamics, I appreciate the gesture at the beginning of the credits, but I am the one who should thank you for this amazing game and so many hours of awesomeness. Keep it up!"

I went in with a positive bias, but what I found was largely disappoining.The game contradicts itself more than Bible does. It is trying to tell a story of tough survival in a harsh environment and throws that premise completely out of the way as soon as gameplay begins. One moment you had a serious wound that was very hard to patch up, the next you are slaughtering dozens of enemies and traversing convoluted platforming sections like nothing happened. The change is so sudden and striking that I can't help but notice it. But I am mechanics-focused player and I am good at suspension of disbelief, you can tell that by my other reviews - they are heavily mechanics-focused. So what made me dislike this game?Linearity. The game is on rails like Uncharted or Call of Duty are on rails. It isn't like CoD only in the ability to go back along the rails. But it is no way less linear. Every single environment, every single encounter, every single gameplay, puzzle, platforming section can be traversed in one single pre-defined way filled with stupid instant failure QTEs and a lot of screaming (seriously, Lara, this is like 100th time a ledge breaks just enough for you to hold it with one hand, you shouldn't be surprised anymore!). The pacing and level progression in this game is similar to Dead Space. But where in Dead Space the screaming and linearity played towards the atmosphere and the horror element, here it's nothing more than another reminder of what this game actually is - an on-the-rails Indiana Jones game without the lava carts (they only had budget for the lava). It is filled with convoluted puzzles, one-the-rails fun, but completely out of place combat sections a-la Rambo did a gender swap, QTEs (lots of them) and cutscenes so disconnected from all that contrived mayhem that the only emotional attachment I developed as a result of them is to my palm, which frequently eneded up hitting my face.A little example: an island inhabited by lunatics, which conveniently paint every climable edge white and also wrap all the correct places in super-rope made from some metamaterial that can hold your weight with no trouble, seems to have zero weight itself and somehow makes insanely strong bonds with arrows shot at it. As you traverse the puzzle from one white paint to the next, a flimsy looking object, which is all but missing a big sign saying ""I WILL COLLAPSE AS SOON AS YOU CLIMB ME"", collapses, you enter a QTE, which by now you have expected so you don't fail it, continue climbing. You are up, a radio conversation happens where everyone makes sad faces about some good dude that died (he said 4 lines in the entire game). After that deeply emotional conversation you dry up your tears and proceed to climb to the next set of white paint stopping for your commander to snipe the enemies for you or else you die (this is the only part where your allies participate in gameplay in any way, and that's the best way they could come up with to make me care? Really?).If the above sounds like your thing, you got a great game lying here for you, because the entire game is like that.For me, though no. This game should have been focused on stealth. It should have had quicksaves. It should have had branching levels, stamina, wound management and reliance on your allies to work together to get through this hell. Or the story should have made no premises of survival and focused the hollywood action movie slaughterfest with 100epm (explosions per minute). You can't force both upon me and expect me to buy it. I don't eat cherry cake with mustard.I am sorry, SE and Crystal, I can suspend my disbelief for fun mechanics, but in order for me to do so I need to be given the freedom to look away from the aspects I am trying to ignore. If you hamfist me with your contradictory and out of place sections, cutscenes, QTEs and don't let me choose what to see, I will only be able to judge what I am seeing. And what I am seeing is a linear holleywood shooter that pretends to be a grim survival story. I don't buy it.Some good things:High production quality. It's smooth and stable, very few bugs, nice PC port. Lara is not unlikable as in previous games. She is by no means an interesting character (I can't name a single character trait), but at least I don't want to punch her in the face every time she opens her mouth, like I did in previous games. I.E. she is no longer a robot. Although being merely a blank slate to convey experience to the player is a marginal improvement at best. The pacing of the shooter sections is good. Never too long, never too short. If the game was marketed as an Uncharted-style action shooter, it would be a good one.Take this review for what it is. It is my personal experience and I only write about things that are objectively in he game, but how these things affect the experience is my subjective opinion. Realise it and try to see if it would match your own.Please do better next time, CD and Square. I want to like your games. I will. Just make sure your team members actually talk to each other. BTW the only DLC worth buying IMO is the Aviatrix suit. It looks really cool and not out of place like all her other clothing options (including especially the default one)! It also somehow fits very well with the environment. Awesome suit, I hope it will be in the next game."

She should've died hundreds of times during the course of this game, but she has more luck than all the Leprechauns in the world.- Surprisingly violent. There are a few moments where there is so much blood and viscera in a given location that it would not be out of place in a game like The Evil Within.- Lara Croft starts out almost vomiting after killing her first human being, ends up killing a battalion by the end of the game. Even some of the NPC's you kill are lampshading this phenomenon by questioning how this girl is able to kick their asses so hard.Good game, though. It was fun doing a 100% playthrough on it.

1649,Simorq,https://steamcommunity.com/id/persiansphinx/,4,,1,12.2,November,"6,",407,0,1,"Lara Croft. The Innocent. I rather enjoyed exploring the island of the Yamatai with the sexy archaeologist. Before I start of about the game itself though, there are two things worth mentioning: first, as a classicist, I cringed quite a lot at how the virtual artefacts were treated. Secondly, there was a beautiful message at the beginning of the credits about how the developers valued us gamers. I loved that.This game is very plot oriented and tries to immerse the gamer in an adventure filled with drama, feelings and action. The gameplay revolves around puzzles, leading to fighting, leading to 'escapes'. There is also a good number of challenges for those perfectionists who like that sort of thing. Within the story, there are only a few characters one can like: Roth, Grim, Lara (stereotypical innocent and humble hero), Sam (damsel in distress) and maybe, just maybe some people can relate to Mathias? I couldn't; too evil. So there is no character development (though they tried) and this part of the plot is not so good.The actual story of the game however, is not so bad. It's quite simple and easy to guess since there are only so many characters involved and there aren't very many parameters to have to decode. Even so, I still enjoyed going through it and there were a couple of pleasant surprises waiting for me even through my somewhat cynical approach to the story.The game mechanics are something I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, controlls are easy and unobtrusive, and the other hand the game was just made easy. Every ledge that I can (have to) hang on to is painted white and the crosshair for the aim is big enough for me to kill every single enemy with a headshot or two. Enemies can be strong but There's only so many of them and there is more than enough cover at all times.The graphics are ok. I rarely ever stopped to say wow, but neither did I stop to look at any glitches or bad textures neither. The music was good as well, but nothing too memorable. Overall; I only got under 10 hours of gameplay out of this game, even though it was an expensive game when it came out; but it also has to be put into account that I did not stop to complete all the challenges and get every single collectible (at least not in all the districts, overall completion of %77)TL;DR- get this game if it's on sale for under $10."

That's just one of the more appalling one way traps, there are plenty more. The whole thing is basically on rails, which in my opinion is an affront to the series. To make matters worse, even the puzzles suck. They aren't puzzling in the least. This is Tomb Raider in name alone.

1659,Hattori Hanzo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SaymonAce/,2,,1,23.6,June,"13,",343,0,1,"New time - new rules. Few of us would now play in the continuation of the old but good Lara Croft in her old role - a bright combination of Indiana Jones and Xena, the warrior princess. Today it is important to show not only engaging scenes with shootings or chases but also the actual emotions and experience of the hero, his/her formation and evolution. Let's say here in a next way: it's interesting for players to play an action film, where they will be the main characters themselves.In order to pay tribute to the present, the famous project has been restarted and now we meet brand-new Lara, a fragile and delicate girl who accidentally falls into the storm and, her with the team throws over to the mysterious island of Yamataj. The small problems are shifting with big problems and they need to be done quickly - not just because of her own life but the lives of loyal friends who decide to help her with a traveling. And here begins the reincarnation of a beautiful swan in a deadly hawk - no matter how she is trying to avoid the cruelty, Lara must defend herself and her team, so she will be forced to kill. Hit or run away, but its nowhere to escape - it is not possible to leave the island (they all - Lara and enemies - are locked here), and therefore you need to hit exactly one time - kill or be killed. At the end of the game, we are already seeing old-fashioned Lara Croft with the eyes burning of the battle (even if the reasons are not so huge - just the salvation of friends and not the whole world), a predator which should not be missed out of sight. And this one is kinda bad news for me - we break balance to the side of Xena, the warrior princess.The player has a small armory available in a game - a bow (heh, classic), a pistol, a shotgun and a machine gun. Each weapon, as well as character, has its own system of improvements.It is cool that the game also has elements of true history - as a tomb raider, Lara discovers various ancient artifacts that tell the story of what was going on the island. Among the side quests you will need to find each one of them, and then you can more closely assess the motivation of both enemies and the team of Lara Croft.The game plot is really enjoyable and exciting, long, events dependent on each other without rapid changes and twists, with the fabulous-tale finale - here the authors paid respect to the several previous series and thus mysticism is also invited to the party. With a graphics component, everything is more than super - both characters and locations have high detailing and do not go beyond the scope. The sound effects are rich, they add dynamics and they are very important during the shooting or escaping.It's worth a try. Very often I meet a game with good discounts and in addition to the second game of the series - Rise of Tomb Raider. If you want to spend 10-12 hours on a good action movie with a story - you will not regret it.9 icebreakers from 10"

I didn’t play the old Tomb Raider, but in this one, I appreciated the graphics and the story which has a lot of twists. The atmosphere was really intense sometimes.The main story of this action adventure is rather short, 10 hours I think, with a lot of cinematics and QTE events. But you have a lot to do with sidequests: items to collect, skills and weapons to upgrade, and beautiful hidden tombs to discover. The puzzles are not too hard, I would have been pleased if there were more. But for a first reboot, I won’t complain too much, I don’t regret buying and playing it. And Rise of The Tomb Raider is even better.Let’s be honest about the multiplayer: it’s dead. But if you want MP achievements, you can find people willing to play on the forum. Because of a bug with Square Enix account, I was losing MP progression each time I quit the game. When I fixed it, I had to play 15h alone to get to level 60 MP.

I like this ggame a lot, the story is solid and the progression is smooth, also the collectible documents helps you know the history of this island from different prospectives... Sometimes i felt like i m in the island of the LOST (the tv series) wjich is kinda cool and i liked it a lot.. Also it is able to create emotions and makes you feel great while you are playing it!  Also i have to mention the replayability of the game, whisch is ok.. I mean after you finish the game , you can come back and exploring again to find the collectibles, and if you put a skill point to unlock the map with the items, you will be able to collecting without get bored the game, which is kinda cool.. The Graphics and the scenery is awesome , and makes you want to leave there!-negatives:  The game while it has a great motion capture and the climbing system is by far the best element of this game, the movement of the hero is bben restricted some times , in some parts of the game, which is gonna make you upset and make you full of questions for the developers..  Also the combat is so and so, i mean after you get the rigle is pretty easy, it has its good momments but its frustrating.. In addition you will find the the simple pistol is stronger that the shotgun or the rifle sometimes, and it is able to aim like a sniper from long distances (LOL!) , but it is the coolest gun with the bow i have too add and the feeiling while you are shooting is enjoyable..  There are hiden tombs, but they are nothing special at all.. While the place they are all built is quite impewssive, the difficulty of pazzles is as much easy as you can get, and also the rewards in all of them are the same, which is not making them so special as i have beeb exected..   The key binding is frustrating , but thankfully you can remap the keys as much as you want!  If you want to replay the game and you have not put the open map perk , you are a bit doomed, and you will get get bored after you replay it..In generel lines, it is a great game!! Ofcourse it has some bad aspects, but the story is able to kee you there.. The weapons are awesome, and the feeling while you are using them is like no other game!!You will see a hiden side of Lara and is pretty awesome i have to say!! Guys you have to buy this game, it is a col game, and it will keep you company at least 15-18 hours!! also my advice is to  get it in special steam sales where you will be able to pay only 4-7 euro for it, which it makes it more value for money!! Go guys, give it a try!!"

A tomb raider with tombs as mini side quests?!Story is way too simple. characters are very shallow and poorly written.  Lara just got butchered up from a badass mofo to a ""innocent deer"" that kills with no questions asked. It's like watching ""Happy tree friends"". There are even moments that people are begging not to be killed but you have to do it for no other reason than watching the next cutscene!Sound and music is very good. at least they had ""tomb raider"" in mind when they made it.Graphics were good at the time now they are ok now.Level design is odd in most parts and does not feel right but straight forward. Enemy placement feel very repetitive. game has some very memorable parts like the pool of blood scene but they get lost in the ""filler"" content of this game.One of the good things about this game is once you picked it up you just have to finish it.Also bow is VERY fun to play. End game is fun as well.I would not recommend anyone to buy this game in full price. just start with rise of the tomb raider and play shadow of tomb raider and you should be fine without this title. if you think you have to catch up to the modern tomb raider trilogy, just do yourself a favor and watch this title's story form youtube.Also you get to friend zone someone right before their death! So, thumbs up for being realistic!"
1683,MasanyaKot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ariel35427/,2,,1,25.9,February,2,456,0,1,"The graphics are pretty good, but looking at them I can see this is a game a few years old, and that it was made for the consoles of that time; the Xbox 360 and Playstation 3. Still, there is nothing to really complain about. The textures are pretty well detailed and I cannot remember ever seeing one that looked poor or out of place. Some might be a little soft, but nothing too bad.The models could look a bit better. They are really what make it apparent to me that this game was also made for consoles. Several objects have flatter edges than I would like to see, and some stand out more than others.The environment still does look quite good and has a lot of details that add to it. The foliage and stones on the ground are nice, but it is more the mist and small insects moving through the air that really help to build the world. These are not always present, but when they are missing something else does that, like tall mountains in the background. Overall the environments are very well designed and add a lot to the visual experience.The lighting is also nicely done, though I will admit it can be annoying at times. The time of day will change as you play, and it seems to largely follow the story. If the current chapter you are in is set at night, then the whole island will be at night, no matter where you are. This is just annoying because it can be somewhat hard to see in some places at night. You can light a torch to help you, but its light does not reach very far. Of course, torchlight should not really be reaching far anyway.I should probably spend some time talking about Lara's hair, since Tomb Raider is the first game to feature AMD's TressFX. This is software for improving the rendering of hair by leveraging the highly parallel nature of modern GPUs. It definitely does give Lara's hair a greater level of realism, compared to a static hairdo or something with clunky, pre-rendered animations. The only issue is that the individual strands can look a bit big compared to real hair. Basically it was getting close enough to reality, that its differences from reality were standing out to me. That could very much be a 'me' thing, and even then, it still looks better than the base option.This is the first Tomb Raider game I have played, so it is possible some things important to the previously established lore will be lost on me. Considering this game is a reboot for the franchise, maybe that is a good thing.Tomb Raider begins as a story for survival, with your ship, the Endurance, having been destroyed in a storm, leaving you and others wrecked on a mysterious island. Your hope was to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai where Himiko, the Sun Queen ruled. You first heard the story of Himiko from your friend Sam, who is one of her descendants, and are not dedicated to finding it. Coming with you is Conrad Roth, who is apparently an old friend of yours that tends to act like a father figure for Lara. At first you do whatever you can to get to him, because he will surely know what to do.As you traverse the island to find the others and means of escaping, the story changes and focuses more on the legend of Himiko. The island has a curse on it that prevents anyone from leaving and will kill those who come trying to help others. You also encounter the Solarii Brotherhood, led by Mathius who is obsessed with Sam and some ancient ritual. The brotherhood is comprised of various people who have been shipwrecked on this island and all are very willing to kill to obtain their goals. These are not the only inhabitants of the island though as there are also the Oni, who exist to protect the Sun Queen, and will kill the Solarii and you without hesitation.As you play the story can get a little confusing because the island has a long history of people coming to it for different reasons. Some just happened upon it by accident while others came intentionally, to learn what powers the storm. The confusion comes from possibly mixing up the different contexts for the clues you find for the island's past. It is still a cool story, but just be sure you keep in mind where some of the information is coming from as you gather it.Is Tomb Raider a game worth playing? In my opinion, yes. It is a fun game that just does things right. It may not be a superlative, but it does not have to be. It does what it does very well, making it a good game and one I can comfortably recommend to anyone interested in it.The graphics do look like they came from a console, but still look good. The performance is very good. The framerate stayed at 240 FPS just about all of the time. There may be some exceptions to that, but nothing significant. The story is good and while I would have enjoyed a certain decision being different, I can also see why the choice is the way it is. Only someone as obsessive over story as myself would probably care about that though. The gameplay is also good with everything working the way I would want it to."

1692,A Tomato,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imjustatomato/,2,,1,9.3,March,"30,",250,0,1,"is the 2013 reboot of the eponymous franchise, developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. The new continuity chronicles Lara's development from a cheerful college graduate into the badass she's supposed to represent throughout the previous games.I wasn't personally blown away by the visuals. It's not actually ugly at all - it's quite the looker, but there's something artificial in the environment, characters, and even post-processing effects, which doesn't sit right with me. I distinctly recall the water and other such fluids looking off, even if the occasional ripples rendered were rather neat. Actual character animation is pretty good, if floaty during platforming - but facial animation, again while not bad, is very underwhelming considering the emotional duress the characters go through. Makes the anguished screams feel less powerful.The audio design was pretty standard stuff mostly. Good voice acting, good lines, good ambient music and mixing between action and calm sequences, but I especially liked the sound effects on the weapons. They feel powerful and loud, and even helps to tie into the storyline subconsciously, what with the inexperienced Lara only getting proper firearms familiarity through this game.Compared to previous Crystal Dynamics games, the gameplay in this is quite a lot different. It's a new interpretation of combat, platforming and puzzle solving, and while it seemed derivative for me at the start, by the end I grew to enjoy all of them. The puzzles could do with being more frequent and perhaps longer, and I say this as otherwise not a puzzle fan, so they definitely are well done. Platforming flows together well for the most part, but many setpieces will require certain retries due to the fast movement and lack of visibility of what to grab onto or avoid, as well as normal climbing sometimes keeping your ""jump aiming"" direction for a moment, which sends you careening off the side of the wall instead of reaching up to the next section above.Lastly, the combat tries to emphasize stealth opportunities but fails to capitalize on any sort of stealth system; once an enemy finds you for more than half a second, you're going all out, and those quiet arrows fired from your bow won't mean a thing when they hone in on you immediately. Thankfully, actually fighting the enemies feels good enough, with flinches, screen shake and feedback. You also have a few unlockable moves for melee combat, though they're finicky to take advantage of sometimes.Story is a big thing, what with TR2013 touting it as Lara Croft's rise to fame. A common complaint is how she seems to get over her first, very intimate murder way too easily for a girl of her age, and those complaints have a point: it stretches your belief to see her nearly break down on the spot, and then follow up with murdering dozens of other goons in the next five minutes like she's been at it for ages. To the game's credit, she acknowledges how quickly she becomes detached from the violence, whilst other characters remark on her thousand yard stare more than once. Looking at it again, the skills and weapon upgrades also do their part in desensitizing Lara: what starts out as a simple shove progresses into moderately effective axe attacks, and the functional, if unremarkable, skills start out with stabilizing her situation and awareness of the surroundings, then progressing to better and better ways of killing people so she can survive. Her Chronic Hero syndrome is most justified in this game, being a tale of losing her innocence, still showing her naivete and shock as the cast of characters dwindles. It's especially a shame, however, that none of her other friends get much in the way of development. Reyes, the one most skeptical of paranormal, turns to believe her warnings near to the end, that the island is inescapable until the spirit of the last ruler is set free. The world is divided into explorable sections, separated by linear escape or setpiece sequences - the former hold most if not all of the collectibles and (sadly) optional tombs in the game. Many areas and routes are inaccessible until Lara upgrades her gear sufficiently, and the addition of fast travel and a modest chunk of routes that can be reversed give it a light Metroidvania feel: your new upgrades can now be used to return to older areas and complete challenges and item collections, if you so wish.This game can take over 8 hours if you're indeed invested in at least partial exploration over the collectibles, and even if the rewards are usually experience and salvage (upgrade points), it's usually well worth it because it's rather fun. The multiplayer was untouched and won't be commented on. My initial doubts over the game were mostly washed away, but I would enjoy this new continuity a little more if there weren't two more games after it, showing what appears to be a further change into an unlikable, selfish Lara... or is that an intentional jab at how she actually was in older games?"

1705,Meat Lion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JonTaffer/,2,1,0,12.0,October,"9,",421,5,1,"I wish there was a Neutral recommendation option for games on steam, because I'm not really sure how I feel about this game, but I wanted to write the review right after finishing the game so it would be fresh in my mind.By the time of writing this review I have finished the main story of the game with a 70% completion score and a playtime of 12 hours on steam, but about 9 - 10 of those hours were spent actually playing the game, as one time when playing the game I got interested about the devs for the game and read about them and got side-tracked and started doing other things.Coming into Tomb Raider I wasn't a fan of games which I deemed 'Cinematic Story Driven games'.A lot of people love the games that focus on telling a really compelling story with brilliantly written characters that act and feel real, but have a large amount of cutscenes with a lot of qtes (quick time events) and generic third person shooter, cover-mechanic gameplay. I personally hated them. Not because of the game itself, but because of the fanbase that claim that games like Uncharted and The Last of Us were the best games ever made, when really the actual GAME part of the product was mediocre or good at best. Tomb Raider was one of these games, anyone can tell by looking at it, but the game did interest me a lot more than The Last of Us' zombie apocalypse setting, or Uncharted's Indiana Jones like feel. Tomb Raider interested me because the old games were really good, and scratched that puzzle solving itch of mine. I was sceptical about the game but played it as soon as I upgraded my PC.Within the first 2 hours I found myself enjoying the game a fair amount.I was rooting for Lara to survive the many unreal situations she got caught in and generally was having a good time. I wasn't bothered too much by the qtes and got into the story. I really loved the beautiful scenery and the (mostly) fun puzzle solving and was very surprised to see the hidden tombs in the game which ramped up my enjoyment of the game more.The gameplay wasn't half bad either, the shooting felt good but I did enjoy the traversal and puzzle solving far more. This is where my gripes come in. This proved to be a bad thing for me because the original Tomb Raider games focused on more puzzles than combat, and the new Tomb Raider obviously focused on the opposite. This would have been alright if all the puzzles were all really good, but I'd say only 20% of the puzzles in this game actually got me scratching my head or gave me that 'A-ha!' moment. The rest were pretty dull and a lot of the solutions to the puzzles were used multiple times. I'm pretty sure I had to use a heavy object to break open a door about 3 times in this game.The characters didn't strike a chord with me that much. Lara certainly is the best character of the game by far. I felt immersed in the game for most of my time playing and was always rooting for Lara to keep going. It is a bit odd that a character like Lara can evolve into a gunslinging, crack shot within the space of 3 days though, but it didn't bother me that much. SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE GAME And now for the biggest issue I have with the game, the story.Usually they say that if a game has average gameplay, it will have a really good story, and most reviews I had seen of the game said that the story was the best part about it. For the first 2-3 hours of the game I agreed that the story was very good and well written. However, I quickly found out that this was not true for me.This next part of the review is spoiler heavy, so be wary.Overall I'd say the game is maybe worth a play when on sale. The story is not that good but maybe you might enjoy it. The gameplay is OK, probably the best thing about the game.6/10 for me. This is just MY opinion by the way."

I really enjoyed playing the original games, back when I was a child and also now as I am older, but I didn't seem to have any high expectations for Tomb Raider. However, when I began playing this again, I found myself interested, very interested. The story line was great, the combat was brutal in several parts and the scenery was beautiful. When playing the game, you can tell how much has gone into it and for that reason, it's more appreciated (with any game). I guess the only thing I can mildly complain about, the puzzles weren't extremely hard, but this is me comparing it with the original Lara Croft. I look forward to playing Rise of The Tomb Raider."

A couple of the QTEs are annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete.

If you were to make a drinking game out of everytime she tells herself ""i can do this...!"" or stumbles and pushes herself back up at the beginning, you'd be blackout drunk within the first couple hours.  It's a tad overdone.  The game suffers from triple-A-itis.  You can't help but feel like it's been heavily polished to be as mass-market appealing as possible.  This isn't necessarily bad, but in certain aspects it's eye-rollingly banal.  Quick-time events need to stop being a thing... and cut scenes where you need to hold W to get thru them don't count as ""gameplay"".  These pieces of the game seem to be refined by the end of the game to feel much less annoyingly simple, though.  The steady stream of xp and salvage you gain from exploring and combat keep the feeling of reward going well enough to keep you enjoying the game.  Combat is decidedly bland and watered down, likely because aiming on consoles is hard.  Out of some 300-ish enemies killed in the game, I must have killed less than 10 with something other than a pistol headshot.  It felt like the only reasonable way to kill people that was both rewarding and a (slight) challenge. A major problem endemic to most cover-based shooters with health regen is the question of what does a player do when they're forced to take cover?  Good games give them something to do like command a squadmate to do something (mass effect).  Bad games make you stare at a wall texture (COD/BF, this game).  Another problem is ""hunker down/fall back"".  A lot of the levels had elaborate pieces of cover everywhere. But you will likely only use the rear 10% of the map because over extending forward is punished.  The light puzzle elements and (optional) exploration provide a nice means for the player to self-pace the story.  A welcome addition.I purchased this game of the year edition on steam sale, but a quick glance at the store page and the amount of DLC for this game is sort of appalling.  Luckily it wasn't an issue I had to worry about, but I'd be reasonably pissed if I'd bought this day 1.6.5/10"

I got it in a sale, and this is from a guy who bought and played the first Tomb Raider for the Sega Saturn (good times). I started playing thinking this was one of those ""games"" they release now where its cinematic after cinematic, holding your hand to death. Maybe there is a bit here of that, but I can't deny that this game is flawlessly executed in terms of a combination between gameplay, story and dramatic value.Gameplay is awesome, it is so smooth I couldn't believe it. It is the best quality of the game by far. The story is good and complements it well. The lore aspects of eastern history are a delight to find out.The only things I can say I was not so impressed was always this feeling of the Island trying to be a sort of open wrold exploration area, but it really isn't, it is for the most part a linear game. They missed an oportunity with the Tombs you can explore (and raid). They offer you a sort of ambient puzzle (gameplay wise) to complete, and it's over. Most of them are beautiful, offer lore, but so very smal, and I mean one room small.Multiplayer is only there for the sake of being there imo. It is clear this game isn't build for that. You can have a few laughs, and the times I played I did get some enjoyment but... it's not that good. Reminds me very much of Spec Ops the line multiplyer.Excellent Game all in all."

The puzzles that you will do, require you to think well on what's going on. And the events that unfold require a think mind and a quick reflex to push the correct buttons to evade attacks. As well as the story demands that you go and look around, and discover the hidden secrets that you can find.

1729,AC Black★J0ck Shooter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/redsupersonicninja/,2,,1,13.5,December,"27,","1,921",0,1,"I've been a long time fan of the Tomb Raider games. Played through the good and the bad. While I did enjoy the previous entries in the franchise from Crystal Dynamics (Even if Underworld was blatantly rushed and confusing... Okay that game wasn't much fun but that's beside the point) they felt a bit lacking. So I was excited for the new game in the series even if the title of the game is extremely lazy. Thankfully the game delivered.The game's story is as you'd expect from a Tomb Raider game... which pretty much means there isn't much of a plot... but what they have is usually decent (if at times weird). Though this game does have much more of a plot than before. This time around Lara has friends to save. I can understand why many would be sceptical about saving her friends, especially after the chatter mouths from Legend. But thankfully they aren't that annoying. The game is ultimately your average save your princess from the affair it works.One thing about the gameplay that may make peoples stomachs turn is the Quick-Time Events. And yes sadly they would be correct. They are present, annoying and sadly abundant.One problem many people have is the lack of tombs. And yes they may be demoted to optional challenges to gain upgrades to Lara and her arsenal. The tombs make sure to challenge you though some of the tombs tend to have puzzles that make you ask ""How was I supposed to know"" such as one where you have to pull a bell, open the window doors when gale-force winds appear for 5 seconds, climb onto the ball and then jump to an edge. But when you archive them, even if you looked at a walkthrough, it feels so good to finally get that upgradeFor all you gaming music fans, you'll be sad to hear that there's a lack of songs available. For the most part the game relies on ambient sounds. For all you ambient sound fans, the sounds are appropriate and make you emerged into the atmosphere of the game.There is multi-player. However 2 problems! Problem 1: It's already empty. Problem 2: There is a reason for it being empty and of course the main reason is that it's underwhelming. I can't really talk much about it because I've only played 2 games but after playing them I wanted more of the single-player.Overall the game might just be the best Tomb Raider game since... well, the first game. Heck it even surpasses it! Sure some people will complain about the QTEs and the lack of Tombs to Raid, but the overall experience is well worth the money. There is the Definitive Edition coming soon on PS4 and Xbone but no PC version. That's probably because there really isn't much to build upon. Most of the DLC is just for multiplayer which pretty much means it isn't even worth it. But you don't need the DLC to enjoy this game and I have no problems recommending this game."

The storyline of this game is absolutely magnificent, and had me interested the whole way through. In addition, the game itself is gorgeous, with the environments really well created. It is easy to find yourself immersed in an entirely different world by playing this game. The game is not too hard, but not too easy either.

1734,Alex,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965463884/,2,,1,7.0,July,"15,",243,3,1,"In this game you play as Lara Croft, a budding yet naive young archaeologist yearning to make a monumental discovery that will cement her reputation as one of the greats. Along with her adorably inept crew, she embarks on an expedition to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai, home of the sun Goddess Himiko. After an unexpected storm and a series of unfortunate mishaps see the expeditions ship go the way of the Titanic, an almost drowned Lara conveniently washes ashore on a mysterious island bearing great resemblence to the aforementioned lost kingdom. After being reunited with her crew, who were surprisingly competent enough to swim to safety; they make the logically sound decision to split up and search the island, no doubt inspired by spending too much time watching Scooby Doo between their previous failed archaelogical excursions. Velma, wait, Lara, that's the one, then proceeds to make the unfortunate discovery that the islands native inhabitants are inexplicably more hostile than a rabid wolf being taunted with a succulent ribeye steak, and after escaping captivity finds herself responsible for not only her own life but also those of her largely incompetent colleagues, which hang precariously in the balance throughout the game. Lara spends the first third of the game devising a cunning plan for rescue, which naturally backfires in a hilarious fashion, resulting in a tragic plane crash (No, the pilots weren't Korean) in which both pilots initially survive only to be brutally murdered by the islands local inhabitants. Once Lara finishes briefly languishing in a mixture of self-pity and guilt, she makes the wise decision to get productive and take matters into her own extremely capable hands. It is at this point we discover that Lara is actually the prodigious offspring born from an unlikely love affair between survivalist Bear Grylls and law enforcement extraordinaire RoboCop. Armed with nothing but a cheap wooden bow and an assortment of tools, Lara proceeds to commit systematic genocide, excuse me, i mean commit several hundred counts of self defence against the islands populace, seemingly with no further motive than ""they started it"" (Let's hope Lara has George Zimmerman's lawyer on speed dial, she can probably afford it from plundering that entire ONE tomb in this game). The story continues to develop disjointedly amidst periods of quenching Laras insatiable bloodlust, coming to a fantastic conclusion that you'll just have to see for yourself."

There is a sort of open world environment but there's not much you can do but go back to collect the extra collectables and explore the secret tombs. The game mechanics is great and the weapons provided are badass. The graphics is gorgeous, I had so many moments where I was left speechless because of the beauty of the game, the game is also very well optimized and can run on most mid-end machines.

1742,DemunGod,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014850745/,2,,1,27.3,January,"6,",359,0,1,"First let me start off by saying these graphics are pretty amazing on ultra and with tressfx enable.  Character movements and actions seem so real its unbelieveable.  This has a great storyline that keeps you interested through the whole game.  It has a mix of searching and finding things with a mix of shooting and fighting.  I personally love the fighting, I think it was balanced just right, leaving you not to get bored by just running around and finding things.  I finished this game in about 30 hrs and that was completing all the things you have to find for upgrades and the storyline.  The guns in this game are really nice, especially the bow, but after time using just the bow is fun but gets boring so I am glad there were other guns in this game to keep it interesting.  I have read a bunch of comments on this game saying there needs to be more puzzles and tombs but to be honest the old games were fantastic but would personally get boring with no action and no fighting and all hunting and puzzles.  I think the devs to a great job in balancing this game out between the two.  There are quite a few cut scenes which makes the characters look amazing in with the graphics.  I love cut scenes because it adds way more interest into the game and makes it movie like but still leaves room personal play.  I personally would add more cut scenes with the group or survivors and more interactions to make it even more personal and make it more involving for the players.  Only negative comment I can even come up with which is minor and doesnt effect me but I hear is effecting a lot of people is the shakey cam or whatever you call it.  Yeah it makes it more realistic looking but that doesnt matter to me, I just love watching the cut scenes and playing the game with a normal cam.  There are a couple options you can turn off in your settings that stops the shakey cam quite a bit but not all the way, its still there in the cut scenes and some are pretty bad but like I said it doesnt effect me.  There should of been an option like in Kane and Lynch 2 where you could turn that off completely to make everyone happy.   Also the only other negative comment I could think of is there wasnt enough outfits for sp that you could buy or use and I think laura should be dressed more sexy, I mean come on this is a new age and things have changed over the years since the old games. Lastly this is for the devs, forget about the MP, I could give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ less about MP in this game as a matter of fact I could care less about any MP in any game except for Killing Floor and Battlefield 3 and 4 games.  Im all here for the SP storys that is what the most exciting to me and a lot of my friends. Those all the negative things I could think of and to be honest thats is really nothing major at all. Overall I rate this game a 9.5/10 and I have about 300 games on my computer of all varieties and types and this is one of the 10 or less games that I have even rated above and 8, so that should show how good this game really is.  I hope the next sequel thats coming out is just as amazing (graphic wise and gameplay) and fun to play as this with more personal interactions.  Good job devs and thanks for all the hardwork.   This game is well worth the full price and I wont hesitate to support the makers on the next sequel(unless it has cartoonish graphics)."

You'll be playing a pretty straightforward game, there are no sidequests and exploration is limited, but still rewarding and enjoyable. Best thing about the game are Lara's moans ... *cough* sorry I meant story... the story, yes yes, of course it is the story.***GRAPHICS 9/10: Graphically the game is stunning, you're going to fall in love with the Tress FX option for realistic hair. Unfortunately, that requires a lot of memory to run and it is limited to Lara's only. If you haven't a high end machine you're probably going to just turn this option on for 30 seconds, get hypnotized, regain consciousness when your PC fans start screaming, take a screenshot, and then turn it off. My graphic card is an ATI R9-280x with 3GB vRAM and i still get huge fps drop when the camera is close to Lara's head with Tress FX turned on. Fortunately this happens rarely during the game and almost only during cutscenes, it is annoying but at least you won't die because of it. Here is a screenshot with Tress FX onFor what it concerns the environment, the game is settled on a tropical island lost in the Pacific (if I remember correctly) but you're not going to find palmtrees and komodo dragons like in Far Cry 3. You start in a forest, then move to some ruins on a high snowy and windy mountain, later you reach a city built with scrap metal and then go into an ancient japanese tomb. Each area has its own, almost, unique look and that's a good thing in my opinion, this way you won't risk of getting bored because you're exploring something that looks all the same every moment.***GAMEPLAY 7/10: Neither fish nor fowl. There is nothing new abut the gameplay, it is pretty much what you can expect from a third person action/adventure game, but I couldn't stand the fact that the game keeps babysitting you from the beginning until the very end. During combat, for example, you have to take cover, but this requires nothing more than getting near something and let Lara do the rest. There is no crouch command since she crouches atuomatically as soon as enemies are near. This is, in some way, game breaking, because I've learned that as long as she keeps that ""combat stance"" enemies are nearby. However, that is not the worse thing, what is worse is that horrible ""survival instinct"" that you can activate whenever you want, making the screen turn grey scale, with the exception of mission objectives, lootable objects, enemies... well, all the important stuff. These things are highlighted in bright yellow/gold so you know exactly where to go and what to activate. It's really too easy that way, so do yourself a favor, do not ruin your game experience turning it on every 10 steps, forget about it and explore. By doing so I've been able to keep the game experience going on for 25 hours. Speaking of game length, I think the game is more or less 12+ hours if you just rush your way out, exploring is recommended since you'll discover documents that explain what happened on the island during the centuries.One of the positive features of Tomb Rider's gameplay is the quick time events system. I know some people don't like them, but I think they fit nicely in this game. They are used to add pathos in some some sequence and they are succesful in doing that. Since the beginning you have to mash, hold, or quickly tap some keys in order to survive or kill an enemy. ***SOUND 9/10: Sound effects are good and the music ""a la Indiana Jones"" fits perfectly with the game. Characters are fully voiced and even the most useless enemies have dialogues that may be worth listening to, they might say some useful things about what happened to the other characters or refer to something you previously did. I really appreciate that kind of dedication in a game, even though you are fighting enemies that looks the same they at least say something different every time you advance in the story.***STORY 9/10: The story makes the game itself. As I said before, this game is like a movie and if it were one I'd go to the theater to watch it. The narration comes from Lara herself who voices her feelings, her fears, and all her thoughts as you lead her through the game. You will see the evolution of Lara Croft from a simple scared girl to a killing machine. Yes, I know that this might be a rash statement but that's it. In this game Lara might suffer from the Mary Sue condition, but if you think about the old Tomb Raiders there is nothing wrong with her being almost a superhero-ine. Lara Croft has always been super-fit, super-strong and super-intelligent ..... aaaand, yes I have to say it, super-sexy. The only problem with her character is that she is the only round character; all the others, even the antagonist, are just there because the story needs them, but they are almost completely forgettable. The characterization of the ship's crew is just plain bad, pick a stereotype and make it a character... end.TL; DRGreat game, a bit too easy but amazing story 9/10Grab it when is 25€ or less, 50€ is really too much (for almost any game imho)"

And the world is highly detailed, and gorgeous! And thus ends the good part...the game play is ...  limiting.  It is a decidedly linear track, and you do NOT go off plot.  But the real killer for me was the timed control cut scenes.  Go forward, now right, now left now jump.  Now struggle, then kick the face NOW.  You are just along for the ride, but you have to do exactly the correct key combinations at exactly the right time, or your start over.  I was having flashbacks to Dragons Lair back in the 80s!   Not to mention how it breaks the flow when she has been headshotting everyone with flaming arrows the entire game and is suddenly captured because it is needed to advance the plot...So, my vote is a somewhat mixed bag, but I have to say no as it was more disappointing then pleasant.  Perhaps if you get it on an amazing sale, but not full price."

I have been more of a casual gamer in the past (hence the console), and am not good at any kind of FPS scenario, but with this one - I enjoyed the combat, and you can deifnitely approach it in different ways. I picked this up on a steam sale, and PC is so much better.A lot of Square Enix's games become my favourites, their attention to storyline and soundtrack are incredible.  Storylines are the main reason while I keep playing, if it has a crap storyline, then chances are, I'll not continue. I would say it's very much a survival game, whilst uncocvering the badass nature of Lara, her transistion to a Tomb Raider, and uncovering the myserty of the 'cultists' on the islands. I'm one of those people that will read/listen to the history/profiles of games (Assassin's Creed took me forever because I read all the character/building/event profiles) but it's things like that that really make a game for me. It's fantastic in my opinion, great graphics, storyline, a few puzzles and a fantastic start to the Tomb Raider re-boot"

1758,DAVOS,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018110605/,2,,1,24.1,May,"10,",134,5,1,"Quite possibly one of the best games I have played in the last 10 years. Plot & storyline, character development, enagement & immersion, graphics & gameplay, platforming, puzzling, ranged & brawling weapons, very cool weapon mods & gear to interact with the environment. It borrows a little from the TV series Lost (the good bits without dragging on & shark jumping like that show did), but all good games do that e.g. fallout games series hinting at movies like ""Six string samurai"", ""Mad max"", ""last man on earth"", not to mention the call of duty series borrowing from numerous classic movies including Enemy at the gates, Behind enemy lines etc you get my point. All the good stories have been told anyway and are just retellings of greek tragedy in modern settings right? Not to talk up ""Lost"" that much but I digress.I clocked 20 hours or so on this game because quite out of character I really wanted to complete everything so did all the challenges, you might do it faster but why would you want to? Enjoy yourselves, it's a celebration. I remember playing the first Tombraider game on PS1 and it being groundbreaking and all that, but this game is of seriously high caliber. Devs should be proud of this masterpiece. It's a bit visceral in parts, but quite possibly needs to be. I'm not into horror and this game just danced enough around the dark themes as not to give you nightmares but still be on edge and make you care about not dying, even though dying is really of no consequence, as the autosaves are done excellently so as not to force you to replay large swathes of game. Lara is still sexy but they've toned down the ridiculous boobs of the original games and the vacuousness of the movie adaptations is absent, and both ways she is not two dimensional. Lara's growth from wide eyed girl to savage survivor is done carefully and montage-free. Hype about the almost-rape scene are unfounded. The bad guys are bad and she aint no damsel-in-distress stereotype teen-boy fantasy trope on a rope. She mods up some pretty deadly weaponry and by the end there's no army that can take her down. The puzzles are hard enough to be challenging yet easy enough to solve in less than big O time so don't get frustrating.The game has the least number of bugs I've seen in a modern 3D game (a minor object overlapping/clipping type thing in one area and a weird fast-travel-map behaviour were once-off and inconsequential). It seems in modern high graphics intensity games that some studios just can't get that level of QA. Think about any Bethesda game, especially Elder Scrolls Oblivion, although admitedly Skyrim wasn't bad, but I've not seen many games in recent years that haven't had the odd exit to desktop or random reboot/ bluescreen memory dump driver crash but this game just ran perfect. Summary: 10/10 and I don't give that lightly. I played the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game."

It's visually impressive, you can tell they really worked hard to bring the game to life. Lots of amazing cinematic events with great angles. However, they could've probably toned down the crazy camera movement in some parts of the game.I thought the game was great length-wise. Lots of collectibles and side stuff to do in addition to the main mission. The side tomb areas were a let down though. I felt they were too easy, and thus short. The extra story that you get from the collectibles was a nice touch too. I listened to every note and appreciated the extra story they added to the game. I was kind of iffy about the story at the start of the game, but it grew on me as I played. It worked out well.I liked the young Lara and all the other main characters in the game. They could've probably spent more time building up some of the characters though, but this game is all about Lara so thats fine. There's that gradual transformation from innocent to survivor Lara that you see as you play along the story.I have mixed feelings about the multiplayer however. It's pretty simple and solid. I just got to it late, and playing with max level players just isn't fun. Maybe if you had a group of friends to play with in a private game. It's not bad though, I'd probably play more multiplayer if I didnt have a million games to play already.Bottom line, the game is awesome and a great addition to the franchise. I hope they make a part 2 as I'll definitely be buying it."

Mechanics could be smoother though. Here's my first review about it, will update it as I advance with story...To be fair, I bought the game to start with the Tomb Raider franchise, plus can't be that strict with graphics or different things because this game is from 2013, can't wait to finish this one to play the Rise of Tomb Raider, and of course, the Shadow as well.EDIT-1:Wow, the more I play the more interesting it becomes. I'm getting used to the game mechanics so it's much enjoyable now.  The ambient has really cool effects and, specially storm and rainning sounds are excellent. One thing I liked about gameplay is the fact that you are able to pick up and collect different things such as messages, or objects. The thing I liked is, if you had picked up tons of things and you die, when you respawn you don't have to pick all those things up again, because you've already done it, and the game had autosaved as soon as you collected them. This makes the game easier to complete."

How much pain she was able to withstand, being able to carry on, to save herself, and lives of her friends. I guess she did not earn the Tomb Raider title for nothing. Well deserved. Even I said, it was an average experience for me, I would not say I regret playing it. No way. Recommended !Now, the review of the Rise of the Tomb Raider (can´t leave the review, because I played it via family sharing. So I decided to add it here.)And here we go, again. Trying to drink a cup of coffee that I did not like that much. Rise of the Tomb Raider is basically Rinse and repeat of the Tomb Raider from 2015. I was pleasantly introduced to the game, with a great intro and fantastic graphics. But the Wow effect quietly disappeared as I continued to play the main story. Biggest let down its just...It´s the same thing again, only enhanced a bit. I was disappointed to see almost the same Skill tree as before. I thought Lara grew up a bit more and got thicker skin, became a tougher fighter. But no, Lara is weak again, needs to learn how to stretch a bow and hold it longer, again. She forgot how to use her senses in a wilderness, so she has to invest skill points to that, AGAIN! Basically same stuff you already learned in 2015 now vanishes, and you start from scratch. Skill tree got slightly enhanced, with new (unimportant) ones so it should look like a progress. But hey, who are you trying to fool here?I was really upset, yelling Hey! I already played this game a year ago, it just looks fancier right now. The story is something you will not remember, and I even got to the point where I forgot what´s the purpose of this journey. I knew the Himiko queen was in the last one :) In some areas, I did not feel I can even play my way. The ropes were stretched between two points,  but I could not use them. I could not swim longer than 5 seconds underwater, and I was like Stop!! What is this? I found out the reason later ingame. The way Devs wanted me to play it. Meh, since this is not a real open world, but semi-open and linear I would say, I can understand why they did some tricks here and there. But that´s not gonna change the bad taste in my mouth after it. Imagine it ...You have that big jump incoming, you know her hand is going to slip when she grabs that edge, and you know what to do already. Press X button again! (I played on Xbox controller) Was it so hard to mix up the buttons from time to time? Like use X Y A B randomly to give you feeling, you need to press the right one, or you will fall and die? Ugh...Same here for the story, Predictable, and the same template as in 2015. Not gonna spoil the story, so I will shut up now.So, you now know the ugly face of this game, let´s take a look at what this title did good and pretty. And I got to tell ya it´s the graphic! Level design is astonishing! When you crawl through those caves, with great lighting, shadows, shaders, and fancy things that are supposed to shine and make your mouth drop. Yes, it is well done. And I was giving myself a break from the story many times, just to enjoy the surroundings. This world is truly beautiful. You can expect everything here as in the previous one. Lot of challenges to complete, a ton of readings, and recordings to look for. TOMBS to complete, gathering resources, clothes to wear, guns, and ammo to craft. But some upgrades unfortunately felt shallow and dumb tbh. You will find out.Man, a lot of words spoken already. To sum it up. This is not the right sequel to the previous one imho. It definitely trying to look like it, but it´s not. This should be the reboot of the series then. But it´s a beautiful one. It plays well, the locations are beautiful, and even now, I´m still amazed how the game looks. Even in 2020. As before. It´s not my cup of coffee, but I drank it again. Let´s see what taste Shadow of the Tomb Raider brings us. Have a great day and take care!(Played via family sharing)..:: 7/10 ::.."
1779,iriyap,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iriyap/,7,1,0,20.3,May,"2,","1,779",0,1,"is the 9th mainline game in the Tomb Raider series and the most recent ""reboot"" of the franchise.This time around the focus is on cover based third person shooting instead of, you know, the puzzle platforming which the series got famous for. You'll be mowing down waves upon waves of generic faceless bandits while hiding behind a chest high wall. That's the meat of the game. Sure, there's some platforming too, but it's minimal and is mostly automated to the extent that all you have to do is keep holding forward and pressing jump occasionally. The game will do all the rest with cool camera angles and semi-interactive cutscenes.Speaking of cutscenes, the game is chock full of them. They're triggered every other step of your way. You feel like you're finally enjoying the game and then BAM, it takes the control away from you. Only to show you some more ridiculous explosions and everything crumbling apart while Lara miraculously survives at the absolute last second. For the 10th time. There's also a lot of quick time events where you have to mash various buttons during a cutscene so that you don't die and don't have to sit through the stupid thing yet again.The worst of all, the game tries its hardest to appeal to the ""mature gamer"" crowd. There's barely any color anywhere, it's all muted greys everywhere you go. Not only that, the game goes overboard with violence and gore. Right at the start of the game Lara gets impaled on a rusty spike through the stomach. Your very first tutorial prompt is to pull it out. Then she starts bleeding and limping. Whenever you fail some sequence in the game you'll be sure to see a violent death. Lara gets stabbed and impaled through pretty much all of her body. You hear her crying and hyperventilating in every other scene. Is this meant to be torture porn? Same goes for the locations, some feature piles and piles of corpses, guts and innards strewn everywhere, and even literal rivers of blood that Lara gets to take a dip in.As an older fan in my early 30's I can't help but be disappointed with the drastic direction change the series took with this game. The game is so different from everything that came before it that if you replaced Lara Croft with any other character no one would be none the wiser. If you're at all curious about earlier Tomb Raider games I'd heavily recommend  and . Both are much better games and still hold up great today."
1780,Coco,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049036335/,2,,1,37.1,September,"28,",771,1,1,"What an awesome game! I never was a fan of the Lara Croft / Tomb Raider games, but what I read and saw of this game made me buy it when it was on sale. Now that I finished it, I can only say: THIS GAME GOT IT ALL!!!- Superb graphics- Compelling action right from the start- A well made story- Excellent level design- Believable characters- Evolving skills- Improving equipment- Great fights- Challenging riddles- Well balanced difficulty- A main character you quickly emphasize with: The young Lara Croft is natural, sympathetic, athletic, beautiful and... yeah, sexy... without acting cheap or the game accentuating it.Really, it's your own fault if you miss it! For me, this will be one of the few games I'll play twice for sure.Besides all the highlights, there are two things though that are rather negative in my opinion:- Some of the places are truely disgusting. I could handle it, but in my eyes it was a bit over the line and I can imagine that sensitive people may have a problem with it.- The BIG MINUS of this game: The camera bob! The game features the shaking camera you may have seen in a couple of recent movies already. It's not only in the cutscenes, but also in the game itself. For example when Lara runs in a straight line and you see her from 3rd person view, the camera shakes as if you were in a boat on a windy lake. Though (according to the forums) most people seem to be unaffected, there are others (like me) who can't play the game for long,  or it will make them throw over. I still can't understand why the developers didn't make it optional... It's in the game and the player has to deal with it.Nevertheless, even though the camera was annoying, the game was very worth playing it and I really highly recommend to get it as soon as possible!"

The mandatory crafting and level up system kind of feels out of place beyond the initial stage of setting up Lara's basic survival skills and equipment. By the end of the game you're crafting magazine fed auto shotguns that fire grenades and it is kind of jarring departure from the beginning where you'll use a deer antler and hide to make a makeshift climbing pickaxe or a bow. I kind of wish they would've settled down to just basic weapons without customisation especially since the customisation is entirely linear and straight up upgrades rather than optional sidegrades. I understand the constant progression helps keep things fresh. This is the most mature and grittiest Tomb Raider, which I feel is refreshing since I was never too keen on the atlantean gods and asgard god aliens. A lot of gruesome deaths. Enemy variety is unfortunately a bit limited because of this but near the end of the game you'll have a bit more refreshing encounters. No big monster bosses unfortunately. Biggest criticism I had with the game is the lack of Croft Manor and Lara not banging out with two pistols. Gurl when u gonna learn?"

To me, 65% of it just boils down to: ""Lara is a klutz and Roth is the only good character."" I felt like it really only picked up the pace towards the end. Throughout my whole time playing, one question lingered in my mind ""People actually loved this s***?""I swear I'm not trying to sound like some contrarian, I just don't understand what people saw in this. If I knew beforehand what I was gonna get myself into, I think I would've just booted up my PS4 and started Uncharted instead.I hope I'll find Rise and Shadow to be better."

Gorgeous graphics, immersive level design and setting, tons of collectibles, a very well designed learning curve and challenging difficulty levels, amazing sound effects and soundtrack, great voice work and wonderful art all around. The only minuses - multiplayer isn't really fun, and by now there aren't many people to play with anyway + the overall story is, of course, very Lara Croft-ish. But the rich world and many hidden collectibles help out with that, and personally I wasn't really bothered by it that much, even though the outcome was quite predictable. Note: it does borrow a few things from Uncharted, yes, but then again Naughty Dog surely borrowed a lot from the original TR series, so it's all good in the end. Tomb Raider is a different experience than stepping into the shoes of Nathan Drake, and comparisons should be made with care. Overall I can't praise this enough. If you haven't explored the origin story of Lara Croft, there's no excuse not to do so!"

1800,Kevin_and_Other_Drugs,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199018011191/,3,,1,16.3,January,29,172,0,1,"I've never seen anything as resistant to damage as Lara Croft's outfit. She gets burnt, bitten, stabbed, shot, she falls, swims, fights and explodes but it somehow remains mostly in tact.The Story:Lara Croft is pursuing the work of her father. She's aboard a ship with a small group of people documenting the search for the long forgotten empire of Yamatai. She quickly deciphers the location of the island but gets caught in the curse of the island that maroons the ship and her passengers. They're all separated, and Lara slowly uncovers the mystery that the treasure she was so desperately searching for, could be the key to her's, and everyone else's, destruction. The Gameplay:The game is played from a 3rd-person perspective and has you either involved in gunfights, or traversing the interesting locations of the game. There are various collectables in the game, and the locations are varied and exciting to explore. Each sub-area is filled with a challenge, a possible puzzle tomb outside the main story and the aforementioned collectibles. These puzzles are great and can sometimes be brain teasers, but inversely can also be just as simplistic once you look at the big picture. There is a surprising amount of verticality in this game as you're often required to climb or jump to ledges which adds awesome levels of exploration and cinematic visuals. 2013's Tomb Raider is definitely a cinematic title, similar to PlayStation's Uncharted series. That's not a bad thing per se, but it should be noted so that potential players who are turned off by those types of games are aware. Some pros:- Fantastic exploration and level/world design- Great story (Part 1 of 3)- Good sound design and voice acting- Impressive visuals- Good length game- Not overly grindy to 100%- Often on sale for cheapSome Cons: - Little enemy variance - Grindy multiplayer achievements- Dead multiplayer so you'll need a crewConclusion:Tomb Raider serves as a great introduction for newer players to the universe of Lara Croft as well as the first part of her origin story. It's a wonderful game with very little faults that I recommend to anyone, especially with its frequent sales. 9/10, will raid again :D"

Shipwrecked, near-drowned, knocked unconscious, wakes up hanging upside down, tries to escape and gets pierced by a rod through her stomach. Its impossible not to FEEL for her. The Gameplay is so smooth, I cannot figure out when its a cut-scene and when I'm controlling the character. For a 2013 game, the gameplay and graphics is as good as any game today.The voice acting is done perfectly for this origin story. Lara's voice is soft and shows her to be a simple girl caught in terrible circumstances. And over the course of the story, she develops confidence and at turns into the badass Lara Croft that we've seen in previous games. Especially notable is the scene with the dual-guns that indicate her transformation.I play my games on Easy mode and was able to finish this while dying only a few times. I didn't encounter any bugs.The Multiplayer is hard because other people are either Level 60 or Level 1 so for a newbie you get killed again and again. Also, there aren't many people playing Multiplayer as this game is quite old. But the Singleplayer more than makes up for this.I wasn't sure whether to buy this game. Because I don't like wolves, I don't like playing in a night scene, and I don't like using bows. Thankfully, using the bow was fairly simple and the wolves pestered me only twice and the game alternates between night and day over the levels. This game has been a pleasant surprise. Enough that I will also play the sequels.If you are undecided about buying this, just look at the fact that the Reviews tag this game as 'Overwhelmingly Positive'. That should be enough for anyone to blindly grab this game.Lara may cry and say, ""I hate Tombs.""But I'll laugh and say, ""I love Tomb Raider."""

1838,Torllay,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Torllay/,2,,1,21.3,January,"2,",452,0,1,"As a two-decade-long fan of Tomb Raider, since I was a kid, I waited eagerly and played the rebooted trilogy when they came out. Completed all they had to offer, and played through them again in the last two weeks. So finally, with the knowledge of how these games are in their full picture, and with a refreshed memory of their story and mechanics, I’ll try to do an objective complete review, with hindsight. A perspective of the new trilogy of Tomb Raider. I’ll try to keep it short.This game has a special place in my heart. It was the reboot of a series I loved deeply, and they were going for a bold new style. A completely different game. At first, I thought it was more like Uncharted, but I’d say it also went for some The Last of Us, because while it is about “finding tombs and treasures”, Uncharted is more light-hearted, while this new reboot had much more survival elements to it.The player has to live with Lara all the trauma she has to endure in her journey, basically as a teenager, who is looking for the lost kingdom of Yamatai. And all the game is going to take the stage in it. The story is top-notch, and the gameplay is very solid as well. It aged gracefully since the gameplay was already a bit ahead of its time, and also thanks to some graphic options like the hair effects – TressFX – which still today holds up amazingly.It is a product of its time, obviously, and it was a smaller project. But it’s a great solid start, and it puts the foundations of something great. It features the tool-kit Lara is gonna use in the whole trilogy, and makes great use of it, in the exploration and tomb puzzles. The game allows Lara to use different weapons, having the bow being the main one, especially during exploration. It has weapon upgrades and a simple skill tree, which helps Lara become even stronger during the journey!It’s almost Metroid-like when it comes to progression, having areas inaccessible until a new tool is obtained, which opens crazy shortcuts at times, and encourages replayability and exploration.It’s not a long game, but just like other games of the genre, it features some small treasures around the maps, challenges, diaries with lore in it, and some optional tombs as side content and multiplayer?. This game, as I said, it’s a product of its time. Starting with the bow as the main weapon –  – and finishing with a multiplayer mode in a single-player game, which was very common at the time. But having played some of that too, I can say that it’s not for everyone, but the choice it’s always good to have, especially with such a great combat system! When it comes to DLCs this game doesn’t have much to offer in my opinion. I know that the game is so cheap right now, with all the DLCs it’s a few cents more, but I still wanna talk about what they offer, cause they used to cost much more.I think the only DLC worth buying and playing is , which as the name suggests it’s a new tomb for the game. The rest of the DLCs are either skins for Lara, multiplayer stuff, or...abilities. This is one of the things I really don’t like about the DLCs: they didn’t make NEW abilities available to the player, they just sold them to you for real money, and I honestly despise it. This game is worth it, especially if you like the genre. It’s a great start for the series, has a great story and some optional content for those who want to stick around."

The story was fairly intriguing, I was always curious to see what was gonna happen next. Gameplay gets better the more you progress, as you gain new skills (only thing I really miss from Rise but can't be acquired in this game was sprinting, that's multiplayer only x_x), you will eventually get some skills that will help you clear (100%) areas easier, thus making it easier on yourself if you decide to backtrack a little every now and then to get extra salvage or xp (or you can just do that once you've finished the game).I really liked what they did with the main theme (A Survivor Is Born), the way it sounds and the way they used it (playing it in different parts of the game, sometimes slower and quieter, etc) kinda reminds me of the older TR games, it makes you grow feelings for it.I tried multiplayer with a friend and it was actually quite fun! Sadly when we played with randoms, you could tell they were all good players using sub accounts that they had just created because the game was free :/It's really cool that this game also runs on Linux, and it's overall well optimized! Worth buying.Oh, and that little easter egg after finding all GPS caches was a nice touch :p"

Well II thought the game was fun for the most part, it has fun gameplay when it comes to the parkour and combat. However, I thought the controls were a bit restrictive and flimsy, I'd often miss a jump because the game didn't register the appropriate direction I was aiming for. The story is fine, I don't really care for about 70% of the characters, it wasn't that engaging and the backstory didn't make me feel any different for the characters. I found the soundtrack to be forgettable but it does add weight to parts of the game. The set pieces are also a highlight. It's a fine game but nothing special."
1906,Blue-Sh0c,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Blue-Sh0c/,2,,1,18.8,February,"11,",191,0,1,"I buy this game for 3$ at summer sale ....amazing. Tomb Raider is compellingly playable. Put a controller or a keyboard in your hands, and you can spend hours exploring. This game is smooth in every sense.- The terrain is enticing, and I had an almost addictive need to complete each area, which I’ve never really experienced before, not even in the wonderful Arkham Asylum and Assassin’s Creed series. I liked this world a lot (well, the non-gory bits, anyway).- Having access to the ropes that are liberally scattered throughout Tomb Raider makes you want to go back to earlier parts of the game to find those items you know are missing from your map completion list. You’ll feel the same way about boarded-up areas when you get your shotgun, which aggressively clears your way for you.- Crystal Dynamics’ gotcher graphics right here. Although it’s not as gloriously beautiful as parts of Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception, it’s still quite spectacular to look at.- Lara was awesome. More about her character here.- I’ve encountered two very minor glitches that fixed themselves with the same reboot. In other words, Tomb Raider was 99.99% bug-free.WHAT I DIDN’T LIKE- My biggest complaint about Tomb Raider: As I said in the first section, There were so many cutscenes and moments where I couldn’t use my controller that at one point, it seemed as if the game were playing itself. In that regard, gameplay was sometimes too simplistic.- Quick Time Events pervade the gamescape, and some are crazy-making. Getting impaled on a tree happened again and again because I couldn’t work my way past a particular QTE alive. If my husband hadn’t been there to take the controller, I would be killing Lara right now.- There are three save slots. Three. That and the QTEs, say “console game” so loudly that Gabe Newell can hear it all the way in Bellevue.- It was much more violent than I had anticipated. I fully agree with the ESRB’s 17+ rating.HINTS- I put my “trait points” into skills that gave me bonuses to my experience. That way, I could unlock the other abilities sooner. I suggest you do the same, because it worked for me.- Don’t waste time trying to figure out how to use the ropes. When you get the rope arrow, all will be clear. That also applies to salvage that seems out of reach; chances are you need the rope or the shotgun to open up the barbed-wire barriers.- You can retrieve salvage from hanging nets by lighting them on fire. Initially you’ll need to find a fire source to light your torch, but you’ll eventually get both a lighter and flaming arrows.- Buy the Tier 2 Survivor skill, Orienteering, as soon as you can. It lets you see collectibles through other objects, like walls, and is almost as good as having a treasure map: If you stand and rotate while in instinct mode, all the collectibles in range will be added to your map. Awesome.OVERALLWith more action, and fewer and simplified puzzles and a less savvy Lara, this game may seem to die-hard fans like a watered-down version of the old school Tomb Raider we all know and love—and to some extent, it is. But with exploration, a plot that flows, a fun, playable experience, and a likeable protagonist, it’s easy to see that it’s one of the best action/adventure games of 2013 and a terrific reboot of the series. I’m looking forward to re-meeting Lara in the future.I’m giving this game 9 out of 10.You can follow me on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and here at Forbes.Get the best of Forbes to your inbox with the latest insights from experts across the globe.Carol PinchefskyAn alumna of Clarion West Writer’s Workshop for science fiction and fantasy, I’ve written for markets like The New York Times and Time Out New York.

1909,Nuit Calme,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuitcalme/,3,,1,59.7,December,"29,",169,0,1,"First, a small digression about the bare minimum of respect for other cultures and languages that the developers are unfortunately lacking. I have nothing against Russian villains in games or movies, it's a stereotype many of us have grown completely used to over the years and it's like a classic already, but if you decide to include one in your story, hire a decent voice actor  Don't give a clueless Canadian guy some text written in Russian that he has to study for 10 minutes before you hastily record the lines; this is not how it's supposed to be done, Square Enix, you're a big studio and you can do better than that. We live in the glorious epoch of the Internet — you can go to any freelance website and get real Russians to read your text for a grand total of five bucks; they won't make dumb grammar mistakes and butcher the pronunciation to the point where I can't even seriously follow the cutscene anymore. Such a stupid oversight – you've got people from Russia buying your games, too, and we'd rather not hear our language being raped like that. Thanks.Great news! Lara is not so glaringly objectified anymore — not sporting a D cup,  no unreasonably open cleavage (ignore the opening cutscene), her bum is not accentuated at all; for the most part our rookie adventurer is clad in normal, practical clothing, except for that episode when she spends nearly an hour high up the mountains during a blizzard wearing only her camisole and a pair of trousers, not even wincing from the cold — unbelievable! She could have borrowed a jacket from at least one guy she murdered on her way, and there were  to choose from. This is a step in the right direction; it makes you empathise with her struggles, which, by the way, will be depicted in utmost detail. I mean it; I have never seen a fragile human body endure so much pain and suffering. On the whole, Lara Croft is now a person, not some doll with her butt jumping out of the skin-tight shorts while she's doing all the climbing stuff and acting like it's nothing. She is actually scared of climbing without any safety gear now, as almost any sensible person would, with or without extensive training and experience. The gameplay is not as challenging as it used to be in all previous iterations. It feels like it is holding your hand with ""survival instincts"" which point where you need to go and highlight all collectibles; if you level up enough, those collectibles will be visible through walls, greatly facilitating the search. Despite the intricate design of many levels, it is virtually impossible to get lost. The game tells a decent story, has awesome soundtrack, is more mature and enjoyable overall. I also can't stress enough how gorgeous the main menu is, and Lara's British accent is absolutely marvellous, music to my ears. The scenes where everything is crumbling apart are totally epic. The only snag though (not counting the complete and utter disregard for Russian) are those sequences where Lara is sliding down and has to avoid obstacles — these are far too numerous, feel clunky and become repetitive quite early on.  beware of this game. There is this stupid easily missable achievement that will require replaying the entire story once again in order to get it. All multiplayer achievements were obviously designed to be unlocked when the servers are chock-full of players, which used to be the case, but, well... not anymore. You'll need to search for a friend online if you want to get those and do the good old  Yeah, I know..."

Its everything I could have asked from a game such as this and even more. Story line is somewhat linear (You have little to no impact on the ending) but nonetheless one of the best stories. I got it on sale I believe for $10 and its worth at least $20.

It has its own fundamentals that shine within the characters and gameplay and it is truly in depth, the voice acting is sometimes lacklustre but there are peak moments where they excel, the cinematic scenes are very well put together making you feel very immersed. Overall the game is a bargain at its current price the gameplay is smooth and well optimised and i was averaging 160fps on a 1060 with High settings throughout the whole playthrough. I generally wish I didn’t hold back on this series as I was truly shell shocked by how immersive this game is so if you were like me and thought stupidly with thinking that this was a clone of the Uncharted series I highly suggest you give this game a try after all this game isn’t locked at 30fps like Uncharted so its immediately performing better with how the gameplay is going to feel and look."

Add to it that you have a map which will eventually get every collectable item marked on it so you'll have no problem collecting everything either.Despite that though, it's absolutely a good game."

1958,ReV,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198182445101/,2,,1,68.6,May,"6,",33,0,1,"Lara Croft sets sail with her friends on her first expedition, seeking to find the ancient kingdom of Yamatai. The ship is unexpectedly struck by a violent storm, and amidst the chaos, Lara is left stranded alone on the island. With all the dangers of the wild, Lara must find a way to brave the harsh elements, along with the seemingly mystical phenomena surrounding the island.To survive, Lara will have to become the tomb raider.Tomb Raider is a well-rounded game with lots of collectibles and side content. The story is excellent, but I felt that that the gameplay was never able to build tension to a level that matched what was occurring on-screen. This could be because Tomb Raider is fairly easy in general, but also because the game throws everything at you right from the start, and never really ""ups the ante"" gameplay-wise.For example, there are constant scares early in the game that will immediately keep you on edge. Planks will break, and rock faces will collapse,  when Lara decides to use them. When this happens, you will be forced to learn how to handle these perilous situations on-the-fly.As a result of this, you quickly start to anticipate the bad luck that will always follow Lara, and it will no longer surprise you later on. I personally felt that this realisation made the climactic moments of the game feel a little predictable, and even comical at times.Nevertheless, Tomb Raider is an origin story that is amazing, inspiring, and something that is worth experiencing."

1979,Rakun,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakun94/,2,1,1,11.3,December,"16,",314,0,1,"It is an okay game. Definitely not worthy of bearing the overwhelmingly positive title, though. I was kind of fooled by that. Do not get me wrong, it is not a bad game at all. Maybe the name Lara Croft deserve ""Very Positive"" but i honestly think the game is over-rated. I was pretty excited first 20 or 30 minutes into the game, but i lost interest so quickly while trying  to locate collectibles. Because they do not really offer much and other than that, the game has only a boring story with not so interesting characters. They really sound kind of forced, the game tries to give you emotions, but i had felt a lot, lot more of it when i first played Mass Effect 1 for example with worse graphics and technology.The fun part for me was to headshot enemies with my bow and other various type of ballistic weapons. So the combat part of the game was quite satisfying with upgradable weapons. I am sure you will enjoy that, too.Raiding tombs, however, was sort of uhm... frustrating? The puzzles in tombs were not challenging enough, they were very easy to solve, and there were no physical challenges (enemies, traps, difficult to make jumps) either. And all that frustration for just a handful of scrap.Graphics and optimization quite good, i did not have any performance issues other than looking at certain places in certain tombs or caves.Gameplaywise, the gameplay camera stays mostly loyal to older games camera angles except this game is in 3rd person view mode and you get the feeling you still are playing a tomb raider game. There are some quick time events, but they are at a normal amount you do not feel overwhelmed by them. And often you can choose how you want to approach a combat situation, gunz blazing or sneaky peaky like?I, personally just had to rush the story after finding out there really is not much the game has to offer me, other than okay fun.I might give it a 7/10"

Seriously, the atmoshpere, the storytelling, the characters, music, environment, and much more, all these aspects create something so entertaining, cinematic, so gripping and compelling, that after 2-3 hours into the game you find within urself an urge to progress and complete the game you can hardly resist. Personally for me the combat was a bit too simplistic (yet still much satisfying and rewarding) as I would love some more challenge at particular areas, though I understand with my background in shooters there's barely a singleplayer shooter game that represents any challenge for me whatsoever, so don't take this ""shortfall"" too seriously, especially given the fact that everything besides combat is outright fantastic.

I took so many screenshots while playing this game! The story kept me wanting to soldier through the few bits I found frustrating and played out through cut scenes, QTEs and found objects/books resulting what I found to be thoroughly enjoyable gameplay.

I previously beat this game on PS3 back when it came out but was pretty indifferent about it. Maybe it was the extra spit and polish of the PC version or the buttery smooth frame rate, but I enjoyed this a hell of a lot more the second time round on my personal computer. Awesome stuff from a series that was on it's last legs years before."

2019,Rhizzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/donrade/,2,,1,34.0,August,"12,",726,0,1,"Tomb Raider is one of my favourite video game franchises. A perfect blend of action and adventure has followed this franchise since its inception - and now you can add storytelling and amazing graphics to the list. The 2013 reboot is exactly what was needed for the series. The story starts off pretty casual but ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan very quickly. The game managed to very nicely show Lara’s transformation from regular explorer to badass action star we all know. The only thing I disliked about this game is how easy the Secret Tombs and general platforming was. The Secret Tombs should be much harder to figure out, completing them gave me no satisfaction of figuring out a puzzle. But all in all Tomb Raider is a very solid experience, I recommend it for any fan of the action/adventure/movielike genre."

After quite amount of time, I finally came up with Tomb Raider. I saw reviews, my friends urged me to play, but I never actually bothered to try it out.That was one of the best possible decisions I could have made at the moment. After 30 minutes of gameplay, I was completely immersed in the story. I wasn't the greatest narrative in the history of gaming, but there were times when the plot took such an unexpected turn that I was honsetly surprised. The characters are very well written, Alex the Nerd will be my all time favourite (even tho he got like, 5 minutes of screen time). Even Reyes, who was pain in the ass throughout most of the game, was great as a character and added much to the emotional side of the game.The graphics are absolutely stunning, the animation is flawless. The world SE created is absolutely breathtaking. After I beat the main story, I usually don't come back even if I didn't finish all locations. I simply forget about the game, as the only thing that kept me interested ended.But in Tomb Raider, it was completely different. If you didn't go back after beating the main plot, do it. Just do it. It's incredible. My favourite location is the Coastal Forrest. When I came back, I was amazed at how...silent and peaceful it was. The deers and rabbits were running around, there weren't any shady russians (no offence to russians in general, not all of you are shady ;P) that tried to kill me hiding at every corner. The forrest was living on it's own and it was truly an amazing experience to be there. As to flaws, I didn't like the 'console approach' to gameplay SE took, like when enemies were nearby you knew because Lara had already her gun in hands, crouching behind nearby obstacle. I understand that they were trying to aim the game at less experienced players, but it would have been nice if we had the option to turn this 'help' off. I really, really recommend this game, whether you are into RPG-style games, uncharted-style games or you simply enjoy beautiful views, it is game for you. Hell, even if you hate all the genres I mentioned, play Tomb Raider and you will learn to love them."
2023,WaterColour,https://steamcommunity.com/id/WaterSmoker/,2,,1,26.3,June,"13,",92,1,1,"After watching the entire uncharted 4 gameplay on youtube (because i don't own a PS4), i decided I needed a game of the genre. I've always been a fan on Tomb raider and I played a few games before on Ps2 and the older PC versions, and since i remember the hype it was back on 2013 because of the legendary graphics and amazing game (back in the day of course), I decided to buy both Tomb raider games, 2013 and 2016. I finished the 2013 one and I must say, what a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unbelievable game. Just legendary in almost every aspect. To all uncharted fanboys, this is going to hurt, but I was so impressed at the level desing in this game (not with the graphics of course) that I looked back to the gameplay I saw from uncharted was child's play. Uncharted made everything look so obvious while in tomb raider, although it was equaly obvious, there was more depth to it, and a little bit more thinking into where should you go now.The only thing it fails to deliver it's the story. Although the story is great I think it should've been presented in another way. They give us to little time with other charaters to actually make a conection or even care for them. Semi-Spoiler alert- There is a guy that will die about halfway into the game and it supposedly is someone important to lara and we should at least care a little for is death, but guess what, I can't even remember is name, good thing though, you would be mad after reading this if I spoiled it to you.Worth every penny, no questions asked"

This is actually the first Lara Croft game I've ever played and I love it. Gameplay is smooth. Got these exploding arrows (""stealth"") and different guns which makes the game fun and fast paced. The enviroment is well designed and looks splendid. I just love how the game played out and made it a nice relaxing action game with an understandable story. There are a ton of save points, making it an easy game to play in small bites. There are a few bugs that I encountered , like a certain sequence getting repeated again and again, but they weren't extremely serious and could be fixed with a simple restart. A great game world to just explore in. I would definitely play again sometime in the future."

As Lara said herself, killing terrified her, it was scarily easy to do.Some silly quicktime events, reminescent of Tombraider2 and beyound where more dramatic scenes needed to be time correctly. So same old same old to be honest. A valiant and brilliantly executed reboot to this beloved franchise."

I did get satisfaction though in the end. HahaAaaaaaaaaand now for the not so great stuff. When I played it the first time the game glitched out on me in a cut scene causing me to have to restart the whole game over again, luckily I was only 30% done.That being said, back the crap up out of your game by switching save files. (I really need to get into that habit)I also had some really funny glitches happen, where a flashlight was stuck floating in the air, which was actually pretty hilarious, and a few other glitchy this but nothing game breaking.My final opinion would be definitely to play this game, maybe just not %100 it, as that makes the game a lot longer and really you won't be clueless even if you don't pick up the Journals and whatnot.Now I'm off to play some of the DLC till the new one is out! :D"

Great storyline, great graphics, great gameplay, and lots of action and puzzles in the game! They've transformed Lara from a Sex Symbol* to an Icon! Crystal has no longer tried to make Lara's boobs as large as possible, instead they are focusing on what she REALLY is! A survivor, an archaeologist, a sweet and kind character on the outside but when needed she can be a real hardened character! Aside from Lara, the new set of characters since Tomb Rader Underworld is definitly a big change! They all have their own personalities and attitudes to match the game perfectly for being stranded on an island! The Optional Tombs in my opinion are a great add-on but I wish some of them were a bit longer. Especially the DLC one! You are paying $3.99 for it and it's this short segment that is also glitched! Yes, you heard me right, if you don't do a certain part right, it'll glitch the game and you have to go back to your last campfire save (you can't do the checkpoint save as the game saves the glitched state.) I know the Multiplayer has gotten a lot of criticism, but it actually isn't half bad! While it's not like Call of Duty or Left 4 Dead type of Multiplayer, you can definitly have some fun with the four modes they have! However in order to really get the experience, you need to buy the DLC Maps! I own all of them and they are all good! And surprisingly it's still fairly active! You'll find quite a few people online! While Tomb Raider isn't as good as the Classics in my opinion, it's definitly a great title and is in one of my top favorite games!*This comment has been given by a lot of Tomb Raider fans and in articles comparing Tomb Raider 2013 and the Classics. I personally agree with it! If you haven't played the classics and don't know what I mean, I'd recommend doing a Google search on some of the classic Tomb Raider's and you'll see what I mean..."

The hyperealistic atmosphere is really immersive.

If you're looking for blood, there's some really zombie/l4d2 elements to this game, so if you're psychopathic, you can really relate. Or, be revolted and driven to fear and survival. Either way, it is stunningAs a fan of good narratives; this game is not disappointing.

And don't go judging Father Mathias too harshly - after all, survival is for the fittestIf you're a perfectionist, this game will grate on your nerves slightly, with the multitude of collectible you can easily miss without guides. However, there are multiple opportunites to complete the challenges or collect with backtrackingIf you suffer lags, and I mean the fps drops, I found lowering resolution to help, but otherwise, wait it out. The lags, as compared to other games i've played like AC series, to be comparitively and noticibly faster - so that's a plusCombat is its own dimension; not quite versatile or flexible, but each combat situation you're in increases in difficulty, forcing you to up your game. Stealth and efficiency is rewarded - as it should be if you're fighting to survive as a young green woman who only embarked on this journey just to visit a tomb and not struggle to live. I suppose the combat play immerses you into Lara - being a small, slender and physically weaker female - and you HAVE to approach situations carefully. Unless you want to fight - which ups the ante.

The story had me hooked from the get-go and I was excited to find out what challenges lay in the next tomb, crashing ship or storm would bring next! There is a variety of weapons to dispose of your foe with, ranging from bows to shotguns,pistols and assault rifles. Even more of the back the back story can be uncovered by finding any of the hundreds of collectible items such as a diary,some abandoned dog tags or even a 1000 year old relic! The story and atmosphere in this game are both wonderfully beautiful, suspenseful and terrifying! The environments are rich in color and filled with  small details that just displays how the developers created and paid attention to even the smallest detail. Not to even mention how gorgeous this game looks. Be warned, if you don't have a powerful rig it will be difficult to run this game in its prettiest form. This was an excellent game and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great puzzle/shooter!"

It's a barrage of qtes mixed with Lara screaming in pain or sounding like she's having an orgasm (which prompted my neighbour to ask which porn I was watching and why was it so loud). However, hang in there. The game afterwards is a lot better, when the game lets you play it. When not exploring dungeons and doing puzzles, you're half stuck in cutscenes where you'll have to suffer through awful dialogue and half playing whack-a-mole in the tedious gunfights that occur every 10-20 minutes. Boss battles are also a let down, there's not much variety in them.I did start to warm to the plot as the story progressed, but it's nothing to write home about. The graphics are beautiful in my opinion, I especially liked TressFX althought it's stupid how only Lara gets proper hair and everyone else has the standard glued to head hair. However I feel they should implement TressFX into more games.Overall, despite my review containing a lot of negativity, I'd reccomend this game. It's kind of like a poor mans Uncharted. I'm just hoping they address a lot of the problems in the next game cause I'm looking forward to playing it."

2099,Balakiel ~Sensual Birdfeed~,https://steamcommunity.com/id/balakiel/,2,,1,13.8,December,"29,","1,644",0,1,"Tomb Raider is, confusingly, a prequel to the Tomb Raider franchise.  It differentiates itself from its property of polygonal boob simulators by being the first hair simulator in the series.The campaign is a touching story of a young girl being dealt every short straw that life has to offer, and eventually overcoming her trials and becoming a mass murdering psychopath.The gameplay takes a little bit from every action adventure game and does them all pretty well, with the exception of terrible AI and mandatory quick time events that occur with no warning and whose only penalty is setting you back five seconds every time they happen.  There's enough in the maps to justify wandering around and those are honestly the times I have the most fun with it.As far as a survival game this has very little to offer.  There's ammunition everywhere and the AI is a little too dense to cause any legitimate threat.  Hunting animals becomes obsolete pretty quickly as experience and resources are handed to you from everything.  As far as I can tell there aren't any context sensitive materials and I upgrade just fine when I fight back after being attacked.There are times where I actually kind of care about the character, which is also a first for the series since up until this point Lara Croft has had the personality of cardboard with a couple watermelons stapled onto it.Best game I've played in the series hands down.  It surprised me a lot."

It has amazing graphics and really solid gameplay made up with a good mix of puzzles, platforming and shooting. The level/world design is great, and the platforming is very fluid, even the quicktime events dont suck too much.This game actually reminds me a lot of ""Uncharted"" (although maybe Uncharted took elements from old Tomb Raider games), as the storyline is quite linear and you platform, solve (easy) puzzles, and shoot a lot.  The game looks great and is very cinematic. The story is ok, but it's certainly not one with a ton of character development, and therefore you don't get overly attached to the characters in it.  However it is a Lara Croft origin story and I really like where they went with it.It's not one I would put on the ""everyone has to play this"" list, but if someone wants a good 10-15 hour action-packed, story-driven adventure game I would definitely recommend it."

I played it long enough to beat it, so it's got that going for it.PROS: there are graphics and such. things look nice and move in a pleasing way. Shooting people in the face with a grenade tied to an arrow gives me a warm feeling. CONS: The story is garbage. Tries so very hard to be ""realistic"" that the supernatural stuff looks stupid. Like a really bad movie directed by 8th graders. Lara never really does smart things, and gets her friends killed. She is like ""I'm a strong female character"" and I'm like ""maybe you should take responsibility for getting your friends trapped on an island and then trying to manipulate them while they get shot up by cult members"". There are a bunch of questions the game itself raises and then never answers. But hey apparently you can mod a shotgun into a flamethrower using sticks, so it's not all bad."

One of the good things this game did was hide the puzzles/tombs.

2129,kat cats,https://steamcommunity.com/id/katcatcatkat/,2,,1,30.1,July,"12,","4,320",0,1,"A surprising reboot to the Tomb Raider franchise, it manages to combine free form action adventure gameplay with a level of control that plenty of other games could look to for advice. Yeah, it's not as puzzle heavy or ""tomb raiding"" heavy as the past games have been, but it's a step in the right direction to breathe life in the series.While you're not left to explore the island freely from the start, it's not an entirely linear experience. The game gates certain areas dependent on the gear you have at the time, but even with these gates, most areas you travel to have a bit of exploring that can be done for collectibles (which provide XP for you to level up and obtain new abilities), salvage (used to upgrade gear), and optional tombs (puzzle-light areas with rewards at the end; if you've played any of the games in the AC series, they're very similar to the optional areas in that).Combat follows the same kind of philosophy (in the larger encounters, at least). In the smaller engagements you're usually left to take out one enemy silently if you choose, while the remaining two will be alerted regardless. The larger ones, however, allow you to scurry around the environment and take the enemies out from multiple angles.Lackluster multiplayer and some questionable effort put into Lara's death sequences aside, it's a great retelling of a series that's been around for so long. Well worth your time and money."

2137,MrTRiKs,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrTRiKsGaming/,2,,1,5.8,June,"30,",149,0,1,"Tomb Raider may be one of the few games that I've bought where my expectations were not only met but gone above by the game's overall design, gameplay, story, and environmental interaction. This game is hands down a worthy game to add to your game collection if you enjoy action but want something that is a bit more simplier.Design:The graphics are worthy to take note, and though I don't want to focus to much on them as I don't feel graphics are what make the game...these made me stop in my tracks constantly. My computer that I use for gaming was able to play the game on Ultra settings, I tried the game at ""High"" and ""MEdium"" to see how much of a difference there was in the overall designif your computer wasn't able to go all the way.  Even on ""Medium"" settings the game looked fantastic and if you are a person who believes graphics are a selling point than I think this game did a very good job at making sure that it looks surreal while maintaining a workable computer on a decent computer.That is all I wanted to say about graphics, for the main point in terms of design is just the overall look and feel of the game.  The beggining intro really gives the game that ""movie"" appearance and it definitely reminded me of the older ""Indiana Jones"" movies before they got ruined...by that awkard one (aliens...)I could tell that a lot fo detail was put in the game, obviously cutscenes are where the developers go nuts to really get that ""cinematics"" feel that the user experiences. The game has a very grungy look to it and yet when you find a new area the game really opens you up to the beauty of the landscape, but for the most part you really feel that this island looks like something out of King Kong with the level of detail to the ruins, people, and the occasional tomb raider/indiana jones escape from rolling ball type of ordeal.Overall for Design: 9/10Gameplay:Gameplay is pretty mucha  breeze with this one.  THerer are not very many controlls and Lara is somewat limited in what acrobat feats you can do.  Its mainly that if ther is a specific obstacle or feature running or jumping towards it and holding ""E"" will activate that obstacles's ""siugnature move"" I guess if you want to call it that.  If you like games where its straightforwardlike this then you are in no danbger of learning 30+ buttons or 50+ combos. The game is really as simple as it gets.I played the game both using the keyboard on my computer and my Xbox 360 and PS3 controller.  Worked like a charm, game responds well with a controller and I almost redcommend using a controller just for the comfort and muscle memory that the controller offers over the keyboard.  There is some hiccups though that the game is lacking. I found that Lara does not have a ""stealth"" more or walking mode and a running mode seperate from each other. The reason I wanted this was that if you had to use stealth or were appraoching the ""bad guys"" you didn't go runnin in there like a teenage girl at a Justin Bieber concert. For this reason I felt the game lost just a bit of realism, as it would make more sense to walk or have a stealth mode.  Now I understand there is the use of the ""shift button"" to crouch behind objects and roll/evade enemies, and...its got a lot of things mappde to it.  Though having a one button do all your evading and your crouching just seems a bit sillyand counter-intuitive when it comes to be actually useful.  Most of the time I didn't use the evade button at all as it would just put me awkard position and I really wished that I could ""crouch-walk""???? across areas that were heavy in enemies instead of being limited to only using that ability when there is a wall off to my side.Overall for Gameplay: 8/10Story:What can I say about the story...its Tomb Raider and its Lara Croft (hmmm sexy!!).  Essentially the game is the story of how Lara Croft becomes the badass/sexy version Lara Croft that we all come to know and love.  The game is pretty fastpaced but still uses the open world aspect so even though the story is somewhat limited you can take your time and enjoy the sceneryand collect all the relics, documents, and hidden tombs...BUT...back to the story.  I won't say very much on this subject as I don't want to ruin any spoilers for you gents and ladies but if have played the original Tomb Raiders and wanted to know the story behind Lara Croft...then look no farther. The story definitely grips you and makes you feel for Lara at times, and believe it not...and I thought this was hard to believe...it didn't sound like the generic ""AAA"" type of storyline that you get exclusively with games like Call of duty, Battlefied, Fallout New Vegas, and more.  There was no dropped balls on this one and for that I applaud the game developersin their wisdom.Overall Score for Story: 9/10Environment and OTher Things:For the most part there is a lot to do in this game.  Various relics, documents, tombs, weapon upgades, skill point upgrades, etc etc.  However even with a lot of things to collect I felt the game was lacking some immersion from the player with the environment.  Most of this comes to mind basde on the version I got.  I bought the Game of the The Edition as it was only a couple dollars more and I thought it was worth it in terms of economics and my college budget.  I definitely got a lot of messages when I opened the game for the first time that bombarded me like the it was the beaches of Normandy again with new ""DLC UNLOCKED!!!""So it would seem that most of the extra things are based on the version of the game you get.  Now I'm not saying the the standard version is stripped down and naked...oh my...but for the most part I feel majority of the extra content that looks really  cool and really brings out Lara Croft as Tomb Raider are in the DLC.  On other things, the hunting is pretty cool.  Its not everyday that I get to shoot Crows and songbirds with my bow and arrow...if I was a good shot at least..and didn't live in a city where its illegal.  Country doesn't count.But hey if you want to see who the best shot is, go crow hunting.  Otherwise animals such as Deer, wolfves (these guys are pricks to say the least), and boars, are all available for your exploitation. Maps are laid with hidden gems, relics, documents, and GPS caches as well as local challenges.  So even if you are unsure what you should be trying to get or go for.  Just start shooting at things or lighting things on fire...something will pop up with a challenge progress.Overall Environment:  7/10Game Overall Score: 8.5/10Great game, well worth it. Could be expanded a bit more in some trivial areas but for the most part I've enjoyed it to my hearts content and my college budget is yet again happy to see it has not been wasted."

It only take a minute into the intro video for you to realize you've just loaded up and epic tale. This is far and away my favorite single player game, the story having made it hard to get off to go to work. I just had to know what happened. 10/10. The visuals are stunning (GTX 770m if that helps anyone), and her hair had enough detail to require a special graphics option just for it. 10/10. The audio is perfect, with the sounds of wind, gunshots and even breaking sticks changing depending on how enclosed the environment is, how close or far the action was, and, if I'm not mistaken, even if it was on the other side of a wall or rock. 10/10. Controls are simple and easy to use, with little difficulty understanding even the most intricate of actions. The same goes for the user interface, with nothing but your mini-map displayed most of the time. That's the pros of the game, and while I love this game, I will talk about the downsides. To start, if your looking for online, look somewhere else. The online for this game doesn't exist anymore as of the writing of this review, and didn't when the game had released. It was clunky, slow, and had some glitches that didn't seem right most of the time. I'm an online gamer, GoW3 being my go to for 3rd person action, and I would recommend that to you as well if you want that style. For this and other reasons (can't play Laura till max level >.<) this game receives a 3/10 for online. Now second up is graphics. Let me explain before you blow up about how I already gave graphics a high score. The are amazing, they are. But their level of amazingness can be a bit much at times, for both myself and my computer. When your trotting along and suddenly five men attack you, you have bullets, fire, explosions, arrows, bodies, plants, rain, wind, debris etc. flying around on screen. This puts strain on your computer as with nearly any AAA game. Now add amazing graphics, and set them on high or higher (pun intended) and your computer will freak, tank the fps, and try to cope with the maddening amount of crap on screen. To top the insane flurry of activity, add in a motion blur that's even more realistic than jerking my own head around, and you've got the perfect headache cocktail. Now this doesn't hurt the graphics rating, but it is something to watch out for. If you get this game, mess around with the graphics settings and see what your comp, and you, can handle before you get into a motion storm. All in all, still my favorite game, over any of the Bioshock's, and I have a Big Daddy tattoo. For a final score, Tomb Raider deserves a 9.5/10 without online, and a 9/10 with it (10/10 is reserved for a game I can find no qualms with)."

2158,Boozad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Boozad/,2,,1,8.0,May,"1,",215,2,1,"I was late to the party with Tomb Raider 2013, I've had it sitting in my Steam library since release as I got it free with whatever piece of hardware it was I bought at the time, but I was a little hesitant to fire it up. Why? Because, as with remakes of our favourite movies (sprinkled with a large dose of nostalgia), remakes always seem to let us down. And not because our expectations are overly high either, but because our memories of the original are barely ever lived up to.I remember spending hours sitting on my bed listening to 'Rust in Peace' by Megadeth whilst guiding Lara around Area 51 and a dark, depressing London in Tomb Raider III having some of the best game playing fun I've ever had, it topped the first two easily and it consumed me for a while, but that was way back when and I haven't revisited the TR franchise since. I was scared those memories would be tarnished, and I was completely wrong...Of course, if you didn't jump on the TR train from the very beginning back in the nineties and missed Lara in all of her original blocky glory that won't matter as you've nothing to lose. Neither have the gamers who got to know Lara years ago as this game doesn't let the originals down one little bit.There's a big shift from how TR used to play, the game isn't one giant puzzle where even figuring out how to get from A to B could be soul destroying (although there are still elements of it in the game) and there's more of a linear feel to it. That's not a bad thing though as you aren't led through the game literally by the hand, there are discreet pointers and a Survival Instinct which will show you the main path, but there are hundreds of side objectives and mini missions for you to complete which are hugely rewarding in themselves.There is a start point and an end point, no more collection of huge, self-contained levels, but to stay true to the name of the franchise there are plenty of tombs to enter where puzzles must be solved to claim the riches that lie within. There is a sensible array of weapons to be used, and along with some excellent guided action moments they bring a great feel of energy to the game.The game play itself is smooth and responsive and even through some of the more guided elements of the game you feel fully in control of Lara. It's been slightly awkward for me to revert to a controller while aiming a gun (using my right thumb just isn't anywhere near as accurate as using my Gigabyte M6900 in, say, Battlefield) but it does come flooding back after a while. The graphics are simply lush, and anybody with a higher end card who can knock all of their settings up to Ultra without even giving it a thought are in for a real treat. I've yet to finish the game at the time of writing this, but I don't think it will be too long before I do. It's good enough to peel me away from the Battlefield franchise which speaks volumes for the playability of a single player game to me, and I'd have absolutely no hesitation recommending this to any gamer out there as it has enough elements to appeal to you regardless of your favourite type of game.So what are you waiting for? Get your hand in your pocket and stump up the fifteen quid it costs to get the game, then love it to bits."

I've grown up with the Tomb Raider games, I still remember with chills running down my spine how I loved that dragon opening every time I booted up Tomb Raider 2 for the playstation. It was like a action movie everytime. It's one of my very fond franchises and I've loved it to death ever since I could play games.Now this new revival of Tomb Raider, was it any good? Yes. Yes it was. And it was worth every second of it. There is few games whereas I gladly spend hours searching for hidden objects. But in this game the reward with the understanding of the story and the history of this Yamatai island... It's just captivating. I would say this game truly stands up on its merits. Great level design, great graphics, great combat, great story, great storytelling. Is there any bad parts? Sure. I'd say there was some, some things that felt a bit stressed. Not much though, only thing I really can say at this point in time is how Lara went from innocent to killing machine without alot of dynamic change in the beggining, however this was reflected on and corrected later in the game. Should you buy it? Yes, if you like the Tomb Raider franchise. Should you buy it even if you dont like the Tomb Raider franchise? Probably. This game is very different from its predecessors and in a good way. If you havnt gotten into the franchise allready I wouldn't hesitate to say that this is a great introduction to the universe of Lara Croft.So how does it stand up to my standards? Well. Quite simply I love this game. So I'd gladly give this 9/10 toasts. Tomb Raider truly feels as if it finally is back on track after a couple of less than great games. Great revival of this franchise. Thumbs up Square Enix and Crystal Dynamics."

I enjoyed collecting all the relics and documents and of course the fighting elements were also pretty fun (Lara Croft is a mass murder just so you know). 50% into completing the game it will get a bit too easier to solve the puzzles and loot, simply because you get special perks that help you find everything.

2176,franko,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fransuke/,2,,1,9.8,March,"5,",332,2,1,"Ok so Tomb Raider is an AMAZING game,but it's not for everyone. You'll se what I mean by that later in the review. First off: the graphics. I've played the game on ultimate setting with the hair realism and I've got to say this is one of the most graphically beautiful games I've ever seen, the design,the character models,the nature,EVERYTHING is detailed. I've tried the game on the ultra and high settings the graphics were great on those settings aswell. So I recommend playing this game if you have A STRONGER PC because it just feels better to play this game on the higher graphics settings(high,ultra,ultimate). Gameplay: The story itself is great. Just a tipical Tomb Raider game but with major improvements. This is the kind of game in which you have to follow the storyline and there are no side quests (except the secret tombs which you have to find). There are campistes in which you can upgrade weapons,level up (using skill points) and fast travel. The game includes easy puzzles which everyone can solve. The shooting is really unrealistic but fun. Sometimes it takes a few shots to the head. You can choose to approach the enemy with stealth or just to shoot everyone in your sight. The game itself doesn't take that long to finish. If you find all the tombs and play on hard it might take you 15-18 hours. It took me around 10 hours to finish it on medium.The multiplayer: The multiplayer is good,nothing special but playable. It has one huge problem: nobody plays it. It's really hard to find a server that has more than 1 person on it. You can customise your loadout and change your character. So nothing new there.Final score: Graphics 10/10                   Story 9/10                   Overall gameplay 8/10                   Multiplayer 8/10                   Cutscenes 10/10  Overall I recommend this game for averyone who likes the adventure genre.

They have worked very hard to bring us a cinematic experience, giving us gorgeous and detailed environments, blending cut scenes with urgent platforming, fast-paced action along with a touch of sandbox roaming.  It is clearly a labour of love, and I have enjoyed hours hunting down every item, finding every document and completing every challenge. If you have to resort to guides to do any of this, or to solve any of the puzzles, then you are not really trying very hard!You do have to work at suspending your disbelief, though, when Lara survives the most outrageous falls and explosions without any broken bones, and sticks the most unlikeliest of jumps ...and Lara grunts continuously, even when standing still.All of this is good clean, violent fun, though.  Now, here are my gripes: Camera----------------------I was continually wrestling for control of the camera.  I don't need the game telling me where I should be looking, I can manage all by myself, thankyou.Button-mashing----------------------As an adult, I don't want to be button-mashing.  Seriously: you can leave that for the kiddies' games.  I don't know any adult who wants to be furiously pounding their keyboards.  Quicktime Events----------------------And, we've got quick-time events.  This wasn't fun with the ancient Dragon's Lair in 1983 (so I am told).  It certainly isn't fun now.Scripted Events----------------------The game is linear and it is scripted in parts. It doesn't matter if you have been playing a certain style, because the game is going to make you do these scenes the way it wants you to.  This breaks immersion.  I would prefer to do it my way.  You can see why the devs have done this, though.  Mostly these scenes really do work, and give the game the action blockbuster feel the devs were seeking, and when you play these through flawlessly, it really is exhilarating.Tomb Raider is a good game.  I do hope the devs have put in telematics into this game so that they can see what they should do more of and what they should avoid next time, because one thing's for sure: I will be playing the sequel.8/10  (single player PC)"

The handling of Lara in the game and the usage of her weapons that you acquire as you play the game is great. no doubt this game is good but what i missed in the game play was the survival aspects of it. Lara is vulnerable yes and in the game it is used to build up the tension for the gamer, to keep him/her exited and theyre blood pumping. But theyre are no concequences to her injures, no bandages she has to find or make her self from cloth. the amount of enemies Lara has to gun down lets you feel more like a soldier or hitman that kills with persistence head shot for head shot. The aspect of raiding tombs and solving puzzles gets pushed to the back. it gets degraded to an option, a achivement you can get. the aspect that in the end you have so many weapons you feel invincible if you know how to aim well takes you out of the experience of beeing a grave rober.

It really never felt like my kind of game. Until now, that is.This is one of the best games in 2013! Amazing atmosphere, great freedom to move, several playstyles to adopt and wonderful, dazzling graphics. This is one of the few games out there with a female hero. The good thing: you don't have to deal with many clichés male heroes have. The bad thing: you get stuck with female clichés. This has got to be the game where my character cries the most. It's refreshing, at first. But after a while, you're just thinking ""come on, Lara, man up!! i mean, you've just witnessed undescribing slaughter and did some of that yourself..."". I mean, one moment Lara's screaming her ass off because a friend of hers got a boo boo, the next moment she's going ""oh wow, JINKIES!"" after finding some old vase... on a pile of guts, bones and crumbled bodies. That's right, Lara, just filter all that carnage and admire the vase!! It's japanese!! Doge says: much shallow!But anyway, this game is a must. The story is pretty decent and we play it instead of admiring it from afar. The game evolves pretty well and you seldom have that sense of boredom one sometimes gets after a while shooting the same old enemies.Plus, you don't really feel the scripted part of the game all that much - ok, i did stumble into something disturbing once... i was stalking and silently killing quite a few enemies in the jungle, then i missed one arrow and... right in front of my eyes, an enemy materialized and, all of a sudden, they all knew exactly where i was in that darkness and shot me. Not good for immersion, IMO.You can fight using several techniques. You can either go silent and take them out with arrows or with melee finishing moves, or you can go full berserk and bang bang shoot them in a frenzy of gunfire from your shotgun, pistol and machine gun. Keeps the game fun.The puzzles are alright, nothing too dificult and just to change the pace a bit.Highly recommended game."

Eventually the license was bought by Eidos, and they made a game for the Playstation called ""Tomb Raider"", then they made a game called ""Tomb Raider II"", then they made another game called ""Tomb Raider III"", then they made a bunch of bad Tomb Raider games, then they remade some of the good Tomb Raider games, THEN they rebooted the entire series with Tomb Raider.Now I'll tell you something right now: if you don't want to see a human being get the crap kicked out of them, then stay away from this game because Lara Croft gets the crap kicked out of her A LOT. I'll be honest, I cried quite a bit while playing this game, and I'm not even finished the game. Sometime I have to put the controller down because I can't see through the tears.

Where in the original Lara finds it very difficult to kill another person this new version (which is not canonical to the original) finds no issue with massacring the inhabitants of the island without remorse. There is no incentive to explore. The ""tombs"" you are able to piddle around in can't even compare to the breathtaking expansiveness and intricate puzzles present in the original game of the same name. The environment looks good for the most part, but character models are dull and mostly expressionless. Lara's face drifts between out-of-breath bewilderment and calm bewilderment. Character personalities are boring, predictable, and forgettable. Do NOT purchase this poor excuse of a reboot for one of the most storied franchises in gaming history. If you must try the game, play it via some other means. The only reason I purchased it was because it was part of the Tomb Raider Franchise bundle that included the entire series (as well as the excellent Anniversary remake of the original Tomb Raider).

The game is full of story-wise emotions and superbly directed action scenes, and it still has a very strong human factor. I'm rarely this positive about a game. Crystal Dynamics took a risk that won't appeal to some orthodox fans, but all in all the developers have succeeded. The most important thing to know is this: the new Tomb Raider is one of the best action-adventure games I have ever played, with its excellent controls, engaging heroine, thrilling combat, and fascinating settingLara’s origin story is a terrific, action-packed experience with stunning visuals that sadly has not much to do with her previous adventures. Yet the puzzle physics are cool, the exploration of the island is rewarding and the much-improved combat is easily one of the biggest steps forward for the series – too bad there is sometimes too much of it.While not every promising idea Tomb Raider has is pulled off successfully, it nevertheless turns in a tense and memorable ride that combines modern game design with its forebears’ adventurous spirit in some exciting ways. Some of its missteps may well come at the cost of your enjoyment, but most can’t hope to hurt the adventure in the long run. Although it never fully finds its identity, this is a game and a story worth seeing through. A ""Must Play"" game indeed.- XeroSyphon"

Even being so compressed to the point of pixelization on a 1080p screen, it was noticeable and wrecked them. Vsync recommended if you can, should fix the issues.Half cut scene/intractable parts have no prompt of that you should take control over. Expect to die randomly, the camera will change angles and then out of the blue you are expected to interact and direct Lara. The camera angles are great and well done just be aware.Puzzles weren't hard, but due to how the engine handles interactions wilth climbing and jumping expect to be annoyed in certain parts.

I wanted to know what happened next so much that it cut into my usual collectible mania. You can tell the designers were aiming for the game-that-feels-like-a-movie, and I think they hit it straight on the head. There are a ton of set pieces, there are some QTEs, and you do lose control of the camera semi-frequently, but none of those things bother me. The QTEs taper off rapidly after the first half-hour, and they don't even really bother me to begin with, and the camera being taken away from you feels slightly condescending, but what they're showing me is so cool or beautiful that I just can't make myself care.Seriously, I beat this game, and then immediately played through the whole damn thing again, that's how much fun I had."

The level design, combat, voice acting, gameplay, music, character design and animations are very well done. The controls, my goodness. They’re fine tuned. You don't feel frustrated to make jump or when you're dealing with combat, it is very precise. Every location you go to is different and lovely to look at. If you have rig that can max it out, WOW. The game is in real-time so Lara has dirt on her face and body, you'll see the scars and cuts throughout your game and in cutscenes. If she falls in mud you'll see her get covered and it wash off in the rain or in water. Also you see the costumes (DLC)  in cutscenes –Bonus! The attention to detail is fantastic.The character progression of Lara is great. As this innocent girl has to now fight, kill, suffer and go through hard ships to survive. You can upgrade Lara by finding salvage and xp. The down side to this game is the game is a bit too easy. You really can't fail the platforming, the tombs are way too easy and they give you a stupid highlighting thing (can't remember what is called).  It’s great for locating animals and plants and when you upgrade Lara for hidden items but it just makes it to casual friendly and for someone like me who likes to play their games on Hard Period Its just... Blah! There is no way to turn it off. Also there is no replay value. Yes you play it again because it’s that good! There are collectables – but here is the problem. You can go through the whole entire game no getting the collectibles. But you need them to upgrade Lara. Now say you beat the game. You can go back through the game and collect them but it’s so boring! There are no enemies; they don’t respawn after a while or even going to the next area and on top of that no new game plus. This is good because the game is easy enough as it is. So going back through the level for the collectables is just empty.This game is a must play. And I recommend playing it on Hard. I played with X360 controller. I did not play the Multiplayer.Also Kudos to CD, for PC support. When some things weren't working they brought a patch out quick. Also they changed the Tress FX (Hair physics) for Lara as well because there were a few problems. This is a fantastic game, no laziness done here. Just like Metro LL and a few others. Oh! And Lara is hot..... What!? And dat ass tho! :3Looking forward to Tomb Raider 2."

The storyline evolves as you play the game and you really feel for Lara's struggles as she battles through the islands lush locations.The gameplay has depth and combat has a visceral feel. The controls are simple and do not get in the way of the action or story. The graphics and sound are state-of-the-art and rival anything seen and heard in other games released in the last year.

The Tomb Raider reboot changed that. The gameplay is solid, with the game having no problems aside from a few minor graphic glitches that happend maybe twice in the 12 hours I've played. And speaking of graphics, the game looks & works great in 3D (Aside from the Crosshair) and is just as demanding as Crysis 3. And the TressFX hair. MY. GOD. One of my friends mentioned it had QTE's, but like Resident Evil 4, it saves most of the QTE's for high action situations, so it doesnt come up too often. Infact I'd say its even less so than in RE4. The story & characters so far are also good. After playing this game & seeing Lara go through the hell she does, I have a new found respect for her as a character. All her firends that are stranded on the island with her are also likeable & I actually cared when one of them died.If you've been somewhat keeping your eye on this game like I did, hoping, wishing, and/or wondering if it turns out good, then buy this game. It is one of the best single player experiences I've played in quite some time, and it more than warrents a spot on my shelf via a physical copy.

At most time of the game, i was absolutely impressed, there so much, what is going on my mind, the levels (very wonderful), the story (really strong), the enemies (which have their own story, if you listened to them), the huge area you can explore. Very good is also the soundtrack, which gets me totally nervous, but have the right place in the right situation.In a short sentence, Tomb Raider really amazing and will play it again and again, but there some things which are really annyoing me : Sometimes, i got into situations, where i had to be very quick, causing fallen into an abyss, if i let go my hand or my hammer, especcially at the end of the game. And then, i didnt know, where i have to go. And some ingame movies, especcially at the end of the game, are too much, i think. I knew, i was on the end of the story and wanted to be the hero of the game to finish it.The next point, there are much of quicktime events in the game, where i didnt know, which key i had to use (was it ""E"" or ""F"", no, the other one, damn, now i'm dead again)-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Was soll ich über das Spiel sagen ? Wie habe ich es empfunden ? Fast die ganze Zeit über war absolut beeindruckt von dem Spiel :  - Die Story, die es mir ziemlich angetan hat und mich absolut gefesselt hat ; - Die einzelnen Abschnitte sind sehr liebevoll gestaltet worden, sodass ich mich kaum sattsehen konnte , - Die Feinde, die teilweise ihre eigenen Geschichten hatten, wenn ich ihnen zugehört habe ,- Die Umgebung, die so riesig ist, das ich wirklich gezwungen wurde, mir alles anzusehen und alle Objekte zu finden, die überall versteckt wurden ;- Der Sountrack, der zu jeder Szene eigentlich den richtigen Ton getroffen hat.In einem kurzen Satz, Tomb Raider ist ein wirklich rundum gelungenes Spiel, das in keiner Sammlung fehlen dürfte, da wirklich alles vorhanden ist.Aber leider, gerade zum Ende vom Spiel, sind mir da einige Kleinigkeiten aufgefallen, die mich echt gestört haben :Gerade wenn es aufgrund der Story wirklich sehr schnell gehen muss, war ich öfters überfordert, weil mir nicht sofort ins Auge gefallen ist, wo ich denn nun hin muss. Das ist gerade ziemlich stressig, wenn ich da mit meiner Hand am (Eis)Hammer hänge und nicht weiss wo ich denn hin soll. Zum zweiten wurde es am Ende etwas zu gut gemeint, mit den ganzen Filmsequenzen. An dieser Stelle möchte man einfach nur noch zur Retterin werden und das Spiel abschliessen.Zweitens, es sind sehr viele QuickTime Events vorhanden, während denen mal krampfhaft versucht, die richtige Taste zu erwischen. Die Tastenbelegung ist jetzt zwar nicht aussergewöhnlich geändert, aber es fiel mir sehr schwer die richtigen Tasten zum richtigen Zeitpunkt zu treffen. Möglicherweise hätte eine Maustaste, anstatt Tastaturtaste, hier Wunder gewirkt."

(1) Very Short(yet perpetually repeating the same premise) Story Line, I was able to beat the Single Player campaign in 10 hours with 80% of the items found. Note: Prerequisite, I have played every single TR release, and this scores second besides Unfinished Business in being the shortest Single Player campaign I have ever played.(2) Deviates from the traditional puzzle solving mechanic's presented to us from the previous Tomb Raider franchise. Thanks to the survival instinct feature ""puzzles""(dare I even call them that), are pretty much a walk in the park.(3) QTE(aka quick time events), due to these additional gameplay mechanic's the overall game feels more like Uncharted with simply a female protaganst.(4) Grindfest - Nothing but killing hoards of enemies, lather, rise, repeat till you eventually reach the next area.  Warning: The ending will leave you thinking:  ""Wth, thats it?""Finally, overall the game is fantastic on it's shear graphical prowess alone, but due steams not so wonderful rating system being limited to a simple yeah or nay.

I had almost no experience with the series prior to this - watching a friend adjust the camera to get the best shot of the goods in a demo on one of those Playstation Underground discs doesn't really count - and this made a very good first impression.  I usually don't like Third-Person Shooters, because the controls never feel like they were programmed by a sane person, but these work very well.  I can't aim very well with a gamepad, but using WASD to control Lara in a 3-dimensional environment with complex platforming puzzles was much easier than I could've hoped!  What starts out as a series of quick-time events and a lot of spectacle over substance gradually gives way to a very solid experience.You have experience, but instead of just gaining it from killing enemies, you also build up from solving puzzles and finding artifacts; they remembered that she's a badass action heroine, but an , first and foremost.  Finding relics was neat, too, because she'd give some historical context, and you could inspect them, sometimes finding additional information.  Experience is used to learn different skills, and though you'll have them all by the end, you have a chance at some customization until you get there.  You also salvage scrap, which can be used to add parts onto your weapons to enhance performance; though you only have 4 weapons, they're all fun to use and build.  That said, I killed most of my adversaries with archery, because it works very well; yes, I was a basic bow.  Combat isn't super common, but it often unfolds something like a puzzle; there are plenty of solutions, often involving environmental elements.  I found out that you can just shoot your way out, though, because it took me a while to get used to noticing them, but that's entirely on me.  Puzzles can be challenging at times, but only once did I need to consult a walkthrough, because there was a thing I didn't even know I could do, and it was never explained; everything else was pretty intuitive.Crystal Dynamics is a bunch of jerks and they knew that most any ""young woman coming of age"" story would be a slam dunk for me, and this did not disappoint.  That said, it took me a while to get into the story, and most of the characters didn't really resonate with me, especially the obligatory nerd character.  There was also a strangely powerful focus on beating up the poor girl; there were times that I was laughing out loud at how ridiculous it was, but it kinda helped, because I always knew to steer Lara toward the most painful non-lethal hazards to get through the action sequences.  So, the story didn't always land, but it did its job, and had one HELL of a climax.  The graphics were good; fairly bland and colorless most of the time, but there were still some very memorable locales.  The voice acting was either better or worse than the writing; it's hard to tell, but they were definitely out of sync with each other.  As for the music... well, there wasn't a whole lot of it, but that didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.They did a neat thing in the credits, where they showed pictures of most of the staff, which made me care more than I usually would.  The credits also said that they worked hard to bring players the very best game that they could, and I have to say that they delivered.  This gets a solid recommendation from me."

2277,ListlessPuma,https://steamcommunity.com/id/listlesspuma/,49,,0,16.5,May,"11,",941,3,1,"Stay clear.This isn't a Tomb Raider game. Don't expect to be adventuring or solving puzzles. The only puzzle is who thought this farce was a good idea. There's some good aspects but not enough to call it anything but a glistening turd.The graphics are decent, particularly for a console port; I'd complain about a oddly small light-sphere given off by your torch but that's probably just a poor style choice. Croft is also more ""realistically"" proportioned than you might remember - it wouldn't bother me if she started out this way but is smacks of needless political correctness.It's got a story too; it won't blow you away but more than you might expect. I'd say about what you'd get from a typical but well-done Hollywood action offering. Of course the story is given partially through items you have to find so if you miss something it wont ruin things but it will limit some of the depth they managed to put together.The issues undo any good from the narrative though. Remember those pretty graphics? Remember how it's a console port? Those things don't go together for a reason and the only way this was pulled off was by making this a hallway. There are no wide expanses or open planes, you're confined to a very linear, limited, unimaginative path. There's no zone that feels bigger than 50 cubic meters. Enjoy just pushing forward, there's going to be a lot of it.Lets not forget audio. The score isn't bad, I'll listen to it by itself and see how it stacks up as music but it's a competent component of the game. The rest of the foley work is questionable at best. Things like the rain sound find, then hooves of a deer running past seem like it must be carrying several ton on its back. The jarring moments aren't often but are distracting when they happen. People always underestimate good sound.If QuickTime events are the domain of the lazy and stupid then the designers of this game came up with all their ideas in brief moments where they slip out of a coma and draw something with a dull crayon. The game is constantly taking control away from you, often for just a few moments and with no reason, just to show you Croft slightly winded or climbing to the top of a ledge and then, steps later, a quicktime event. It's how half the combat takes place and it's not just a single event either but a chain of button events you must mash, alternate between, or correctly time; getting through these sequences is about as close to a puzzle as you're going to see.Which is the next issue - where the hell are the puzzles? It's a Tomb Raider game but don't expect to have any need to be skilled at jumping. Can you push left and jump at the same time? Maybe hit 'E' to grab on? You're all set! Don't think you're going to have to push things around, place artifacts or spend more than five minutes thinking about how to pull something off, the level isn't big enough to have something so complex! No, you'll just have to look around, maybe press 'Q' which reveals anything important anyway, you'll be out of there in a jiffy!Nor is the AI impressive, but it's probably for the best since you've got almost nowhere to run if you're spotted. Just arrow them in the head and there isn't much of a need to level up your weapons it seems. Oh yeah, levelling up - you slowly get a little better at some things! It adds nothing and doesn't seem to be timed with Croft gaining confidence or anything so literary. Maybe it will start to show later in the game but, as of this writing, I'm about a quarter done and feel nothing but the urge to complete it so that I can see how it unfolds and don't feel like I've totally wasted my money. I'd have felt like ♥♥♥♥ if I'd paid full price for this.I might update this again if something changes or I think of anything more but, given the [bought?] meta-critic score, it felt like people should be warned. My opinion of this game doesn't even see the light from whatever galaxy this game deserves almost a 90 in. Subtract 60 and you're about right.Edit: Forgot to update on finishing. Opinion didn't change much but the QT events dropped off at least. Can't understand the love many have given this title, even if this hadn't been called Tomb Raider, which comes with expectations, I don't think I'd have found it more than middling."

However, there are many irritating things which could have been done differently for the better. Some of those things include: Unneccessary ""Button Mash"" interactions - (Basically every locked door, chest and 'boss' fight).Collectables which do not appear on a map - (1-2 collections of completely unrelated items on most ""stages"").'Batman Arkham'-style ""instincts"" mode - (Much the same as ""Detective mode"", but only functions when stationary).Some of Lara's script when inspecting 'relics' smacks of her in fact being entirely incompetent.Typically neglects to take into account ""night-blinding"" when using the torch - minor, but irritating.Climax is underwhelming and the odds of finishing the game with a 99% rating is beyond frustrating.Lastly, Lara, a novice (and that's being kind) archer is able to use a longbow with pin-point accuracy in hurricane force winds - yeah.However, beyond these gripes the game is enjoyable, immersive and does make you want to play to the conclusion.

I grew up hearing about the game, played one or two of the series, but it never appealed to me... until now. The Lara Croft I knew was this super woman (and super hot ) wielding duel pistols, shooting wolves and climbing ridges. But this game gave me a whole new Lara. She's more like a neighbour girl. She would also be scared, panting, comforting herself ""shhhhhhhh""; She would be faschinated by her findings, frustrated when things don't work out, and disgusted when falling into a blood pool. She now feels more humane than an action figure. I absolutely love it. After all, tomb raiding isn't an easy task. The gameplay is smooth and intense. The transition from the cutscenes to gameplay is perfect. and the control is easy to handle. Graphics, well grapphis still looks pretty good even after 3-4 years.  Applause for the collectible settings ! I can upgrade my abilities which makes them easier to find. God knows how much I love collecting things in video games ! It doesn't always have to be a pain in the ass does it ? Checkpoints settings are reasonable. I hate going through the same boring climbing over and over again.  The story line is intriguing and clear, yet somewhat lacks the elements of surprises. Feels like they are scraping the bottom of the tomb raider franchise. No judgement, since I seldom play the previous series. It's good that i can also learn some history(don't know if the facts are accurate) via artifacts. I am a simple Chinese girl. I see Chinese jade dagger/fan/bowl I recommend ! :D Too bad that my potatoe computer can't handle the rise of the Tomb raider.  I wanna play it after finishing this one. 10/10 will hate tombs again"

Definitely would recomend it, especially for the single player campaign; the multiplayer is not perfect, but the game is worth it just for the single player stuff.On occasion you can come across a bug or a crash, but I had no mayor issues.Now comming back to Tomb Raider after a while I just remembered there is no New Game Plus mode; kind of annoying as I want to replay the game now in 3D, but just can't be bothered to do all the collecting and searching waste of time stuff just to upgrade my weapons.I did not mind doing it the first time to fully experience the game, but I would just like to run through the game without so much exploration.Kind of a shame Squere Enix have still not implemented a New Game Plus mode, and probably never will for this great game.On a more positive note the 3D looks pretty good apart from the fact that they did not bother to make the cut scenes 3D as well, which kind of throws you out of the 3D immersion.While the 3D is decent, it is not spectacular in a way a Disney 3D bluray movie like Frozen is with true 3D effects comming out at you; the one big negative is the rain and blood hexagon effects that stick to the screen and obscure your vision, not great for 3D at all, but luckily you can disable them from the launcher options menu."

2320,Undercover Cactus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Undercover_Cactus/,2,,1,7.7,December,"25,",112,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a very cinematic game, focusing more on the story than the gameplay. It is well-made and enjoyable, albeit with some downsides. The story is probably the strongest part of the game, and for the most part is pretty strong. Some of the more ""gamey"" aspects of the game detract from the story, such as exploring optional hidden tombs or finding hidden collectibles, as there are rarely moments in the narrative where the characters are not in a hurry and would actually spend time doing these things. I personally just ignored these for the most part since they immensely broke my immersion. However, the story is still pretty strong and enjoyable. The gameplay is a little more lacking. It can be split into a few categories: climbing, sneaking, fighting, and puzzle-solving. Climbing is relatively boring, as it is fairly simple and mostly consists of holding movement buttons and occasionally pressing space or e. Dying while climbing often felt more like the games fault than my own. Puzzles are not much more interesting, but also don't happen very often. Sneaking and fighting are actually pretty fun, and luckily they do happen fairly commonly. I think the game definitely could have done with a more interesting climbing system, as climbing sections always felt like the annoying and uninteresting down times between combat sections, even if the scenery I was climbing on was breathtaking. Overall, the game is an enjoyable experience with a good story and would be worth playing if it's on sale. I'd give it a 5/7."

2340,Pink,https://steamcommunity.com/id/poliskshatriya/,2,,1,7.9,April,"2,",340,0,1,"This game starts VERY slow, and the beginning made me not want to play it. However, the game definitely opens up further down the line. Of the criticisms I have, I would say that the quicktime events are annoying, and Lara walks like she's in water, and when she's actually in water, it's so much worse. I also think some progression should have been done earlier in the game, like receiving the rope ascender at the very end of the game -- It would have been nice to have earlier and kept the experience virtually the same.In terms of story, it's pretty dismissable. The characters are shallow tropes, deaths don't feel weighted, and I don't even remember the characters names. Definitely better than the movie based off this game though, that's for sure.Another item worth noting is how short this game is. I 100%'d the game on hard in 7 hours, with lots of farting around while looking for collectables. There's a silly term for the last problem with the game, called, ""ludonarrative dissonance"", but it basically comes down to this: Lara kills hundreds of people with ease during gameplay, but in a cutscene, it's suddenly the hardest thing ever? Why? Definitely a lack of self-awareness from a narrative perspective.All in all though, it was fun, but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for the game. Uncharted has always done it better, even if it's an exclusive."

2383,Artibius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/artibius/,2,,1,30.8,November,"23,",640,0,1,"+ fun action story+ good visuals+ great atmosphere+ level design+ skill upgrades+ weapon upgrades+ lots of collectibles- couple of crashes to desktop- really hard to find someone to start a multiplayer game- very few, simple and short tombs to raid- maybe gory close-up deaths of Lara are not for everyone(?)Finally a less clunky and more action oriented Tomb Raider game. While third person shooting is almost a cliche nowadays it really fits well here. So while many people who were fans of the previous games might get disappointed this new approach breathed life into the franchize. Yeah, the story gets a bit cheesy later on when you compare the fragile beginnings where everything can hurt Lara to the grandiose Rambo-like ending. But I still love it because at no point did I not have fun. While sometimes the game is QTE heavy I prefer it's linear approach. It gives focus on the fact that Lara is trying to survive, find her friends and escape the island. An open-world setting might have ruined that aspect. The tombs are okay but rather short and simple for a game called  Raider. Apart from tombs there are lots of collectibles which make your explore the scenery a bit more. These are not just for show as they help in your XP progress to level up your skills or to get salvage. The skill system helps give the feeling of Lara getting stronger as she progresses. There is also a weapon upgrade system where, if you collect enough salvage, you can improve them. That being said, the bow and arrow is the most satisfying for most of the game. You need four people to play a multiplayer match. So nowadays it is really difficult to have one. Combined with DLC maps it is even tougher, so disable those if you wanna up your chances. Also expect to meet cheaters as there is no anti-cheat protection. The game has flaws, sure, but these all fade compared to the really fun and action-packed experience. Definitely worth checking out! The GOTY Edition is not really needed as most of it is multiplayer stuff, six skins for singleplayer (Demoliton, Mountaineer, Sure-Shot, Hunter, Aviatrix, Guerilla) and the one extra tomb (Tomb of the Lost Adventurer) is still bugged.------------------------------------------------------------------"

So starting up let me say that I never played the original Tomb Raider games, i heard about them and such, but never had the opportunity to play them, so keep that in mind.So the game is about the adventures of a young Lara Croft i assume, before being a professional tomb raider, so she is young, bold and inexperienced. We start the adventure at a ship seeking for a mysterious island, we manage to found it and then we sink, so Lara is trapped at an island. She starts hunting and surviving, which would be the right decision. After some hours of gameplay, we get our first guns, and the game decides to keep that hunting aspect aside. The game turns in some Uncharted clone, killing guys while everything we step at decides to break. I don't mind that but why would they start the game showing that if we only use that the first 10 minutes of the game, I mean we can keep hunting and taking plants from the ground, but the reward is not that useful, just a bit of exp, so i never hunted after that. So now let's talk about the gameplay, the gameplay is enjoyable for the most parts. You don't get bored but there are some things that aren't perfect. In  between jumping and hanged on a wall, if you pay attention you can see the script that kind of teleports you to the wall, it's a bit awkward.Then there's the weapon change. You can press [1,2,3,4] to change your weapons, bow, pistol, shotgun and rifle. The weapon you were holding disappers magically and you get the one you changed to, it's not a realistic thing like at Uncharted 4, where you see the animation of changing it and putting where it was. I can understand the limitations of the engine and the time they had to work at that time, but not realistic, so, uncool.Apart from that the gameplay is very enjoyable, the gunplay is satisfactory and the parkour/uncharted bits of gameplay are decent. You can approach the fights differently, depending on the weapon you are using.The story is decent, nothing too crazy but well it's an adventure game.I liked the collectibles, and secret tombs, there's some objects you can get, that show you the asian history, like helmets from different areas, coins etc... It's interesting to have these as collectibles so you can get more deep into that culture.It took me almost 16 hours to complete the game, just complete the story and some collectibles, I didn't got all of them, neither touched the online system(I don't know if it's still working but however) it's a decent duration keeping in mind the price, and if you get it on sale, you can get a good experience for a low price. So to sum it up the game is enjoyable, if you are into an action game similar to uncharted, to play some hours and then move on,  it won't be a game i'll remember deeply, but it was decent. I recommend even at full price, come and get it."

In this game you are marooned on an island after your boat sinks, and end up facing a cult of shipwrecked people like yourself, who have been stranded on the island for a long time, believing that their only way to leave the island is by- *chokes on spoilers*. Anyway, In this game, Lara kills for the first time, almost pukes, then afterwards goes merrily on her way bashing bad guys using a variety of weapons including a bow, a pistol, a rifle, a shotgun, and a climbing axe. Lara also seems to possess the ability to not care when she should be dying, and to sustain so many injuries that are miraculously cured a few minutes later when she completely forgets about them. She also has the ability to climb and jump like an olympic athlete, and has an endless degree of stamina that means you can travel around the landscape wherever you want, whenever you want, despite the fact that Lara really should be dead by now and even if she wasn't surely the environment should have at least lessened her superhuman abilities by a small fraction? She also doesn't seem to notice the cold very much, despite the only thing she wears on top being 2 vest tops on top of each other. But why am I griping about realism? It's a videogame, why do I care if it's real? The truth is, I don't! But those that do care will probably, well, care.The short version is: Awesome game, lots of action, challenging at times, nice graphics+environments = worth your time to play indeed.Lara's twin pistols included. (For about 20 seconds at the end of the game)Rating: Nine outrageously invincible white vest tops/10If you get it, you won't regret it!"

It has some really good graphics, The gameplay is really nice, and the graphics are excelent. I liked this game a lot. I felt that it was really well done however I felt the story was a bit to short. I got 10 hours of gameplay in and I felt like I took my time. One thing that I feel was done rather well was the progression of your weapons as you play going from a crude wooded bow to a high powered compound bow. I liked the gameplay style as well. It allows for multiple styles of gameplay. You can sneak passed enemies or you can go in guns blazing. I prefer the sneaky style of play and found it to be quite well done. In terms of story I felt it was really well done as well with the character evolving as you play though the game. It is also the one game that I have played where I get a feel for how much the character suffers. The story does suffer from being a bit on the short side for my liking making the game rather quick and to be honest as good as the game is I am not that tempted to go for a replay. Overall I think it is a good game. I can't comment on how well it fits into the Tomb Raider franchise but as a game it has nice graphics, a decent story, and lets just say that Lara's cries in pain are a bit to sensual to be pain."

Environments are really well done and fun to explore; story is engaging and intriguing. I don't have 100% completion yet, only have 1 play thru done, and will definitely be doing more play thru's in the future.  I was reluctant to get this game initially, remembering how clunky and horrid the controls for the original tomb raider was back on the PS1 (left a bad taste in my mouth all these years over it); however, this reboot was definitely a great purchase choice.  The controls are well done and largely intuitive (I play with the Xbox controller), initially the sensitivity is set REALLY high and needs turned WAY down, but getting past that it seems to run really smooth for the most part.  Exploring environments is fun, and the puzzles, while some are a bit of a doozy to figure out, are also quite fun and offer a sense of acccomplishment when figuring them out.The story for the game is really well written, the characters are engaging and intriguing, and I personally found it very difficult to put the controller down every time I picked it up, resulting in 4+ hour play sessions.  Theres alot of slower play areas that give you time to get acquainted with the controls and movement and ability to get around; but once sh** starts to hit the fan, it hits fast and hard and goes EVERYWHERE, you have to be on your toes, paying attention to everything and have a solid grasp of where you need to go next, otherwise your probably going to die.  Fortunately the game makes EXTENSIVE use of checkpoints and an unfortunate misstep or death isn't an hours long effort retrudging and retracing to get back to where you were, but rather, you typically go back a few steps before where you died, and when everything goes to hell, theres always a checkpoint right before that happens, just in case.The negative points in this game are rather few, but enough to warrant it not being a 10/10 in my opinion, and chief among those is the cutscene ""button games"" where you have to hit X the Y then wiggle LS back and forth....the timing on them is....precise....to say the least, you can't do it too fast, or too slow, and you can't hit the buttons too soon, or too early, and it can be VERY frustrating.  The controls while largely well done IMO, do have some jerky moments, and aiming to shoot that enemy in front of you is a right jolly pain in the a**; they could have done well to put a bit of an auto-aim or snap function into the game able to be toggled on/off.  The gameplay, is fun, the learning curve is steep, and in combat you will die alot and fast if you don't use your cover and tactics.TL;DR~great game, love the story, gameplay is great, great characters, beautiful environments; steep learning curve, combat requires tact. and the button games on cutscenes are terribad and frustrating.  Would buy again and reccommend to anyone who enjoys exploration and fast paced combat with a well-written story."
2407,QueenofBrambles(TTV),https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996958755/,3,,1,25.6,January,"11,",232,0,1,"This is, visually, an incredibly pronounced departure from the old series; from the vaguely-experienced, unnaturally buxom protagonist in a halter top and booty shorts, into a green, realistically-figured college graduate in a practical outfit in a tank top and classic fit trousers (with just the right color combination to make it nostalgic), Crystal Dynamics' Lara Croft starts the franchise off fresh. All the old elements are there: archeological discoveries create a setting backdrop for plots that reveal supernatural phenomena, the gameplay includes both action-oriented combat, and puzzle solving, a woman kicks butt. However, this game restructures combat and gameplay in a way that may leave old fans scathing. Much of the puzzle solving enjoyed in the old games are left by the wayside in favor of a more cinematic adventure feel. To further this feel of a cinematic adventure, combat is regularly interrupted by cut-scenes and quick-time events.  What puzzles are left are solved quickly; many of these puzzles are so intuitive, many players - especially gaming veterans - may not even realize they're there.Lara Croft is no longer an overly sexualized object of lust doling out bad-assery and oozing cucumber-cool confidence from every pore at the expense of having a believeable personality. Lara is a fresh-faced, academically-minded graduate in the field of archaeology with foibles, ambition, anxiety, insecurity and growth. Her outfit is designed for practicality in exploring a warm forest environment, and the alternative skins share in this proper aesthetic.The game is not without flaws. Combat and platforming can have serious bugs. You might see your bullets and arrows fly straight through an enemy's eye, while not delivering the headshot you would expect - or any damage for that matter. Shooting from behind cover is heavily encouraged in this game, but trying to fire your weapon from behind a corner is a small gamble, as your projectiles might stop at the wall. There were a few times when I was leaping toward a surface that required a button press to latch on to (and it's easy to tell what is a legitimately climbable surface), actually pressing the button did nothing, and I plummeted to my death.  I also determined that aim sensitivity is not consistent, and traveling along the x-axis is minutely quicker than along the y-axis. Aiming is easier with a mouse, but general controls are much tighter with a controller - though not perfectly.The plot was on the whole, very enjoyable and riveting; it was easily blockbuster quality, however some of the nasty things that happen to Lara Croft and her supporting cast could have easily been avoided. Some mistakes were actually understandable, but just as many only served to advance the plot action-movie style, and drive home the sense of despair and weariness that Lara was supposed to feel over the course of the game. Additionally, in the beginning of the game, Lara suffers a wound - front through back - to the left side of her waist. Her kidney was probably punctured from that, but once she's able to settle down with a first aid kit, she bandages two locations on her leg but not the gaping wounds on her torso. Still, there's enough twists and turns through the unfolding events to keep you excitedly guessing, and it won't be terribly hard to overlook the chronic idiocy that besets the cast.All-in-all, a pretty good game, and definitely worth buying if you catch a sale."

I got everything on the lowest of the low, and the resolution at 800x600. And I am having alot of fun. It is pretty challenging without all the detail. Im excited to see how pretty this game really is on my GTX 660ti  or replacement gpu. It has definetly been worth my money. The way Laura dies in many failed attempts reminds me of ""the Last of Us"". Some of the things Laura has to do to survive are stupid insane and puts me on the edge of my seat. Even at such low quality.In short, if you are looking for something to play. Watching as Laura turn from an Innocent archaeologist into a deadly killing machine is definetly worth spending a few bucks on.Buy it"

2435,Shawn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/persianshawn/,2,,1,13.0,January,"12,",336,0,1,"Tomb Raider is one of those games that put the cinematic experience and game playing into one, sweet package (much like the highly praised Uncharted series and The Last of Us. It's characterized by several awe-inspiring moments, solid controls and an equally innovative story. Furthermore, Tomb Raider put's the whole ""female-player"" role into a good perspective, focusing on charachter development and new ways for fans to relate to her: she undergoes a ""human transformation"", to say the least. This is something not seen in previous installments of Tomb Raider, where we, the players, are thrown right off the bat into the role of Lara that is more resembling of a female version of Rambo, rather than a ""actual human being"" with feeling, which the player can somewhat relate to. In this sense, the new Tomb Raider game has succeded in numerous ways. But the game has its own shortcomings, preventing it from reaching the top, albeit it's pretty close. Given an enough high-end PC, this game is georgeous to look at. Everything from the amazing tropical setting, to the never-ending changes of the game environment, making every part of the game feel fresh from the get go. Although there are several things that Tomb Raider excels at, there are drawbacks to the game that stops it from reaching perfection. One is the lack of side-charachter development, solely focusing on Lara Croft might come with good intention, though it becomes boring in the long run. Another ""dissapointment"" is ironically the lack of actual, FUN, tombs to raid. While there are several ""hidden"" ones, they more or less consist of 1 (or 2 at most!) riddles to solve before reaching the actual end of the tomb. While the game is undoubtedly the best in the Tomb Raider series, it has its own share of drawbacks, stopping it from reaching full potential. I'll give this game 4 solid islands out of 5!"
2436,Rhamsa,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980576540/,2,,1,56.3,December,"20,",153,0,1,"This isn't just a remake of the original Tomb Raider, it is a complete reimagining of the entire series. Fans of the original games may end up disappointed with the new direction. There is definitely more action and quick time events than a traditional platformer. With that being said, the story focuses on the gritty origin story of Lara. You start off as a young and inexperienced Lara heading out for the first time on a grand adventure. You are quickly shipwrecked, beaten, bruised, stranded alone and traumatized within the first hour of the game. Equipped with a bow and a climbing pick, your goal is to recover the rest of the crew that you arrived with and to escape the island in one piece.Basic gameplay is that of a traditional third-person shooter. You run around using cover and shooting around edges and corners to progress through fights. There is also the element of stealth that can be employed. If you are good with the bow and sneaking up behind people, you can stealth-kill your way through a vast majority of the game.Some quick time events are fairly bland. The most common one is to press a single button repeatedly to open certain doors. Others are the typical ""press E at the right time or die"" situations. They don't add much or detract too much from the overall experience. If you fail at one of the events, it'll put you right back into the action and give you another chance.The greatest disappointment with the game is the multiplayer. It is a veritable ghost town and next to impossible to find a game except during peak hours. It is plagued with one-hit-kill mechanics that discourage newer people from giving it a second try after playing with more experienced people. It feels like it was tacked on at the last minute in spite of all the downloadable content and emphasis placed on it by the developers.  The visuals and graphics are absolutely breath-taking at times. So much so that it enhances the journey on the island to feel much more epic that it would have otherwise. This is an amazing game and well worth the price if you are willing to accept the new direction of the series."

2453,F☻ﮐﮐa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bu-troniks/,22,,0,26.2,December,"23,",423,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a linear 3rd Person shootem'up with occasional platforming and puzzle segments.If regenerating health, cover based shooting galleries, quicktime events, and everything exploding and collapsing around you in a spectacular fashion sounds like your cup of tea, then by all means pick it up.The majority of puzzles are optional, with only a few being forced in the later game. This is my biggest gripe with Tomb Raider as the puzzles are rather good, and would have been better appreciated if integrated into the main story. Hunting is introduced in the early game, and ignored for the the rest of it. Tomb Raider seems to exist in an open world, but all the survival and exploration themes evaporate once the shooting starts. Lara is constantly under attack by a barrage of burly men, their bodies lead the way to the next checkpoint and more people to shoot in the face. This approach is pretty standard fare for modern 3rd person shooters, but I always see games struggle to justify the ridiculous body count it produces, and Tomb Raider is no exception. After all is said about tomb raider as a game, its quite an excellent port. Graphics are highly customizable, with DX11 support and high res textures. Mouse control is precise and most actions can be binded to keyboard. I managed to finish Tomb Raider, but I probably wouldn't have if I didn't want to write a review. It does pick up in the later parts of the game which I enjoyed, but it just takes too long to muster up any type of real challenge."

2467,Woozie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silopjah/,2,,1,47.7,July,"12,",222,0,1,"Tomb Raider is an awesome game made by Crystal Dynamics. It contains a long and varied storyline, fun gameplay and interesting places to discover. The gameplay is great and fun, expecially playing with the bow, but the other weapons like assault rifle and shotgun are also fun. Climbing around in the ruins of a battefield from WW2 is very cool, and also brings a good feel to the game. The AI is very well made, but as always they have some flaws. Tomb Raider is an open world game with many locations to be in, but to reach each location you need to advance in the story, and returning back to the locations is really only useful when wanting to find collectibles. The game uses fast travel to get around to other places (camps in the various locations), but the fast travel is pretty much useless if you're playing the story, and is mostly used to return to cleared/discovered areas. I personally only used it when I was going to get all the collectibles. The story is extraordinary, and is very amusing play. You usually don't expect the outcome, and when you think there's one hour left of the game, there might be five hours, so the game really delivers much story and gameplay. There is so much more to write about this game, but the best way to experience this fantastic game is to BUY THE GAME! 10/10"

If I could I would give this game a neutral rating, but since I look for actual good game play in games Im giving it a negative. This game is pretty much cut scenes, with a bit of walking, climbing/jumping and shooting in between them. If you can, I would get it only if its on sale.Everything I didnt like about the game:-Its basically an interactive movie, Lots of quick-time events-You cant sprint, which I found to be really annoying, at least for me-The game ducks for you at certain parts, You cant just duck whenever you want-There is one part, where you need to get a backpack, but when you get the pack, your character doesnt put the pack on, but when you take the pack to where you needed to, you magically have the pack..-The shuffle, and Roll actions are mapped to the same button and its really annoying-I didnt like the huge weapon crosshairs-During cut scenes the camera shakes WAY too much-Gets really old seeing Laura just being filthy dirty, and always crying the whole game-How Laura holds the guns, especially the Assault Rifle-They had this really cool survival element in the beginning where you had to hunt and catch some food to eat, but you only have to do that ONCE in the whole game. They really should of made it so you had to do it like at least 3 times. It was cool but they just abandoned it..-There is a part where some of the enemies are using only swords and bows, but you go around picking up machine gun and handgun ammo off of them, I found that pretty funny.-Lots of parts where the game forces you to walk super slow. I hate it when games have those parts, and there is a lot of them in this gameThings I really liked about the game:-The bow, Its probably the best thing in the game, its fun to shoot, and fun to upgrade.-The torch mechanic is really cool, but they mainly just use it in the beginning-The relic viewer is very cool. You find little relics and a viewer pops up and allows you to check them out and zoom in and turn them around-The tombs where pretty cool to explore and look around in-The puzzles were alright-The equipment upgrades were pretty fun to do, although pretty easy to getThey REALLY should have added a like ""survival mode"" where you could try to survive against waves of enemies, that would have been really cool and worked perfectly in this game, and would have added a lot to the game play.I did kind of enjoy the cinematic part of the game, but not enough to ignore the mediocre, over scripted and linear game play. Like I said, some entertainment value to be had, if you dont care about actual game play."

This  is expressed in visually and through the audio.The game play merges the classic physical overcoming of obstacles, also seen in previous chapters or in other games like Prince of Persia, with a logic of third-person shooter.There are 5 weapons available: an ax, a gun, a rifle, a machine gun and a bow.Not very long (35 hours) but replayable a couple of times. If you like me find it discounted at 3 euro during the sales ...Also present a multiplayer ""shooter"" mode.To be appreciated it should be played with a controller and I recommend an XBox controller as the game is designed and configured for it.Rating: 8.5 / 10 Cinematographic"

But there was nothing that ever happened in the game that felt new or even particularly fun. If it had average gameplay with no new mechanics, but it had a great story, I would give it a pass. But the gameplay is recycled from so many other third-person action games (Uncharted, ect), there are NO new or innovative mechanics, and the story is cheesey and unoriginal.The graphics were good, I guess. It's a very pretty game, but it's not the kind of game that makes you WANT to stop and admire how pretty or detailed it is. It's not like Skyrim or Shadow of the Colossus.

I guess I would be having 30+ hours in the non-steam version alone. So when I started playing, I literally forgot the story line, Instead I started to fall in love with Lara Croft.She is the most beautiful woman I have come across, in a video game. I can't stop admiring her. I was completely stunned, not because of the story, not because of the gameplay, only because of Lara's beautiful face and the way she changes her face reactions according to different situations. I think I have no other words to explain her beauty, but yeah I do have something most important to tell and that is ""She is Hot"" <3I was not satisfied after finishing the game. I felt I was missing something and HellYeah I found out what was missing!I had a GTX 760 few years before & I used fraps to take approx 50 screenshots of Lara's face expressions and uploaded the snaps to my facebook album so I can admire her anytime. Also I was creating too much scene showing the screenshots to my friends :'PAfter buying the steam version of Tomb Raider(only the base game), I owned a GTX 1060. So Now I want to play this game once again with all graphics settings maxed out. Yes I did. I was not satisfied once again. Still something was missing. I was feeling completely stupid about this.So I used fraps once again to take 500+ screenshots, but this time not only Lara's face expressions also her B**BS and her perect cleavage and I uploaded all those snaps to my facebook in a new album <3I didn't stop there, I used shadowplay to record close-ups of Lara and uploaded them to my Instagram. I put slow motion effects to lara ""jumping"" videos to see how bouncy the two melons are xD and those videos are also in my Instagram posts.Moral : I have just gone extremely crazy with this game and too much Virtual Love for a non-existing character :')Please.See : I had to buy the base game(once again)+dlcs on the sale because I was feeling ashamed that I was not owning the dlcs for a game, which was already a part of me.Though I love this game more than myself, I still felt I didn't complete the game 100%, which takes me to the process of achievement hunting.I managed to complete 35Achieves by myself and the rest were Multiplayer achieves, well the multiplayer was already Dead AF, I thought its impossible to do the 100% achieves -_-But I come to know that there were already mates like me who were dying to finish the game with 100% achieves.So I added those fellos from TR:MP groups and we created a 4 player private party ranked matches, started live voice chat and ""Well you can think of all the stupid things we did just for simple achievemnts"" ;-)I am sorry I was not talking about the game instead I was sharing my feelings about this game thats because this is not just an another game ""to me"". One way or the other this game is a life changer to me.If you think this review is useless, You are free to give a thumbs down for my stupidity.But I am here to inform the devs that, ""Hey Devs, you have done the best thing in your life by creating this masterpeice and I can't explain in words how happy I am everytime I play this game. Keep up the good work,btw I am already into Rise of the Tomb Raider & I have no idea how ROTTR is gonna be a Life Changer for me"" </3Fine, I will give the scores for this game in my point of view(FINALLY) :Graphics : 10/10Audio: 9/10Lara's Voice: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10Storyline: 8/10Happiness: 11/10Virtual Love: 12/10Stupidity: Not Defined !Cons:Graphics are 'Crystal' ClearCut scenes keeps you on the mood ;-)A superstitious storylineAmazing character customizationNice transormaion of Lara from a woman to a survivor queenLara's best weapon is the Bow&Arrow (lot of upgrades available)Pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, grenade launcher keeps you on the edgeI have put these points on the cons because I am sorry I don't find any errors right now.Pros:""CLEAVAGE"""

2502,Fei,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theparrotlover/,2,,1,17.8,July,"20,",437,2,1,"Tomb Raider is a reboot of the -once- successful adventure franchise dating back to PS1. You assume the role of a new Lara Croft, a reality TV archaeologist, in search of a island with mystical storm properties. The game starts off which an explosive cutscene of your ship getting wrecked onto the shore before pitting you in the mysterious island of Yamatai. It's inhabitants? A bit crazy. After your wreck, you're captured by the inhabitants and are forced to find a way off the island. The game is incredibly darker tone than the previous installments, filled with gruesome cutscenes that capture every moment of it. The game has a gritty survival feeling, where Lara's adventure leaves her wounded, gasping, or in plenty of pain. The story is simple at first, slowly changing from escaping the island to uncovering it's mysteries as you climb, battle, and explore Yamatai.Lara is a wonderfully thought out character, and the whole game gives plenty of character development. turning into a simple researcher to a battle-hardened adventurer. The same, however, can't be said for the other survivors or crewmates; they're forgettable, lacking characters with strange quirks that just seem tacked on. The game mostly centers around Lara, so it isn't all too bad. It feels as if they could of done the characters a bit better. Combat in the game is what you'd expect from a third-person adventure game, featuring a no-key/button cover system and basic stealth elements. The AI is well-done, using plenty of tactics to get the drop on Lara with plenty of enemy variety to keep the game entertaining to play. The action is exciting and fun, whether you decide to silently pick off enemies with a bow, or blast your way through with a rifle. Along with the action, some of the most exciting parts are the set-pieces, which are stunning to look at and fun to play though. There are several weapons in the game, which you can upgrade into better weapons multiple times by finding salavage and upgrading; along with upgrading weapons, the game also features a skill point system in which you can unlock certain perks or skills to improve Lara. One of my gripes with the game is that it presents itself as a survival game, yet there's no incentive to hunt or gather things, because hunting rewards you with XP (which isn't very much) and gathering things gives you salvage or progress to challenges and map completion. XP and Salvage are also gained from looting enemies and salvage boxes. There's not much drive for hunting and gathering unless you're a completionist. One of the issues I've had with the game is that it seems to doesn't know where it wants to be. One moment it is insanely over-the-top with crazy action, and the next ultra-realistic with Lara recieving a wound, going through plenty of trouble to get it patched up.Tomb Raider is a well-needed rebirth to the franchise, and a wonderful action adventure game that bends around the genre. The game last around 10-15 hours and is gripping enough to keep you hooked to the very end. I defintely recommend you play it. :DTL;DR----------Game Length: (Hard) 10 hours.+Wonderful character development for Lara.+The Island of Yamatai is absolutely stunning.+The combat is a lot of fun, and the AI behavior is fantastic.+The story is well-written and simple.+The character animations are fluid and smooth.+/- The game is gritty and dark, depends on whether you like that type of stuff. -The other characters feel lacking and uninteresting.-The game can't decide whether it wants to be over-the-top and explosive or ultra-realistic.-Survival elements are non-existent, it's more of an action adventure game than a survival game. Although, it tries and presents itself as one.Play it: Yes. Especially if it's on Sale for $12.50 USD."

The downside is the narrative dissonance between what Lara Croft thinks and what she ends up doing. The story that almost gets to a climax but comes to a halt.

Now it suffers from some of the quirks that other modern day AAA adventure games are famous for: QTEs, Level ups, a Cover system. But it also incorporate some old school elements that have been sorely missed in the genre: Puzzles, exploration, a somewhat decent stealth system and weapons that are also used to gain access to new areas besides the obvious murder applications. I came in expecting a decent story with forgetable gameplay i got decent gameplay with a forgetable story. The characters are bland, unlikeable, and one-dimentional, like someone closed thier eyes and pointed at random at a movie character database and added them to the cast without a second glance. There was plenty of room for interesting character interactions for adding depth to the characters but alas it avoids any character relationships beyond one.The game is definatley worth playing if you are interested in seeing how to design good gameplay, dont expect a story that will grip you or characters that will stay with you as you make your way through th game.

You feel as if the entity is watching you by striking at you with lightning as the rain is pouring down to make you lose your grip and fall to your death.By the time morning rolls around its all gone.The game just becomes 3rd person action game were you go about cleaning the island of it's enemies. No more supernatural enemies or mystery just Call Of Duty soldiers with rifles, shotguns and shields.I do not understand like what happened in the development, there so many ideas:- when you get to the beach it becomes clear that the island has been stranding peoples from all eras, pirates, merchants, WW2 soldiers etc. Why don't you fight against multiple different groups each seeking a different goal.- the game is set in multiple environments but the they all kinda feel the same, like you don't feel the altitude at all.The game is supposed to be set in the mountains but there is no point were you have to follow a narrow path going up and risking to fall, for the majority of the game if you look down you will see the generic walkable ground and not some vista of the mountains. In fact most of the levels seem to be cornered of somehow, I do not remember ever falling out of the level at it's edge.- the platforming, the core traversal mechanic (actually jogging is core traversal mechanic in practice) is boring.It's the same Prince Of Persia/Uncharted style of ledge grabing were you can go and make yourself a coffe while Lara is holding on to the edge.There is no skill involved in traversal, no puzzle of what ledges you need to grab in order to reach your destination because most traversal sections are one way only and no timing skill you don't have to time you jumps at all you just need to reach the end of the ledge.I think you can do most of the platforming with just one finger because Lara doesn't seem to jump farther if jump while running. I don't remember ever having to jump further that before (I write this review some time later though after playing the game).I usually don't care as much and I am not a fan of the old games but after taking a break from the game and playing Batman Arkham City I couldn't help noticing some stuff:- why is Lara for the entire game portrait as weak, like you can be on the beach level near the end fully equipped, leveled up, 3 digit kill count and having overcome some stuff but her expression is ""afraid please help me"".You would think after killing people by driving her pickaxe into their skulls and after rising from blood she should be more like Rambo: First Blood, a predator.Why do Crysis 2, Batman: Arkham Knight and Far Cry get to have confident characters from the start and throughout the game.- why does Lara need to suffer and look injured ALL THE TIME to prove she is strong (wash your face and change clothes there a plenty of downed enemies).I have not played a game were your character get ping ponged so much into everything.Did you really need to have fatalities for all deaths including from the enemies ? it's not a horror game.- you could be at 95% of the game and Lara still says to herself ""You can do it Lara"".Do you think Batman says to himself encouragements or do you think his enemies need encouragements to face Batman.In the end it's meh."

2536,aUNICORNpotato,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aunicornpotato/,2,,1,10.2,November,"11,",162,0,1,"Of the franchise reboot wave, Tomb Raider was among the strongest, played extremely well, and contextualized the icon for the modern era. Sure, the gameplay drew heavy inspiration from Uncharted, but they did a good job of it and Uncharted is a great franchise to draw inspiration from, and on top of all that, the first Uncharted felt like it had drawn some inspiration from past Tomb Raider games anyway (Or perhaps both are drawing upon the shared source of Indiana Jones).But Tomb Raider seems so at odds with itself and unbalanced in weird ways like it started off as one game, and then halfway through development became something entirely different. It seems like the focus of the game shifted at many points throughout development, and never clearly settled on one idea until finally, they decided to go with the Uncharted formula.Secondly, I don't think any of the characters are likable or relatable. Lara is an attractive young girl, but suddenly she's turned into a hardened killer in the blink of an eye? Everything that Lara says is completely forgettable, and there's nothing memorable about her character other than she's attractive.It's fun to play, and definitely worth your time, especially if you're into action adventures at all.7/10"

It results in gameplay that seems at odds with the experience your character ought to be having within the fictional universe. If only there were a term for the incongruity that results from these two different narratives.However, to the credit of Crystal Dynamics, the entire thing never ""falls apart."" Tomb Raider accomplishes very different goals at the same time - not gracefully, but it does accomplish them. The result is one of the better third-person shooters I think I've ever played. It's not flawless - there are a few grindy achievements, in particular, that were wholly unnecessary and detract from the experience overall. But most of these have savegame exploits available in the Guides section.Recommended."

2540,Km@psi.❣Kitty❣,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyKitty_Devil/,2,1,1,28.5,November,"22,",781,0,1,":Tomb Raider is an action-adventure video game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix in 2013. It is the tenth title in the Tomb Raider franchise and works as a reboot that tells from scratch the origins of Lara Croft.The game takes place on Yamatai, a fictional lost island in the dragon’s Triangle off the coast of Japan. This island is shrouded completely with mystery and has gained a fearsome reputation over the years due to all the storms and weather phenomena that happen close to its location. Very little is known about Yamatai’s history, aside from an old story that says that this kingdom was once ruled by a queen named Himiko and that she was known later on in history as the “Sun Queen”. A legend created by common folk saying she had some sort of shamanistic powers that allowed her to control the weather.This title is presented in a third-person perspective and combines action-adventure, exploration and survival mechanics. The player takes on the role of the iconic Lara Croft, a young and ambitious archaeology graduate who stumbles upon some theories about the lost kingdom of Yamatai and the “Sun Queen”. Lara is set out on her first expedition aboard the ship Endurance, led by Dr. James Whitman (a celebrity archaeologist struggling with some financial problems) and a six man crew: Conrad Roth (an old croft family friend and a mentor to Lara herself), Samantha “Sam” Nishimura (Lara’s friend and a Nishimura family descendant), Joslyn Reyes (the skeptical and temperamental mechanic), Jonah Maiava (a kind fisherman and a true believer of the paranormal), Alex Weiss (the goofy electronics specialist) and Angus “Grim” Grimaldi (the gruff Glaswegian helmsman). The gameplay itself is very intuitive, even tho if you never played a Tomb Raider game before, it might take a couple minutes for you to get adjusted to it. Players can easily traverse between visited camps across the island and also use available footpaths, ziplines or climbable tracks to get to different areas of the map.Quick time events (QTE) play a small but also important part in the game and are used wisely throughout the story, to remark crucial points in the game’s plot.The combat uses multiple elements, free aim when using a bow or a gun to hunt down either human enemies or wild animals and the ability to engage in close-quarter combat and perform some beautiful stealth kills. All weapons used can be upgraded as you progress using the salvage you collect by exploring the island and that same salvage can be used to craft arrows and healing items. The player is also given a very useful tool (Lara’s “survival instinct”), which is an ability to scan the area around you and highlight mission points, interactable objects, collectibles and even enemies.It features a good single player story to keep you busy for quite some time but also introduces for the first time a multi player option for the franchise. Well what can i say about the looks in this game? Really good actually and i do hope you have a good graphics card also because watching miss Lara in high quality is on another whole level, hats down!It is pleasing to the eye, no point in lying about it. It was well done and it shows the wonders of how far the technology in the gaming industry has evolved. It becomes more realistic and well detailed as the years go by, how they use the scenery to make the island come to life and also on the little things that transform the characters into the unique individuals that they are, their facial expressions, body movement, the acrobatics involved, voice acting and all the special effects used. Awesome job!The enemies and wild life are also well polished, aside a few minor bugs but nothing that i wasn’t expecting to find. The uneasy feeling of being surrounded by nature and that at any given moment something can come out of the shadows or the bushes to grab you, it’s really a very good quality. The design of the puzzles are nowhere near the difficulty of the ones in the old titles but the developers gave it some justice and you can finish them without too much pain or struggle.The music and soundtrack used are quite pleasing to my ears, i enjoyed it. Nice key moments with audio cues related to some kind of changes in the scenario or the sudden appearance of an enemy. Helps to really keep the game flowing and to keep you on your toes. Voice acting was also a strong point for me here, good job for all the voice actors and all their time and effort put into this project. They really gave life to their characters.The only thing i have to point out is that, even tho i actually really enjoyed Lara’s voice actress, she was indeed quite unique and gave that youthful touch to it (and trust me i am not saying this in a bad way or even complaining really) i just think that a tiny bit less emphasis in some hurtful noises would be better suited for the character. That’s it. Aside from that, Lara’s voice is quite feminine, sexy, young and has all the qualities this character is supposed to have to be a female badass. She is not yet the femme fatale we know from the previous titles, she still needs time to grow and mature but she will get there eventually. I strongly recommend this game to all the fans and non fans too, it will not let you down. And you will spend countless hours enjoying yourself playing a fun and fearless character. This game has a lot to offer and for you to explore. Just keep an open mind and enjoy it without the influence of what others tell you about it.I really enjoyed playing it, was quite fun and exciting. The story is actually well presented and draws you in until the end. You will have to put some effort into some areas and be quick on your fingers with the QTE’s, you miss one too many and is bye bye peaches to Lara! XD It really hurt me inside to see her die because of my mistakes and bad gameplay, i felt sorry for her and my bad gaming skills. T_T"

Did not regret it for a second, the game is pretty awesome. DLC is absolutely optional, all about multiplayer.POSITIVES:- At the first glace you can see how good and detailed are the graphics. I usually don't care that much about it, but this game gives you the reason to care. It also runs smoothly on mid tier PCs.-  While it is an exploration game, it does not overwhelm and punish you, the exploration is fun and incredibly nicely incorporated into the game.- Gameplay and controls are fluid, the learning curve is steep for first 45 minutes, but after that you shouldn't have any issues with it.- Decent stealth parts. Wish they were more than a prelude to shooting action, but they're generally fun.NEGATIVES:- It is kinda sandbox open-world, but it's a bit linear. After you have finished a region, it's almost empty.- The story is weird and hard to follow at the beginning, but it comes together towards the end.NEUTRALS:- Poor multiplayer, but the SP is so great I don't even care one bit.Overall, I don't think many people will find it as their favorite game, but I struggle to find reasons not to like it. It's just great, but not prefect. I wish the island part was more engaging, they really could've created something special with it, especially considering how great the graphics are. It's more a colletion of paths that could've easily happened in a jungle. Maybe I'm just too influenced by all the survivor movies and games like GTA/SR, but the location is not homogeneous as it could've been.Anyhow, I'm looking forward to buying ROTTR in near future after playing this one."

As a first timer into the Tomb Raider series, I may or may not be making a quick judgement. However, I can definitely say that this game is worth it. Of course on high settings everything looks absolutely gorgeous. The combat flows extremely well and everything you do makes sense. Every mechanic fits into the story so that you don't feel like you're missing out on anything and the camera is almost always positioned so that you'll realize where to look next.

It's truly a trustworthy reborn of the TR franchice and an amazing depiction of Lara's commence as a survivor and, of course, as a tomb raider.For the ones who played TR games like Legend or Underworld, you'll find this game still being a TR you always knew, yet much more plausible and credible in its story, world, enemies, mechanics, physics, customization, weapons, gadgets and Lara, the heroine herself.For those of you who have not played TR before, give this game a try. It's full of action, exploration, stealth and surviving in a cursed island. I'd say it's kind of an Uncharted game, but with a female hero (heroine) and a practically open world (much like the freedom you have in Dead Space when exploring the space-ship stations, maybe even more). If you're somehow into any of the games like Prince of Persia, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Hitman, Splinter Cell... I can assure you, you'll love this one :)"

I'm not going into much detail with the story, but I personally liked the direction they were going.What I will mention though, is that some plot-points during the story often don't make a lotta sense, or are just incredible short sighted. Characters with essential influence being killed without much fanfare leave you wondering what could've been if the potential some of those characters had was realized.Also, some ""twists"" you can see coming a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mile away. Don't expect TLOU storytelling.As mentioned before, this linear adventure game features iconic Lara Croft basics, such as climbing dangerous terrain, fighting adversaries with a decent arsenal, hunting animals and surviving falls that would leave more than just a mark.There's a crafting system, that relies on Lara looting enemies after a fight and actively rewards exploring the environment. Just like the game itself, in concept this is simple, there is just a single crafting material that you use towards upgrading your arsenal and gear. This is smart, since the adventure here is the main focus and a crafting aspect should not take too much time to distract from rock-climbing and zip-line riding goodness. Still, the upgrades are interesting enough and encourage the player to keep upgrading Lara's gear.Fighting adversaries can be a bit stiff at times, but it feels satisfying shooting arrows at armored enemies and seeing their armor fly off as they recoil in pain.The cover is simple, again, but serves its purpose.What's the worst aspect for me, is the fact that this game has some quick-time events (QTE) thrown into the mix. A popular gameplay mechanic at that time, it now has become a no-go for developers if they're serious about engaging the player. QTEs like in this Tomb Raider, have  aged well.For a game released in 2013, this still looks good. Sure, you can tell this is several years old, but I was able to basically max out the graphic settings on 1440p and having it run mostly smoothly and I have to give kudos to the devs for that one. During my playthrough I have not encountered a single crash, yet a lone a game breaking bug. Good stuff.For what it's worth, I can only recommend this game. Even though it suffers from some shortcomings that were fine back then, but fail to hold up now, it satisfied my need for action-adventure in a Tomb Raider style sufficiently.A fair deal on msrp, and a really good deal when on sale.Score: 7/10"

This game is one example of what games should be, Good story, interesting cast, Good voice acting, Pretty enviorments, Good combat, and nice things to upgrade Lara with.That said, this game, is in my opinion well optimized, and runs smoothly, yes the game also has some flaws, but it never takes away from the immersion. QTE fill in pretty well with Cutscenes, and gameplay is never really broken, Saying that because Lara can be pretty stupid with grappin Ledge's sometimes, or simply fall off and die.There are alot collectibles to find, and every single one comes with an interesting story behind it, The GPS's, Documents, Relics, and treasure maps await you, and ofcourse in true Tomb raider style, there are some tombs to be raided, though in my own opinion they are way to short and easy.If you are thinking about buying this game, i would say, go do it, Cause you will not regret it.and i don't care you do not like this sort of game, you like what i like, GOOD games. Games that are worth you're money.As for me, i will deff, buy the ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"". Will revieuw that aswell!As for now, the pros and cons of the game with ofc, the game score i think it deserves.*Good Action/Stealth game*Good Combat*Interesting Story*Graphics are amazing and stunning*Alot of collectibles to find on you're own*Lara had a big and nice reboot*Can decide to go stealth or gunzablaze towards enemy*Bunny dollCons:*Multiplayer []* Lara can sometimes be frustrating by jumping off cliffs * QTE can sometimes be replaced with combat* Boss battle [Final] was not what i was expectingScore: 9/10 Beast of a game, Go pick it up."

2626,✪ ZΛK-ƬΉΣ-BᄂΛᄃK,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zaktheblack/,2,,1,3.6,June,"28,",227,0,1,"This time reviewing a perfect rated game. First of all, I have completed overall 100% of this game (not by achievement side) means all collectibles, challenges and everything. So let's start.★ Gameplay ➜Tomb Raider is an Action, adventure,puzzle-solving third person game based on an open-world environment. There is only one map in this game and enough to explore the whole world. There is no mini-map. By its name, the game series should be more focused on searching for tombs, artifacts, relics, historical interest, puzzle, traps, etc. I was expecting that but it doesn't exist properly here. The thing is something different. First 80% of gameplay gonna be end by saving your friends and learning the survival tactics which makes this game more enjoyable but doesn't judge its name properly. But the developer arranged the whole trilogy successfully like the next sequel is going to be more tomb searching rather than learning survival tactics and the main protagonist of this game Lara Croft going to be a great adventurer and experienced.In this game, the gameplay is mainly focused on using environmental stuff properly, learn survival tactics against some crazy enemies and weak animals. So hunting is a part of this game but not so much enlarged. There are some RPG elements I have found. The skill tree was really good but expecting some more useful skills. Combat is based on weapons bow and cover as well as playing stealth is important to success in Lara's opinion. Bow, Weapon and it's customization is also great, you have to explore for parts which are really enjoyable. Here searching for collectibles is interesting because every time you have try something new, so never felt bored and reveals interesting information. Climbing is my favorite part in this game because it is not only restricted in 'W and Space' but also using equipment is also necessary as there are climbing-axe,rope ascender, rope arrow etc . Enemies are crazy, they do everything to get Lara. So every time searching for something new is required to survive their ambushes. Quick time event and close quarter combat were like an action movie. I think this part made this game famed. Besides insane fighting with enemies, there are some optional Tomb which is not so much puzzled in my opinion. Lara has got a great instinct, you have to use it to progress in this case. Using fire torch in dark caves thrilled me. There is no repetitive content so I never felt bored. But I have felt some lacking like there is no underwater part as Lara is on an island. There are no survivors without Lara and it's team so there is no side mission in this game. Lara can't climb trees etc.★Story ➜Story is really cool, some people suggested me to explore it's story. After completing the story, I am fully satisfied by story progression. Basically, Lara wanted to be an explorer and adventurer from her childhood, wanted to explore the beauty of this world. So as part of his dream, she was in a team traveling by ship intending to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai which is the Island of Japan. There is a famous archaeologist in that team but the whole team always listens to Lara as she has got good instincts. According to Lara's speech, they changed directions and their ship crashed by a dangerous storm. So they stuck on a mysterious island as there is no escape for dangerous weather and separated from teammates. Now the journey starts from here.The story was full of mystery and suspense, related to their whole team like a Hollywood movie.Story was large enough to enjoy.★★ Graphics, Optimization, Soundtrack and Miscellaneous ➠➠➠As a game of 2013 graphics designing was really cool. Design of Character, Environment, Jungle, Tree, details, texture, shadow, water, bloom, lens and flare, sky, cloud everything was fine. Not best but fine. The combination of shiny and stormy weather was amazing. Optimization was quite well. But I was expecting better sound quality and more music. Faced a lot of bugs like I have executed jumping upward but Lara jumps on right or left and dead. The animation and movement screen during the quick time event like escaping a collapsing cave was up to the mark. I was amazed by their story representation.★Multiplayer ➠So many don't know about the multiplayer of this game. Multiplayer is actually quite fun. It is totally PVP and has got a match instantly. Ping was Under 150 which means totally playable, PVP rewards are good, can be used in single player.Multiplayer of this game is also recommended if anyone wants to spend time.Personal Overall Rating -19/20As a Tomb Raider rating -6/10 (Less historical stuff and puzzles, more action,adventure and RPG)By the way, Lara is one of the greatest female thief in this world.Sorry for any mistakes If I made any"
2627,Payne,https://steamcommunity.com/id/solemn-philosopher/,15,,1,17.1,November,"27,",341,0,1,"Recommended, but with some reservations...POSITIVESThe Tomb Raider reboot is visually stunning. I like the exploration aspects and the tomb raiding is especially fun. I was thrilled when the game opened with survivalism and hunting gameplay, but unfortunately it never plays much of a factor. The initial stealth combat and action sequences are exciting.  NEGATIVESTomb raiding is infrequent and short. I was disappointed with the enemy AI. Once you are discovered they gain super-radar and always know your exact location (a major pet peeve of mine). I found the action and combat sequences increasingly ridiculous and overly long. Lara vs. 1000 Mercenaries and the mercenaries don't stand a chance.BOTTOM LINEI liked Tomb Raider initially, but I struggled to finish the game. My rating is 6/10: Good, but not overly memorable or long lasting. If you like long over-the-top action and combat sequences, you might enjoy the entirety of the game. However, if you get bored with ridiculous and long action sequences, you may want to consider passing on Tomb Raider."
2628,Primm Slim,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CornyKelleher/,2,,1,10.2,January,8,637,0,1,"I was surprised how well this held up! It still looks really nice and the platforming and puzzle gameplay is fun. The shooting is average, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience. The story and voice acting are pretty poor, as is Lara's characterisation, but there are plenty of bombastic set pieces that make the campaign cool and overall worth experiencing."

2630,://Sineater,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sineatermkii/,2,,1,48.4,August,"31,",459,0,1,Usually a remake of games turns out really bad in my experience and opinion but I've grown up with Tomb Raider pretty much all my life and wow this was wonderful. I had no problem with it once so ever and I even went back to complete most of it on Xbox and am almost done with completing it fully on PC. This has to be one of my all time favorite games. I loved the new Lara and I really enjoyed the story. So excited for the next one. I happened to get the Xbox one when it first came out with the little booklet with character designs and the story and it was all just really perfect. I wasnt planning on getting the PC version but the DLC and the game together were on sale and so I bought it all for a really cheap price and it was so worth it. Strongly STRONGLY recommend this game to anyone.

Despite a strong showing in the early titles, Tomb Raider seemed to have lost its way.When I saw that a reboot was in the works, my first thought was that it was going to be a poorly-crafted ripoff of all of the work that the Uncharted folks have put into evolving the genre.  Instead, I was rewarded with what is easily one of the best games of the year, and may be my personal favorite.What the Uncharted series did for the genre the original Tomb Raider created, the reboot has done once more.  The storytelling, pacing, and gameplay are fantastic, and the graphics are some of the best I've ever seen.I loved this game!  Here's hoping they make more."

It's more of a cover shooter than a puzzles-in-a-tomb game (the puzzles are much worse & easier than in Anniversary/legend). They removed the good bits of Tomb Raider and replaced them with bland gameplay. Screw this game for getting my hopes up.

Generic plot: find, help, unfortunate event happens, repeat. Dumbest ""supporting"" character death I ever saw:Tiring, pointless cutscene talks, desperate to develop some meaning in the characters.

All I saw was dreadfully basic game with choppy attention to detail. Right off the bat, Lara falls onto a spike and she never so much as bandages the wound. This would be fine if she did not go wading through blood and feces almost immediatley. The game is totally unbelievable and unimmersive, like a grindhouse film, yet the developers try to present the game world as harsh and survivalistic. The treacherous tone and atmosphere they set are absolutley ruined by Lara's god-like immunity to fatal injuries and the abundance of equipment that are ""randomly laying around"" the jungle. This game really is a terrible re-boot in the sense that they totally changed the mood of the game, but kept Lara a near-immortal Indiana Jones like character (as she was in the OG Tomb Raider games). It clashes horrendously and completely removes any sense of urgencey or danger.The gameplay is boring, frankly. Puzzles, stealth, and combat are basic. Some of these puzzles don't even make any logical or practical sense (ex: several times I lit a basic wooden torch and that caused a bridge to deploy itself). The world feels taylor-made for you to dominate. I lost interest rapidly. The interractive cutscenes are badly designed and are just plain time consuming at some points (nobody likes watching the same cutscene 12 times because it's hard to see the buttons they want you to press). The engine runs great and the combat is free of any clunkyness, but there's really nothing interesting that is brought to the table. If you love fast-paced action games, this might be for you.If you want to try this game you should absolutley get it on sale. If you are nitpicky about details, this game will be like getting your teeth pulled. I guess the ""overwhelmingly positive"" review status led me to expect better."

The old Lara which was a gun slinging, gritting buxom femme fatale has been swapped for a younger, vulnerable, unsure and more realistically proportioned Lara. I found this Lara to be a huge improvement over her predecessor and found myself actually caring for her survival and being cautious rather than going in guns blazing and simply restarting every time I die. The game mechanics work well and don't deviate too much from previous games. There is the option to do some portions of the game stealthily and save yourself some ammo or you can go in guns blazing and have some fun. There is a level up system that provides some benefits while playing the story but it is ultimately limited and you'll only be using a certain set of skills.The textures and graphics are extremely well done, creating unique areas/tombs that come across as repetitive and as a result I found myself happily exploring the island and waling everywhere rather than using fast travel. The story is above average and sewn together fairly well but it did feel a little overdrawn at times.  Although I will say the voice acting is superb. Nobody plays the multiplayer so don't bother buy any dlc for it.If you've ever played a previous game in the franchise and were skeptical about this reboot don't be, its worth your time and money. This game is a very strong 8.5 out of ten and is a welcome addition to the series. I'm looking forward to the next installment.Also as far as the supposed ""rape"" scene goes the guy puts his hand on lara's hip and it lasts about five seconds (unless you mess up the input.) People overreacted to it."

In Tomb Raider, young Lara, 21, finds herself stranded on a mysterious island after being shipwrecked by a mysterious storm. From this moment on, Lara will have to fight for her life with bandits, wild animals and mystical ""storm guards"", with whom the ancient secret of the island is connected.In Tomb Raider (2013), players will have to explore a huge island, passing it up and down. The game world is open, which allows Lara to go virtually anywhere, although some places can only be reached through the story or after obtaining certain skills. The heroine will not only have to travel and get treasures, but also defend herself from misfortunes, in which she will need several types of different firearms, as well as a bow, which Lara will be armed with throughout the game."

One such incident that really showed this, without spoiling too much, was her first kill.As for the game as a whole, I found that it looked really amazing for when it was released, the newer mechanics, such as the climbing walls and the ability to burn through things was definitely a nice additionI definitely recommend this game for people who enjoy both Tomb raider and the exploration genre"

The game is linear but you have a bit of freedom to change your path every now and then.  Make no mistake this is not an open world shooter, but I still found myself feeling like I had room to explore.  The optional side quest tombs are a nice addition as a way to take a breather from the main storyline.  There are not excessive amounts of quick time events, and the one's that are there feel like they belong.  Visually the game is beautiful and runs flawlessly on my pc.

Now you're stuck with (a lot of) cutscenes, mindless combat and the feeling of repetitiveness. If you're looking for puzzles, there's hardly any. The ""essence"" of Tomb Raider?

The game is ultra-cheap if you buy in on sale (I think I bought it at 84Rs in India). For a 2013 game the graphics are pretty stellar. I make this point because before TR, I had started playing Far Cry 3, but I felt like that game was too old for playing at this day and age. And incredibly slow too, though I have been promised that the story is worth it, I did not feel like playing through it. TR was not like that even though it was released around the same time. The game is fast paced whether you are running, climbing, grappling or shooting. The story is quite gripping and the characters draw you in. One issue I had though was that the running, grappling, climbing stuff is much more enjoyable using a controller while shooting required a KB-M combination. I often had to keep switching between the two as I found shooting using a controller way more difficult. I wished PC versions using a controller had the auto-aim support option like Play station and Xbox. (Apologies if this does exist, kindly let me know if there is a way to achieve this) The game itself is absolutely stellar in all aspects. There are some incredible fight sequences, especially the final boss fights and some levels are pure puzzles and needed some thinking on my side. The game does lead you through in the general direction of progression, but does not hold your hand like a baby and you still need to think a little. I can't wait to jump on to Rise of the Tomb Raider!"

2709,๖ۣۜMidnight||Dreamer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDarkStorm/,2,,1,50.8,June,"12,",463,1,1,"Reminiscent of the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider boasts absolutely gorgeous visuals, fantastic art direction and design, clear/crisp audio, well-designed mechanics, and an excellent ambient soundtrack. While Tomb Raiders level design isn't necessarily unique, it's exceptionally well done and incredibly beautiful. With mountainous vistas, lush forests, craggy beachs, and detailed interiors, Tomb Raider is definitely one of the most beautiful works of the year. Breathtaking visuals aside, another one of Tomb Raiders major points of interest is the motion capture technique for Lara's model. When trekking through the landscapes, whether she's running, jumping (passive interactions with the level), in water (my favorite animations), climbing, or taking cover, Lara's motions are realistic and absolutely absorbing. Not since Uncharted have I seen such excellent motion capture techniques. Although Tomb Raider is a reboot AND origin story, it does an admirable job of setting up the Lara Croft mythos. Expect a modern retelling of our classic heroine though, which by no means incorporates dinosaurs (as of yet). While this installment focuses heavily on streamlining an actual story, compared to the tomb by tomb design of the classics, you can still expect to ""raid those tombs"", as the island of Yamatai is pockmarked by tombs of varying design and difficulty. The tombs aren't at all difficult, and while each tomb has an actual puzzle, don't expect a classic Tomb Raiding experience. The plot behind Tomb Raider incorporates supernatural elements, which befits the mythos, and is a fairly well written adventure. Multiplayer makes an appearance in Tomb Raider as well, and is on occasion entertaining, but is by no means a fleshed out experience. It's dull and nowadays, dead.Introduced in the beginning of the story as a young, innocent and inexperienced University graduate, Lara's transformation to that of heroine and survivor might be considered extreme and unlikely, considering the events that she is placed through. Consider, though, that this is Lara Croft - indestructible, beautiful, and smart (she's still gorgeous, to all you nay-sayers). Unfortunately, Lara's character is the only one of interest, and the only one with character development of any sort (as all the supporting cast of characters are cliched and average). All in all, Tomb Raider boasts excellent production values, and is a well written and developed product. I highly recommend this cinematic journey, as it's definitely worth the money and the time."

The bow was definitely my favorite part--second to the site seeing amongst the cliffs and gorgeous sun glows.Putting aside two big pet peeves, the overall game was well worth it. Took getting used to watching a legit cut-seen only to realize I'm supposed to be paying attention to little buttons flashing up on my screen. Sort of took from the enjoyment when I could not longer watch the cut seen because I was so frustrated at dying by missing the ques. And lets just face it: no human being could sustain as many falls, knocks, cuts, and bashes as Lara Croft. Like seriously. No one. Not even her.

2716,Marksman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/freethemind/,8,,0,11.4,January,21,122,0,1,"Tomb Raider (2013) is a AAA game with a B movie story.This is the second time the Tomb Raider franchise has been rebooted. The original series was primarily focused on exploration and puzzle-platforming. This time around, there is less emphasis on exploration, and the puzzle-platforming is too easy. The gameplay involves traversing mostly linear levels peppered with collectibles, combat, and action sequences. In the later portions of the game, it's about 80% action/combat and 20% exploration.I found both the gameplay and the narrative to be lackluster. The gameplay is hampered by the overuse of forced camera perspectives, scripted sequences & cutscenes (including ultra-violent scripted death scenes), hand-holding (abundant resources, automatic crouching, tomb entrances being clearly marked), and numerous QTEs. Beyond that, it's a bog standard third-person action-adventure with some RPG and survival-craft elements tacked on.The narrative is held back by an excessive usage of cliches, an over-reliance on tropes, and flat characters. Every character is poorly written, except maybe for Lara herself, and the plot overall is rather hackneyed.Perhaps the biggest issue with Tomb Raider is the disconnect between the gameplay and the narrative. Such dissonance is not always a negative thing in games, but neither is it typically as egregious as it is here. The game takes itself very seriously, and is presented more like a movie. Things that happen within the narrative and in cutscenes are often disregarded, discouraged, or contradicted by the actual gameplay.Suffice it to say, the suspension of disbelief required to go along with the story is tremendous. PS: Although the game has a native Linux build available, Steam does not list it as having Linux support. The native version uses OpenGL (via Feral's IndirectX). Proton may offer better performance with Vulkan."
2717,Canterbury,https://steamcommunity.com/id/canterburyfails/,4,,1,17.0,February,"12,",137,0,1,"Short, sweet, satisfying. Almost everything about this game is satisfying. The one con I might acknowledge is the post-game artifact hunting to 100% the game. This review is regarding the single-player campaign only. I haven't touched the multiplayer, and I don't plan on it. I'll play both sequels, but I feel like this is a weird series to add a multiplayer component onto. The campaign is a great introduction to Lara for the modern generation of 3D platformer/shooter hybrids. I know this review is a little late, but this is my third time playing through Tomb Raider, albeit the first time on Steam (much more gorgeous on intel i7 compared to a console). In around 20 hours, I managed to both beat the campaign and 95% the game with no guides or walkthroughs for any tombs or collectibles. I probably won't come back for the last few collectibles. I wanted to 100% the game, but a few of them are just in tedious locations it feels like, and I don't think that hoarder mentality is meant for me, but that's personal preference. Overall, a great game worth the price of entry if it's listed for less than $30, as it normally is these days, but I probably wouldn't pay more than that given the brevity of campaign and lack of replayability in terms of RPG mechanics. I'll most likely wait for the latter two games in the series to dip in price before adding them to my Steam collection as well. Great game overall."

I thought I'd find a Lara Croft with oversized assests and scantily clad but surprisingly, that wasn't the case. Lara is pretty and athletic, yet feminine and I absolutely loved playing a game, where the hero was female. Girl power! Lol.When you first meet Lara she seems a little unsure and vulnerable, but her quest to find and save her friends, for whom she feels responsible for bringing to the island, quickly sees her grow into a very confident and capable fighter. Along her adventure she becomes an explorer, survivor, salvager and even a geeky archaeologist, as she fastinates over discovered relics and ancient civilisations.                                                Learning Lara's abilities/skills and weapons was progressive, giving you plenty of time to get used to them. I did however have a favourite weapon and would often reach for her bow, loving the added touch of the flame arrows skill. Combat is varied giving you some situations when you can use long distance weapons, others where a more stealth approach is better suited and some where it's full on hand-to-hand combat, which would often have you on the edge of your seat using every tactic you could just to stay alive!  Lara climbs, slides up and down ropes, makes daring jumps onto ledges, up cliff faces and between ropes in mid-air, squeezes through tight ravines and is even swept down a perilous river.. and all set in some amazing surroundings (which will have you endlessly clicking on screenies) which get you totally absorbed in Lara's world, making it easy to connect and empathise with her throughout her adventure. Combat, cutscenes and challenges, weapons, skills, puzzle-solving and exploring.. with an interesting storyline, all set in breathtaking surroundings AND a female heroine too... this game has it all. Great fun!Awesome game. Loved every minute of it!10/10"

Everything about it shines with polish and care.Graphics: Lush, gorgeous vistas and caverns pop off of the screen with detail, and are varied enough to keep things interesting.Gameplay: Strong platforming, stealth, and gunplay elements combine to make a cohesive, but fairly linear experience.Sound: Simply sounds great. Listen to this on a 2.1 system or higher preferably of high quality.Multiplayer: Honestly is a bit weak. Everything about it works well, but it doesn't save itself from feeling tacked on.Overall, Highly worth it... especially if you can find it on sale for a good price.

Depending on what you want this could be good or bad. Uncharted has better story telling and production values, whereas Tomb Raider has much better variety of gameplay and level design.In TR there are 4 weapons you can carry on you: bow, pistol, machine gun, shotgun as well as a pickaxe for a melee weapon. Actually, the pickaxe, bow, and technically shotgun are all used in many of the platforming/puzzle elements as well. Very good design. There are also alternate firing modes for every weapon (the pistol is DLC though), skills to be unlocked, and upgrades for weapons. This game is like if somebody took the Uncharted idea, but wanted to add more gameplay elements to make it more fun.Before getting to the multiplayer section, I should note that the story in this game is more dark/supernatural oriented so be advised. Also the camera during cutscenes is unbelievably shaky which can be a little headache inducing. I think they were trying to go for the whole ""someone is filming this while on their phone"" type thing.Multiplayer:I'm a bit shocked that I've enjoyed the MP of this game when I rarely do for most games. Part of this is because I usually have to enjoy a good single player experience and get ""attached"" to a game/characters and a lot of MP-focused games may not have this. The other reason I think I enjoy this is because of how you gain experience in ""stages"": Obviously if you are amazingly good at the game you'll be getting experience from kills but also a lot of experience from ""feats"" like killing 5 enemies in a row without dying or getting headshots. If you are mediocre at the game you only get a moderate amount of exp from kills but there are certain feats that are specific to being ""mediocre"" so to speak. You won't get as much exp as if you were really good (duh!) but you will get some. The really cool thing though is how you still get SOME exp (though not much) if you are terrible. There are some feats that are specific to not being very good so you can still earn SOMETHING. Again, you won't get much...but at least it's not an all or nothing type thing.Some people might think this is similar to a ""participation trophy"" but it really isn't due to the fact that better players will get more exp than worse players. A true participation trophy is something everyone gets and therefore ""equalizes"" everyone regardless of how good or bad you are.Also of note for the multiplayer: You can earn exp while in private matches (which is awesome!) so you can just have fun with your specific friend group rather than fighting against max level players who've been at it probably since the game came out.Overall, TR is a really good game with an interesting MP that you might like if you aren't usually into other MP type games."

You have the ability to upgrade Lara's skills and weapons in order to become stronger against your opponents.However this game has astonishing graphics and the fact that Lara feels like a real person, the game itself felt different to me than the older ones I used to play (The first six games from Core Design, not Legend, Anniversary and Underworld). Where the older games used puzzles, acrobatics and thoughtful levels as recipe, this game aims more for the action, collectibles & upgrades, button cutscenes, and most of all, on the events around Lara Croft itself. The outcome of this recipe is that you feel more connected to Lara and you are willing to spend more time in this game. I finished this game on 100% and enjoyed the game alot! I recommend it to anyone who love the Tomb Raider series, adventure games or just Lara Croft. Altough i want to say that this game is definitely not like predecessors because of the different developer team, Crystal Dynamics."

There are things that games can very easily excel at, and a realistic movie presentation is not one of these things.

The story and pacing were quite good, and the cutscenes were interesting and meaningful.  This was one of the few games in this genre where I wasn't mashing buttons trying to skip cutscenes.  I actually cared about what happened to the characters.  Lara actually had reason and drive to do the things she does, and you can see the consequences of her actions.The gameplay is pretty solid.  Platforming is straightforward and usually successful where it should be.  Melee combat took a little getting used to, but this was mainly to allow for learning what quick time events would be popping up.  That's really my only qalms with the game, is the instant and unnecessary QTE's during certain unavoidable encounters.  Having to do them on a keyboard is pretty hamfisted compared to a controller.The skill system and weapon modding system are straightforward and effective.Overall I'd give this game an 8 out of 10, just below other favorites like the Uncharted series.  Definitely worth a try if you enjoy those."

To show her development and how she becomes a great tomb raider as we know. The presentation is really impressive, not just the overall environment and architecture, but they put very strong emotional characters to express the survival feeling. For the gameplay, it's balanced between platforming, action, and some puzzles as the series was. The controls are solid and animation is fluid. It's a first time I see dynamic cover system for Lara and it's works well. Combat is fun even it's easy due to upgrade and stealth element is based on line of sight and sound. I love exploration and each relic and document are worth to find out as it give you more info. and what happen to the island.However, it doesn't feel like survival as cutscene presentation. Hunting and scavenging give nothing but XP and savage as I think that savage point could be use more than upgrade like crafting ammo or food and it helps to limit OP player at the end. Some skills are quite useless and provide ammo is exceed which ruin survival feels. For the tomb puzzle, it's creative using physics, but it feels short and not much complex as previous series. And this game is not fully open-world, most of them are linear, but you can back to explore for detail and reward. I wont review for multiplayer as this series focus on single play, but ti's quite fun. [TressFX is a first usage, not perfect but it's pretty cool tech.]I can see hard work from Crystal dynamics with details and presentation. I like how Lara born this way. Even, it had minor flaws. It's really hard to get away from overall masterpiece. It's great fun, it's emotional. You won't regret."
2770,Ezekiel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ezekiel43/,58,3,0,30.1,February,"17,",240,4,1,"Tomb Raider exemplifies much of what I dislike about games nowadays. I believe this series has amazing potential, which was never realized with the older games and, because of recent trends, likely never will be.There are too many “cinematic” interruptions and little things that take control away from the player, like forced walking and times when Lara refuses to light and put out torches, saying, “I can’t do that now.” In the first hour of the game, there are few moments in which you’re fully in control. New games replace player agency with presentation.The game features ridiculously fragile and predictable roller coaster environments. Lara’s luck is amusing. You know that linear path will crumble and explode perfectly around you as you jump from platform to platform or tumble and slide down, you know you’ll swing against that conspicuous climbable wall after that rope you’ll climb across is cut and you know there’s gonna be an “exciting” river ride if you try to cross those raging waters. The quick time events are worse. Setpieces and QTEs usually feel like scenes for actors, that have to be repeated until they’re performed just right, so that they look good to the viewer. I'd have had more fun if they had removed most of the predictable cinematic setpieces and integrated the fights more naturally into the exploration.The transparency of action movie games like Tomb Raider: In nearly every fight, you’re crouched on one side of an arena and you have to kill waves of enemies on the other. The fights are too contained. In the bigger areas the enemies always wait in little, widely dispersed groups, conveniently having conversations for you to listen to. I like the fight near the end of the game, where you have to advance through enemies, but there is almost none of that in the game.I don’t want to hold a button to aim my ranged weapon (zooming the picture in) in a game that’s mainly about shooting. You already know where you want to shoot with the orientation of the camera. It’s an unnecessary strain (Why is there not a toggle option for aiming?) and I find the camera zoom slightly disorienting. Just keep the dot on the center of the screen until I put my gun away. I prefer the gunplay of Max Payne 3, where you can shoot at any time and the camera is pulled back so that you can see more.The automatic cover system is alright, but I'd rather control Lara myself. She doesn't always lean out of cover how I want her to. Manual cover systems let you lean in any direction. I want to be able to stand during gunfights so that I can move faster between cover. It's nice, however, that she doesn't foolishly press her back to the wall, like other action heroes.Why does nearly every modern game need upgrade systems and other RPG elements? They made the guns much less effective than they should be to validate the XP system. Enemies can take a lot of bullets to kill, and the combat becomes too easy if you explore, collect and upgrade. With temporary weapon pickups, it's easier to keep the game balanced. Temporary pickups and lower ammo capacities also require the player to move more during gunfights, keeping them from being shooting galleries (in which you're always crouched on one side). The permanent carry system in Tomb Raider kind of contradicts the gritty realism the game is going for. How does Lara carry a shotgun and a rifle on her back without them getting entangled with the bow and quiver? The bow disappears whenever another weapon is used. Even if it’s just the pistol, which, unlike the shotgun, bow and machine gun, you can always see anyway.Another thing that bothers me about the bow is that enemies can neither see nor hear arrows whizzing by, which dulls the stealth. They can only hear the impact of it, if it’s nearby.They tried to mix the fights up with big fighters, but their sizes made those moments pretty silly and weird. One guy is like 9 feet tall for some odd reason. In an older Tomb Raider, he would have been a monster instead of a human. Some ancient protector.The wildlife is an illusion. Only the wolves in the beginning and at one point in the middle are threatening and only at one part in the beginning does Lara need to feed herself. After that, hunting just adds to your XP, which increases in a multitude of other ways. Tomb Raider pretends to be a survival game, but those aspects are pretty bare and quickly forgotten.The mechanics are made so that anyone can play the game and that makes exploration bland. A special sense reveals all the secrets in the world and all the jumps are simple. There isn’t even a lot of jumping and climbing, which was the best thing about Tomb Raider: Anniversary. That game combined challenging platforms with puzzles in a way that made surmounting them satisfying. I wish they'd bring back some of the acrobatics (like wall running with a rope and jumping off walls while running on them) and timing of the older games instead of inserting so much slow climbing. Tombs have taken a backseat to the action and are too short and few. Lara is an archaeologist, an explorer, but in this game she spends almost the whole adventure killing.Why does Lara always touch rock walls when she is walking? I think this started with Uncharted. It looks weird there too.The journals feel arbitrary. Like the characters wouldn’t actually write them and put them in such convenient locations. Especially the ones written by Lara’s friends.If you wanna tell an origin story, do it convincingly. I didn't believe this inexperienced girl wearing nothing but a tank top could survive the harsh conditions, completely dominate an island of armed men and make such a change by the end of the game. From the beginning, she is an amazing killer. They only explain her abilities briefly briefly through one of her monologues, in which she says that she did some treks and target practice with Roth, but it's unfortunate that we never see it, considering how powerful she is and the fact that she has never been in a life or death situation or killed anyone. Her moans, cries and anguish continue through more than half the game. Should all the men she kills in the first hour not harden her? She has this meek expression and a voice that breathes exasperatedly through almost every line, making her look even less imposing. I don’t like her outfit. A simple shirt worked in the old games because she was supposed to be cool and sexy, but in this grittier game she looks too bare. Why doesn’t she grab a coat off a dead body if she shivers and sniffs? Everybody else on the island is smart enough to wear a jacket. And you would think she’d take off those three earrings with all that tumbling, falling and skidding about. The game takes itself too seriously, showing Lara as sensitive and inexperienced in the cutscenes and then letting us dominate groups of armed men. All the abuse and her gory, screaming death scenes (one featuring a branch impaling her throat) together come off as trashy and sadistic. I like strong protagonists in my action movies.The other characters are worse.The music is cheap. I turn it off sometimes. The music often distracts from immersive sound. That’s something the game does well.I like the Japanese history of the island and the idea of these people being unable to leave because of an ancient curse, although the effect is lessened by how many of these people there are. How many you kill.Some of the open areas also look pretty and I liked collecting items, even though it was mostly meaningless and Lara seemed more concerned with her predicament than her profession. She hates tombs. But I guess when you make a game about surviving, it’s hard to emphasize discovery. I hope in the sequel she’s there because she wants to be there."

It can be summarized as a long series of linear sequences separated by more open areas with really REALLY simple puzzles and lots of collectibles.Mechanically, this game runs fine. It is just boring. What you do in the first area is the same as what you do in the 10th. The gameplay is a simple loop: watch questionable cutscene, do linear sequence, mess around in open area as long as you want, do objective, go back to step 1.The writing and cut scenes are bad, they remind me of a b-movie that takes themselves too seriously. I mean nobody learns to shoot bows, fire guns and build weapons in no time. I also have no idea (since this is a reboot) why ANYONE in the in game universe should believe Lara capable of anything.Most importantly, this game suffers from an identity crisis. On the one hand, Lara in cutscenes is trying desperately to cope with how her lifes being up ended and disturbed by having to kill people and save friends. However, Lara during gameplay though is a homicidal killer with extreme training and survival skills. DOES NOT COMPUTE. Even if you wanted to be stealthy, you'll be killing scores of people in game."

Some characters show their true colors quite early, and I think that's good because it did not entirely hint towards them being bad. I do think that it lasted a bit longer than it needed to, but it ended shortly after I felt that it was getting too long. The story ends with a satisfying conclusion, and it is worth experincing.Gameplay: The combat gameplay is good. There's plenty of climbing, dodging, QTE, shooting, and red barrels. It was enjoyable to climb around the maps, and do some bad guy stuff (Shooting doods).  The guns have different affixes such fire, and the puzzles require the bow for various ways to traverse around the levels. As you progress further into the game, you get additional upgrades that allow you to travel in different ways than you're used to. So it continues to change up the formula until the end. I have no complaints about it the gameplay, and I think the entire experience is enjoyable.Graphics: The graphics were great. There's plenty of scenes that will make you think that it looks great. There are some scenes that could have used a bit more work, but this game is a reboot of a long running series so it is to be expected to there be some cutbacks because of uncertainty. I had no issues with anything graphical related though. You won't be disappointed.Sound: The soundtrack was pretty good. I did not feel that the soundtrack for any given area in the game was out of place. But it's not something that I would listen to outside of playing the game.I recommend this game for those that a third person action game with some light puzzle elements. The story tends to last a bit longer than I would have liked, but it finished before it became a slog. Other than the story, there were some puzzles that required a bit more thinking, but nothing too complicated to halt your progression. This game is a great reboot to the Tomb Raider series, and I throughly enjoyed it. I highly recommend this game to others."

2787,Navrin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Navrin/,2,,1,52.4,February,"7,",319,0,1,"Spoiler Free Review:Tomb Raider (2013) is a complete reboot to the franchise.  I played this game, after playing its sequel Rise of the Tomb Raider, which I absolutely loved.  Tomb Raider was no exception.  What a great way to restart the franchise.  Gone are the bouncing days, but Lara still remains a strong attractive character.  Throughout the story, you get drawn in and feel for her, you will understand how she gains her confidence and provides a background story.  The main story line is engaging, well thought out and the suspense level keeps you interested and engaged the entire time.  Campaign takes about 20 hours to complete doing all optional tombs.What surprised me are the secondary characters (except for the villain) were equally as developed.  Not just stand in NPCs, but full characters with stories and wit, etc. – really helped drive the humanity of the game.  The villain unfortunately wasn’t as developed, and fits a standard villain type mold.  It’s unfortunate, but not detrimental or distracting.Controls are excellent and so are the graphics at 2013 standards.  Neither are as good as Rise of the Tomb Raider but this game is a bit old now.  Was able to run everything on max on a GTX 1070.The DLC is a collection of skins and weaponry you can use through the game and multiplayer; however, it doesn’t have much substance.  I didn’t change her skin throughout the game, instead watching what she was wearing deteriorate as the game progresses – good job there Sq Enix.  The DLC isn't worth purchasing.Multiplayer would have been fun if I was playing 4 years ago, but it’s basically dead now.  I had to join a Steam group to find people to play with.  Can’t really rate its MP because it’s so difficult to get a game going these days.Rating: 8 out of 10.  Highly Recommended.Playing on i7-6700, 16Gb RAM, GTX1070"

The whole production quality is excellent. Graphics, levels, characters, everything is almost perfect. All in all a extremely well made game.Could be a little harder though.There were only two or three puzzles in the game that really made me think and I didn't get lost a single time. Some of the action sequences are in a kind of half-auto mode even, were you just have to run and press jump in a timeframe of like a second and everything else is handled by the game itself.But hey, at least Lara is a real human being now."

I played nearly 50 hours, but I did not complete it because the dark nature of the game finally got to me.  There are a lot of people who will think of this game as simple fun, and if you are into zombies or horror movies and that kind of stuff, you probably will not have any problem with this game.  I am writing this review as a warning to others who are a little more sensitive.  Lara finds herself in a truly nightmarish situation.  It starts that way and continues that way for as long as I have played it.  I don't think that is any great spoiler for those who really want to play it.  But there may be those have heard about what a great game it is, but are really not into ""horror stuff.""  If that is you, then don't waste your money on this game.

Since then, Tomb Raider has grown up a bit and so have I. The last generation of games (Legend ,Anniversary, and Underworld) were a great step in a new direction. Now with the latest one Tomb Raider, it has taken a giant leap into the Tomb raider series. It has a great story with some twist and some unexpected surprises that would make you want to keep on playing. Many collectibles to find and collect, though Tomb Raider does have quite a lot of quick time events. The multiplayer part of the game is pretty good though it gets repetitive really quickly but it plays remarkably well. The visuals and graphics look stunning especially on PC!

2800,nerloch,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993118789/,5,,1,32.3,February,"10,","2,264",0,1,"Tomb Raider is a series of games most people played at some point: it stars Lara Croft, a self-proclaimed adventure archaeologist who is travelling around the world in search of finding forgotten artifacts. It is cheesy and pulpy, therefore very amusing experience that combines action and puzzle elements. But there is something else to it, an aspect that kept showing up more or less obvious in every game, especially in this version:Lara Croft as a fictional character created by their creators and past games is a very troubled individual, with antisocial personality disorder combined with destructive and suicidal tendencies, as well as under-developed emotions. She had an extremely difficult childhood with the abandonment and death of one, if not both of her parents, voluntarily engages in dangerous and often criminal activities with human and animal casualties while masking these actions as doing a public favor of finding rare and lost pieces of artifacts for archaeology, has no qualm with taking a human life, always goes to life-threatening escapades alone and does not trust others. There is another person who exhibits these characteristics: Batman. Need more convincing.... her only friend is an old family butler... just like with Bruce Wayne.Which leads me to this iteration of Tomb Raider: it is trying to flesh out Lara Croft in her younger years as a real person that is on her way to become a legend. It tries to mix a slice-of-life drama experience with extremely violent action adventure. Lara at the beginning of the game is a frail woman who somehow manages to kill hundreds of people till the end of the game, while showing a semblance of guilt as she is resting at the camp and is upgrading her skills and weapons to BETTER KILL PEOPLE!!! And let's mention her gruesome and unnerving death scenes, her deaths are always pre-exaggerated and most violent, border lining to masochism. Thisis why the story and characters irked me the whole time. I won't even waste words of weakly developed characters in this game...It would seem that I am damning this game, but there are many good things about it: it has a great look and feel of the Island, levels are varied and interesting, if a bit too easy, metroidvania and shooting mechanics are quite amusing, even online matches were fun while they lasted. Exploration of tombs, avoiding and solving their traps is the most fun aspect of the game. It's only a shame there a handful of tombs in a 20 hour game. And the feel that you get as you climb and reach the highest peak on the island is indescribable.Tomb Raider gets a recommendation from me as a decent Tomb Raider game with underwhelming narrative component. Developers tried to make Lara Croft, a female version of Indiana Jones, more nuanced heroine with mixed results. Earlier games knew what they were, accepted that and reveled in it. This game is still going through an identity crisis while delivering poor results. But there is a slimmer of hope the next one might be better, with a lot more tombs, as the name openly suggests. In the series of Tomb Raider games, this one is an okay game."

It seemed odd that for a Tomb Raider game, all the ""tombs"" were mostly one-room puzzles reminiscent of the assassin tombs in the Assassin's Creed series.

Following a shipwreck on a mysterious island that seems to draw in ships and planes like some Pacific version of the Bermuda Triangle, Lara and the crew encounter strange cultists made up of other marooned survivors. I won't get too spoiler-y here but the background story is tied up in Japanese legend and mysticism.Gameplay is an over-the-shoulder third person perspective, like the older games. Displaying the agility, strength, and endurance of an Olympic gymnast, Lara can run, jump, swing from bars, climb cliffs, zip-line down ropes, and a whole host of other acrobatic actions. Figuring ways to explore the surroundings, to climb to that one spot you want to reach, or how to shimmy along a wooden pole so you can leap to a nearby ladder, is a central tenet of the game's action. The animations for all these actions are good and relatively fluid, and the controls are pretty intuitive. After a few minutes, I think most players will have a good feel for the rhythm and be able to move smoothly through the environment. I never really got tired of watching Lara parkour her way around the cliffs and shipwrecks. Some areas require special gear to access but the game is good about introducing the tools you need, right about when you need them.That said, you will spend an awful lot of time dangling from high cliffs over long drops. There are also a number of very tight tunnels. So if you have a fear of heights or are claustrophobic, just something to be aware of.It will not take long before the cultists start coming after Lara. There is a lot of combat in the game. I'm not sure if I thought it was too much or just too concentrated. In a number of instances, you will enter a wrecked building or drop off a zip-line and be attacked by eight to twelve bad guys (sometime in waves, sometimes all at once). This is usually followed by long stretches of calm, only for combat to erupt again without warning. Some zones are worse about this than others (Shantytown, I'm looking in your direction). Lara slowly obtains several weapons and can upgrade them with salvage found on bodies and in crates and chests. All I can say is that if you have a chance, make as many stealth kills as possible and the moment your cover is blown, use area-of-effect damage (grenades, shooting explosive barrels) to wipe out as many grouped-up enemies as you can before mopping up the rest. Otherwise, you may find yourself under bullet, explosive, and melee attack from multiple angles at the same time and surviving all that can be rough. Lara can take a few hits but she is not super-durable.On that note, you will probably die a lot. I think I repeatedly fell, got shot or stabbed, eaten by wolves, crushed by rocks, drowned, impaled, and just about anything else you can think of. Penalty for death means nothing, you just reload at the last checkpoint and they are generally pretty frequent, so you won't lose much ground.There are lots of collectibles and challenges (like lighting the braziers at all ten Buddha statues in one zone) to be had, plus optional tombs to explore. Collectible and document sets give experience and unlock artwork in the game files. Don't worry if you don't get them the first time through an area; you can fast travel back from certain camp fires to older zones to clean them up. Enemies do respawn in the old zones, so don't just blindly run in.If none of the collecting appeals to you, at least do the optional tombs. They provide salvage to upgrade your gear, skill points, and maps of other rewards in the zone. None of the optional tombs are hard or complicated, or even very long, and that was a significant disappointment. Voice acting, music and sound in the game are all pretty good. For the most part, I thought the graphics are excellent and like I said above, the action animation was fun to watch and partake in. One issue is the number of quick-time events. They blend with the game's flow but there are a lot of them, and most of them are annoying.You may find yourself doing some repeatedly to get the timing just right. And too often, the camera angles during these events is ♥♥♥♥, making it even more aggravating to deal with.Steam Achievements aren't too hard, though some may take a guide or multiple runs. Combat achievements may require revisiting old zones to find respawned cultists. If you like to solo play, be advised: about a third of the achievements only come from multiplayer games. I haven't tried the multiplayer as of this writing.Tomb Raider is a good game and can be enjoyed like an action movie: fun, full of adrenaline-fueled moments, and not too filling. It was good enough for me to play through twice in a row.Pros- Excellent action and fun swinging from the rafters- Great graphics and soundCons- Too much combat, not enough puzzles- Overuse of quick-time eventsFinal Score: 8/10"

The island—and the kingdom that once existed there—is shrouded in mystery, given its reputation for fearsome storms and shipwrecks that litter its coastline. Yamatai was once ruled by a queen named Himiko, known by her honorific title of ""Sun Queen"", who according to legend was blessed with shamanistic powers that enabled her to control the weather. Very little is known about Yamatai's history in the time since Himiko's death, other than that the island's infamy was established shortly thereafter. In exploring the island, the player may find evidence that—among others—Portuguese traders, United States Marines and a Japanese military project were all stranded on Yamatai at various points throughout history. At the start of the game, the island is populated exclusively by the Solarii Brotherhood, a violent cult of criminals, mercenaries and shipwreck survivors. The Solarii Brotherhood has established its own society based on the worship of Himiko, complete with a social structure and laws, with their exact purpose and intentions being explored over the course of the story.The player takes on the role of Lara Croft, a young and ambitious archaeology graduate whose theories on the location of the lost kingdom of Yamatai have convinced the Nishimura family—descendants from the people of Yamatai themselves—to fund an expedition in search of the kingdom. The expedition is led by Dr. James Whitman, a celebrity archaeologist who has fallen on hard times and is desperate to avoid bankruptcy, and is accompanied by Conrad Roth, a Royal Marine turned adventurer and close friend of the Croft family who serves as mentor to Lara; Samantha ""Sam"" Nishimura, Lara's friend and a representative of the Nishimura family who films the expedition for a documentary; Joslyn Reyes, a skeptical and temperamental mechanic and single mother; Jonah Maiava, an imposing and placid fisherman who is willing to believe in the existence of the paranormal and esoteric; Angus ""Grim"" Grimaldi, the gruff Glaswegian helmsman of the Endurance; and Alex Weiss, a goofy and bespectacled electronics specialist.Picked This Game Up For Like A Dollar Or Two,Damn Awesome Game afReminds Me Alot About Previous Tomb Raider GamesMy Personal Rating:Graphics:9/10Story:10/10Gameplay:9/10"

But everything about this franchise, I've witnessed practically everything. Games, movies, animated show, comic books, figures... I was attentive when the first reboot happened, which became known as the Legend timeline, and the same goes for the current Survivor timeline . The latter is the one I am talking about today, in particular the game that pretty much kick started the 2nd reboot, Tomb Raider (2013).Now I know it's been a long while since the game came out, but I still think I should share my thoughts on it, regardless. So without further ado, let's go.Now because this game is pretty long and the story would take a while to describe, I'm going to keep it short and as spoiler-free as possible. The game starts by introducing us to an inexperienced Lara Croft, embarking on her very first expedition, the destination being the island of Yamatai, in the Dragon's Triangle near Japan. Upon approaching the island, a storm kicks in and the ship is heavily damaged, seperating the whole crew and leaving everyone shipwrecked. They all seem to manage to reach the beach, albeit still seperated. Lara spots the rest of the crew and calls for help, but ends up captured by one of the inhabitants. After managing to escape, she sets out to look for the rest of the ship's crew. Realizing that they're not alone, the time they spend on the island becomes fighting for survival due to encountering previous castaways who eventually joined a madman's cult, which worships the entity that haunts Yamatai. This provides Lara with no other choice but to learn how to survive in a hostile environment. Hence the game's slogan ""A Survivor is Born"".If you've been playing Tomb Raider for as long as I have (since the original timeline), you'll notice how different the gameplay is, feeling a bit like the Playstation's exclusive series, Uncharted. Besides the 3rd person perspective which has always been like so since 1996, the combat is somewhat similar. Aiming puts you in an over-the-shoulder perspective, whether with the bow or a firearm. The game also allows you to dodge incoming ""up close and personal"" attacks. This can later be upgraded to counter attacking and climbing is mostly done later in the game, when you have equipment for it. Not much of it is done in the beginning. There's also plenty of stuff to find around Yamatai, since the world around you sort of acts like a hub world, for the most part. Some areas are exclusive to certain parts of the story. But you can find various collectables like artifacts, journals and GPS caches. You'll also find salvage, which is extremely important, as this acts like the ""currency"" you exchange for upgrades to your weapons. Almost anything you do in the game like exploring, completing challenges, finding collectables or hidden tombs and even hunting will grant you EXP, which will grant you skill points that can be exchanged for upgrades for Lara herself. There are a few QTE moments but at least these don't feel too overused throughout the whole game, which is good. In addition, when you're done exploring, you can just look for the campsite for the game to save and for you to work on upgrades or to fast travel.Personally, I think that Crystal Dynamics did a really good job with how the game looks. I find it to be incredibly detailed on Ultra. The character models look great and the world feels alive. The cherry on top of this cake is additional feature on the PC version (pre-Definitive Edition) that makes Lara's hair look... well, like actual hair. I can't remember the name of it, but Lara's hair will separate into individual hair strings when there's wind blowing and whatnot.Considering that by now, we have the regular version and the Definitive Edition on PS4 and Xbox One... I think the regular edition looks much better. So if you can, buy the game on PC.Now this topic is gonna be for this game, particularly. Or at least for games that have this kind of features/content.Personally... I find this ""part"" to be mostly bad. For starters... seriously, did anyone even ask for Multiplayer in Tomb Raider? No one even touched it... correct me if I'm wrong on this part, because I didn't play it (neither do I intend to and there’s no one playing), I only know what I've seen. And it looks like an Uncharted Multiplayer clone. It feels tacked on, in a series that never had and never needed Multiplayer in the first place. And most of the DLCs suffer because of this. It's mostly just extra Multiplayer content. A waste of money. The Tomb of the Lost Adventurer is... okay-ish. It's nothing special, just an extra tomb for you to get extra EXP and extra salvage from. And Lara's outfits... I mean, they're nice, but they kinda break the game's immersion, as they won't suffer any sort of damage and show it. The outfits and the tomb... I say it's up to you, but I would stay clear of the Multiplayer DLC.Overall, the game is a satisfying experience. Which leads to my final score of a 7/10. A great game. And a great reboot to the series. And I don't give this game a higher score because, if you ask me, the tacked on Multiplayer hurts it, as well as the extra content, which is pretty lackluster for the most part. Were this game a Singleplayer experience alone, I could easily give it a 9. Or an 8 if the DLCs were even worth the money they cost. But these two elements... they just hurt the game. Especially the Multiplayer. It was never needed and nobody asked for it. Not between 1996 and 2008 and not even now. Luckily, Square Enix seems to have learned from their mistakes and implemented different Multiplayer-like elements in Rise of the Tomb Raider, which seem to work better for a series like this."

While some of the controls can be hard to manage, the game more than makes up for it with its incredible storyline, length, and gameplay mechanics. This game is very reminiscent of Half-life gameplay-- There are quite a few tricky puzzles that you have to solve, and the rewards for solving them are great. My only complaint is perhaps the fact that some parts can be agonizingly difficult without proper checkpoints (imagine trying one area 10 times before finally getting it right). Again, the scenery and design were awe-inspiring, and the characters were all real and relatable.I really enjoyed this game. 10/10"
2826,Conker,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047672025/,5,,1,15.8,December,"8,",867,0,1,"This is a really good game, better than i remember it, i had the original game on pc back in the day, and the 4th one on Dreamcast and i could never finish them.... not through lack of trying but the jumping had to be so precise it would drive you mad, and it gets really tricky later on. In the 4th one i got stuck at some puzzle where you had to move round really large chess pieces in a particular order and i could never figure out how to position them to open the right gate.They fixed all the issues the old games had with the jumping, and now it gives you room if you mess up a jump slightly you will still grab onto the ledge and not fall to your death over and over. They also fixed the labyrinthine puzzles by  eliminating them altogether,That's kinda the joke actually, all the tombs you can raid in this are both optional, tiny and simple as f*ck, too simple maybe. If you were into Tomb Raider for the puzzles i could see you not liking this game too much.I thought this game struck the right balance between gunplay and exploration, which a lot of game don't get right, but the gunplay and the bow and arrow play? are really satisfying to use on people, you can even use the bow later on once you get the rope upgrade for it to pull enemies off a cliff edge and watch them fall to their deaths.Lara Croft also seems approachable in this, and has a personality of a real person, i'm not sure how much they changed of her story in this reboot, you don't really know if she is still rich and has a mansion. The only thing they messed up is her character arc of becoming a ""survivor"" replace survivor with killer, it's way more apt. Once she kills the first guy Lara becomes Jane Rambo, there's even achievements for killing 70 people with the assault rifle and 40 people with the shotgun, that aint surviving that's a f*cking massacre son! i'm not complaining about the action, i enjoyed killing all those people, but there's a real disconnect between the story and the gameplay.Anyway play this game if you haven't already, even if you were never a fan of Tomb Raider."

With the recent steam sales I finally wanted to give it a try to see for myself where the series is going.I guess with the development in the gaming industry (as well as the current political climate *cough*) you can't do much about a big developer trying to design a game for a mainstream audience. But what they did to the once great and iconic name Tomb Raider has reached a new low.Tomb Raider 2013 rated as ""just another game"" is mediocre at best. It is a simple and very repetitive action game, nothing more than a linear no-brainer. As if this wasn't enough the gameplay is interrupted constantly by quicktime events and way too many unnecessary cinematic elements. Unfortunately, not even the story adds anything to the game's quality. It only serves as a reason for countless battles and to torture Lara as much as possible. The game barely reaches C-movie standards.Action game rating: 6/10It's sad, Tomb Raider 2013 could have been so much more. They added a lot of interesting features and abilities like the bow, special arrows, a rope ascender and so on. Lara is fast and agile as always and she obviously still knows how to kick ass. All this combined could have been used to create another great Tomb Raider with actual (big) Tombs and puzzles where you have to use all of Lara's equipment, tools and skills. Instead they went the lazy way and made a shooter with zero replay value. Collection achievements don't count in my opinion.Tomb Raider game rating: 1/10"

There is nothing more frustrating and degrading than dying more than several times because the game thrusts button presses at you while there's action on-screen. These events even make their way into banal events like opening doors or kicking open objects, and even some cutscenes. This is what I can't stand in this game, when my skill level is brought down to my ability to press a button to progress through a cutscene that I have no other effect on anyway. This happens CONSTANTLY. All throughout the game, I ragequit simply because I can't press a button fast enough and I die instantly several times in a row. Unbelieveable. - Mucky movement mechanics: In an effort to make movement more 'realistic', Lara instead moves as if she's guessing where I'm trying to go rather than directly responding to my keyboard. This makes getting into cover painful, simply because I'm hoping her AI can do it for me, rather than simple cover buttons that work better in so many other games.You can play the game yourself to see whether this will bother you, but honestly, having finished the game, there were gleaming moments of solid design all-around, that ultimately fell victim to stupid Quick-Time Events that will kill you unfairly."

If there is no game after these searches then all lobbies are currently full.Some Single-player DLC works in Multiplayer too while others gives strange benefits. (none of those benefits can help you win)Sadly there are sometimes cheaters. Fortunately not so often.(Bulgarian review below)Tomb Raider се препоръчва от мен.Кратко лично мнение: (предимно за Multiplayer)*Single-player*-Историята е невероятно-Героинята е красиво изработена-Страхотен геймплей-Графиките са много добри (дори на нормално качество)*Multiplayer*-Прилича на FPS стил игри, но в 3-то лице (8 играчи макс 4 в отбор)-Приятен геймплей-Четири режима на игра-Чат системата не е добра, но поне я има-Може да искате да заглушите микрофона си, преди да започнете игра-Винаги има най-малко една започната игра-Практиката прави съвършенствотоДопълнително към Multiplayer игра:Само Casual мачове се играят, така че ако искате да направите Ranked ачивменти може да  потърсите за хора в TR групи или да попитате в чата на играта.Все още има много добри играчи които играят. Така че може да се намери предизвикателство.Ако не можете да намерите игра с ''Quick Match'' бутона опитайте да проверите всички четири режима един по един. Ако няма игра след тези търсения тогава всички лобита са заети за момента.Някой Single-player DLC работят и в Multiplayer, докато други ви дават странни умения. (нито един от DLC уменията не може да ви помогне да спечелите)За съжаление понякога има чийтъри. За щастие не толкова често."

The combat is chaotic but still controlled enough for you to know what is going on at all times, consistently switching weapons depending on the situation, though in saying that it would not be too hard to go at this game with just your favourite weapon, even I spent the first 70% of the game only using the bow. The story is a nice ride with constant twists and turns along with characters that you will probably care a fair bit about, but seeing as you mostly follow Lara in this while she's going solo you won’t be having a fit if one of them dies.In all this game is AMAZING! Pick it up if you haven't already because it's a story you won’t want to miss, and they better bloody make a sequel!"

2848,RiotPill,https://steamcommunity.com/id/riotpill/,2,,1,19.5,January,"21,",960,0,1,I was a little late getting into this game three years after its release. For a game thats a couple years old I was blow away by the graphics. The art direction is dark and gritty and Lara is made out to be a real bad ass. There are many well scripted set pieces and it is a constant roller coaster ride from beginning to end. The dialogue is well written and the games voice actors were well cast. The story while it starts out believable has a few things that seem a bit ludicrous at first but once you accept the direction its going in I think its a fun ride. The combat is challenging but very satisfying. It has an intuitive auto cover system and while not a lot of different weapons they all provide a nice level of variety as well as being able to upgrade them along with Lara as you progress. One of my favorite things in the game is the optional tombs that you can discover and take on their challenges. The map opens up completely when you finish the main story giving you the option to finsh any left behind. I wish there had been more tombs and that they had been a little bit longer as these harken back to the gameplay and level design from the older tomb raider games and I personally found them rather enjoyable. There is an online multiplayer mode that seems like it would be fun but sadly at the time of writing this it would appear that its completely dead and I was unable to find a single player. If you could add bots it might extend the longevity of the game but you cannot.I highly recommend this game. It's not too expensive and I have seen it regularly discounted by 50 percent in sales. Its a rewarding game and works well. If you have been thinking about playing it don't hesitate to pick it up.

The puzzles and the difficulty levels have been bumped up quite a bit and the game has evolved from a traditional console style game to a action packed movie style game. Has great voice acting. I was a bit weary when I heard Square Enix was involved but Square Enix is known for quality games and this one shows it. The full environmental interactivity in the game adds to the possibilities of how you can progress through the game , it seems there is more then one way to get through a portion of each part of the game. Going to be playing this more over the holiday weekend here in the USA, but if you are looking for something new Tomb Raider wise, I would pick this game up over Tomb Raider Legend - Its more fun to play."

2887,HachiKitsune,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsGalaxyPixel/,3,,1,12.0,January,"2,",486,1,1,"I jumped into this game expecting an immediate fast paced, lighthearted adrenaline rush full of daring acts rivaled only by the iconic movie archaeologist, Indiana Jones.What I got was very, very different. This game isn't as fast paced as the Tomb Raider fandom would have you believe. It slows down quite a bit, making you think your way through as well as grow attached to the characters and care what happens to them. Instead of the seemingly high-octane non-stop action I saw in previous iterations of Tomb Raider, I got slower paced puzzles, building up to an unbelieveably exciting climax. Don't get me wrong, there was certainly combat in that buildup, and it was fantastic combat, at that. Though the main focus of the game seemed to be thinking about your approach through the obstacles presented to you. The mechanics in this game honestly deserve an in-depth rundown piece-by-piece, but I don't want this review to be book-length.The movement and traversal system is well done, the controls seem tight and responsive, but still give you a realistic feel. The combat has so much depth that I'm convinced that I still didn't find all the ways I can take out enemies by the end of the game. The level design is done in such a way that you feel like you're in an actual environment, but you can still utilize it as you would any other game. The story is written with many, many twists and turns, and I can't get over how little the direction of the plot took at turn I was expecting. The visuals were not exactly what I was expecting, as I had previously seen footage of the game back in 2013, and it was the best looking game I had ever seen at the time, but before long, my perception had adjusted to the point that I could accept that the game is a rather stunning game, even still.The game kept me interested until the very end, as I was exploring every little thing I noticed, fighting enemies which are far smarter than those in other games(They actually AVOID explosive barrels, can you believe that?), and managing to pull off action-movie style stunts despite my apparent inaptitude to move around in a resemblant fashion to a remotely mentally stable person in a video game.As seems obligatory in reviews, I suppose I'll explain my personal pros and cons to the game.Pros:-Good story-Smooth controls-Excellent combat-Pretty visualsCons:-Feels long-winded at times-Can be mildly frustrating-Too short"
2888,StingingVelvet,https://steamcommunity.com/id/StingingVelvet/,2,,1,18.5,July,"9,",870,0,1,"Usually when I hear reboot I roll my eyes, but this is a very good example of a reboot done right. When it's not trying to be Gears of War it's a wonderful action adventure game with great exploration, puzzle solving and stealth action. The Gears of War segments aren't bad really, they just don't feel ""right"" for the game, but they're only one part of a big whole. I hear the sequels tone them down even more, which sounds great.The story is pretty compelling for a video game. Usually I don't like cinematic storytelling for games, but this is an example of it done right. It's better than the movie based on it, which is pretty impressive. The voice actress for Lara does a great job, and the writing is solid. It has those ""epic cinematic moments"" a lot of games annoy you with because there's no gameplay involved, but this one does a very good job of making them feel interactive by mixing combat and platforming with these ""epic"" moments. For example there's a segment where a monastery is burning down and you have to escape, but instead of watching it happen you fight and jump your way through burning rooms and fleeing enemies. It's cool stuff.Even the PC version feels good, with excellent controls and graphics options. Camera control being taken away at rare moments was my only issue at all. It's quite the looker even 6 years later as well, and even a low-end card can max the game out now. All in all if you like third-person action games I hope you own this, as it's an excellent example of those done right."

Lara Croft and her team strand on a lonely island, don´t know where they are, don´t know how they really can leave the island because something is not letting them go. They meet people on that island but they only want to kill them or have them for an ancient ritual to awake a god called Himiko. Sounds like a good old and interessting story where Lara has to learn to survive in that new and cruel world where people try to sacrifice another especially woman.Well it is interessting and really fun to play but only the first 5 hours, then it slowly becomes annoying. Nothing really shocking happens anymore and you think you´ve seen all on this island. Also the gameplay is always the same, it becomes really boring because nothing other is happening. The little riddles are always solved the same way with the bow and sometimes pretty easy. There game mechanics aren´t progressing, it´s always the same, no variety in the game.And the story slowly goes on and tries to create some tension but it doesnt always succed. Mostly because of the always same fights.I really wish there were some progress or even a little change in the gameplay wich would make the game not that boring to play.All in all it´s a game with good graphics, an ok story and a gameplay that becomes boring fast after the first 5 or 6 hours."

There are no puzzles, it's just cut scene, gun fight, run somewhere else, repeat.It's quite a short game if you don't bother with collecting things along the way. And if you like collecting things then the open-world and fast travel will be useful. The story line was okay and the skill points and weapon upgrades were a good addition, but don't expect anything like the old games."

2927,cuttlefishtamer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuttlefishtamer/,1,,1,12.3,December,"27,",135,0,1,"For a game that is a reboot of a decade-old TPS, Tomb Raider does a pretty good job of breathing live into the franchise while not straying too far from its roots. It is its own being, yet still respects its origins and doesn't seem out of place in its execution. It has a super enjoyable combat system, decent writing, and a perfectly-balanced crafting system that doesn't have you going out of the way and grinding to upgrade Lara's equipment. The only gripe I had about the game was the struggle between the immersive tone and the constant Uncharted-esque action sequences that pulled me out of the experience. The amount Lara gets battered, bruised, stabbed, shot and generally injured in this game is ridiculous. She gets tossed down hills, off cliffs, lands on spikes, etc. - all over the course of the few days that the game takes place in. Considering the game seems to pride itself on being able to deliver such a stunningly-detailed and believable world, these set pieces really took some of the energy out of the world's importance, especailly considering how frequent they were.Still, an absolutely fantastic game and a totally recommendable ride for those who are willing to suspend their disbelief for the 10-14 hours the main story lasts."
2928,5150,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/,2,,1,12.7,September,"13,","2,095",0,1,"Tomb Raider - this time brought to you by Square Enix.  This adventure title is a white-knuckle thrill ride so cinematic in nature that I've only ever seen its like rivaled by the Uncharted franchise.  I was *extremely* impressed with this title, which is a mix of Drake's Fortune and Batman: Arkham Asylum starring Lara Croft.  When you're not exploring every nook and cranny of the sprawling and well designed, non-linear levels looking for collectables and loot to upgrade your weapons in a very ""RPG-esque"" way, you will find yourself engaged in heated battles with countless enemies.  At times, I did get the ""shooting gallery"" feel, but usually this wasn't a problem and I found the game was well paced in general.  Certain larger / boss enemies (especially towards the end) had quick time events mixed in with their battles - I found this enjoyable, as with the rest of the quick time events found in the game.  QTEs can be hit or miss - I felt this game was a hit.  They're used a little over ""sparingly"", and really add drama to the already intense situations you'll find yourself in.What many may not expect is this game is extremely brutal and gruesome.  It earns its ""M"" ranking - I found myself cringing at numerous times throughout the game.  It really served to build an incredibly strong protagonist though, I can't believe some of the stuff Lara goes through in this game - especially if you get her killed.  I've seen rusted rebar going through her stomach, a coral reef smashing her in the skull, and Lara being crucified on a giant polearm.  The gameplay is crisp and tight and features outstanding controller support.  I played the entire game on a gamepad and didn't miss the mouse and keyboard once.  As for the engine, there's a large amount of adjustments you can make - all the way down to rendering Lara's hair independently, which is a cool feature if your computer can handle it.  The game got to be quite tasking on my rig - especially during the ocean parts where there are a lot of particle effects going on.  Tomb Raider also sports an absolutely beautiful GUI and awesome menu design - it's a very slick user experience.As for DLC - don't buy it, the only one ""worth"" buying is the extra Tomb, and that one sucks - extremely short and there are plenty of other tombs to expore, that one is nothing specialy.  Stick with the base game.I'd recommend this game to just about anyone - if you enjoyed the Uncharted Franchise (and you should) this is a must play.  Skip the DLC. A-"

There is something special about a girl that can duck-tape a grenade launcher to an assault rifle to take out a machine gun nest. Then again, I get impressed by girls who know how to knit/crochet/random needle crafting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, so I may just have low standards.-Wanna show her off to mom? Just have her talk with her. She actually has some interesting things to say in this game during the campfire sessions. It's weird to describe a video game character like this, but she actually grew as a person during this adventure. -Wanna show her off to Dad? Show her those pics of her you keep in your phone. Dat body. -She's got moves. I'm sure she knows how to dance and all, but the controls on her are solid. For adventure titles, I usually go with a 360 controller. The compromise with that in this game is it's harder to pull off headshots, which means less XP and fewer glorious death animations. -She doesn't poop. Or at least they never showed her answering nature's call. And believe me, if she went #2 in those pants you could tell. My only criticism of her as a person: -She has some baggage. Seriously, she went through some violent ♥♥♥♥ on the island. Nearly died every 20 steps and killed a LOT of people/creatures with unknown backgrounds. Most of it was in self-defence. Most of it (ya see that's the scary part). -She doesn't poop. That could become a serious health issue. I found the puzzles weren't as challenging as most games these days, but the adventure was great. It was like watching a good action film and being entertained for 14 hours and then a multiplayer mode, which I really should have tried before I wrote all this ♥♥♥♥ up. I blame Carl for this. Somehow I know he's responsible. Here's the formula for this game: Uncharted + explore mechanics + ""Lost"" kinda wtf story = Tomb Raider. Good ideas, good execution."

The devs clearly took lots of inspiration from the Uncharted series for this one, and it paid off for them. There are a lot of really crazy sequences that make this game really memorable. The story is nothing crazy intricate, but just interesting enough to make you want to keep going to find out what's coming up next. Only downfalls are that they seem to want you to explore to find trinkets like GPS caches/relics, but it's far more productive XP/loot-wise to simply keep going through the main storyline and loot any bodies/crates you find along the way. None of the puzzles are too difficult at all and are somewhat short, keeping more to the modern action-adventure type of gameplay in getting you back to gunplay fairly quickly. Main campaign took about 10 hours to beat, and that's with completing all of the optional side tombs and getting most of the upgrades available. 8.5/10. Try to grab it when on sale for about $20-$25, if not less."

Dont bother unless you love this game style and/or its on sale for <$2.50. I got it on sale for about $4 and still feel like i want my money back...Details:if you like games so linear they're on rails, you'll like this. if you like being told 'mash this button' to win a QTE fight, youll like it too. if you like playing games that have duck and cover systems that make you duck when you want to run, and run when you want to duck, you'll love it. if you like your ai dumb enough to run right past you while you shoot it in a firefight, you'll love it. if you want a protagonist so stupid you'll want them to die, this is your game. If however you like to play a game and not watch a booring interactive and WAY too long movie, look elsewhere    +ves runs well, nice graphics. Managed to find just one major bug (dropped off a zipline earlier than the game wanted me to and all the enemies i was dropping in on disapeared) but still didn't break the game, so no biggie.    -vesaioh, the ai. Unrealistically fantastic shots, their guns have 0 kickback or scatter, so they're all hitting you in the head. They've also got perfect vision, despite saying in game 'its too dark i cant see anything' they can apparently pinpoint where you are sniping from 50m away with a silent weapon, the moment you kill their 'brother'. There can be 2 of them facing away form you, you can snipe one in the back of the head, and when the live one turns around and sees the corpse, he imidiately knows taht your hiding behind THAT tree/rock/wall, and opens fire. Same goes in thick fog so bad you cant see them at all, but they can still headshot you. oh, and if there's a large building inbetween you and them, no matter, they'll still throw molitov's or dinamite over said building, landing right at your feet. Shoot a silenced weapon to make a large peice of equipemnt fall and kill some enemies? oh, they know imidiatly that it was sabotage, and where you are. No 'what happened' no 'where is she?' just 'that was definately not an accident and she's there behind that wall, open fire'. Despite this, the AI is beyond stupid. A number of times they'd run right past me in a firefight, rather than attacking. They'll also just slowly walk round any corner you happen to hide behind, one by one, making it easy to pick them off. just sit there and wait for them to come to you. if they see their mate get blown away right in front of them, they'll still continue on slowly 'creeping' round the same corner. If you or they destroy a piece of cover, they'll still attemt to hid behind it, even though its no longer there. So they're just crouching, 'hiding' behind nothing.ControllsIn a word, infuriating. Try to use a crate as cover, and she might take cover behind it, or to the right of it, or the left. who knows? not you. Want to peek out on the left side? ok. now the right side? nope. Varys according to each piece of cover. Bos fights involve 'doge dogde shoot, go into QTE' kind of manotonous bordom. Characters.So dumb and wingy you want them to die, lara in particular. there's a number of cut scenes where you just cant help but say 'that is beyond retarded you stupid %**@*!'. For instance (not really a spoiler) - jump and knock someone back off a large turret gun. then, rather than use the gun already in your hand to shoot them, you try to turn the heavy ass turret around to kill them. moving the heavy turret takes so long the guy recovers and knocks you off a ledge, and into a dreadded QTE. This is all a cutscene so there's nothing you can do about it either. Are you trying to save your mate, with enemies all around lookign for you? no worries, shout out at the top of your lungs Im' sure they wont hear you... Room full of 30-40 bad guys? no worries, step right out in the open and shoot a bow at them. oh gee, your captured AGAIN? how on earth did that happen? I have nooooo idea (sarcasm). QTEneed i say more? ChallengeThere is none. Pretty much infinite ammo the moment you get the 'recover arrows' perk. even if you use 1 arrow to kill an enemy carrying a gun, you'll pick up anywhere form 1-7 arrows off their corpse, maybe some bullets too. Every boss fight is easy, the first one is actually the hardest since its a long QTE that restarts every time you fail it. The most 'challenging' part is killing large groups with the dodgy controlls even then its just run and gun to win, this is on 'hard' too. i'd have done FAR better with a crouch button and no 'auto' cover system. StoryPredictable as all hell, and so linear it becomes more like a interactive movie. A really bad interactive movie. Strait to DVD $5 discount box bad interactive movie. Oh look, a clearing. leme guess, as soon as you zip line into it youll be fighting a bunch of enemies coming out of the woodwork? you bet your ass. Cleared a room? yep, untill you step through that doorway, all of a suden theres other enemies that heard the gunfight, but didn't decide to come join in untill you went through said doorway. NO way to take alternative paths, to stealth (read above on AI) or do anything but walk allong this path, climb that wall, shoot that guy, wash, rince, repeat. Story is forgetable, and goes on WAY too long. Like LOTR or harry potter with about 3x the number of books/movies. all i can say is im glad i got it on sale, even then though i feel ripped off. In conclusion, NO, i dont reccomend this."

Who thought this was necessary? Apart from being annoying gameplay wise, it completely destroys any sense of realism or immersion. Where are these hundreds of adult men armed to the teeth coming from? How is this completley untrained girl killing all of them? Why am I completely fine after being riddled with hundreds of bullets and being set on fire hundreds of times? It's really stupid. This game doesn't have to be CoD. I squeezed some satisfaction out of combat by sticking with a bow whenever possible but I would rather it was not necessary at all. If you've ever played Mirror's Edge, think about how annoying it was that they shoehorned guns into that game, then multiply that by 100. Any stealth is impractical and rarely possible. On occasions when it is possible to sneak past enemies it's self-defeating because you're missing out on precious XP and salvage... why is salvage a thing, again? Why does this game need a crafting system to upgrade weapons? The game introduces some sort of skinning/butchering system where you kill wild animals and eat them. Once. Then it never happens again. Why does this have to be the game? So Lara only needs to eat the one time and then never again? I choose to believe the group subsists by cannibalizing the hordes of enemies that Lara (thanklessly) mows down. The characters range from boring to annoying. There was never a moment when I was happy to see any of them. The tombs are clearly an afterthought. There is a fun game hidden under a lot of unnecessary dreck, and I really hope it gets cleaned up by the next installment because there's potential for an excellent game here."

Has been for months and will continue to be, I'm hoping there's a part 2, or a completely new game, the graphics are amazing, vocals are awesome, missions, hidden artifacts, tombs, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and that's just the campaign, I played for 13 hours, 6 and a half hours for 2 days, I couldn't stop. It's like finding a good book and not putting It down.buying this on sale would be a massive rip off, It's worth full price and so much more.

I really wanted to like each game. This game takes the best parts of Uncharted, the exploring, adventure and wonderful set pieces. Some good parts of Farcry 3, the vistas, wonderful set pieces, the leveling system, and a story about someone who is woefully inexperienced being pushed through a meat grinder. And adds it with everything that Tomb Raider always strove to be. A game about survival. This game is like taking those survival expidition courses being *played.* The game isn't perfect. Be ready for some of the worst QTE out there. They're poorly timed and you may find yourself stepping away out of frustration. But I'd urge you to push through. Because once you get past that difficulty you're in for a real treat. This is a game that I really feel like most people would enjoy. Ignore the multiplayer and DLC. They're unnecessary and unfortunate. If they hadn't worked on that and instead put the manpower towards making the singleplayer maybe they'd have decided against using QTE."

It's an easy game, perhaps because it's balanced for console aiming. With a mouse you can headshot every enemy and it never really challenges you in that respect, but it's still fun. The game has a nice exploration feel to it. The puzzles are nice, particularly the tombs.My only real complaint is the quick time events. They aren't fun. They are interspersed in the gameplay and in cutscenes, there's no way of knowing when it's gonna happen, and, I don't know what it's like on consoles, but on PC the key that you have to press in order to not die seems to change depending on the event. It doesn't add anything, it just serves to kill you once and make you watch the cut scene again. It's a particular problem at the start of the game in which it forms a major part of the gameplay, because a large part of the narrative is made up of short cutscenes. Stick with it and it does get better.The multiplayer is pointless. It shouldn't have been added, but it does the game no harm by its presence."

They take more thought than Uncharted, but they ain't Portal. Again, I thought the highlight of the game was the shooting. Of the dudes. With the bullets.HOWEVER, be warned: The first hour or so IS ALL ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's QTE's and cinematics of Lara basically getting tortured by mother nature, and that really turned me off.

I wasn't hugely enthused or anything, but I didn't want to punch myself in the face and finished it, even picking up 88% of the various collectibles on my way through.  The platforming is lacking in obnoxiousness, with most accessible areas signposted well.  The combat was amusing, if not especially deep.  I actually managed to enjoy wandering around looking for loot.  The writing is at par for videogames, ie crap, and I had some problems suspending disbelief - how did the bad guys get into these insanely inaccessible locations?  Why can't Lara ever take their mysterious service elevatosr?  How the hell am I supposed to believe Lara is still moving?

PC is where it's at, my friends!I've always been a fan of the Tomb Raider series. I love how this game brings all the things I loved (exploration, puzzle solving) and added much needed improvements to the combat. In old versions, you locked on to target and blasted away with pistols whilst jumping to an fro. This game is much more tactical in it's comabt. Steath kills, headshots, weapon mods, and skill trees make for a much more immersive experience.I also love the new fresh faced Lara. Awesome that they went backwards with the timeline and you play as a young, vulnerable, naive Lara. Unsure of herself, but determined to succeed and save her frineds. It doesn't hurt that she's very easy on the eyes either. I love her new look.

2999,Abbe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/abbe/,1,,1,15.6,March,"10,","1,546",2,1,"The best Tomb Raider game since the Guardian of Light (the top-down platformer). Young Lara Croft is returning in a new series and hopefully it will continue to be amazing in the coming games after this.I played it to 100% completion in single player, haven't tried multiplayer (why is it even there?), normal difficulty, roughly 15½h long with only slight help from youtube in completing two challenge missions (finding hidden stuff). If you skip optional tombs, exploring and challenge missions I guess you can maybe halve that time. Had lots of fun and got slightly fatigued after the 10 hour mark.I bought the Survival edition which have an extra comic and soundtrack with it. More about this in the bottom.The game has a good mix between shooting, exploring and story. They have opted for a heavily scripted game with the majority spent exploring and climbing around with smaller sections of shooting and very cinematic scenes taking the story and game forward. This I felt were very engaging but can at times lose all grip of reality in favour of creating an exciting experience. Personally, I find it clashes a bit with the realistic graphics.Lara is an amazing character and while she shines brightly and you care for her, the rest of the cast comes off as dull and incompetent, placing all blame on Lara and expecting her to give it all while they do nothing. This becomes increasingly apparent when she is bloody, scratches all over her body and they look almost pristine and unharmed. Yet they doubt her and leans on her for everything. Lara seems to be clueless until the very end and do not see the patterns from everything that she finds in the world, highly questionable to me and kind of immersion breaking. So in short the writing and characters could have gotten a bit more work.The island itself features many different areas and styles and I really really wonder how they could have built all that without ever leaving the island to get more resources or noticing that everything is going to ♥♥♥♥ as soon as they try to leave. Making about 50% of the environments completely unrealistic by the terms of the story.The gameplay is slightly arcady and while Lara cannot jump quite as high as in previous games you have loads of aircontrol and its generally just a good feeling running and jumping. There is quite a bit of climbing around, often it feels as if you move as much vertically as you move horizontally. It kind of feels like Batman: Arkham Asylum/City without the cape and slightly different tools. This is not a bad thing and its quite enjoyable.The shooting is quite realistic, enemies aren't bullet sponges and with a steady hand most encounters are finished quick and without problems. It was only when I were getting impatient in the fights that I died.The beginning of the game is extremely QTE heavy and its kind of hard to know what button you should press. Having one icon up on the screen and an explanatory text in the bottom actually saying which button you should hammer, the system is quite stupid but after the first 30minutes you get to act on your own and its not that common after that.The graphics are crazy good, I played most of the game with the unpatched graphics (which I believe all have been fixed now) but didn't notice or care about that at all, the environment and work involved in everything is amazing. The TressFX hair AMD have created certainly makes the hair look good when close-up, but most of the time it kind of flop around everywhere and you can clearly see the collision hitbox down by her shoulders, making the hair float 5-10 cm over them. I turned it off and the normal hair is just as good as it doesn't look crazy at times or effect the performance.Performance wasn't a problem most of the time, i played on normal quality and my GeForce 570 handled it well, a few hiccups here and there (most notably after the graphics patch or with TressFX hair activated) but maybe future Nvidia drivers will be better optimized so even those will be gone.Continued in comments."

Lara makes so many unfathomable decisions that had me shouting at the screen. The amount of times she could have saved someone/killed someone important etc. she stands still and just lets things play out. I thought it was cool at the beginning when the enemies armed with bows are audibly spooked when Lara finds an assault rifle because the difference in effectiveness between a bow and a firearm is huge and the game understood that. Then Lara proceeds to forget she has a gun at every oppertunity, using the bow instead or just nothing at all and let people die. Why?! Why are you so baffling?That's not to mention a lot of the scripted sequences. It felt like Michael Bay on cocaine. How did any of the ancient structures last so long when all it takes is a bit of a thud to send them all crashing down. Not to mention all of the structures that have been built and actively maintained by the enemy faction that are somehow just as brittle. How many hundreds of them have fallen to their deaths off camera? I'm all for spectacle but a lot of it is so absurd it just breaks the immersion and completely disconnects you from what's going on and from Lara. That's not even mentioning the horrible janky physics.The saving grace that kept me playing for so long was the alright combat but it's not really and different from any other 3rd person shooter. That said there's no real depth to be found here. You'll reach a designated point, the game will throw a few waves of easily dispatched enemies at you and then you just point and click. There are 3 major enemy types, shooty people, stabby people and grenadey people. There are occasionaly shield enemies but they're very rare. In theory, these enemy classes should make the combat frantic. Guns pin you down as Lara dies very quickly to machine guns and the like especially on hard, but grenades and melee units would flush you out of cover, forcing you to try and weave in between incoming fire and enemy units. In reality, there's almost always a convienient red barrel right next to the entire enemy horde and the only strategy comes from not blowing all the barrels up at the same time. Even in the rare fights where there are none, shooting the obligatory grenade guy a couple of times has the same effect of killing everyone. So what is this game's strong point? The puzzles are nothing like the rest of the series, being very watered down in the name of accessability so they're out. Combat is meh. The stealth is pretty rudimentary, just hope you can headshot everyone before someone notices a body. After an intense shootout they will be another group 10 metres ahead that are apparently all deaf and didn't hear it. What I do think is the strong point of this game would be the graphics. They still hold up 5 years later if you don't look too closely, even looking better than some games released now. If you're looking for a good-looking, cheesey, cliche-ridden action film of a game, only then could I recommend this game. I'm not a huge fan of Uncharted but I genuinely don't understand how people think this holds up against it. It's like one of those Chinese bootlegs in comparison.In conclusion, this game is about as shallow as reality TV star in almost every aspect while being incredibly linear so it doesn't get away with it like Elder Scrolls. Lara is one of the most frustrating protagonists I've ever had the displeasure of playing as and I don't understand any of the praise this game gets. The older games area  mile better and Uncharted is just a better version of this, even if it also has its own share of flaws. Maybe pick it up if it goes on sale but otherwise avoid this game.Also screw forced walking sections."

3013,Noble Gamer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Noble_Gamer/,3,,1,25.5,January,"19,","1,226",0,1,"As the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played, I can recommend this third person adventure shooter to nearly anyone, with only reconsideration for people who want great stories or are hardcore about shooters. I completed 80%+ of the game in ~20 hours. Achievements arent proportional to that because there's some multiplayer and ""collect all X"" achievements. I cant say I've played multiplayer yet, but I may check it out sometime since the last time I played third person multiplayer shooter was Max Payne 3 and I really enjoyed that.Here's what you need to know:+AAA graphics, sounds, and polish are all here that still stand out 8 years later+Characters are decently crafted with their backstories & expressions.?The story is alright, but nothing special.+Controls are tight and can seamlessly change between KB+M and controller, which I switched half way through, and I actually preferred controller a bit more.?There are occasionally scenes that are quicktime events (QTE) where certain button presses have to be done or else theres failure or death. Sometimes these work and are intuitive and sometimes they are out of place.+Some great cinematic running/climbing/near-parkour scenes where the UI is hidden. If this is mistake for a QTE or an uncontrollable cutscene though, you'll die.? Only 2-3 bugs I encountered ever, one with a boss type enemy, but was able to clear it after reloading to checkpoinr then campsite.? Checkpoint and camp system work pretty well.-There could be more fast travel camps. Fast travel seems to serve no purpose in the story other than backtracking for collectibles, XP, and such. So lack of fast travel forces unnecessary terrain travel.?If you want open world exploration to grab all the things, you can, and its not totally critical to getting through the stoet. I personally would've enjoyed the game more had I not spent more time getting collectibles.+Ample opportunities for stealth kills, but dont mistake this for allowing all stealth through much. You will have to shoot a good amount whether with bow, gun, or more. There are melee attacks, melee stun, and melee kill opportunities. Most of the time you'll have your choice, but of course some situations will naturally limit choice like large groups of enemies.+In game tutorials are relatively unobtrusive and work well in context for new tools, weapons, or secondary abilities.+The main story was just the right length since it ended before I got tired of it or where it would send me. If you still want to explore, you can after completing the story.I was surprised how much I enjoyed Tomb Raider. It wasnt a GOTY for me, but I understand how it can be for other people and for me it is one of the more enjoyable adventure games I've played in quite some time, even if its story is not particularly memorable. I am very much looking forward to playing Rise of the Tomb Raider later this year."

It's a solid game with some stunning visuals and they sure did a good job when modelling and animating Lara, she really looked cool and felt great to control, but that is basically all that stands out. The story is mediocre, at times pretty cheesy, the characters are stereotypes - with Lara being no real exception - and this game is barely anything I remember from my older Tomb Raider times. You fight people mostly, the action is ok but wasn't very challenging on normal difficulty. There is some platforming, but not that much, none of it being really difficult anyway, and the puzzling at it's ""heights"" requires you only to pull or push a thing or two within a rather easily doable time limit. The optional ""tombs"" are a joke - slightly bigger caves at best that you can do in a very few minutes only to get some ""salvage"" you don't really need anyway (see below).I've heard people call the game a reboot of the series. They are clearly moving away from their roots. That isn't necessarily bad if one can enjoy dozens of quicktime events and narrowly directed gameplay paths and cutscenes in chliché manner (everything Lara climbs breaks, every path she goes soon or later goes up in flames - it's a very predictable manner and was overused in Uncharted as well). I just wish the game had more unique aspects. It felt like a watered down cinematic action title and a very drastic Uncharted clone. Which is kind of funny because Uncharted was called a Tomb Raider clone in the beginning. Funny how things can turn around.The game has an XP system and a multiplayer. I don't know. Do they wanted to do it? Is Square Enix pushing them? It doesn't seem very fitting. You upgrade your mostly combat-related skills and weapons through the XP system and through ""salvage"" which basically serves as money. But if the combat is already easy enough there isn't any need to do that unlike you are a completionist, which I am not by nature. I've only played one multiplayer match thus far, and it looks mediocre too. It's PvP only. Pretty sad. After I was done with Uncharted the online co-op of it made me stick around a lot longer. Tomb Raider lacks that, and since the PvP doesn't look too appealing I will probably not stick around much longer with this game. I'm glad I got it pretty cheap during some sale. And even though I might check out the previous installments - my last one before this reboot title was Tomb Raider 4 - I will be very careful about the next installment in the series."

The island you are on is full of huge amounts of Russians for no good reason. Even with the huge amount of people that have been on the island, including BOTH the Japanese and Untied States military at one point, nobody knows anything about it. But now the satellite radio, that should work as it is intended but conveniently doesn't unless it's at the top of a radio tower, can be used to call for help from the top of the radio tower, that apparently nobody outside of the people on the island knew about, and now everyone should know about the island. right? f*** if I know.

Because of course. every single moment of this games story is made of random garbage that defies physics, logic, reason, and interest. that’s it! I’m done with the unbelievably bad dumpster fire of a story!Now for the gameplay!The gunplay sucks. I would try to say more about this but I just don't know why it feels so bad and unsatisfying. But this is an adventure game so there should be some adventuring... right? nope. everything is basically linear and the one or two times there is opportunity to look around you are blocked by something impassible, there is nothing there, or it is one of the two or three small tombs that are clearly neglected little side puzzles that the developers thought were not important and didn't spend any time on. The game basically revolves around falling off things, getting blown up, getting stabbed/shot, stupid quick time events, or hurting yourself in other stupid ways while sporadically shooting toy guns in between.And now for the graphics.At first the graphics looked nice and the scenery in the distance looked well done. But I have to take off for the awful fire, water, and foliage physics and detail. The foliage is actually fine if its far away or there is fog. However, the fire and water are almost as bad as they could possibly be.I heard this game has multiplayer, but I don't know anything about or why this game would have it to begin with. I suppose multiplayer may redeem this game in some way, but I seriously doubt it.TLDR: quite possibly one of the worse stories I have ever seen.

The previews made it look and sound almost akin to an ""On Rails"" campaign. I'm happy I was wrong.Tomb Raider ends up feeling great as a game. It feels like the classic iterations of the series often while giving players updated game play to put the game into the top tier of today's AAA blockbusters. A ton of exploring and unlockables are available if you want to do all that otherwise there's an exciting game that will keep you on your toes the whole way through. Tomb Raider feels a little long at parts but the story is well written and will keep you engaged. The characters however are not. Aside from Lara and her older buddy everyone else comes across as flat. The other characters can't decide who they like, what they want to do, or basically anything, often. Also the quick time events are not as bad as you might expect. When they do come you'll still be cursing them. I'm positive when I say I hit about 20% of them on my play through. The timing never felt right. The inconsistencies between cut scene and quick time were very confusing. At some points where you would expect there to be an event the in-game movie would just play out. Even at places where action was happening that you could have participated in. Where as some quick time events will happen that have you thinking to yourself, ""Really?""All in all Tomb Raider was a good game.

She's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ super hero in this game.The environments that aren't just corridors feel more like a series of explorable hubs that have nothing of interest or challenge.Any platforming you can do is often trivial, flat and carries no risk.

In roughly 25 years of gaming, I never had any problems with a single one of them. But this game... this game is 'special' in a really bad way.I don't mind some screenshaking and head-bobbing... lots of games have it and it never bothered me. But here it is RIDICULOUSLY high. On my search of a way to reduce it or turn it off, I stumbled upon so many threads on so many forums, where people are reporting that it renders it unplayable for them... more than I've ever seen for any other game before. And I can totally understand it.I'm a normal human being and not suffering from motion sickness. This game isn't inducing it either. I don't feel nauseous or anything... but it's really on the brink. It strains my eyes. They HURT. After just 30 minutes of playing this abomination of a screenshaking simulator, they're throbbing. I'm actually happy I alt-tabbed out of it right now, writing this review so my eyes can get a little rest.I'm not kidding! It really is THAT bad. Funnily enough they added it to give it a natural feeling. But it is SO MUCH that it feels completely unnatural and uncomfortable and it looks like ♥♥♥♥. Cut scenes are by far the worst. Even the cinematics that are no hand-cam shots and which are depicting fairly quiet scenes - like Lara sitting next to a camp fire - are shaking worse than the landing scene in Saving Private Ryan (again: I'm not exaggerating)! It's frantically jittering and flickering like crazy every second! When Lara is sitting at that camp fire, talking into the radio, you can't even fix her eyes in the close-up, because it's shaking so hard. She's calmly sitting next to a camp fire ffs! There are no explosions, no action, nothing. And the screen is shaking as if there's a Soviet artillery barrage at the start of the Berlin offensive... It is just ridiculous.If I were to refrain from sleeping for three days, drank 10l of coffee, get my hands broken and hosed down with icy water I could hold a handcamera more stable than that...When even someone who doesn't have motion sickness is having issues and can tell that this is totally overboard, something is really screwed up.Some people are making fun of the ones who get sick from this game... I feel like anyone who DOESN'T get affected at all by this amount of screen shaking can't possibly be sentient.I honestly cannot understand that they thought this was a good idea and it is absolutely pathetic that in more than 5 years they haven't patched an option into the game to turn this off, despite so many complaints and pleads from the players. Same goes for the missing FoV slider... the terrible FoV basically goes hand-in-hand with the shaking and only makes it worse.There might be a good game underneath that earthquake footage that is going on on my screen, but after just 30 minutes of playing, I seriously don't know if I can torture myself to play through it."

The freedom that it's given to the player ( you can basically do almost anything except climbing a few walls , flying [] ) and another awesome stuff is that the game lets you choose what you want to do in combat and the stealth technique felt like in Thief .I don't want to say anything more because i'm afraid i'll start giving spoilers so the one and only thing i will say it's : BUY IT !

I had a lot of fun exploring the island and uncovering further bits of lore and characterization to expand on what was told during the main story. I thought the climax was a little too easy to determine what was going on, but they did well with what they were trying to do. The only nitpicks I had with the game was that sometimes I felt the controls weren't as intuitive as they could have been especially with the QTEs.

Especially when it's on sale and you can get it for $3, like seriously, you have no excuse.So, okay, let's actually talk about the game a bit. The comparison is made to Uncharted, and yeah, they're basically the same thing. And to be fair I think Uncharted, particularly 2 and 4, is generally BETTER... but Tomb Raider is really great in its own right. The campaign is long and satisfying, the stealth gameplay is pretty fun (although could be executed better, and the somewhat lackluster enemy AI makes stealth play a crapshoot), and the exploration is really great, like you're actually rewarded for going off the beaten path and poking around (which is something I think Tomb Raider does BETTER than Uncharted).The Good:Great graphics for a five-year-old gameVery satisfying combat and stealth mechanicsExploration is a lot of fun, puzzle-solving in the optional tombs is greatEnvironments are varied and lushThe Bad:The story is okay at best. I don't expect a super engrossing story in a game like this, but it's perfunctory to say the least.Considering the game is already five years old (geez, that's hard to believe honestly), it can be a little janky in places. But overall it's aged pretty well.The Ugly:Character animations can be a little... odd... sometimes. Haha.The Verdict:If you haven't played Tomb Raider 2013, you owe it to yourself. It's a solid action-adventure title, especially if you enjoyed the classic Tomb Raiders or any of the Uncharted titles. I've had TR2013 in my Steam Library for years, but I put off playing it until yesterday, and I binged through it in a day. Now to play through Rise! And I'm eagerly awaiting Shadow."

As a diehard fan of the Tomb Raider i was highly disappointed, since this is a total turnover of everything. As a game it is very well-constructed, very goodlooking and engaging.

3064,HK-47,https://steamcommunity.com/id/levicki/,12,,0,0.7,June,"26,",101,0,1,"As a big Lara fan who played all Tomb Raider games from the very first one to current remakes and franchise reboots, the fact that I have managed to stand only 43 minutes of this sequel in a single play session should be a reason enough for you not to buy it.Since this is a review after all, let me tell you what you can expect from this game:GOOD - Stunning graphics (running everything on Ultra here on GTX680) - Bargain priceBAD - Clumsy, laggy controls - Awfull camera angles - Checkpoints (no saving when you want it) - QTE (Quick Time Events -- mindless button mashing when told to by the game)I won't comment on the story since Tomb Raider was never about the story alone -- it was an adventure where you could roam through large spaces sometimes having to go back and forth while often solving non-obvious puzzles before you were able to move on. And you wanted to move on because you wanted to find the next puzzle, to explore and find the next secret area.Without spoiling too much of this game, let me just tell you that your first goal is to survive and escape some cave. Every action you can perform the game will helpfully spoil by showing you an on-screen tip explaining what you can do by pressing this or that button. All puzzle elements are made even more obvious by semi-transparent icons, even more so with survival instinct power which you have and which conveniently highlights the key items or paths in the room.Trying to play this game I have realized that my passion for adventure games has not changed. What has changed is the target audience for the genre -- Tomb Raider 2013 like many other new games is targeted at casual console players who don't want their brains getting tired by hard-to-solve puzzles, and who will play it on a gamepad dutifully mashing the buttons when told to. Out with exploration and freedom, in with hand-holding and linear game play.If you liked Tomb Raider I, II, III, IV... you should not bother with this game -- it has nothing in common with those old titles except for the heroine name -- the only thing worth playing for is its stunning visuals provided that your PC can handle them."
3065,hiddo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hiddo01/,8,1,0,7.8,August,"15,",322,0,1,"--PERSONAL THOUGHTS, IF YOU DON'T AGREE, THAT IS FINE--*SPOILERS WARNING*First of all, I get it that the game was released over 5 years ago but if you plan to buy this on sale, hear me out.Often the game forces you to walk slowly/wait for the voice lines to finish which artificially prolongs the game time.I had no interest in exploring any tombs as the first one that I have completed contained only a large amount of scrap, which is uneccessary as most of the upgrades that you get for your weapons can be obtained by normal gameplay, without raiding the tombs.Skins that you get by getting the full package on sale are garbage. They implement minor changes like climbing vest or pants. I just ran with the default outfit all the time.Everyone is oblivious to what's happening on the island and what is the reason you cannot leave. You can figure this ♥♥♥♥ out in less than an hour (I might be exaggerating but I'm pretty sure you will catch on once you find some clues).Every, single time you split up with your group, one of them ends up being dead or the whole group is in trouble. You can catch on pretty quickly or find out later in the game why but to be honest, this was so predictable that once you go alone somewhere, you know you are going to get back to a fight or aftermath of it.You feel like you are being held by hand most of the game. When something importaint is happening or you are presented with a new path, your camera will zoom on it and you can bet that you will be waiting for a script to end so you can move either at your normal pace or move at all.Oni warriors are creating this image throughout the game that they are powerful creatures with inhuman instincts.They are just a reskin of the enemies that you face except maybe one of them... You would think that you would be running away from them but no.No you don't. You just shoot them in the head once to get rid off their helmet and second time to kill them. Ruined potential there.Two scenes that ruined them completely for me is the first one, where you sneak pass them when they are performing a ceremony and they could very easily and clearly spot you but they don't. You are literally hanging on a ledge across them where if they looked up at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 30 degree angle they could see you. Hell, I don't even think they would need to look up at all.  You are only spotted when you get through the and area drop some rocks off the ledge, which is a cutscene by the way.Second scene was on the bridge where two Oni guardians were protecting it. Whitman is being tricked by the antagonist that they are waiting for their queen and he should greet them. So of course, he does that and fails which gets him killed. Now, there were two guardians and both of them killed Whitman, which wouldn't even leave the bridge unattended. Antagonist somewhat gets to run by them dragging a girl with him and Oni guardians cannot catch him/spot him in time. THAT just left me amazed how stupid they can be which was later confirmed in combat how weak and pathetic they are.Minibosses are a joke. The first one I thought might be a challenge but I dodged him three times, countered and it was over before I even knew that was a miniboss. Same for the one right before the ""main boss"". You dodge his attacks, shoot him in the back several times, add more QTEs to get his mask off, repeat until you get a prompt and finish him with a QTE (because why the ♥♥♥♥ not) and you are done. Not to mention that you will be stuck in a pointless cutscene/script afterwards.And a final boss is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ QTE. QUICK. TIME. EVENT. Which for me, ruined the whole ending.All of this made finishing the game a chore and I had no interest in getting all the collectibles or playing it again.Again, this is five years after the game came out but if you want to get it on the sale... In my opinion, avoid it at all costs. One of the worst games I have ever played and a massive disappointment."

I recommend Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld over this. Even Lara Croft and the Guardian of the Light is better. Lara Croft is much more likable in the past games than she is in this reboot trilogy! This game takes itself way to seriously and tries to be dark, gritty, and depressing.

I was collecting everything I could and finished the game on 100% Completion. The map takes place on Ancient Japanese lost island Yamatai.

Anyways, she is with her crew going to the place where is supposed to be a Ancient Yamatai, the old lost Japan Island. As they are getting closer sky gets darker, heavy rains and horrifying storms with dangerous waves begin. They end up crashing and splitting. Lara gets on the island and gets hit in her head. You wake up in the cave underground and you are realizing you are not alone on the island. Place will tell you that there are cannibals. Later on will Lara realize that the storm that caused crashing you ship wasn't random storm, it looks like the storm comes whenever is someone trying to enter the island or leaving it. There will be MANY old ship wrecks from many countries which means the ships were crashing there for many ages. After few minutes of gameplay you will find your crew and will try to get everyone  together and find a way out of the island. You also find a guy called Mathias who is a person that crashed on island long time ago but he is not as much friendly as he looks at the first meet, he has big army of his follower and he will kidnap your friend, try to kill you and try to sacrifice you friend in order to bring Himiko back to life.

3089,Benjamoose,https://steamcommunity.com/id/benjamuffin/,18,,0,1.4,September,"29,",482,4,1,"Fantastic graphics but unfortunately one of the most boring games I have ever played.""Tomb Raider"" attempts to reboot a franchise that had already been successfully rebooted several years earlier thanks to the trilogy of ""Tomb Raider: Anniversary"", ""Tomb Raider: Legend"" and ""Tomb Raider: Underworld"". If you've never been interested in the Tomb Raider franchise in the past, I highly recommend trying this original reboot series first. The characters and voice acting is impeccable, and for a game made in 2008, Underworld holds up graphically even today.As for the reboot;Never do I feel like I'm in control. Lara moves from one situation to the next through overly animated sequences, and I'm not even referring to cutscenes. Simply travelling from one end of a hallway to another can often be ""hold forward and watch as a specific set of animations play to make this seem all cinematic and cool!"".Not to mention the amount of quick time events strewn throughout the game from every given moment.We're thrust into a story with a bunch of characters that we are not given any enough time or back-story to care about. To which end none of which act logically. The combat is bland and repetitive, the linear level design is simplified to the point where simply moving through a level seems to be a test of how long you can keep focus.Lara's new voice borders between irritating and just absolutely obnoxious, every five seconds the game feels it needs to remind us how vulnerable she is by constantly narrating random lines such as ""I can do this"" and ""oh my god!"", a needless skill tree and weapon upgrade system is tacked onto the game in an incredibly unfitting way also.The main problem with this game is that it tries to take pieces of several other successful game series' (such as Far Cry and Uncharted) and mixes them all together in a way that somehow forgets what made them fun and popular in the first place. It never quite hits the mark on any of them and as such feels very generic and repetitive. It also flicks between realistic and fantasy at it's own whim to serve itself. In the opening hour we see Lara fall two feet onto a stick of metal/an arrow (I'm not sure what it was) which penetrates through her body, trap her foot by the ankle in a hunting ""snap"" trap (something that can break your ankle FYI) and fall down various mountainsides on her way to the next area. All of which without any medical assistance at all, yet she recovers mere moments later (hours in the story's logic, which is still ridiculous).In a game that attempted to turn Lara away from her apparent and so called ""misogynistic"" past (something the recent reboot trilogy already managed to do to some extent) it has an awesome ability of making her look like a constant damsel in distress. The opening scene for example gives an internal dialogue about finding strength in times of weakness, then moments later has her pulled to her rescue multiple times by several male characters, already negating the pointless hollowing of a once interesting character.The reboot also assumes too much about the players knowledge of her previous incarnation. We never learn much about who she is, why being a ""Croft"" matters beyond fan recognition, her motives, and so on, and thus Lara never really feels like a real person.That said the game does look very good graphically speaking. The game does well in it's cinematic department and makes the whole experience feel like a Hollywood movie. The crying shame is, a Hollywood movie, is not what I want to play, and as such, one of the last remaining great video game characters has finally been laid to rest alongside Spyro the Dragon and Crash Bandicoot.Thankfully we still have Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light, but I'm incredibly disappointed thus far with this new direction, and the near flawless reviews it has somehow received. I wasn't expecting to magically like it more than the previous games, but I was expecting it to at least keep my interest. It's definitely a game made for more modern sensibilities; no challenge, no gameplay, and incredible focus on ""looking good"" and appealing to a wide audience.To repeat myself; if you've never been able to get into the Tomb Raider series, I highly recommend the previous reboot starting with Anniversary (then Legend and Underworld). Underworld in the least should keep you interested, but I'm afraid this new ""reboot"" is certainly not for me."

However, as an achiever, I'm very disappointed that a large number of achievements are multi-player related when multi-player is almost non-existent. To make matters worse multi-player is infested with hackers. When I checked the leader-board, every single player in the top 20 had over 1 million kills and a handful of deaths. Not only was the hacker problem not solved but they didn't even clean up the leader-board. What a shame! To add insult to injury some of the single player achievements are bugged and not unlocking. For example I  got the Archeologist (>75% of relics) but not Relic Hunter (> 25% of relics) and already finished the game. I probably killed & skinned double the big animals required but still no Big Game achievements. Same with pistol kills and head shots. The didn't even bother to fix the bugs."

There's been a good amount of both in this franchise to be sure.But this game is exactly what Tomb Raider and its fans deserve. It's the perfect blend of Lara Croft action and fun puzzles you've come to expect, but with a survival twist and a great story. I haven't been able to put it down since I bought it. As an added bonus, you're able to choose what skills and abilities Lara has as she grows into the Tomb Raider she was born to be. You're also able to upgrade her weapons as you see fit by finding salvage throughout the game.I absolutley love this game and, though I haven't finished it yet, I know I'll be coming back again and again. This is a must-play."

Amazing and fun game.Sampling of the many positives:+Good campaign length, I 100%'d this game first playthrough and got over 16hrs out of it.+Smooth gameplay that feels at home with keyboard and mouse.+Amazing looking! Animations, scenery, everything is stunning.+Interesting skill and gear enhancements.+Great platforming that at times makes you think in a good way.+Combat is solid. Shooting is smooth enough to pick people off and keep them at bay but there's a dodge and counter system that can be fun at close range too.+Treasure hunting down every item and challenge to get 100% is rewarding. Nothing is cheaply hidden but a few things take a keen eye. It was a fun challenge. Some nitpicking negatives:-Quicktime events. I never have been a fan of them in general and some in this game are ""cheap"". But there aren't a ton of events so it never gets annoying. -Way too easy. Platforming was the only time I felt in danger.  -Lackluster and disappointing end level and ""boss"". -Mild to extremely easy puzzles in the side quests (which are the only actual tombs).I love a good adventure. The story is average but presents enough of a grand adventure to suspend disbelief and get caught up in. The platforming and combat make for stellar gameplay and the graphics and animations are just icing on the cake. While fairly easy it was all around a thoroughly enjoyable experience that I most definitely will revisit down the road. I got in during the Winter Sale (2014) for $3.99USD and feel like a stole something! I'm a big fan of games for cheap and preach waiting for sales and stand by that. But feel confident spending your money on this one at any price that seems reasonable to you!"

Anyways, Lara Croft is off to explore the Ocean with her crew when they realize that some nearby island is famous for a legend: A Japanese Kabuki Princess who was overcome by guilt and rage and still haunts the site. They decide not to head that direction because of a vortex that surrounds the island! They somehow end up shipwrecked there anyways and then realize they are not alone! What vibes does that give you? ""Lost"", yep that's right. However, beneath the dense beautiful atmosphere, greeny forests and lively 4K graphics lie gore, branches that penetrate your liver, bandaging your slashed arm and getting thrown around by huge Samurai-like figures. The characters deliver a fantastic narrative that will have you confused at times, but really enthusiastic to see the story through. The graphics are amazing: this is, in my opinion, one of the best looking 2013 games and I'm not exaggerating. The gameplay mechanics are things you'd expect from literally any Tomb Raider game with an excessive use of the bow and excessive jumping quick events as well as wall-scaling.It's been all but pros up until, again, the Multiplayer: which is dead, non-functional and de-synchronizes you if you're naive enough to try rounding up your mates for a quick trigger-happy duel. I achieved that Ranked achievement online by literally asking strangers to help me, most of them asked for games in return and I guess I was too lucky to find a few that could spare time to help as long as I helped them get the same achievement in return. The achievement for grinding out level 40 took me almost 30 hours... and it was the most relentlessly boring thing I've done in a very long time. All in all, this game is great for people who don't care much about achievements and just want a new Tomb Raider experience! This has got it all and it gets a score of 7.8/10. Mutliplayer could use a lot of polishing, but I doubt they would care about it now that this game's dead and gone. The story is worth playing through at least once."

Good visuals, nice environments, good voice acting. Music can be repetitive at certain times, but overall alright.Now story isnt anything groundbreaking, but fundamentally quite alright.There are problems though. Character development of a lot of supporting characters is weak, to the point of questioning why did they even bother having them.The progression of the story could be better too. It starts out quite slow and feels rushed towards the end.The development of Lara, as a character, seems quite decent. Although some things could have been done better.The gameplay is where it has the most issues. The movement is clunky. I got the impression that game was meant to be more tilted towards stealth. It doesnt feel that well suited towards action gameplay. But towards the end you become a one man army and often stealth is in no way, shape or form an option. Not that I mind such gameplay, but considering this game is going for a serious tone, it kind of went overboard.Combat often revolves around clearing tight locals of enemies or being swarmed in a broader area by enemies. They are either melee or ranged soldiers and throughout the game they start being buffed by armor and grenade throwing. Conceptually its alright, but there was always a feeling that it lacked finesse. If there were say, less soldiers, the combat was slower, but more tactically demanding, then I think it would have been a better experience.Level design can at times feel irritating, when you are trying to figure out, where is the next twist you need to make in order to get where you want. Its trying to confuse you and that doesnt feel fun.In the game there are also several types of collectibles and challenges you need to find and clear. A lot of them are just fluff that add almost nothing to the story or gameplay. They're just there to clear out and waste time.Exploring and traversing the island is a hit and miss. Sometimes its fun, but sometimes it can feel shallow. The action scenes and events are usually fun where you need to escape a collapsing environment, but they can feel few and far in between if you dont stick to the main story line all the time.One thing I noticed that kinda bothers me. Why did all the white male characters die and all the minority characters survived? Is it that stunning and brave thing again?There are some other gripes I could discuss, but I think I got the point across.Its not a bad game, but it doesnt push the potential that it sets up. A lot of things feel mediocre, with the odd very cool moment shinning through.5.5/10"

Everything is well balanced and the game is very immersive as it makes you feel like you are part of the characters. There are many games out there which are very fun to play, but lack the bond between the player and the game character. Examples of games that give the love bond would be games lick last of us, uncharted, etc. This is one of those games. I've had it over a yaer but im not a person that plays a lot of campaign but this was a game that got me to love campaigns of games. Therefore, I just finished it with an overall completion of 66%, sadly i don't really enjoy exploring but I will definitely want to finish Rise Of The Tomb Raider wiht overall completion of 100%, which i bought yesterday ;)."

Flames animations are not the best, and they put flames and explosions everywhere. You can feel somewhat immersive without flames :) It is so arcade for me. Part of the game you get injured, barely walk. After finding a medicine you can jump up 5 meters. In the easy mode you get auto aim while playing with gamepad other difficulties don't have auto aim.

The name would imply raiding tombs and that's what you did in all the previous TR games. Besides that, you solved puzzles, explored tombs using your acrobatic skills and occasionally there would be some combat. This reboot kicked all of that out of the window and injected a massive dose of ""Uncharted"" into its vains. The tombs take a serious step back and are much smaller to the point where they become meaningless. In its place, there's a LOT of combat. There's also a ton of scripted events including the dreaded QTE's.On top of that, the camera is nauseating by being very close up without any option to alter it (some suffer from this more than others so it may not bother you) and the camera shake only agrevates the problem. I can't play this game for more than an hour at a time because of this.On the positive side, everything is beautifully animated and voiced, the story is an interesting one and the setting is beautiful but this type of modern approach is just not for me. Why are modern games all so linear, scripted to hell and back, filled with cheap QTE's with lots of hand-holding? This reboot took away the freedom of exploration, the ingenious puzzles, the massive and inspiring tombs - all of which could have still been added despite of the new scripted approach. As such, I can't recommend it to those who enjoyed the old games for these very things."

3137,Mr Ravin Raven,https://steamcommunity.com/id/raven_7306/,1,,1,9.6,January,"22,",350,0,1,"Where to start.I guess I can start off by saying this game is just what I needed. I've been playing so many open world, exploration games lately that it was such a refresher to play a *mostly* linear, story based game. This game is fantastic.Everyone else has already said in their reviews what this game is and why you should get it. I'll put some of the pros and cons from my playthrough.Pros- Makes you feel like a badass- You really get the sense of what Lara is going through, they really make you empathize with the character- The Salvage and Loot system for upgrading your weapons is very nice. You start off with little pea shooters towards the beginning of the game, but as you progress you see your weapons turn into more powerful versions of themselves. Visually and effectively, these weapons are YOUR weapons due to the work put into them.- Puzzles are very fun, and you get the sense of wonder as you explore new areas and find the small puzzles to progress through the story. There aren't many along the story, but the ones off the beaten path in the tombs are fun.Cons- The puzzles in the game at times do something different than how you think it should be done. Say I need to pull a platform down to my level to reach a ledge. I have these canisters. They look like gas or something, my first impression is they're flammable. Okay. Toss them on, it weighs the platform down. Shoot fire arrow. Nothing happens. On a small amount of occasions, my idea that I believe should have worked didn't. So sometimes you'll get stuck, and it could be for quite a couple minutes. This isn't a very big CON, but more of an annoyance.- The parkour in this game is finicky at times. I died countless times due to falling to my death. You can change the direction you move in midair, which at times is helpful for staying stealthy, but at others is irritating. You can scale cliffs with your pick. Sometimes, jumping from one scalable spot to another, you can not get to your destination because of the movement keys you were pressing. If you need to move to the side in a jumping manner, don't hold forward as well. Trust me.- The enemy AI has a real bad habit of knowing exactly where you are. When you remain stealthy, it works just fine, as you would expect, but if you kill someone and he alarms everyone, they know exactly where you are. There aren't many places where you can flank your enemy, but the times where you could get out of sight and then reposition only to find they know where you are is quite annoying.Those are my pros and cons to Tomb Raider! As you can see, my cons are all small things that don't come up very often or come up in niche conditions. Pick up this game, it's amazing!"
3138,Devis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ITechnoGaming/,2,,1,17.5,March,"24,",66,0,1,"Incredibly fun game. The campaign itself it's around 15 hours, 20 if you take your time to look around for collectibles and gears. The story is interesting enough to make you stick till the end, but the gameplay is the strongest point of Tomb Raider. Popping heads with either your bow or pistol is really satisfying.Overall, a great cinematic game that continues to age well."

If like me you bought it but always put off playing it I heavily recommend giving it a go. The gunplay and camera arent amazing but the level design and story are interesting, and the overall graphics and world design are fantastic.Despite having no interest in Tomb Raider or Lara Croft this game has made me consider having another look at the Tomb Raider series especially now ROTTR is out.BE WARNEDThis game is fairly gore heavy in places especially whenever you die, if your sensative to stuff like that dont get this game."

It exceeded my expectations even. Loved the story, how vulnerable Lara was and how she progressed. Very well done. When she grabbed the dual pistols at the end it gave me goosebumps lol. `The gameplay is really good, exploration items and tombs add many hours to the game and you certainly don`t feel cheated in terms of the length of the game.The part I didn`t like is that while in the beginning, killing someone had a big impact on her, later on she becomes to accustomed to it and doesn`t affect her. And she does kill A LOT! (you can avoid some enemies with stealth though). Another part Im not sure of is the reboot of the story. It`s a really good origin story, but I don`t know if they really needed to reboot her story from the :egendéAnniversaryéUnderworld series."

There's stunning graphics, great world layout, smart AI, unique weapon choices+upgrades, and overall an amazing game, though it's not perfect by any means. There are 2 main problems I have with this game. First, the campaign is short, itt only took me 9.5 hours. Every minute of those 9.5 were incredible. Always keeping you on your toes and intensly into the game. I just wish that there was more. Espacailly the fact that the mulitplayer is boring (second problem). It's your average 3rd person shooter with nothing that really makes it unique or stand out. A short campaign and a boring mulitplayer makes for a short experienceThis game is a great experince that I think all gamers should purchase. It's short, but worth your hard earned cash."

3149,Il Vaticano,https://steamcommunity.com/id/johnxfire/,2,,1,20.1,March,"6,","1,520",2,1,"Tomb Raider (2013), the reboot of the long-running Tomb Raider series of  platforming games, puts the series in a fresh new direction. The game is charming, and is a great effort that reinvents the game whilst keeping it true to its core.Tomb Raider explores the story of a young Lara Croft as she gets throw in the middle of an adventure that she didn't ask for. The game starts off with young Lara getting stranded in the middle of a island off of Japan, and she ventures forth into the wilderness in a quest of survival and discovery. The story itself is not terrible, but I'm not sure if it would win any awards - the character arc of Lara is a bit too short and rushed to give her the sense of transition from fresh-faced city girl to hardened tomb raider. Various story pieces also feel a bit convoluted, with some deaths being shoved in out of nowhere. However, the overarching mystery of the island and its back story is excellent and drives the player to seek out more journal entries and artifacts to learn more about the area. Sadly, I feel that the game rushes the end, and leaves a lot of lore hanging in the air, which is a shame, as it was a very good ride to the end.Graphically, Tomb Raider may very well be one of the better looking releases in recent memory. Model and texture quality is excellent. The environments are all well designed, varied, and interesting. Each area manages to deliver the ambiance that the developers set out to, and I felt a bit terrified in some areas of the game, truth be told. TressFX is an interesting feature, but is a very big performance leech - you wont lose much from turning it off, as it only affects Lara's hair. It's fairly well optimized - on launch, I ran it on a 7970M on max, save for TressFX, and was averaging around 40-50fps. Now, when I go back to it with my current laptop sporting a GTX 765M, I still run it on max, albeit at 900p, on 60fps. It is a well optimized game, and should run well on most modern systems.The gameplay takes a big leap from old Tomb Raiders. Based on personal experience, I did play Tomb Raider 3 on my PlayStation 1 - combat there was far more sparse, and emphasis was on puzzle solving and tomb raiding. This time around, combat takes a bigger role in the game - indeed, the actual tomb raiding is now set aside as optional side quests that give you perks if you do them. They are, however, well designed, if not a bit small - each tomb is unique, with various puzzles, and well-thought designs. The only bothersome thing about the game is the QTEs - they are numerous, but not enough to completely wreck the game, in my opinion. They are a nuisance, however - less would have been better.Overall, this game is a great restart for the franchise. Hopefully Square will listen to feedback and tune it further, but that remains to be seen."

3153,waterplease,https://steamcommunity.com/id/waterplease05/,5,,0,9.9,May,"6,",132,0,1,"So last tomb raider i played was something on my ps2 way back when i was a kid and it was one of the best platforming, puzzle solving, and gun play inducing games i had at the time. No matter how much i played it something in it brought me back whether i wanted to grapple hook around in a level or shoot some dinosaurs again.When i saw this game i got the same thrill. Me being poor and also seeing this game on a mega hype train i decided to wait for a sale or a price drop. And i did, i got it at $12.My advice is wait out for a sale especially seeing how its now 19.99 and will most likely remain at that, but its not worth it. I have put in 9 hours of this game and thats including me taking time out to run around and do collectables, upgrade every weapon, explore every tomb, and me just standing at some of the campfires for a bit reading the journals you pick up through the story. All in all i feel terrible for people who got this game for 59.99 cuz they wasted their money on it. The puzzles are lacking or so simplified down that i only had trouble with one of them, but the puzzle i had issue with wasnt even part of the main story it was in one of the OPTIONAL tombs that you can run right by, so if its too dificult you didnt have to do anything but turn around. 9 hours is my play time and this games replayibility is non existent i wouldnt even play it again for a stream or youtube series.SPOILERSMain story and action: Main story was alright but very lacking but every question i had was either eventually answered or found in the journals around the island so its no big deal. Fighting in the game and bosses kinda pisses me off. So at the beginning of the game you are thrown a pistol and a bow and one is for loud play and one for stealth and the beginning and you can really choose what route u wanna take and theres actual routes to move to help wiht either way you wanna run through the beginning. This stops right after you get out of the first area and about maybe into your second or 3rd hour of play. It becomes all run and gun no stealth anymore and if theyre werent little add ons to the bow to help me get scrap, make a zipline, or rip open doors and ♥♥♥♥ it woulda been the most useless weapon in the game since after the 3rd hour for sure you are facing at every location either every enemy shooting at you from a distance which you can just use ur gun back since theres no  reason to be stealthy at that point or you are getting rushed by waves of enemies until you win and move on to the next section. Bosses? Lacking, and the only boss you really play is this sloth from the goonies looking thing that you see throughout the whole game whooping ass and being a scary presence. Until you fight it. When you finally are doing battle with the thing youre about 10 mins away from finishing the game and i have to say the battle took me 5 mins at most and i honestly wondered if anyone died to it more than once and if they did they must be playing with their feet or no monitor because its that easy and lacking. After you do all that you finally get to the end game boss which is the god taking over your friends soul like a vessel type stuff. You shoot her in the face wiht like 3 arrows and she dies and you win. AKA lacking. The whole game builds you up for this battle against the god that you think is gona be this huge fight like something out of half lifes 2 end boss but in the end its you shooting a statue looking thing 3 times until it cuts to a cutscene of her floating into the air exploding and boom everythings happy now. This game felt like $12 dollars, i got it for $12, and id never purchase this game ever for more than $15. Besides all that the game was fairly good and im not gonna force you to get it or not but this is one of the games i have that i wanted to voice on, but its still a good game, its not clunky or buggy at all even with me trying at one point to break it, physics are funny at times with ragdolls and the game does suck you into feeling a way for certain characters from the very beginning to the very end even with feeling some type of sympathy towards the main villian for why hes doing what hes doing which is great. Amazing writing and voice acting and a huge plus on that. Artwork wise the game is beautiful and different parts of the island really suck you in espeicially ones with little journals near them you can read that make you feel as if you are not only in the game but went back in time to feel what happened to some of the old soldiers or citizens felt before you got there. Weapons upgrading actually made you feel more powerful and like actual upgrades rather than just tacky shiny extras (except the bow). The upgrades aswell although i found that the ones that were most prominent were the ones relating to gaining extra scrap or meat from animals or corpses while the ones relating to hand to hand combat were awful since theres no point or even attempt at being that close to an enemy when every weapon you have is long range and if you are even that close to an enemy you should be in stealth doing a stealth kill not some crazy combo move with you pick axe cuz then everyone just turns around and shoots you for being out in the open and dumb. Other upgrades leading to extra storage of ammo and better looting of bodies were amazing and made the game ride smoother though. Parkour in the game was fantastic down to every feature you had, climbing felt realistic and movements in the game were paced down to realistic paces like climbing up or down a rope or runnning up a wall. It didnt feel like i was just flying up a wall or speed climbing around like a monkey. Also congrats on the dev team to make the parkour 100% not glitchy or iffy. Not once did i feel like if i had to climb certain objective high obstabcle would i have a chance of the game just saying ♥♥♥♥ you and me falling to my death, i felt in as much control of laura as she looked to be through my screen, some games by ubisoft cant seem to get that right anymore *cough* *cough*. Other wise good game but i wouldnt recommend getting for full price now even though its only $19.99 i still would suggest getting it for $15 or less.TL;DR Either wait for sale down to $15 or < or dont touch it at all, took me 9 hours to complete while doing optional collectables, tombs, and journal readings. Mid to end game messy and unsatisfying. writing and visuals fonominal. Nothing felt clunky or out of my control when traveling throughout the game. 6.5/10Edit: Anyone you see who has more than 15 hours in this game mot likely let it sit running to get cards.Edit 3 years later: games on sale for $2 so there ya go."

3169,ThatBeardedHistorian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Croaker1084/,2,,1,30.7,February,"15,",149,0,1,"I am hiding behind cover in the darkness in an desparate attempt to escape unseen after being caught by members of the Solarii Brotherhood led by a medthodical madman known as Mathias. Just a few short hours ago I had been captured just after the shipwreck, only to break free and sustain a nasty wound. Now, here I am having been caught again, but fighting back, and while my hands are bound I move quietly through the paths that are dotted with rock, rumble, shrubs and trees. They're searching for me. I have to be careful of the flashlights, if I am spotted I will die instantly in a hail of gunfire. I make my way to what appears to be safe shelter, but alas, I am discovered by one of the Solarii and taken, a struggle breaks out with a small series of QTEs. This ends with me shooting my would be captor in the head, splattering his brains about the stone path and some soil. My bonds are broken free and I now make my way towards rescuing my shipmates, my friends. I take out severel of the Solarii with clean headshots using my bow and arrows. This is only the beginning and this adventure has sucked me in entirely. Welcome to Tomb Raider.When I first heard about the ressurection of the Tomb Raider of the Tomb Raider series, I had my doubts as whether this series' new facelift could compete with with newer IPs, such as Uncharted or the Batman Arkham IP for instance.I was very pleasantly surprised by the work of Crystal Dynamics. I feel, having played through the Uncharted series, that Tomb Raider surpassed it by leaps and bounds. I felt that CD breathed new life into Lara Croft in a way that I could never imagine.No more cliche outfits with huge breasts, they kept her beautiful and tasteful, yet sexy and desirable; appealing to everyone on the spectrum. The Origin story of how Lara Croft becomes not only a survivor, but a tomb raider is an outstanding work. The story has a natural pace to it, the pace quickens at the right moments and slows at the right moments to allow the player the time to explore optional tombs and to find and collect relics and documents. Characters are fleshed out well, despite the fact that they really don't have much screen time, and some characters you feel more of a bond with, like Roth. The VO work in this title is phenomenal! Aside from the story characters themselves, I always looked forward to discovering a new document just to hear the amazing VO work. Overall I would say that the origin story of Lara Croft is excellent, it pulls you in, it moves you to feel emotion. The story is well written and it isn't short, nor is it too long, it feels just right for the type of game that this is.The setpieces in this game are of some the very best that I have seen. I know that they are setpieces, but the way in which CD implemented these setpieces..makes the setpieces and gameplay meld together in way in which it isn't too obvious. CD doesn't overdo the setpieces either, but the setpieces that are in place are epic. Even the smaller setpieces. The gameplay for this title was very solid, the controls, unfortunately aren't that greatly suited to KB/M, so I used a control pad, in that regard the controls were very tight. I had no problems getting Lara to do what I wanted her to doat the very moment I needed her to dodge an enemy attack, to falling from a cliffside and catching herself with the pickaxe. I was very pleased with how the controls worked, with the exception of the KB/M. I am a PC gamer, and thus I prefer KB/M (duh).The combat system overall felt new and fresh in so many ways, whereas in a few ways it did feel a bit stale. Hiding behind cover and popping out to take pop shots is standard fare. So, I put the combat system to the test. I played on hard and used only the bow through the game to kill, that and stealth kills, and melee. Of course there are certain instances in which you are forced to use your pistol. Those are rare. I made use of every tool at my disposal, in terms of pushing Lara forward and gaining ground with my bow and my pickaxe. Dodging enemy fire to the next set of cover, knowing they'll have to reload, I take my opportunity for a torso shot and as they're stunned for that brief second I put an arrow through their head. If they get too close I dodge and throw dirt, dodge and sink an arrow into their knee, etc..While Lara's art of killing isn't very refined, it does get the job done and ultimately leads to some very intense combat throughout the game. The combat stays fresh with introduction of new enemies as well as the introdution of bow parts and bow upgrades. Your tactics in combat will have changed considerably the by the end game stretch, which offers the most resistance. The one glaring complaint I do have with this game is the number of Solarii. I must have killed around 200 or more of these men. How are there so many of them? This doesn't include the ones I bypassed via stealth. In certain areas it felt like I was playing horde mode only with just a bow and some arrows. The graphics in this game are beautiful, absolutely gorgeous looking. While I didn't pay much attention to the texture detail of every item in the game, there are a few that I noticed that suffered from low-res textures, as for the majority, the textures that count, those looked great. The lighting system in Tomb Raider in very impressive, very easy on the eyes. The atmosphere of Tomb Raider was very well done in general. Each area had its own atmosphere to reflect what is happening in said area, and I feel that the artists nailed this! The Audio experience in this game made the whole adventure even more immersive and intense! My Klipsch 2.1 ProMedia set really fleshed out the audio engineering that went into this title. I also enjoyed seeing how dirty Lara could get, covered in mud, blood, waste, etc...then go into the water and she is cleaner. The progression of Lara over the game is also very well done. By the end of the game she has so many cuts and scrapes and bruises. Her clothing is torn to bits withoutbeing distateful and too revealing. All in all I can not recommend Tomb Raider enough! If you have not played this title already, you should. As I look back into the past of 2013, this game would have been my GOTY. I can't wait for the next Tomb Raider title."

To be frank, Crystal Dynamics have really done a stellar job with this.Lara and a group of friends/scientists are shipwrecked on a mysterious island off the coast of Japan. Soon after surviving the crash, they realise something or someone is hunting them, and perhaps this island holds many more secrets than they could have imagined.At its core this still IS a Tomb Raider game, the main differences being this game is more accessible for newcomers. In the pursuit of finding her ship mates and the source of violent rituals that have seemingly occurred across the island - even very recently, manoeuvring Lara will involve climbing up ragged rock faces, swinging over poles and grasping furiously onto ledges, as per normal Tomb Raider.But this one is different. The whole island although linear ultimately, feels alive. The ""levels"" connect seamlessly, animals forage around the mist laden trees and foliage - most of which can be killed and skinned for loot! There are many a beautiful vista, as Lara finds herself propped up on a sheer cliff facing the ocean complete with many a ship wreck dotted around the coastal beach areas, as the sun descends and the rain pours.Lara now has a skill tree (or two) one consists of various survival talents that will help increase loot yields and animal tracking, and a second tree being weapon upgrades. Both these trees can also be completed and further upgrade branches can opened - this of course is very different but adds a smattering of depth and diversity.Graphically the game shines on PC especially if you have a system good enough to support TRESSFX - a system that in a nut shell will make Lara's hair look and move as if it is (almost) real.Lara no longer has a 2D character, this game is well written, well voiced (Lara) and although of course suspension of disbelief has to be employed, the hardships that Lara contends with during the game ultimately do a good job of building her character, giving her depth and ever evolving strength to deal with the horror faced around every corner on the island.There are not enough tombs though.This is a problem, being a Tomb Raider game, and the ones that are there, especially for the seasoned Tomb Raider - they are easy to solve, maybe too easy. For the main this reboot is far more story driven and linear than previous efforts, for some that can be a good thing and a not so good thing.The lack of tombs though didn't really detract me from a very well designed game flow. The island is immersive, the mystery is strong and the puzzles that are encountered although not as hard-core as previous Tomb Raider games, do mostly provide some decent challenge, and most of all the game is FUN and satisfying - Isn't this a good place to start?"

The TR series has long been plagued by sexism and styreotypes of neckbeards drooling over pixelated triangle's that were boobs. Another was the platformer type puzzles that nobody really likes. So when the re-make was announced I instantly though of Sonic or any reboots any media has. Usually they turn out bad. Initial trailers made Laura sound like she was getting raped and some horrible gore scenes with QTE. Well I have never heard of ""Nixxes Software"" but they know how to do a remake properly and make a superb game.The progression of the game is just incredible. Leveling up your gear and yourself was just done right.The Graphics are just insanely good. You will be running and jumping all while stuff is crumbling around you and it's just like a movie. Best way I can describe the game is an interactive movie and you are the star as Laura. It's crazy good.The Gameplay is just great. Taking people out like Rambo with your bow is just great because Archery is cool and not many games or movies have it anymore. Near the end you will be kicking ass with a huge arsenal. Only gripes are that it's a bit easy and most of your deaths are due to QTE's and falling to your death. Really that isn't a huge biggie though.The audio is great as is the music. When you get relic's there is an audio cue that I swear to God is from Predator.Overall I give this game a 10/10. It's a long game and you can really tell they cared for the series and did it justice. This I would imagine would be the best TR game ever made. I know it's up their personally with me like Portal series, Dead Space series, HL series, etc. Most of all they made Laura for the first time really normal with naturally proportined tits. You know that I couldn't leave that out of the review. ;p"

This Tomb Raider (2013) it's far more different than I expected.The classic Tomb Raider you cannot skip the puzzle to continue the progress, but in this reboot, you just don't care or just skipped to continue story. It's not challenging like previous one even remake (Legend, Anniversary and Underworld). For me, it' was just a reboot that we play as young Lara to survive, not to hunting treasure or tombs, it's remind me like Uncharted type of games. It was too easy and too scripted like action movie games and not full control to challenge puzzle. This game just want you as Lara to kill people, not to hunting treasure.As old fan of Tomb Raider, this game was so terrible for me as title Tomb Raider but if you like action scripted games, not puzzle solving, this game is definitely for you but it's not Tomb Raider what we know before. Just play and kill everyone and watch the cutscene until end. The story also not so good, for me, it's just 'meh', boring, Tomb Raider Legend has good story than this.The characteristic in Lara also changing, this is not Lara, she just a young girl who name as Lara Croft. She lack confidence and weak, it's far different from original. The original story of young Lara also not showing her weakness. One more, in-game modelling face of Lara is so much diferent than trailer, she looks like Asian compare to her real face, but in trailer or art concept is pretty similar (which is good). I know it's reboot but this is totally wrong.This reboot was good as action genre but worst as Tomb Raider. For me, this is not Tomb Raider, this is Lara Croft : The Mass Murderer. This is definitely not 'Tomb Raider' at all.PRO : Nice and detail graphic, fun to play, good shooting mechanicCON : Only 8 tombs that also optional and big as room (really??) and scripted/railway, too easy, survival instinct it's terrible idea (looks same as Hitman or Assassin's Creed), typical action movie soundtrack, too much quick time event, no level design, no health meter (replace with generate health), no final (real) boss, boring storyline, jumping like magnet8/10 (for generic action shooter game)"
3189,♤ Ｐａｒａｄｏｘ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/polo0706/,2,,1,27.6,November,"28,",218,0,1,"As an Tomb Raider game, I highly recommend veterans and newcomers to give TR 2013 a try. It DOES feels different from the past releases, but different in a good way. As we all know, we had a new Lara Croft within this entry, and we get to know more about her throughout the game, including the way she deals with every misfortune put upon her. New Lara makes a good job to introduce the reboot series, having more of a female Rambo grip than any other. It's the very first time that I envision Lara as a survivor, when before she felt to me much more like an adventurer, always managing to have the upper hand by clever thinking and being very bold, where in this game she is pretty much the underdog until half of the story. Lara will do anything to stay alive and to keep her friends safe, I really liked that!The whole game is very consistent from start to finish, making the whole adventure much more seamless and with less halts, even giving the player a chance to take a break and inhale some fresh air once in a while (something that Tomb Raider 3 didn't even considered to). It takes up to 16 - 18 hours to complete, and if you want to do 100%, 50 hours should be enough.The controls here are very, very good. One thing I've always liked about Crystal Dynamics is how they manage to implement such great controls for Lara, making her feel the most swift and agile possible.Combat here is the best it ever had been, never liked how combat worked on the previous entries and it does feel archaic, but here it is very refined and works really well. Lara cycles through 5 weapons to fight against her enemies, so in almost every fight I changed weapons in a flight, rapidly changing the pace of the fight in my favor and giving myself the advantage I needed. I liked the story, it is original with some few nods here and there to other titles. I like how important fundamentally interwined japanese culture is to the story, so that's a plus.Is it different? A lot. Is it bad? Not by a chance.9/10"

3199,CausticSalmon,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987942713/,1,,1,24.8,August,"19,",416,0,1,"Finally, after at least a year of collecting dust in my backlog, I finished Tomb Raider. It seemed astoundingly long for such a linear game, but I suppose I had a couple of false starts that can account for a few hours. In its entirety, the game takes around twenty hours to complete (less if don't put much time into amusingly peripheral task of actually raiding tombs). I didn't bother for the majority of my play-through so my completion percentage was dismally low. Note: the completion percentage shown on the save-game is not an indication of your progress through the main story; rather an overall metric regarding the quantity of random ♥♥♥♥ you picked up during your tour of duty.	 There are a couple of things that need to be addressed. Firstly, Tomb Raider is not an open world game. Yes, you can always “fast travel” back to a previously explored area from your trusty campsite, but these are all linear levels with an entrance and an exit. The only reason a player would want to go back would be to take the odd scenic route, climb a wall, solve a puzzle, and grab some booty to gain some precious XP. Secondly, the game is one of those; it is all about upgrading, earning experience points and using them to unlock new actions which usually serve only to make the acquisition of more experience points easier. 	The game starts with a very young and vulnerable Lara and her generic comrades boating out to the South Pacific equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle to find some uncharted island. ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan, the ship hits the rocks, and Lara Croft and the ethnically varied motley crew of survivors are marooned on a miserable gray little island. Things go from bad to worse as Lara discovers this island is home to bloodthirsty cultists who are startlingly well provisioned under the circumstances. They go hog wild murdering various red shirts, and scaring the pants off this poor young girl. The game takes a kind of masochistic glee in tormenting the heroine until she transforms into Lady Rambo and effortlessly massacres a larger population than you would think this island could support. Seriously. Thousands of these silly screwballs fall victim to Lara's maddening rampage.	This brings me to the game-play. As you may have guessed, it is a shooter. It would be deceptive to brand it as anything else, and to be fair it is a pretty decent shooter. That isn't exactly what I wanted from a Tomb Raider game, but it is something it certainly does absolutely right. It is however a bit easy for the folks playing with a keyboard and mouse. Weapons are deadly accurate, and handle beautifully. In fact, it is quite possible to shoot your way out of basically any situation using just a pistol. The only part I really struggled with laughably is the quick time events (which are everywhere). I don't know if I remapped controls or what, but instead of showing a key icon, it shows a action icon; an exclamation mark for an action button thing (which I think is f), and so on. It is a pain in the hiney, and it really detracts from what would otherwise be impressive set-pieces if you didn't have to watch this poor girl meet a horribly gruesome demise seven times in a row before you figure out what key you were supposed to press. 	Speaking of QTEs, the game has an annoying habit of hijacking the camera and chasing the exceptionally unlucky Lara with it like a celestial wreaking ball, literally chewing up scenery. This forces the player to guide the terrified avatar through what feels like an extremely unsafe theme-park ride. The actions consist of sliding the character left and right to avoid spiky Croft-impaling obstacles, shooting massive piles of debris to avoid getting splattered all over the place, and finally pressing either the action key or the uh grab key to end this magic carpet ride from hell and not fall a thousand feet to your death. It wouldn't be as bad if it was just one climactic race against time, but this happens over and over and over and over again. Anywhere Lara steps is liable to crumble and send here tumbling. 	Anyway, as much as I hate this game half of the time, it is a very well produced, full on AAA game the other half. I wouldn't not recommend it."

3209,Nono,https://steamcommunity.com/id/_avde_/,10,1,0,10.9,July,"7,",236,0,1,"For being called ""Tomb Raider"", there isn't really that much tomb raiding. You're spending most of your time killing mooks. That good and all, the combat is great, but I was really hoping for (and expecting) more dungeon crawling action. And yes there are a few tombs in the game, but they're really nothing more than simple minidungeons. So yeah, combat plays a very large role. Besides that there are some platforming and puzzle sections, but they are extremely easy and there's not much of it. Exploration is also lacking. You are certainly rewarded for your curiosity, with EXP and/or materials. These can be used to upgrade weapons and unlock new abilities. Now they are well executed and certainly very usefull, but since you can also aquire both of these things from killing mooks (even though it's usually much less) it becomes far less exciting when you go out of your way to clear a tomb, just get more of the same you already have. It may be useful, but it kinda feels like a waste of time; which is a shame because you certainly don't clear them for the challenging puzzle you need to solve to get to the end. Zelda this ain't. The collectibles are great though. There's all sorts of collectibles, but the best ones are the artifacts and the diaries. When you collect an artifact you don't just get the 3D model of the item, but also a little bit of information of its original use, which is rather intresting and increases the feeling of being an adventurer. The diaries are of course from other characters, friends and enemies alike; and I like them because they give a little bit of backstory and character development to its writer. These help making the exploration better for sure, but it's just too bad you don't come across them that often.As for the combat? It's excellent. You got many different weapons that you can upgrade in useful ways as mentionned before, it's challenging in the right way, there's stealth sections and it's just very well executed. The graphics are amazing (this is a very pretty game), music is good but nothing spectacular, the story is intresting, voice acting is very good and the controls are nice and tight. Levels are mostly pretty linear but are connected to one another and you can backtrack to any area you visited in case you missed something in the more open sections. The areas you visit are very detailed and pleasing to look at, and create a nice setting, putting you in the same mood als Lara Croft would be. So, the game is not bad. It's very polished and everything works very well; no problems with level design, enemy placement, glitches, game mechanics or anything like that. It's just a shame that there is an overemphasys on combat and very little dungeon crawling. Exploration lacking and the survival element is non-existent; collecting plants or flaying animals just yields more EXP. If you don't mind that you will no doubt love this game. But if you're like me and were hoping for more emphasys on exploration, tomb raiding and puzzle solving, you might not find what you're looking for here."

(SHOCK REVELATION!?)So this time we are taken all the way back to the start of Lara's story and the narrative of the game is essentially an origin tale. We learn the background on how a young innocent woman, becomes the Lara Croft we all know and love, i.e. World class archaeologist with a penchant for revealing ancient supernatural myths to be actually true whilst acrobatically murdering endangered wildlife on the way to recovering a lost and priceless artefact.She isn't that.. in this game, not yet at least.The story begins with Lara as part of an archaeological team who along with 3 or 4 of her friends make up the support crew for TV celebrity archaeologist Dr.James Whitman. They are at sea, looking for the ancient island of Yamatai in the Dragons Triangle, just off the coast of Japan. On a hunch / educated guess from Lara, they decide to change course and sure enough.. find the island!! By crashing into it. Shipwrecked the survivors encounter a gang of bloodthirsty pirates or mercenaries who capture Lara's friends... and thus the scene is set for Lara to save them.. come of age.. and ultimately turn into.. LARA CROFT. I won't tell you any more about the story.. after all this is supposed to be a quick reaction :)So.. I already said it's an entertaining game... but why is it flawed? Well... A few reasons. The main one is that the game constantly takes control away from you to the extent that sometimes I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be actually controlling Lara Croft or not. There were more times than I can count that the game just asks you to press the ""forward"" button.. and Lara does the rest herself, ducking under things... moving around things... etc etc..Now this in itself... isn't horrible to be honest... it allows certain narrative driven events to take place, like conversations between characters over handheld radios or whatever... but it really messes up the rhythm of the game and often to the point there just isn't one at all. As a result. the story's pacing felt disjointed and all over the show... and for such a narrative led game, it really stood out for me and detracted from the experience. Others examples of issues I encountered where things like performance of the game, certain chambers or vistas would cause the game to stutter and ""chug"" seemingly at random, when seconds earlier it had been silky smooth. Lara herself demonstrates jerky animations at times, the way she really obviously changes direction in mid air and homes into scalable ledges like a heat seeking park-our expert and the inescapable feeling that despite huge rolling landscapes above , below and around you, you're just advancing down a big pretty corridor.But most of all, the biggest issue for me was how the ""gritty"" storyline of one person surviving against the elements, her hunger and the dangers around her were successfully undermined by the events Lara goes through from start to finish. Lara should be dead... so so very dead. Many times over..I know I know, it's a game, you cry!! ... but it was just SO MUCH PERIL and TOO MANY dangerous situations she faced and survived against ALL the odds that it actually ruined the semi grounded story it was trying to tell. She fell down cliffs, several times. Washed over waterfalls, several times. Pushed down rapids smashing off rocks, several times. Ledges crumbled, buildings burnt down, ropes snapped, caves collapsed, Wolves ate her, PLANES CRASHED, HELICOPTERS CRASHED, EXPLOSIONS WENT OFF IN HER FACE...You get the idea. LARA IS THE UNLUCKIEST / LUCKIEST WOMAN IN THE WORLD.There is suspending disbelief for the sake of entertainment, I can do this.. I can! But then there is just coming to the conclusion that Lara Croft is a super hero and will never ever die, no matter what situation she is in. That's how I dealt with it. ... what?! On another note I felt it was too violent .. considering Lara's apparent inexperience in combat situations at the start of the game and the emotional impact her first kill has on her... she took very quickly to hacking men's heads off with a climbing pick. It went from doing what she had to do to survive... to almost relishing a fight.. and that felt kinda wrong..Moving away from the thematic and narrative issues however... actually playing the game was alright. The combat was excellent and a real shining point, I enjoyed nearly every encounter. The times when Tomb Raider did open up and allowed you to step outside the linear corridor... which were rare... the puzzles were the solvable, but not immediately solvable kind... which is the exact right balance in my opinion.The voice acting and the overall narrative is also engaging, the graphics excellent and for the most part very well put together. Enjoyable and entertaining, finishing the game at all says a lot of course (I wouldn't finish something I hated), but quite a few bits to change and fix for the next game in my opinion although I am glad I played it through.I realise this isn't balanced, it's feelings heavy and doesn't describe what you ""do"" in the game at all... but hey there are plenty of people doing that so go read up on that if you like :)But to conclude, I recommend Lara Croft, maybe for a tenner if you see it about."

Nothing else to say."" - Review on the 8th May 2013Coming back to this revew almost 2 years later as I have recently started playing again. I had no desire of going back to the single player story mode again as, like many players, the boredom of trying to get 100% without looking at guides and webpages, proved to much for me to handle. Instead I went to the multiplayer. Now I don't understand how the mulitplayer gets bad reviews. I like it, I think its great. It's simple yet diverse at the same time with hidden tricks and qualities that are revealed as you level up. Yes the system and servers are terrible, with the game glitching, freezing and kicking people out of matches, but that's Steams fault, not TR's. Anyway sometimes the glitches are funny - who doesn't laugh at Lara's manic, high-speed movements as she gets stuck between a rock :'D. I love the single player, but it gets old and in multiplayer mode there is always something different...apart from the cheaters and hackers. There are SO many. Too many. This is what brings the multiplayer down for me. I don't understand why some players think it's acceptable to cheat. It ruins the fun for everyone. The problem is that they keep getting away with it. No one checks the servers anymore - they didn't really to begin with - so they don't get banned and they keep cheating. It's still not going to stop me playing though. And nor will it affect the good TR players from playing; crizzl, nekov4ego, King-T to name a few. Nothing is better than laughing at a cheaters rage as you continually beat them - Mothra, PETIT LION, juliennatacha - all of them beat, over and over again. It makes my day!Overall I give Tomb Raider 4.5 stars as nothing deserves 5 stars - maybe Rise of the Tomb Raider when it comes out on PC. Seriously Crystal Dynamics / Square Enix, why make it exculusive to X-box One when the majority of the players are PC users? It doesn't make sense. I hope that they include a multiplayer feature on that game - one that hasn't been put together at the last minute! :D"

Римейк про Лару Крофт действительно удался на отлично. Все начинается с того, что Лара с командой исследователей плывет на корабле в поиска острова Яматай, и терпит крушение, как не странно, на том же острове. По ходу игры нам предстоит разыскать и спасти своих друзей и попутно расхищать древние гробницы. Сразу по поводу гробниц. Головоломки, встречающиеся в этих гробница, запутаны и как по мне сложны, что делает прохождение очень затянутыми и нудными, а иной раз бывает вообще безвыходность и приходится оттуда уходить. Сам геймплей в игре отработан до великолепия, боевка, лазанье по скалам, перемещение по натянутой веревке, все это очень эффектно. Сбор деталей для улучшения оружия полностью сбалансирован, нет не жесткого недостатка и наоборот нереалистичного количества запчастей. Враги в игре умные, что хорошо. Также большой, открытый мир для исследования. Отлично завернутый сюжет, который выворачивается самым интересным образом. Вот единственное, удивительное и не реалистичное, так это полное бесстрашие Лары и через чур большая разрушимость островных храмов и гор, если столько всего разрушилось только когда на остров попала Лара, то в принципе за 2 тысячи лет там не должно было что либо остаться. Это на мой взгляд все минусы игры. Подведя итоги, игра получилась атмосферной, красивой, захватывающей и интересной.✰9,5/10."

It was the equivlient of playing an video action game with a barbie doll and see all her bits move in sequence. Yes you missed the lip of that jump just to see her boobs bounce in one of the 10 sequences it was designed to do.Since then we have seen her being recreated in more releases inclusive of the fact that her pop-culture identity made it to the big screen with a well placed Angelina Jolie capturing her image, except both movies were pretty bad anyhow.This game looks to reinvent her image as the younger niave and perky version. It's the prequel of Tomb Raider one would say. The basics is that you are trapped on an island, finding your way out through a number of ways, and being hunted by some crazy hillbillies (think 1,000 Tom Hanks' from the movie Lost and you just stole Wilson).The game has linear leveling system that adds to the come-back-and-play-me chemistry, inclusive of weapon upgrading system which works by collecting easter eggs throughout the level.Realism it is not, as I finally concluded that her bones must be made of titanium, due to the constant scenes which puts her demire frame through some brutal contact with every possible material on earth, seriously I would have been hospitalised from within the first 5 minutes of this game. (the kill scenes are good by the way in the cut scenes - well worth dying to watch them)The game itself has a well driven storyline. The action scenes have you moving from cover to cover so you can place a well fired arrow or bullet into the forehead of your six-fingered adversary. The easter eggs and relics you pick up throughout the game reminds you of Lara's profession.... which at times questions why she would bother picking up valuable items when she could possibly die of infection any moment now because you just trawled through half of mile of blood and excrement.What did disappoint me about this game was the lack of puzzling quality oh which truly defined the Tomb Raider series. Where each level was a puzzle in itself, and was all about timing, pushing and pulling blocks and counter balancing platforms to get to the next level (maybe also kicking a tiger in the face). This game has it's side puzzles which is solved by basic inituition, rather then google searching a walkthrough after dying for the 50th time. The levels themselves have a raw element which could have been rather challenging if the publisher put a little more time and focus into it.In all - its a good game and look forward to the next release. I reccomend you play this at the hard setting if you want some overall sense of challenge.8 out of 10 bobbling boobies."

I figure this game represents something of a reboot, being that it's mostly 'Lara Croft: Origins,' but it tells a successful origin story that pays off viscerally and emotionally. Mechanics are very solid, weapons are fun to use, I'd rate it higher still if there weren't some of those damn QTEs, but they're mostly a presence earlier on in the game (I thought we were going full-ubisoft initially,) and there are plenty of impressive and death-defying sequences that don't rely on mashing F at the right second. Also, pulling a goof to his death with a rope-arrow is never not fun. As far as puzzles go -- they've been largely exorcised, except for some largely optional, single chamber exercises -- but there's still some sense of exploration and adventuring mixed into what is mostly a straight-ahead shooter.Story is really solid, some quibbles here and there with the build, as it attempts to climax twice but maybe doesn't quite get there on the second peak, and aside from Lara briefly struggling with leaping across logs and being slightly traumatized about having to kill in self-defense, she does pretty quickly become THE Lara Croft. Which is fun to play as, but is a bit odd narratively, like she flips a switch -- more often you're held back by game mechanics, namely upgrading a weapon or ability as opposed to something built into the story or character. Which is fine. But a quibble.Graphics are nice, whatever. At their best when imparting a sense of scale, scope, danger and height. Bit miffed about the little chunks of DLC I didn't get with whatever edition I bought before the current edition. Also, no clue on multiplayer, I don't know why that'd be a thing you'd want with this game. Solid 8/10."

It has a good enough story about becoming stronger, facing sacrifice and make it worth it. And Lara Croft (reboot) is a truly memorable character that has gained a place in modern gaming history.Explosions, non-stop action, Japanese temples, samurai-demons (Oni), tombs awaiting to be raided and a young Lara Croft that slowly transforms into the real definition of a strong survivor and a knowledge-thirsty adventurer.A 2013 Triple-A game that aged very well.

I don't mind a short animation or temporary loss of control while it happens, but mashing a button for no reason is just annoying.Similarly, the QTE are sometimes too sudden and don't always indicate clearly what button you have to press to pass them, and even worse don't always seem to register the presses. I replayed one section five times, as far as I could tell doing everything exactly the same way each time and on the last run it just worked.There is also an almost exhausting amount of ""just getting away with it"" moments in the cutscenes.I can't really recommend this game."

The game isn’t overly hard, the fights are good with most enemies only needing a few hits to kill and the platforming areas aren’t unforgiving (like some of the tombs in the Assassins Creed series). If you do manage to die then you don’t usually lose too much progress.You control Lara as the expedition runs into trouble, and learn to run, hunt, crawl, zipline and fight your way through the islands current inhabitants and supernatural foes while trying to rescue your rapidly diminishing crewmates and friends. I found the game to be visually stunning, with many varied environments -forest, beach, mountains, crashed ships, Japanese inspired villages and of course tombs to explore. I was playing with high settings (not 4k) and didn’t notice any visual distortions or drops, and in some areas there were plenty of enemies on screen. There were some QTE events, but these weren’t all the time and never frustrating. I thought the story was explained very well, as mentioned the pace is quite solid. The mysteries of the island and setting aren’t dumped on you, but are fed to you enough that you have a good idea of what is going to happen, and watch as Lara and crew piece it together. Some of the “big” events that happened (certain crew & friends dying, friends betraying Lara) I could see happening long before they did, so it’s not a total shock when they do happen, and it fuels Lara’s growth in the game (from being a meek graduate and breaking down when she makes her first kills, to mowing down enemies and supernatural foes in the end). A lot of what is going to happen is foreshadowed if you collect the lore items and explore the optional tombs littered around the maps.The upgrade system was well done, it ties in closely with the main plot, so you will have everything you need by the end of the game (unlike other games like Just Cause 3 where you can finish it and have unlocked virtually nothing). There are side quests and lots of collectables to find, some explaining more lore of the island (foreshadowing future events), some unlocking achievements. There are challenges to complete which might upgrade carrying capacity ect (again majority of these should easily be done while playing the game).Most of the DLC that is available is for multiplayer, so you can consider it useless unless you have a group of friends who also own the game and are going to play with you.If you are chasing 100% achievements then its likely impossible now, as multiplayer is dead. Not sure if you could grab a few others and farm the achievements."

3275,michael,https://steamcommunity.com/id/256color/,3,,0,3.9,June,"24,",585,0,1,"I only bought Tomb Raider to support Square Enix / Eidos after hearing of their financial troubles, I've never played Lara Croft games before. This game looked promising, but it started to disagree with me soon after it started. First, there's no such thing as ""take care of the wound"" in this game. Our brave dirty Lara magically avoids sepsis by just sitting by a campfire or eating. Somehow it annoys me. At least after falling on a rusty spike in the intro, she or her friends could have applied some anti-septics and bandage. The second thing is wolves. Each time you cross some bridge, you get a few wolves to kill. There just aren't as many wolves left in the whole world, I think :) But the worst thing was a Russian man who wanted to violate our brave dirty sweaty Lara, because she reminded him of his sister. I am Russian :) I was born in Russia, and in all my life here, I've never met a person who'd be into incest, or heard about it from friends or relatives. What I did see, however, are countless Russian characters portrayed as criminals, drunks, idiots, perverts, brutes, spies, barbarians, and so on - in (mostly American) films and games - for decades and decades - by actors who can't even pronounce a single Russian word properly - by authors who hardly know a thing about a thousand year old culture they are hired to smear. It was absolutely unnecessary to make this guy Russian, or Finnish, or Australian, or of any nationality. It was so evidently deliberate, and with such context it felt like the game is saying: ""he's a Russian, and Russians are bandits, they are perverts, they have sex with their siblings, and violate young girls"", just like Ku Klux Klan members would probably talk about Africans, or Nazis about Jews, or homophobes about gays. This felt so disgusting, it ruined my fun completely. I can't even bother to finish the game. Not just because I'm Russian, and I'm rather hurt by such hatred towards my race from a game I bought out of respect towards the company that published it. But because I'm against racism in general. I would be still affected (even if to a less extent), if that nasty pervert would be as deliberately and unnecessarily labelled as Chinese, or Indian, or German, or British, or Whatever-ish. Especially in a game that claims to be a bit deeper than a roller-coaster ride through all the cliches in the world. Shame, really, the graphics were rather nice."
3276,Kastor.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PwR_Kastor/,1,,1,11.1,June,"22,",332,0,1,"Great game. Tomb Raider has a few draw backs first of which being the overuse of QTEs, cutscenes and pseudo-cutscenes. The start of the game is most notable for these draw backs, teething issues getting used to the QTEs and cutscene after cutscene to introduce the characters and story.Gameplay was solid and played very well on PC with M+KB. The secret Tombs were fun and thought out but unfortunately were lacking in substance. Most tombs will leave you scratching your head for only 60secs and the whole thing will be finished in 5mins.This game shows exactly how casual games need to tackle an XP and upgrade system. Streamlined without being stupid. Being only allowed to upgrade your skills at campfires makes the stop, pause, upgrade mechanics found in these types of games less dull. For example FC3 does implements the XP/Upgrade system poorly.Bonus points for the great minimalist HUD design and the narrative based collectable system.But don't buy the DLC, it's a waste of money."

I absolutely do. It is top notch.The gameplay is just solid, all around. The gun play is a lot of fun with great sound effects for every weapon... that FEEL powerful.  Jumping, climbing.. its all extremely smooth and stellar to experience.The game's story is really enjoyable, in a classic Adventure Film sense.. Lara is without a doubt the most interest character in the game, but the supporting cast all fill their respective roles quite nicely.The only negative aspect of the game for me was that I'd wished there'd been a bit more island exploration like you'll find in Far Cry 3... but I realize that Tomb Raider is more story focused than that title was and in order to focus on the story it had to be less open.If you haven'et yet, play this game"

3285,DMYTRO,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dmytro-i/,2,,1,41.0,March,"28,",189,0,1,If I was playing this game when it came out in 2013 rather than now I would say that it is a pinnacle of what a Tomb Raider game can be.The only thing that makes me doubt that is the fact to Rise of the Tomb Raider came out last year and it's probably going to blow my socks off.As for this one... yes it is the best Tomb Raider game I have ever played to date. Developers have done everything right. First of all it feels fresh but familiar at the same time.I picked it up immediately but was in for something different. The way it handled the story of how Lara became the badass that she is if flawless. In the beginning she's this innocent girl but as the game progresses she acts and talks more and more mature and badass.And it becomes more apparent as you unlock more and more skills and upgrade your weapons. The game also manages to connect me with Lara emotionally. I tried my hardest not to get her killed and felt sorry every time I failed. This made me play better.The music and ambient sounds are spot on. It was great in previous games but this time it was even better. Massive kudos there.The world that Crystal Dynamics created is amazing and I felt that it was like a real island. Locations are connected and all make sense. And the variety of the locations is breath-taking.Having day and night cycles makes it even more realistic. But the game is made realistic to a point where it does not spoil the fun. But what fun is there when everyone everything is trying to kill you.What's also evolving is the way that Lara thinks about the mysteries of the world and it was great to be there and see it happening.So the game-play... as I mentioned it is familiar but fresh. One of the major changes is that now you aim manually all the time. And it is a good thing. Even with a game-pad it was not hard at all and it gave me more freedom. And you need to earn the weapons instead of being given them as in Underworld.And when you do you feel like you've earned it. And it doesn't stop there because you can upgrade them. And you need to choose upgrades that fit your play style because you can't have all of them right away. The same goes for skills. Upgrade what is best for you.And the mos important thing is the ending. In this game it was... well... amazing. The tension was there and I was eager to take on whatever was waiting for me. If you played previous games you are going to love the ending even more.By the way inclusion of multiplayer was completely unnecessary for  the success of this game. Which is probably the reason they didn't do it in the next game.If you are reading this then please buy and play this game.

Most importantly though, the tone of the game is schizophrenic. It wants seems to want to be (and certainly was advertised as such) a gritty survival origin story. And yet the initial grim impression gives way to poorly done humour and comic book villians, as well as some lazy deus ex machina tier writing.It's not without some shiny moments however, the radio tower climb certainly left a lasting impression on me, as well as some other nice segments and character building moments for lara.The environments look absolutely gorgeous, and I found navigating the island very satisfying. The combination of rock climing, line zipping, jumping, tumbling and rope shooting was never really challenging, but still served to break up the monotony well.The combat is responsive, and all the weapons are very satisfying to use. A combination of slapped together ragtag firearms and your trusty climbing pick makes for some gritty, meaty, delicious action. Also, stealthing around the jungle with your bow, going all rambo, was pretty badass. The most impressive aspect for me was the seamless cover system, where lara ducks or leans behind cover wherever suitable, without direct input from you.Probably the most dissapointing aspect of the game was the actual tombs, all of which usually consist of one simple puzzle, and a negligable reward of salvage. It just reeks of a development afterthought.In any case, it's a pretty satisfying and  singleplayer action adventure. It does a really good job of setting up lara croft as a believeable character, and the survival part of the story really is well done."

The game is a joy to play due to its cinematic nature, and it doesn't drag on too long. The puzzles are somewhat streamlined and are generally novel. The combat/stealth nature of the game is fun, and I would rate this something over 7.Upgrades are handled well in the form of perks and equipment upgrades. My only gripe is that you can't stick with a lesser gun because you're a shallow bastard who loves those silver slides; it is a superficial gripe all things considered.The graphics are wonderful, especially torch flames. If your machine can handle it, the hair physics are also very cool. There are quite a few graphics options, so tweaking your options to get a good framerate is full of options, without ruining the atmosphere of the game.The story is well written, and the voice acting is solid. There are a couple of pretty bad ways to die... that may appeal to some.

The hair on ""ultimate"" really puts a strain on the GPU. The storyline and gameplay are faithful to the original games. Many characters are instantly recognisable and I'm certain that the fellas at Core would be amazed to see what has become of their baby. Lara is better realised than ever before with the larger and larger boobs having now come into proportion with the rest of her body - in fact she looks gorgeous and is superbly animated. The cutscene CGIs are some of the best I've ever seen in, or outside of, a computer game but they still manage to blend almost seemlessly with the in-game graphic.

3315,Helixion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/da_bess/,1,,1,8.7,November,"25,",276,0,1,"I’ve never played any other Tomb Raider game before, so I can only judge the game on its own but the best way I can describe it is that it’s a game with lots of great stuff held back by other, less interesting stuff common in typical AAA games. I don’t know if any of these decisions were a part of Crystal Dynamics intended vision or were the result of men in suits from Square Enix wanting the game to be more marketable but either way they’re bad and they should feel badVisually, the game is beautiful and though not being that old, I think it easily rivals some of the best looking games of 2016. The area layout is very cramped, with not a lot of the open areas, but the benefit of that is that every space is dense with well-designed details and decorations both big and small. Progression is very linear, but there’s still enough “open-endedness” that never makes me feel like I’m being railroaded. The game nudges players to go off the primary path by looking out for collectibles: some of them lead to bonus salvage (what you use for crafting), but the best ones in my opinion are the ones that fill in the blanks of mystery of the island. Notes from WWII soldiers that were stationed there, relics and objects from the feudal Japanese citizens that once lived on the island, etc. As typical with collectibles, you don’t need them unless you want to 100% the game but I recommend looking for them because they drive home the “tomb raider” aspect of the game.And then…there is bad, and boy is it terrible. The worse parts of the game are the tropes and mechanics more common in other AAA games (which TR2013 is): crafting and perks, boring and derivative third person cover shooting which you do too much of imo, serviceable but laughably mediocre ””””””stealth””””””” moments, attempting to be “gritty” and “realistic” while still abiding by Video Game Logic™ in full force (example: Laura accidentally falls onto a small, rusty metal rod which pierces her side early in the game. She removes it, wads through muddy waters, can jump, climb and hop just fine but never seeks medical attention. Ironically enough, a friend of hers is attacked by wolves with his leg being severely damaged and the game wants you to look for the first aid kit the wolves took to their lair). All of these things, and the frequency of them, greatly dampen the quality of everything else in the game with the shooting being the worse offender of them all because you’ll be stuck doing it so often; It’s almost like the game is terrified of letting the player move and run around in peace without nameless armed goons (all of which look the same to me) attacking the player.TR2013 is a game I both really love and really hate, and it's a game I'd also hate to ""Not Recommend"". If you can get past the dumb stuff, you have yourself an excellent action/adventure game."

Bought it on sale here on steam just to see how it runs on the PC. Couldn't be more pleased that it's even more amazing with PC graphics and I find myself wanting to replay this all over again. The story is so good that it just really draws you in even if you already know what happens. I'm that kind of person who NEVER replays anything once I'm done so that's really saying a lot about this game. ...also... I just like shooting enemies in the head with the bow...

Shocking, I know. On your perilous, yet noble, journey to desecrate and loot the dead, you encounter many of the islands ""colorful"" inhabitants, up into and including 1000 year old Samurai*. And being the explorer/survivor that you are, you spend much of the game shooting them in their dumb faces with arrows. Along the way, you also come across friends/ other survivors, like Angry Lady, Nerdy Guy, and Tito from Rocket Power. They do not assist in the shooting of arrows into dumb faces. It's disheartening, really... The game also utilizes a crafting system, as you, the player, can upgrade existing weapons into far more advanced ones using scrap metal, lugnuts, and what I can only assume is either Lara's genius level craftsmanship or potential use of black magic. One of the two.In all seriousness, though, this was a great game. Mechanics were pretty good and the bow had a really nice feel to it when shooting some bad guy in his dumb face.

But as a sort of newbie into controlling Lara Croft, I have to admit this Tomb raider is gooooooood. It isn't the nitty gritty ""survival"" game that some might have wanted it to be but what it is, is an excellent action adventure 3rd person shooter stealth something. I don't really know. I'm really poor at explaining what a game is. But I suppose it can be all of those. It is quite a journey and a transformation of innocent and a little naive Lara into the action heroine Lara Croft. If you start to really dig deeply and concentrate on little things such as why is there appropriately ammo spread all over the place for you to pick up or why I am collecting all these things which I obviously don't need to survive, you might ask yourself the question what is this? But if you instead focus on the big picture, you'll see that this is a good game and that it accomplishes to do a lot of things right. The shooting and the combat generally flows nicely. There's a lot of little nice exploration to be done. Not too many puzzles but a little to wet your appetite. A grim story and a setting that might remind you of a certain television series. Also the game looks absolutely gorgeous, love it. Not the hardcore survival game that some and many would have wanted but an awesome adventure shooting stealthing something game with some shallow survival aspects sunk into it. Just a teeny little wee bit of a survival spice.Do I recommend the game. I suppo... hell yeah I do!"

3339,Staplz,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978024089/,9,1,0,15.6,October,"20,",424,0,1,"TLDR: This game is bad. It's really really bad.Year of writing (2022)I've never really cared much about Tomb Raider games as I wasn't a Play Station household, so I'm coming at this from a fresh unbiased direction. I like to think that I can appreciate or dislike the game without nostalgia clouding my judgment, especially since this is the kind of reboot that is trying to take the content in a different direction. However, I don't think this did the game any favors. I'm going to start with some of the things I liked about it.The game is really well paced, and thankfully short. It never punished the player for failing stealth, and combat is competent, though I think it was balanced for people using controllers. Even so, the default PC controls are pretty good. I never felt like I needed to change them and they were intuitive enough to use without thinking about them. Visually it was smooth, though I had issues in windowed mode as it tanked frame rate and stuttered while the GPU never even went above 20% load. Lara's face looks weird but all other visuals were really good for 2013. Gameplay wasn't over complicated and worked relatively well.But ultimately I disliked the game. While this garnish of good qualities is nice, the meat of this game (or cauliflower for you vegetarians) is pretty awful.CameraThere's so much camera shake. It's absurd. There's more camera shake here than Ocean's 12 and will make you borderline nauseous. Apparently this gets some attention in the sequels when they patched in a way to turn it off, but that's not available here. On top of that, this game was made with either no experience of gaming on PC or no consideration for it. The auto centering third person camera is so aggressive that you can only look at things if you're standing completely still. This includes situations like stealthing around enemies where peripheral vision is much more important.Bad DirectionIt's rare for me to notice direction as a factor in how good or bad a game is because it encompasses too many things. But in this case a lot of what's wrong is on a macro level instead of being in the details. The first most obvious issue with direction is that it feels like it's plagiarizing from other popular games. Little pieces of Far Cry 3, ideas from Uncharted, but not enough from Tomb Raider. The decision to make Lara a character that the ""player wants to protect"" was terrible, leading to all kinds of bad writing and some of the most obnoxious sound elements I've ever encountered.The set pieces are too much. It becomes abundantly clear that Lara only survives based on extraordinary luck. So many times you will engage a set piece, even without being forced to jump in by gunfire, without a way to get all the way through. As in damage to the environment during had to happen before you could actually progress. On top of that, a surprising number of them were obvious. You can see the pieces in place before it even happened. This predictability makes it hard to stay immersed and makes you think about the tools you have available and wonder why you don't approach things from different directions.The realistic approach makes the supernatural elements seem out of place or shoe horned in. You just don't get enough exposure to this sticking point until later in the game. I'm not sure if this is a problem for other people but for me it felt like I was in two different pieces of fiction. I felt like I needed more incentive to question whether or not the Sun Goddess was real or not. Instead we're left with only two small cut scenes where no one in their right mind would have flown through in the first place, and one slightly more convincing scene of dramatic wind shift. That's it. Everything else is in realism town until you're fighting zombie samurai at the end. Yeah, that sounds even dumber now that I'm writing it than when I was doing it.CharacterLara being the worst archaeologist in the world doesn't bother me as much as other people. There's a little joke hidden with the horse figurine that I enjoyed a great chuckle at. But her character writing and voice acting just don't line up with her actions. Instead of being realistic and relatable, she comes across as the the side character in a B movie from SyFy you hope dies by the end but doesn't. She starts off generic, over dramatizes in the cut scenes, never seems to show an ability to critically think or put together the obvious clues. She also has a persistent jarring naivete that completely disconnects from her body count. I actually don't mind that she says, ""You can do this,"" so many times, but her breathing always sounds like she's mid sob. So running around is like enjoying a whiny companion you can't get away from. The tone in her voice never changes either, despite what the character has been through; which always make her (and any character in any game) sound silly when they try to swear by calling enemies ""bastard!"" It just doesn't have the emotional weight of fighting someone who killed people close to you, or real horror of having killed so many more of them to survive or for revenge. She always sounds like someone on safari or a vacation, a tourist in her own story. Basically the opposite of the gritty intent of changing her character.Bad WritingI don't mind linear writing. You're not really playing the main character as much as you're along for _her_ ride. And this being a Square game, I gave it quite a bit of leeway to be grandiose and silly. But the constant stupid decision making, cliche character development, and quite often mediocre voice acting really rubbed me the wrong way. One of the first things to happen in the game is that Lara gets a piece of rebar punched all the way through her. Instead of inspecting it for potential bleeding, she immediately pulls it out and never in the entire game bandages it. She also immediately wades through dirty water with the wound.The obvious character who will betray you is obvious. The narrative is full of cliches like, ""I'd finally set out to make my mark; to find adventure. But instead adventure found me."" Which isn't even true. She went to the island, the island didn't go to her. Even in 2013 we'd seen it all before.Minor GripesThe placement of things that ropes attach to almost always causes you to make a small leap of faith that the game mechanic will register. Just back these up from the edge by a yard, give us some space to be under the rope.The physics that would be involved in arrowing something than pulling is obviously going to be dramatically different from what's presented in the game. This breaks immersion every time.Everyone is constantly yelling and calling out to each other. It's a wonder there's any stealth in this game at all.So if I were to put this on a scale of how many drinks at a bar is it worth, a single over priced domestic. It's done enough competently that I would say don't pay money for it, but there's so much bad about it that makes it hard to justify value. Part of the problem there is that it's bad, not wrong. Wrong things you can be patch out, but bad things are in there intentionally forever.How much did I pay for it? I don't remember. I got it on a steep discounted sale, but the whole trilogy was given away later on Epic for free."
3340,Vulpyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulpyn/,15,1,0,5.8,March,"29,",197,1,1,"The story is atrocious and the gameplay is unimaginative. The difficulty rise throughout the game is artificial (bullet sponges and bad enemy spawns). And if you are having trouble with a puzzle, the game is more likely bugged instead of having a puzzle that requires any effort.The progression system in the game feels unnecessary at best. At no point is there a genuine reason to go about different mechanics besides run-n-gun, and the upgrade system is just there to make sure you can run-n-gun at pace with the difficulty increase. If you had removed the faux difficulty increase and the upgrade system entirely, a large portion of the progression in the game would feel smoother.  Lara is an earsore throughout the entire game. She comes off as a whiney good-for-nothing that has plot armor and random military experience from her time spent on the front lines of a history classroom. None of the characters have believable personalities that convince the audience of any sort of immersion. It comes off as a bad imitation of a movie that failed in the early 2000's. The movement system is wonky and less than intuitive. The pacing of the cinematic content does not line up with the player interaction with the environment in the slightest. The cinematics play environments that collapse to a 90 lb Lara jumping on wooden platforms then cuts to in-game content that involves floaty movement and playground-like maps. There are multitudes of random points in the game where it goes from a faux-uncharted wannabe to a whack-a-mole contest with guns. The combat is more in-line with a bad Gears of War where the enemy movements are predictable and the variety in enemy types rely on how many layers they are wearing. The ultimate fight scenes do not involve the player in anything more than quick-time events. The most redeeming part about the game is the port. It plays boring combat smoothly and the mediocre story doesn't stutter in cutscenes.For free, the game might be worth your time if you have nothing better to do.For cash, I wouldn't spend money on it."
3341,lukwan,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978546580/,20,2,0,5.8,October,"19,",311,1,1,"It pains me to trash something made by Square Enix. However... Tomb Raider has shot itself in the foot on this one. I have not played other games in this franchise but thats not the point. It doesn't matter to me what style of game this franchise used to make, but rather 'is this game fun to play?'    For me: the answer is no. TR is a well made game with lots of strong elements that is utterly banal to slog through.   In a nut shell: you play Laura Croft, a strong, intelligent woman who can fight and survive the wilds and traverse any landscape on 'the' island. You can explore the entire island, save your friends from bad guys, solve interdimesional portal hazard while doing free lance acheaology in her spare time. But wait. You are too stupid to grab a coat from a fallen enemy even though you are shivering constantly. Your vast island is really a narrow corridor of trees with one exit at the end of it (and a cull-de-sac somewhere to find some meaningless bauble that has no bearing on your plot). Here is a missed opportunity to upgrade gear. Laura Croft is an explorer so finding the loot that upgrades her gear makes perfect sense and would add meaning to the 'Raiding' . Instead Laura Craft would rather spend time at the campfire whittling a +2 celtic knot texture onto her bow while her freinds are captive and suffering.Exploration? Bah! Being a turd in a tunnel still sucks even if the tunnel is pretty. Very linear progression with token exploration.Puzzles. I like puzzles but I find this trope in the TR franchise boring and imersion-killing. These type of puzzles always leave me asking who spent hours setting all this up? or who lit all these candles, or who thought doing this would be fun for the player. This franchise does not have to remake the same game over and over with better graphics. It could go in a whole new direction but....no wait...I see the exit....trudge on! Also where is the challenge when I can hit 'Detective Mode' and the game shows me the MacGuffin dongle I have to twerk in order to leave the 'Puzzle room of tedious Doom'. If so many players get frustrated and give up (going straight to the hint button) then perhaps the whole idea is not worth it from the get go.Combat. One of strongest aspects of the game. I enjoyed the combat system and found the fighting smooth and fluid. And then it ends. Very short fights that get me going then leave me hanging. QuickTime Hell. This trend in lazy game design has got to stop. Period. Here is why.    While I am playing through my avatar I feel power and agency. I have skills and I can think of alternative solutions to the problems. I am in control I am a Hero, an Adventurer with freedom and imagination and...    nope, a wolf bit your leg.    Now I am helpless, on a countdown timer to doing the one very spefic thing the Devs thinks I should do. So: button mash or hit 'E' or maybe 'F' next time. No I mashed too soon: respawn, I shoot the wolf with my really cool pistol that I just upgraded with Wolves-bane ammo....oh I guess I can't do that: die, respawn I run away: not allowed. Ten pointless deaths later I somehow mangle my keyboard to get past this interuption of pacing and flow feeling incompetent and used. Fun stuff!Pacing. I'm playing a cerebral puzzle game, no I watching a quicktime movie, no I playing a cool shooter, no I'm crafting at the campfire. This kills the flow of the game and constanly breaks imersion. Control. See a theme here. I can't control my character, or the camera or the pace. I feel like I am on a raft being tossed by the waves with no rudder, just current.Tombs. Basically a short passage, a simple puzzle, a Chest-O-Loot. Return by door you entered. Sad...very sad.Pro: -Beautiful enviroments and good animations. The  modeling is very good and Laura is statue-perfect avatar who is very easy on the eyes. -Fun combat.-Decent puzzles.Con:-Lack of pacing and control.-Zero meaningfull exploration.-Turd in a tunnel. Just being squeezed slowly through.-Loot is a tripping hazzard.In conclusion. When did skill and reflexes get replaced with button mashing? Don't gamers risk repetative strain disorder already? We need more control with a minimum of button strikes, not the other way around. How can I use memory or imagination to get better at a game when the magic button keeps changing from 'E' to 'F' to 'mash arrows' to jump through invisible hoop. I can never predict the right response and gain ability. Rather, I am made to wait for my cue to act, this way, not that, no...wrong button, sorry you took too long, do it...now using your main finger...this way....ARGH!!!  Just Friggin let go of my hands and let me play the damn game! We came here to Play a game , not Watch a cut-scene slide-show."

In fact, I fail to see how this does not qualify as a Survival Horror game, and the token survival/crafting mechanics thrown in--and the leveling system--do nothing but completely miss the point of what Tomb Raider is. There is an Experience Level system. I'm not even sure Tomb Raider knows what it's trying to be.I could live with this, for the most part, because I don't have a long history with Tomb Raider. But I was a fan of Resident Evil since the first one, and I remember the first time I beheld Resident Evil 6--I can only imagine old-school Tomb Raider fans get the same feeling looking at this. This is Hunger Games meets Resident Evil 6.Like the third thing I did once I had control of my character was die because of an unpredictable instant death trap. See, I wanted to turn around and explore the place I'd just fallen past, and the game decided that was sufficient reason to kill me. Square-Enix, that's petulent and bad game design. You shouldn't immediately punish players by killing them when they try to explore, especially not if you're duing this in a game with a collecting/surviving/crafting mechanic. These two things directly conflict with one another, which, again, suggests that they didn't know what they wanted Tomb Raider to be. The fourth thing I did was die to a sudden QTE that gave me plenty of time to know that the QTE was coming up, but only about half a second to know which button it wanted. Telling me a QTE is about to come is no good at all when I have no idea what button it wants--and, yep, it's instant death. It's that kind of ""It's easy to play if you have already played it before and know what's about to happen"" stuff that made Dark Souls so popular for being ""difficult"". It's not difficult; it's just player-hostile and tedious. But it gets worse, because Tomb Raider forces the metagame onto you. I was actually rather enjoying myself, running around the environment and COMPLETELY IGNORING THE DETECTIVE MODE COPYCAT. I was having fun exploring, looking around, getting a feel for the place. And then the game told me to meet someone ""at [his] location"". It did not convey WHERE that location was. Indeed, the only way to find out where this guy wanted me to meet him was by opening the game map. That... kinda defeats the entire ambiance and mood you set up, Square-Enix. I had just decided minutes before that I was going to play through the game entirely, without ever using the cheesy Detective Mode, in-game map, and all the other ♥♥♥♥ that Lara Croft would NOT have in that situation. I was going to play as Lara Croft, you see--not as a video game player pretending to be Lara Croft, but with access to magical technology that laid out exactly what to do, how to do it, when to do it, and where to do it. But Square-Enix ruined that. Because the idea that someone would actually want to play a game is so foreign to them that the only way they know to convey to me where to go is by showing me on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map. All of my complaints could have been mitigated if Square-Enix had the sense to have Roth say, ""Meet me at the beach near the shipwreck."" But he didn't. It pulled me completely out of the game, out of Lara Croft's shoes, and firmly reminded me that I am playing a game. This is really a problem, because Tomb Raider takes great effort to establish ambiance and mood, to put you in Lara's shoes, only to yank you back out of them and ruin the experience with metagame elements that they no longer even know how to work without.Everything about this game screams Resident Evil 6, to the point that I'm genuinely surprised it's not made by Capcom. I don't know which game released first, but since 6 was almost a carbon copy of 5, we could just eliminate the issue by saying it is a copy of Resident Evil 5, just with hostile natives instead of zombies. So far--I don't know, there may be zombies. I have a hard time caring enough to continue playing, because Square-Enix ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up in so many important ways. Dragging me out of the game to make me study a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map that my character doesn't have is not acceptable after taking the better part of an hour to establish a tone of ""being on your own, without the luxuries of technology"". Lara may be running around with a bow and tools hobbled together, but the player has access to Batman's Detective Mode and a GPS map!I was really enjoying things right up until that. And right up until Lara decided that the best way to cross the island that she knows little-to-nothing about was to enter a cave that she knows nothing about except that caves are one of the places the natives like to torture and kill people. You know. Instead of just walking to the location. That location that we had to learn by opening a map. Because Square-Enix lacks the basic game design abilities to understand that we might not want to have our sense of immersion completely destroyed by metagame elements that fit about as well the Big Lipped Alligator in All Dog's Go To Heaven.This really does ruin the experience for me, because I can't play the game the way I want to play it--which is weird, since it came from the best known JRPG company; I can't roleplay as Lara Croft because Square-Enix doesn't know how to provide the simple tools to let me do that. All they know how to do is give me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blinking cursor on a map and button icons over flammable objects--I don't NEED this ♥♥♥♥, make it go away. Where is the ""I have played a video game before, and I am not retarded, so don't tell me simple, basic ♥♥♥♥"" menu option? I am deeply disappointed. I really am. As soon as I watched the trailers, I knew I had to have this game, and I bought it as soon as the trailer ended. Except for the QTEs and instant death traps, which I could live with, I was loving everything I found. It was really awesome. Then it slowly stripped away the gameplay elements it had been giving me, until it left me with a bunch of metagame elements that are completely at odds with the actual gameplay elements. If you're going to have me survive in the wild as Lara Croft, fine--do that. But don't PRETEND to do it and then go, ""Oh, yeah, you need this GPS, by the way, good luck, gotta go 'borrow' features from some moar games, kthxbai!""I know I'm harping on about the destruction of immersion, but that's because it's a big deal, and I'm not throwing it around as the buzzword as people have been in the past year. I was truly immersed in Lara's situation, in the setting. Oh, I'm stranded on an island with only a makeshift bow, one match, and a radio? Awesome! Let's do this!""No, you also have a map with built-in GPS tracking for destinations and yourself.""""What? No I don't. I have a radio. That's it.""""Well, you have to use the GPS.""""The one that I don't have?""""That's correct.""""Why couldn't you just have had Lara ASK the guy where she was supposed to meet him?""You're addicted to these metagame ""play the game for the player"" things, Square-Enix. It's like I'm playing Dungeons and Dragons and I have to remind the Dungeon Master that I CAN'T buy a Detect  Magic scroll in town simply because I, the player, know that the character will need one, because the character has no way of knowing that. It's ridiculous--it's absolutely ridiculous that their game-making skills are so poor that they honestly don't know how else to convey information to the player EXCEPT through these horrendous ""play the game for the player"" mechanics. God forbid I be able to explore the island and find the place, no, that's not acceptable. Square-Enix has to show me EXACTLY where to go, by forcing a GPS map down my throat and destroying every bit of immersion the previous gameplay provided."
3345,Tizzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tizzy/,8,,0,10.5,September,"7,","1,255",0,1,"This is a Michael Bay directed video game about a girl and her exploration group who get stranded on an island where everything is flammable and prone to blow up. The houses blow up, the plants blow up, the weapons blow up, the sheep blow up, and even the explosions themselves constantly blow up. You'll experience at least one explosion for each minute of gameplay, and the thunderous sound of them will make your tymps feel nice and fuzzy inside.As for the gameplay, forget about raiding tombs. Sure, there are SOME tombs to be raided, but most of the game you'll spend either running from or gunning down a guerrilla group that owns what's pretty much an atomic arsenal on a small island for no particular reason. This isn't an adventure game, it's a third-person shooter and the storyline, while interesting at times, can also get horribly generic and raise questions like ""If nobody can ever leave this island and most people don't even know this exist, where the heck did these people find so many guns and explosives?! And what for, if the island is deserted except for them?!"".All in all, Tomb Raider is an entertaining game, the first few hours. About halfway through it, however, it becomes a swarm game about whether you can survive or not the lots and lots of armed guys the game throws at you. Oh, and it's also about whether your ears can endure so many explosions or not. If yours can, you're awesome. My ears couldn't, and the gameplay got so stale (and Lara so whiny) I just stopped playing it. I might finish it someday, if I'm hungering for aural punishment, but I wouldn't bet on it.PS: The explosions issue is true. It's only made worse by how the smart coders chose to put voices AND sound effects on the same layer, making it so that if you want to be able to hear and understand any dialogs at all you'll also have to go through ridiculously loud explosions that happen twice a minute. It's absurd, and horribly poor design on their end."

The first guns you obtain in this game are from the WWII era but as you gather salvage and extra weapon parts, you can upgrade your weaponry to modern day guns (AK47 and SPAS-12 etc.)  This game also has multiplayer but for me, as a Mac OSX user, I can't find a game (Like, ever)  The multiplayer is only Mac to Mac so If you want to play with me, hit me up with a friend request!

It was a new type of game at the time, and it scared the crap out of me. So, when this went on sale, I thought it would be worth the £5 I spent on it. This is one of the most boring games I have ever played. Everything about this game was super easy. The exploring, the combat, the hunting. Everything. I had this on the hardest setting and it was a breeze. I only died about three times during the whole 8 hours I played. The hunting system sounded cool in theory, but served absolutely no purpose to the actual game. Unless you were going for challenges and achievements, there was no need for it. The same goes for collecting plants and food.I was quite scared at the beginning of the game when using my ammo. I thought every shot would have to count and that if i messed up, I would have to deal with the consequences. I never ran out of ammo. For any gun. Not once. And I wasn’t being careful with my shots. I was shooting everything multiple times. Never ran out of ammo. It got even better once I upgraded my skills. You could get ammo from every dead body. This made it even easier. It introduced so many different mechanics that you just never really needed to use. The game would just do it for you. This game held your hand the entire time. This was just the tip of the iceberg for me, but I honestly don’t want to write any more about this piece of ♥♥♥♥ game.I can kind of see why a lot of people like this game, but honestly it just wasn’t for me. If you like the sound of it, go ahead and play it. But if you think it sounds kind of dull, steer clear. Its not worth it."

The story is really interesting and significantly above average for games these days, the game itself is stunning, the controls feel incredibly natural and the voice acting is brilliant. Little things like how enemies do not respawn once you've killed them makes going back to previous zones to explore every nook and cranny a joy. You can upgrade your weapons but the crafting system isn't overly complex. Lara herself is just incredibly acted, modelled, animated and written. You really watch her grow from a frightened girl to a wrathful killing machine and you feel the anger build along with her as you play through."

It will feel like watching a movie, and you won't be able to upgrade everything which can come in very handy. Actually collecting everything, reading it, looking at the environment, and more has a huge impact. When you play it like that, the cut scenes aren't as bad and more spaced out.As for my hardcore TR fans, I found this game to be in the middle. I liked it more than Rise and Shadow but not anywhere as much as previous games. It is a game I do not mind playing and can find it enjoyable, but really Lara could be swapped out and I wouldn't notice. If you want a TR experience I recommend playing a different game."

All positive things are already said in tons of other comments, but in short: game is good, its catchy, story is better than average, you have tons of things to do during the game, controls are quite nice, graphics for game of these years are quite nice.1) Super easy tombs.2) There is way too much voice actions from Lara during the game, it looks like she gets or*asm each time you do something like jumping, falling and etc.3) Story could be a bit stronger.4) Some things like GPS collection should have some point in that. Like there were not explanation why you are doing that.5) Physics at some places are pushed over logical limits. Like wind pushing half a building apart, and Lara is just holding her hand against wind and moving quite freely. There are quite a few places and situations where  similar things just do not feel right. (btw all mentioned negative things are already fixed in 3rd game and quite big part of them are fixed in 2nd game) Also notes: 1) DLC's are not worth it. Either get them on sale or just don't.2) For main game achievements i  suggest creating save games of each new location start. Because things where you need to kill something in specific way will not complete itself during one playthrough. 3) Multiplayer is really bad. 4) If you want achievements in multiplayer find some friends to help you. Even lvl60 achievement becomes few hours if you have many friends literally feeding you kills (there is tons of ways on internet, but having 3+ fiends and feeding kills is fastest). Else these achievements will take you tons of time and will be pain to do. Or just find Mora2403 or yt."

3384,heuristicus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heuristicus/,1,,1,18.0,October,"2,",409,0,1,"I liked this. Very nice visually, and a good story. However, the story and the action don't gel very well. At the beginning Lara appears to be afraid to kill anything, apologising to a deer. Then 5 minutes later you're slaughtering hundreds of dudes. Of course, without this it would be difficult to justify the story, so it sort of makes sense. That makes Lara's character a bit strange, though.Unlike everyone else, Lara is pretty much indestructible. She suffers various wounds, then walks through water which is almost definitely brimming with bacteria. She falls and slides in so many different ways and yet manages to be alive. Sort of ridiculous, but then again, the same is the case for every other game. The difference here is that at the beginning she seems competent, but vulnerable. These two things don't match up very well.Weapons and gunplay are good, and the upgrades are vaguely interesting, changing the gun and bow models. Most modifications don't seem to make a particularly noticeable difference, and I think you could probably complete the game without any of them. The same applies to the skills, none of which really do much to fundamentally change the gameplay.While the guns sort of work in the scenario, having a competition longbow on a remote island is quite ridiculous. Where did you get that stuff? It would break so easily with all the punishment it gets.Lara spends the entire game in the same clothing, which must be made of the most durable substance in the universe given the punishment it takes. Her clothing changes gradually over the course of the game, becoming more damaged, but her tank top barely rips, and her trousers only rip in one place. At various points in the game, she's running around in the snow and ice with only a tank top. There are hundreds of guys with coats that she's killed who she could have taken a coat from, but it never happens. You even see her shivering at some point. Steal a damn coat!The environments are generally great, some of them particularly so if you like thousands of dismembered corpses lying around.For a game called Tomb Raider, the side tombs are pretty pathetic. Each one is just a single puzzle. A little disappointing.Also, why is she using an ice ax for climbing?At any rate, the game is still enjoyable if you can ignore the realism which the first hour or so of the game gives you."

It was also really interesting seeing the tests young Lara Croft is put through in her journey to becoming the epic badass she is!! The gameplay and controls are well done. I was also impressed with the graphics, art, landscapes and textures.This game has a lot to offer for the explorer/scavenger type of player. Lots of artifacts, treasures, all with their own interesting bits of copyright. Even somewhat challenging tombs!! That being said, the overall plot is very linear.My biggest criticism: Boss Fights...wanted them... The biggest battles you encounter are not with 1 big foe, but 30 little-ish foes.That's it.

It does enough to variate  from other titles like the Zelda-esque gear acquisition with crafting upgrades and new weapon features to go along with it.  The stealth is a lot of fun and I highly support the design decision of minimal UI/HUD clutter. Works great with a controller, runs great on maximum settings with shadows turned down just a tad.It'll take 10-15hours to complete the main-story depending on how much map completetion you do.

Every gamer has fantasized about her (of course, Angelina Jolie's portrayal helped a lot). Attempting to change something that looked established requires guts, and the guys at Crystal Dynamics have plenty of guts.This version of Tomb Raider is different to the ones we adventurers love. First of all, because it's a merge between several genres of gaming. Sure, you can define this game as being an adventure game, but it's also a shooter, an RPG, a platformer... heck, it even has some stealth in it too. And second, this is not the Lara Croft we know and love, despite the visual differences. This game works as a prequel to the adventurer. She presents herself as a survivor, and this is the primal task of this game: surviving, no matter the cost.The gameplay and dynamics of the game are impecable, the graphics are beautiful, the story is well written and the atmosphere overall is dark, spooky and often pessimist. This game does everything right, and you know it since the first minute you play it. This game is an experience every gamer should have in his life.There is only one negative aspect I can say about Tomb Raider: every time you alt-tab out (every single time), the game crashes to desktop when you attempt to go back to it, leaving no message at all. This can be annoying, but it doesn't jeopardize your progression too much, since the checkpoints are plenty and well placed.Final score: 5/5. I truly loved this game."

Several parts of the game make you feel quite alone and vulnerable, but there are a few randomly dispersed fight sections that really break the survivalist feel at times. Lara'as personality evolves from a timid normal girl, to what would be more familiar to followers of the series from beginning of the game to the end. Lara suffers some persistent wounds through the game, and her outfit changes as it gets worn down, very immersive. Puzzles are fairly simple, and rarely will you get frustrated with anything ""unsolvable"", this game is far more about story than solving.Also, Lara has realistically sized tits, so that's a plus.Overall, probably a 8.3/10, a strong reboot that really sets the tone for future games, without destroying any good memories."

The gameplay is simple third person platforming and gun play and enemies are varied and fun to fight. The island itself has a good sense of place but never feels ""open"" despite the fast travel map system.Now for the bad: I understand they wanted this game to be the making of Lara Croft and in a way they do that. However for the first 5 hours of the game they took one of the strongest female characters in gaming and instead of making her ""younger"" what they actually did is make her pathetic. They didn't humanize her they marginalized her personality and in doing so suggest women are pathetic mewling infants. Large parts of this game should be called urgh, hurgh, whinge, cry...because that's the whole sound track. As for the gameplay it also relies too much QTE's, one dimensional characters and a plot that is telegraphed from about 1/3rd of the way through, despite the main characters not seeming to understand. Overall it was a brave attempt and the game is good. However the use of QTE's, the constant heavy breathing/ whining and the weak characters (beside Lara) stop this game from elevating to greatness.8/10"
3413,Midnight Carnival Snack,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ffxivhasconsumedmylife/,2,,1,13.4,July,"26,","1,147",0,1,"I enjoyed this game. It's an exciting adventure where you're shipwrecked on an island and you gotta get the ♥♥♥♥ out before the locals beat you to death three times over.The combat was fast and fun. In addition to just shooting at you, the enemies would throw explosives which flush you out of cover, walk towards you with shields (probably the only game I can think of where guys like these aren't a pain in the ass to deal with), or just run at you with a sword in hand. Shootouts become more fun as you unlock skills like throwing dirt, stabbing people with an arrow (sigh... in the knee) as a counter attack, or an actual melee attack. There's also a stealth system, but outside of one part early in the game, it's just a matter of seeing how many guys you can kill before you get caught.When you're not busy killing a small town's worth of dudes, you'll be climbing, raiding, and exploring. The climbing is basically Uncharted. If there's something you can hang on to, you'll be jumping and climbing all over that ♥♥♥♥. Unlike Uncharted, there are also walls you have you press a button to grab onto and ropes that you can either zipline down or climb up. Also unlike Uncharted, the island can be explored. You can return to areas you've been to find anything from cool ancient artifacts to lame ass GPS trackers. I don't know what they do either.Then there's the tombs. All the tombs are optional areas where you're tasked with solving a single puzzle. These puzzles are usually trickier than the ones you deal with as part of the story. It was always satisfying when I finally piece together everything and make it to the chest at the end. The puzzles outside of tombs, as I already said, aren't as tricky. But they still require you to think about how to get past and they're more fun because of it.So just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ buy this game already."

One of the most classic platforming/puzzle games of the 5th generation of games completely redone to be more suitable for the 7th generation. Lara is completely redone, this time deciding to tell a pseudo-origin story and establishing her as an adventurer and historian, rather than the original smooth badass she once was. Her voice actor is incredible, extremely emotional and delivers each line with meaning. The other characters on the other hand, not so much. Aside from Lara, Ross and Jonah, every other character in the main cast (including Mathias) seems really uninterested and bored. I mean, they deliver their lines well, and know pacing, etc. But the emotion and drive in their voice is just not there, which really doesn't help a story-driven game that lasts a minimum of 8 hours. The story is pretty average, a decent combination of history and myth, as Tomb Raider games often do. The lore is the really interesting part, which can be explored through the various collectibles. The WW2 soldiers that were trapped on the island and the history of the ancient kingdom are extremely interesting to listen/read about throughout the game.Gameplay is really great, it's tailored more to an average third-person action-adventure game, but has pretty great and surprisingly varied level design, and each gadget Lara has is versatile and has their specific purposes. Gunplay is extremely refined, and the interactivity of the world is also really fun. There's also a pretty solid skill tree, though definitely not as developed as it could've been, but is definitely acceptable for a game of this length. The platforming and exploration of this game really shines, as practically every nook and cranny is accessible in one way or another.The graphics (for the time) are amazing, easily one of the best looking games of 2013. I had an i5-4690k and a GTX 1060 6Gb when I played this game and on the second highest settings it would run comfortably around 90fps, with little to no drops. Textures are occasionally washed out, especially on rocks, and every character looks hilariously shiny with sweat, but otherwise easily one of the best looking games I've ever played.Enemies in this game are severely weak. You'll never be in much danger on the second hardest difficulty unless you're absolutely swarmed, the AI is quite weak, essentially boiling down to 2 types of enemies: cover-hiding ranged bois and enemies that will rush you head-on. There's also a lack of enemy variety. There's 4 types of enemies: standard gun/bow wielding guys, ranged molotov/explosive throwers, the very occasional juggernaut, and melee rushers. Each one of these characters only has 3-4 different looks and faces, which is really immersion-breaking to see 4 of the same exact guy coming at you like androids.Overall, other than the average story and really weak enemies, the game is an extremely well-done reboot of the classic Tomb Raider series, and sets up the reboot franchise well."

Beautiful landscapes, good graphics. However the jumping puzzles are reduced to a minimum (optional for most) and you just chain corridors by jumping on the obvious next plateform. On the other side the shooting part has taken a cumbersome part. Very similar to Far Cry or Mass Effect shooting : you cover behind a wall and shoot at the waves of enemies with a variety of archetypical weapons. In difficult mode, some shooting phases can give a challenge, but this is absolutely not what's expected from a Tomb Raider game.The Quick Time Events are sometimes breaking the immersion by displaying a series of keys to press, but often are a well-integrated phase of quick jumps as plateforms collapse.The Tomb Raider franchise has some great titles where you try to find your way through plateforms and puzzles while from time to time enemies ambush you. This game is an easy third person shooter, a shooting gallery in a beautiful uneven landscape where you have to follow the white marks to progress. The collectibles and the achievements are just ridiculous ways to push you to play more with Pavlovian mechanics.Finally, when the very first game of the series introduced a Lara Croft who had never killed a human before, making it the exception, this Tomb Raider reboot makes Lara Croft a mass murderer with the Hollywood justification that the humans she kills are baddies who don't deserve to live."

At first it was hard for me to get into playing it (for some reason, idk why) but after a while, I really started to enjoy every single minute of this game. It does try to have at least some resemblance to the old tomb raider games, however it feels like an entirely different franchise (and not in a bad way). Firstly, the graphics. They're amazing! Even to todays standarts, it's a gorgeous game (honestly, square enix always make their games look pretty). And the devs managed to show the atmosphere in such an amazing way (like, seriuosly, changing climate, sunrise/forest view/even the animals, everything looks amazing). The sounds also sound very realistic and are crisp clean (plus, the in-game music is soooo good). And of course, the gameplay/storyline itself: quite an original story (at least from my experience), every part of the game doesn't feel the same and even when re-playing the story I, personally, don't get bored with it (when comparing to some games to todays standarts). It also offers you quite a few ways to play the game (like, sneaky-like or full on rambo) and these secret tombs make it even more interesting just because you want to finish the game on that 100%. And even though I didn't see a lot of effort put into character developement, it's still kinda there. Overall, I'm really happy with this game and if you enjoy an adventure/stealth/some-what shooter type of games, this would be the right pick."

I hadn't played any other Tomb Raider games before this, so I'm reviewing this game not compared to the others, but as it's own unit. And does this game hold up on its own? Holy **** yes!A game is supposed to be an ""experience"" of some kind, right? Whether it be just pure gameplay, so you feel accomplished after beating it (ie Mario Bros, or something), or if it's telling a story (ie most other things), games are intended to leave something behind in your mind, for better of worse. This game very much excels at that.I felt as though I was watching a real exciting movie, but even better because I waspartly driving it. The game paced itself out well, separating the combat bits with the almost-death-actiony bits.As for story and characters, I'm impressed. Story kept psyching me out in all the best ways, I only really ""called it"" a couple of times. I also like that considering what kind of game this is, they took time to develop a lot of the characters, especially Rayes and Alex, not to mention Lara. Like I said, I hadn't played any predecessors, so I didn't actually know what Lara was ""supposed"" to be like, but what I saw was great. I feel like her character could have been fleshed out just a little bit more though.I think that this game was really just one of those perfect combos of gameplay and story that we don't see very often. Mirror's Edge was great, because that gameplay was ALL the story needed, just freerunning. Simple. It kind of doesn't even belong in a genre. Same with this game. It brings in only the mechanics it needs to tell the story they're trying to tell. There's lots of quicktime events, some third-person shooting, and a few well-disguised puzzles here and there. Normally, I hate quicktime events, I feel like most of the time they make a game feel really weird and disjointed (Resident Evil), but it works here because it's just ""that kind of game."" Quotes because again, I don't think it really HAS a genre. It's a unique individual of a game, as they should be.This game isn't going to float everybody's boats, but it sure does mine! Wait, that sounded weird..."

The actual combat isn't really too challenging, or even that frequent. The main driving force behind this game was hunting and exploring everything. I think I got up to around 95% completion before I decided to hang it up.If TPS, action, more so adventure games are your thing, pick up this title. It's beautiful and fun."

Taking inspiration from previous games in the series and blending them with the more modern flavours of the Uncharted series, Tomb Raider manages to create an extremely satisfying experience which succeeds in regards to gameplay, narrative and presentation. Likeable and believable characters help to drive a well-paced and interesting storyline for a suitable 8-9 hours of singleplayer game time, minus the hundreds of additional yet equally as interesting side missions and collectible items.While this isn't the most technically powerful or demanding game you'll find by quite a stretch, the game's engine and art style are both used to great effect. From expansive vistas to subtle details on a character model, the developers have done a fantastic job creating an incredibly immersive, believable and enjoyable experience which feels complete and satisfying in almost all regards.9.3/10 - Highly Recommended."

The atmosphere is initially great, and the world has so much potential to be immersive and exciting. However, it feels like there's a dramatic shift early on. Partially introduced gameplay elements (like hunting, survival, and exploration) all just disappear.It feels like a totally different developing team slower takes over for the worst. Puzzles are simple (and optional), the maps are very linear, and it feels like the developers have chosen near constant action over exploration. The games story starts to feel like one random bazaar event after another, all contradicting how Lara acts in gameplay. Generally they feature Lara being afraid and helpless in a cutscene, followed by the player taking over, killing a few waves of mindless soldiers and proceeding strait to the next quest-marker nearby.In short:-No survival mechanics-A handful of tombs (all are optional)-Lots of quicktime events (button mashing in the middle of cut-scenes)-Combat feels like a chore (and there's a lot of it)"

In my mind that means that while it was fun and visually appealing it was also repetitive and I lost interest. It's also fair to say this title is less like the originals that had a lot more climbing and puzzle solving. Instead this title had a lot more micro-action, i.e. pressing a button at the right time according to the screen instead of trial and error. I liked that new layer to the game but that didn't fit in with old Tomb Raider. Still, it allowed for a lot more movie-like micro moments and I was fine with that.I suppose it's also fair to say the story is fairly predictable. I didn't play this for the story. I played it for the visuals and the action. The action was all right, the visuals were very nice. Now, years later with substantially improved hardware, this game looked fantastic.So who should buy this game? It's a fine semi-casual action title with light puzzle solving that doesn't go too far in any direction with ways to defeat baddies - although some of the violence could be cringe worthy for the squeamish. So if you want something I'd call fun in a decent setting that wasn't all that hard this might be a good title to buy. It has plenty of completionist elements that I ignored. It's priced right at $15 USD on 4/2021 and goes on sale."

A year later (now) I decided to give it a try.  I researched the keys I needed to use as opposed to the mouse and middle mouse QTE requirements.  I found what I needed and dove back into the game.  I am well on my way to a great end game and the QTEs are no longer difficult or frustrating.  That said, the music score and recorded sound environments are professional and skilled.  The sound on this game creates an even greater sense of emotion and chaos when a situation is encountered.  It is a heart pounding, adrenaline pumping adventure that is well told, produced and directed.  I recommend this and if this is any indication of what is to come in the sequences, you now have a loyal fan.  If anyone needs any help with the PC workaround keys, please feel free to contact me.

Seeing the growth of arguably one of the most popular games characters of all time feels both refreshing and nostalgic. I love the way that this game shows the character developing through collecting weapons off of enemies and slowly becoming more resourceful as new equipment is developed. Along with this, the dialog is oddly charming, being able to slowly see the events leading to the crash on camera as Lara struggles adapting to the environment and how the enemies have meaningful talks whilst unaware that the player is listening in. Just today I was listening to a character trying to help the other understand that killing a comrade is wrong and not to let island life get to them, it's a small addition but one that deeply helps immerse the player in the situation.The equipment feels smooth and never really feels off past a couple upgrades, the large amount of collectables and challenges keeps me looking round corners and searching my environment as I play, which has only added to the experience. Got the game as it was heavily reduced for a time killer and it is well worth the money and more, strongly recommend giving it a try even if you are not a fan of the Tomb Raider series."

The game is so scripted that you never get to experience it. You can just watch as it happens and YOU are not a part of the excitement. There are multiple parts in the gama where she is about to ""die"" but it couldn't be less tense because she is the protagonist and can't die. The game tries to drag you into the experience by making you play the cutscene. An example would be holding w to climb up a gap in the wall . There is no enjoyment in that as there are no stakes and this as well could have been a cutscene. Another phenomena that plagues the experience are the quick time events and as dunkey puts it artificial game lengtheners. Instead of pressing one button that opens a crate for example you have to mash ""e"" instead. It's just dumb. Another issue is that the path is so linear and manmade that it looks like it was made for you and was not a part of the environment.The crafting system and perks are laughable as the perks do not provide any fun and are instead increased loot. YAY FUN. There are burning arrowheads and arrows that are connected to rope that can be creative way of getting around and killing enemies. There are some interesting ideas in there but they can’t compensate for the reasons mentioned above. The story so far is okay. I must hand them that the scenery is spectacular with these ancient tombs and the classical japanese architecture. The game itself isn't that fun. She has nice boots  10/10"

3487,Dzhani,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dzhani_/,3,,0,11.5,January,"8,",174,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a very popular series of games as from the past as from the present. So I have finally decided to make a begin with it. I started my journey with the first part of the new Tomb Raider era.From the very beginning I was absolutely stunned by the incredible atmosphere in the game. The cursed/abandoned island got all of my attention for the first couple of hours. Snowy mountains, rainy jungles, steep slopes, wrecked ships and airplanes made it one of the most significant places in games where I’ve ever been. The park our is a big part of the game, it’s very well executed. It’s all scripted though, but the cinematic which you get while doing all the acrobatics is insane!Unfortunately, the remaining aspects are less good of quality. The shooting system is in my opinion handicap. From all the weapons which you get during the game, the bow remains the only pleasantly weapon to use (and still, it’s not perfect, but good enough though, I really enjoyed shooting arrows with it). You won’t feel any of the automatic weapons, neither will you feel the enemies when hitting them. You really wouldn’t mind shooting some enemy’s now and then, but as you progress further into the game, you get more dumb bots to shoot. This leads us to another incident, there is a huge lack of enemy’s variations. The only ones you get to interact with are some animals (only wolfs actually, because they are the only hostile animal in the game), the fanatics (an unnatural amount of them spread over the whole island) and the crazy/corrupt sun nation warriors. Since there is that much of shooting in the game, why not add more variations of enemy’s?The story is very simple. It just could have been better, there is not very much to say about it.Characters on the other hand is a good topic to talk about. While playing the game we see the conflicts inside the group  which we don’t care about at all and the scenarist are trying to implicate some dramatic losses in the story where over we won’t care either. All that because the characters were never personalised, we know nothing about them, even about Lara herself (and I want to remind you, this game is the very beginning of her adventures, it’s a chapter of her life where she got reborn). The game never creates any kind of emotional bond with the characters. As I’m playing this game years after it has been released I have thought about the limitations which I’ve just mentioned. It can be that the game just got to old. But then I have compared it to other games of early 2010’s, and funny things have occurred. This game indeed sucks at shooting and especially story telling. As a conclusion of this review I would suggest you to buy a newer chapter of the game (as the story of the listed one is not important at all) which will have better graphics and hopefully have better story telling/shooting system (I’m sure, it could not have got worse). I would not recommend Tomb Raider for you. 5/10"

You get something totally different, this new Tomb Raider uses the puzzle aspect of the old TR as a mini game in side quests called ""tombs"", while the main genre is the popular shooter game style you find in Max Payne 3 or Hitman 3. The game itself is fun, nice range of weapons, nice collectibles and unlockables, really good graphics, fluid climbing and parkour mechanics, interesting story line and a nice assortment of enemies. The only things I found less enjoyable was the multiplayer, which has a very bad matching system (beginning players getting matched with max level players), some of the walking mechanics (I found myself spending 5-6 seconds trying to pick up some ammo from the ground), not so smart AI, easy bosses and finally much of the same (mostly changing area, shooting bad guys, with the occasional loot searching, rinse and repeat). Overall, I had fun playing it, went into the game not expecting much and ended up doing 100% of the main story. Multiplayer is dreadful. 8 of 10."

Uncharted just got beat at its own game.  The gameplay, the upgrade system, the hidden objects, optional tombs and the insane action and of course the awesome story writing is exactly what this franchise needed.  Make no mistake this is a prime of example of what a reboot should be and boy did it ever come with a bang.  The graphics are absolutely stunning on Ultimate and the hair tessilation is mind blowing, though it does bug out from time to time when it does work it looks so realistic that next time you play a chick with stuck hair you will go nuts.  The only thing I can say bad about it is the quick time events do get annoying and you do fumble on bit on a keyboard trying to hit all the buttons fast enough.  The other great thing is all the cinematics are done in real time once you get in the game and for in game graphics its crazy how awesome they look.  10/10 It's game of the year material for sure."

It's somewhat of a button masher (i.e. designed for consoles) but plays fairly well on the PC.The most annoying issues are the transitions between cutscene and action scene, which at times can lead to a quick death if you're not expecting it.  Most of the puzzles are simple physics puzzles and difficulties typically lie on not being fully aware of the surroundings (i.e. missing a ledge, climbable rock, etc.)It took me about 14 hours to play through the game, and complete ""76%"" of the content (per the game guide).

The most annoying feature, though, is the constant dump of misfortune that gets unloaded on Lara, not unlike a bookkake of tough luck. Every beam, every rope, every bridge, every plane, every single possible thing that can fail, will do so at the most convenient moment (read: during some scripted machinima cutscene) so that Lara is sure to be stuck on the darn island and the player -has to- keep playing.The game has as much as in common with the Tomb Raider franchise as Assasin's Creed or Prince of Persia do.10/10 would stare at wet, dripping Lara again."

You play as a young Lara Croft, in the adventure that starts her tomb raiding career, fighting your way through an island controlled by a cult worshiping an ancient queen that could control the weather.  Though the game does have some wonderful graphics, it can be a bit glitchy at times; such as when you kill a couple enemies and their bodies vanish before your eyes.  The only major downside of the game is that the camera loves to fight you.  Be it by being on the wrong side when aiming half the time, turning when trying to jump which leaves poor Lara arcing past a ledge and falling to her death, or turning to face Lara when nearing the top of a climb instead of staying behind her to give you a view of the dozen cultists waiting to ram their machette into her throat.  You will probably die more often to poor camera work than anything else in this game.  I will note that the poor camera work is pretty much par for the course for a 3rd person action-adventure game, and this is not even close to the worst I've seen *cough*DevilMayCry2*cough*, so it can be overcome fairly easily. It seems to be just about the right length for an action-adventure game, not long, but not really short either, and if you are going to 100% completion you can probably expect to spend around 20 hours playing.  The world is also one of the more beautiful I've seen in a game so far.  The water effects are amazing, the characters are smooth, but they don't look like plastic, the fire effects is where I believe this game shines though, they even produce a heat blur when looking through them.  I would rate this game a solid 8/10"

The problem is that it turns, for the most part, the player into an expectator with ""little"" (choice-wise) to do other than follow the predetermined path and manage QT-Es to stay awake (but let's be fair: extremely well implemented QT-Es).Trying to gather the collectibles spread around the map may distract you from the game's main selling point: it's character development and the interaction with the environment, but those menial exploration tasks can be left to after the endgame the completionist in me wanted to ditch the sense of urgency and collect everything on the first play-through, but that spoils the mood.The voice acting is solid, the graphics are stunning and Lara's character is unbelievably well done, but the rest of the crew is unmemorable to say the best, sometimes falling into ""I wish friendly-fire could be turned off"" territory. The narrative is very common place (again, not a bad thing), but the action feels... unnatural (too much killing, even if ""justified"").The difficult is set very, very low: the (environmental) puzzles are okay, but ammo is pretty much infinite, making fragility the only problem for Lara, but again no complaints here: dying over and over again has always been a selling point for this franchise (really!).In this reboot we don't have huge, over-the-top and out-of-this-world Tombs, neither did we get underwater sequences (in fact, on my gameplay Lara drowned at least a dozen times) but yes this is solid environment and survival exploration with the most loved female explorer ever. This game truly turns Lara's character into all that she is know even a dose of sex appeal is there, when she isn't mass murdering entire armies."

You can figure out what is happening when you complete 15% of the game. However, it takes Lara 'till the end to find out what is happening. Some obvious traps and cinematic ""jump scares"" regarding spamming the e or f button but that is it. Shame that a sad story telling (not the story itself) ruined such a good experience.

The story is pretty predictable and cliche, but the set pieces are exciting, the combat is functional (and in my opinion at it's very best here in terms of balancing) and if you can get over Lara's almost ""damsel in distress"" behaviour, then she can be a pretty compelling character.

I found Tomb Raider (2013) to be of a decent story, good (but sometimes predictable twists), with some interesting aspects of history and mythology tied in together. The combat was very smooth, but some of the enemy lines are a little over the top (wow, she's a good shot!). I didn't really expect much out of the music, but the actual character design, voice acting, and environments are all extremely beautiful and well done. The tombs were puzzle-lite, so I personally would've enjoyed it a bit more if the puzzles were more interesting in the game. Other than that, I think Tomb Raider is a fantastic start in the franchise, and I look forward to the future games down the track - I would give it a 7.5/10 roughly. Thank you to the developers for releasing it to free during the COVID-19 crisis."

Do not play this game if    * you are afraid of heights* you don't like gruesome death animations* you want a realistic story    Everybody else should consider playing this classic(?!) (It really is a seven year old game. Man, time flies!)    This game has four main components.     1) Exploration    It's not an open world but rather several areas connected by travel points each with their little secrets and items to be found as well as ""tombs"" scattered across the game world. The game strikes a good balance between ingame rewards and your desire to look around a bit off the beaten path without being overly grindy.    2) Platforming    Navigating this world can be tricky at times and even though it really isn't the most difficult part of the game you still need to have you input sequences down right. All of it is well-animated really relaying Lara's struggles against the environment.    3) Puzzle solving    At several points of the game Lara needs to interact with various parts of the environment in order to access the next part of the game. The puzzles are interesting but not overly difficult. It's more the way the animation unfolds which makes them engaging. Moreover, puzzles never take over the game but they fit rather nicely into the general flow of the game.4) Combat    Yes, there's a lot of combat involved in this game. Some of it is ""free aim"", some of it is based on timed events like parry/counter moves and on rare occasions straight up quicktime events. The AI is nothing special. Ranged enemies go for cover whereas melee opponents more or less employ a blind charge strategy. You can use stealth tactics from time to time but there is no ""stealth playthrough"" as you have to go through mandatory boss battles and areas where opponents more or less engage you from the getgo. On higher difficulty settings this can be the most frustrating part but it's managable.    All these parts are bound together by a progression system which mainly unlocks new weapons and combat moves. However,  the important steps in weapon evolution are drip-fed to you depending on how far you progressed in the main story line. Consequently, even if you really upped your exploration game and gathered a lot of resources you will never outlevel the game through progression.    The true genius of this game is how these various game components meld together into one continuous narrative resulting in a high immersion factor. After a couple of moments playing this game you stop playing Lara Croft but you ARE Lara Croft completely glossing over some inconsistent plot elements and a bit of suspension of disbelief as Lara overcomes physical challenges which would put a Navy Seal in a hospital and she then melee fights her way through a dozen ""John Wick extras"". Those are the 80' action movie ""It's just a flesh wound"" moments you sort of have to ignore but because the story has such good pacing you really don't mind.    On an ideosyncratic level this is the only game ever which had me find all the collectibles. Not because I wanted the achievement but because it felt right to do it all. This probably tells you how much I appreciate the overall level of execution in this game."

There's plenty of content to do during or after the main campaign is done, it doesn't have as much puzzle solving as the original TR games due to taking the Lara Croft is an adventurer route and running with it. I for one like the reboot and the new games better than the originals I grew up with, the only reason I can see people liking the original and hating/disliking the reboot is due to nostalgia glasses.The game is amazing both story-rich and immersion with the little details you get from collecting every artifact/collectible. Instead of forcing you to follow a certain path like the original games when it comes to the story they made it open world where if you want to learn more about the details of the island and what is going on as well as Lara's origin story you have to go out and find it which I thought was a nice touch considering if you want that you have to go out and adventure for it. That in my opinion is who Lara Croft is at her core an adventurer not a puzzle solver (play a detective game if you want to solve puzzles all the time). A great game both visually and story-wise. The gunplay for a TPS isn't bad at all either very similar to Uncharted. Originally had this game and the sequel on PS4 but picked it up on a Steam sale (both for less than $25 all DLC included) and what a treat it is."
3600,Anita Coffee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iseeyoucreeping/,1,,1,30.2,July,"24,",196,0,1,"This Tomb Raider DEFINITLY has more of a combat focus than the older ones. Less tomb exploration and more pew pew. Which, I like exploration quite a bit, but my husband is more into shooting, so it works for some. 2016 one feels like it has more exploration and resource gathering by far however if you're weighting between the two, and I haven't even gotten more than 10% into '16. As for the combat, well it has a lot of options, but you'll probably find a playstyle and not use very many. I was hooked on the bow and stealth kills when I could. Again '16 looks like it'll have much more diversity, but if you're a Tomb Raider fan, or new to the series, this is a must. It's a great starter and continuation. The story line was fun, a damsel saves a damsel in distress! Old world Japanese mountainside villages, legends, mixed with some WWII German military relics/bases, and modern day cultists. Graphics were lovely, only her pony tail and the odd askew eyeball here and there were off. If I could change one thing... It would be giving Lara her sass back a bit. Her character remake for both of the newer games is definitly more realistic, but I miss her rose sunglasses and short shorts; catchy one-liners. How realistic does a one woman archeologist army really need to be anyway?My husband and I will be playing more of the 2016 game for sure, and we look forward to Shadow in September '18.

Very good graphics and performance.  Solid story, well told, with fairly interesting characters.  I normally hate QTE events and have no interest in puzzles - but the QTEs were actually appropriate and not overused, while the puzzles were generally quite interesting and things you could work through sensibly.  The gameplay is so engaging and gets quite instinctive after a short while.  Combat feels fluent, and despite the linear story the climbing and exploring does give the game a real feeling of freedom.  Crafting and skill progression elements, though fairly basic, are also nice for those who like RPGs.Can't recommend strongly enough.  Especially on a sale, this offers tremendous value.

Lara as a character is as tough and smart as ever, and she evolves throughout the game, both in ability, and toughness of character an resolve.A GOTY candidate to be sure; if you've been waiting for Tomb Raider to make a comeback - the wait is over!

3629,Raposita,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raposita/,2,,1,19.8,February,"1,",615,0,1,"Tomb Raider is the reboot of a great serie, showing the birth of a great explorer, Lara CroftThe story of the game is incredible. Lara and a few friends go in an adventure to find the Hiamatai, a lost island near the japan, that before was home of The Sun Queen, who had supernatural powers. This is the first dangerous adventure of Lara, there she learns how to survive, hunt and kill. The game give us an inocent girl who evolves to be a killer woman, you are going to see Lara crying about having killed hhe first human but in the end she is going to make brutal kills with no pitty.The graphic of the game is really amazing with some problems (but that's with my weak computer).The music, at least for me is really rare, only the credits music I could really listen to, on the other hand the sound effects is very good.There is the quick time events, they are really random, but very easy, just press F or E at the right time, A and D, shoot and done. The fighting system is really good, shooting or melee. Upgrading the weapon really shows some diference in it.Also the tree skills, there are 3 (Don't remember what each one is, maybe: Survival, Fight and something else :P). They really changes the gameplay, even more the fighting skills. Lara is going to learn some brutal finish with it, like putting the shotgun in the nose of the enemy and blasting it.Talking about skills, Lara is a ninja, she can jump really high and goes to place unreacheble for us humans.The multiplayer isn't very cool, it's just some kind of deathmatchs (Dind't play too much to say about it).Bugs almost never happened, but when it happened was really funny. Sometimes shoot someone in the head, he goes flying. (There was a part when I started fighting with 2 enemies, they were screaming for help, while another 3 guys farther was saying ""Dude, nothing happens here, I want go to the action"". And the guys screaming). Also some visual bugs, like things passing through another things, or when a cut scene starts, Lara is with her bow, but now it's gone, and in the end it cames backThe game has a gameplay of around 6 hours. Taking up to 15 hours to finish it in 100% (without help of Google) or 21 hours if you miss an achievement that can only be done in one run, and plus the multiplayer time.The final boss, or final bosses, are really easy. One is dodge and shoot, dodge and shoot. While the next is a quick time event boss fight, more easier than dodge and shoot.In the end is a great game, the story is simply amazing, and also there is some stories of people that went before to the island, they tell about the Sun Queen and her army. The story goes to a normal explorarion to a totally supernatural thing, storms around the island that is made by a soul that don't will leave no one alive. Great game and a great reboot for a great serie.96/100 ""Masterpiece"""

Lara was a badass and she looked good doing it.  I'll admit I was skeptical about this reboot, as the trailers made Lara seem scared and weak.  NOT the Tomb Raider I'd grown to love.  But I was pleasantly surprised.  Lara is dropped into this terrifying situation and she acts like you would expect.  She IS scared and frustrated at first, but it makes her seem more relatable and HUMAN.  There is real character development in this reboot, and that's more important than just being a badass.  My main gripe is that the game is just called ""Tomb Raider"", even though it has very little actual Tomb Raiding involved.  The tombs are more of a side note.  This game should swap names with its sequel, ""Rise of the Tomb Raider"", as that game is filled with more classic Tomb Raiding stuff.  This first game is more of an origin story for Lara, hence me thinking it should be the ""Rise"" one.Overall I highly recommend it to anyone new to the franchise or a veteran tomb raider."

The game includes awe inspiring graphics, that make having a powerful GPU worth all the while, and an incredible score, that alone will make this game a pleasurable experience. The game is chock full of action, puzzles, wonders, and secrets to discover, and explore; and has many collectibles spread across an expansive world, that further the lore of the game. Overall, this game is a fantastic work of art, and I can highly recommend this game to anyone; even those who are not traditional fans of the genre, as this is a game that will draw new fans, to a now more expansive, and enjoyable genre."

However the story line progression didn't make sense; the most climactic part of the game came half way through. The gameplay was interesting at first, but later on in the game it just seemed to be copy and pasted mechanics with no emphasis on mastering the mechanics the game set out as a benchmark. In regards to the graphics they were fantastic for a game that came out in 2013, there were only a few pop ins of low poly textures that would dissapear in seconds. The climbing mechanics of the game felt like an updated assassins creed 2, which is good; it just got stale after 8 hours of gameplay.TL;DR: Buy it when it is on a sale, it was enjoyable"

I only do so because I don't much care for the tight confines of contemporary action/adventure games. Tomb Raider is dazzling enough to make me forget my misgivings for the genre's current state.The game is very, very scripted. It plays more like a cinematic narrative that occasionally breaks into a video game of puzzles that can be solved in a few minutes of fumbling around or combat easy enough that losing the stealth opportunities is no big deal. A sizable fraction of the total time it took me to complete the campaign were cut-scences or quick-time events.Those stated inhibitions to explorative gameply are what I don't like about the genre, which this game has in droves. I still liked it. It was easy enough to never frustate me. I clumsily burst through the game and it rewarded my lumbering with a satisfying enough playthrough.

3658,.tv/Squary90,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Squary94/,1,,0,10.9,April,"25,",319,0,1,"First of all, the pros of this game.It has very nice graphics and runs nice even on older/weaker hardware. I managed to play this game on my Surface Pro 2 tablet with no problems at all. Thats definitly something good.The character models are nice too and facial expressions are above average. And thats about it.Now the big cons.The gameplay is really boring. The shooter mechanics are very unsatisfying because of the very stupid AI. They either rush you down or camp behind covers. They don't try to flank you or use any tactics to draw you out of your own cover. They just shoot at you no matter what. The level design is very linear. If they show you some enemys, you can try to kill some or even all  silently with your bow. This is rather satisfying but way to easy due to the very linear level design. There only exist 2-3 parts in the game where you have a more open area to take down your enemys. It lasted for about 3 min each but that was nice nonetheless and were my personal highlights of the game.There are also some Tombs and jumping ""puzzles"".  But they are very easy and require only patience and nothing else. Its almost impossible to fail at them.And don't get me started on Quick time events....Now the story.It's supposed to tell the origin story of Lara and the events that made her to the woman we know of previous games. It does an ok job at that. But there are way to many things that just ruins it.1st of all, what is Lara made of? She is thrown in situations where she should have died atleast a dozen times. She gets pierced by sharp metal things, surives falls of several meters on all kinds of surfaces, gets hit by explosions, is out in snowy areas with only a tank top and inhales bullets.They try to keep it realistic with a few supernatural aspects and yet, lara surives all these situations.How can the game try to tell a serious story if they allow Lara to surive these kinds of things?Also, why are there so many skulls, explosions and surivors on this island? Thats supposed to be a isolated island. Some get in by luck and nobody gets out. Thats atleast what they try to tell you. And yet, you encounter atleast thousands of skulls at all kinds of places. And why do things explode all the time by mere fire? You literaly see wood exploding. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wood! And whats about with all these enemy encounters? You kill hundres of them. Are we supposed to belive that a ship passes by each weekend dropping of a bunch of soldiers?This game obiviously wants to be taken seriously and yet, these things happen. That really destroys the story that is already slightly above average.My conclusion,avoid this game at any cost. Its a waste of time."

3662,Ashes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashesnbones/,1,,1,49.8,March,"1,","8,951",0,1,"Being a big fan of the action platforming elements of the original Tomb Raider franchise, I can see this game turning a few people off.  However, viewed as a game on its own merits, this one is outstanding.While the overall plot and storyline are pretty basic for an archaeological action-adventure story with supernatural elements, the individual story of Lara, and her rise from a carefree explorer to a hardened formidable warrior was amazing.  I haven't really found many games where I feel some type of bond with the character I am controlling; characters more or less act as a vessel for me to engage with other elements of the environment.  However, in Tomb Raider, there is this very immersive feel that I haven't seen done this effectively before.The visual and audio feedback convey so well how much Lara is hurt or suffering, and the various elements in the orchestral score make the moments when Lara is battling against all odds to fight for her life simply outstanding. The voice acting is also superbly done, adding so much more to the immersion.  Its easy to distinguish when Lara is scared, concerned, amazed, or charged up and ready to take on the world.  The occasional whimpers of pain Lara makes actually helps here, too.The controls also help further the immersion; at key moments, the character movement is deliberately altered to further emphasize Lara's struggles.  As frustrating as it was to have Lara move slow and be unable to do certain actions at one point in the game, I felt the added tension and anxiety it caused to be very engrossing, Various screen effects additionally helped relate how much damage the character has taken, or highlighted the difficulties of seeing and moving in the wind, rain, and snow. I never felt the need for a health bar or other vital stats on the screen; when Lara is hurt and should take cover, it was obvious.There are moments in the game where I felt a rush of adrenaline as Lara rose up against opposition and obstacle, and moments I wanted to stand up and cheer when she cried out at the enemies, and that 'hell yeah' moment when I kicked someone's ass with her new abilities.Aside from the immersive qualities of the game, the game design itself is also impressive.  The progression system is a definite highlight.  Every time I applied some upgrade to Lara's fighting skills, or modified a weapon, it had very real impact on the gameplay.  I could feel a significant difference between battles at the start of the game and those at the end.  It was yet another massive boost to how immersive the title felt. The only weak point here was maybe the looting skills.  But looting is key to upgrading so it made sense.Levels are fun to explore, especially once the various upgrades to the bow and climbing axe are unlocked.  Its perhaps here where the game feels the most like traditional Tomb Raider - climbing up cliff faces, jumping across platforms and ziplining up and down mountains.  Sadly though, the 'Tombs' the game has as side missions are  like the original Tomb Raider.  In this game, raiding a tomb consists of solving a 1 or 2 room puzzle, typically using some physics based manipulations.  Its the weakest point of the game, and while it can be a fun side challenge, it is nowhere near the type of puzzles encountered in the original Tomb Raider series.  Perhaps the sequel to this reboot will put more focus on this, especially if the developers want to appeal to core Tomb Raider fans.The only downside to this game are the QTE segments, as is true for many games.  While its not all that prevalent, it can be frustrating and unfair, especially if a boss fight can't be won without the right button mashing segment.  However, there are times when quicktime events are put to good use, to add tension or give the player a chance to save themselves from a horrible death. (speaking of, the death sequences are pretty horrific!)Combat is tricky in this game, as it requires holding an 'aim' button down while targeting an enemy, and also using dodging to avoid the unfortunately very accurate AI guns.  Additionally, the camera angles can be terrible and often times special combat moves become impossible due to which way the camera is directed.  This can also make seeing enemies in different areas hard to see, which compounded with aiming makes for frustrating die-and-repeat sequences.  However, at times combat works brilliantly. Stealth is emphasized in various points in the game, and is easily the strongest fighting mechanic in the game. Taking out enemies without alerting others is pretty damn fun.  There are times though when pulling off some skilled gunplay mixed with hand-to-hand combat feels amazing.With so much going for this game, and with such a great immersive feel, I can't help but recommend this to everyone. As with most games, it has flaws, but damn when this game does something right, it feels great.[side note: I said to a friend that there are moments this game feels like Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg  (Indiana-Jones era Spielberg) got together and had a lovechild haha.. you'll know when you see the numerous action sequences what I mean]"

I have to say that I'm glad I decided to give it a chance now, Tomb Raider was a fun ride.Gameplay is 3rd person run and gun with occasional platforming, and relatively simple puzzles. Combat can feel a little janky and chaotic, but the controls are fairly tight and consistent. Tomb Raider is kinda short, I managed to collect all the treasures hidden on the map, complete all the side quest tombs, and upgrade all my equipment in about 15 hours.The only real demerit to the game is it occasionally mixes in quick time events to cutscenes. I really feel like they add very little to the game, and just gets in the way of the real fun it has to offer. This is readily apparent as the game progresses and their frequency occurs less and less. Multiplayer feels kind of just slapped on and not really a big incentive to spend any extra money on.

Everything about the game except perhaps the extended bouts of enemy waves further in help to push the story into the direction of a major cinematic experience. This approach feels quite fresh as opposed to being held back by the usual and tired thought process of ""story doesnt matter only gameplay does"".  While it is true that some elements of the ""cinematic story"" become unrealistic and implausible, it's just one step down a wider path for gaming and of course it's not going to be done 100% right. All in all however, both the gameplay and the story in this game are quite enjoyable. Both combine to create a Lara Croft that is far more than a pair of polygon'ed boobs in a tight outfit with dual pistols blazing.Pick this game up, enjoy the adventure, and appreciate that gaming can be so much more immersive when the aid of a cinematic flair to backup and even overshadow gameplay."

The story was decently written with the ol' usual save-the-world theme, or rather this time is more of ""save my peeps and then myself"".It is an interesting story and it kept me wanting for more, the build-up was great and the direction it steered was indeed intriguing.The characters was interesting and with enough effort to locate scattered documents in the world, made the characters even more so interesting as you get to learn their backstory.The gameplay mechanics was quite good. I loved how the controls felt solid!The camera can be a little wonky at times, but forgiven as it does it's job most of the time.The multiplayer mode is a little of a joke as an extension/game-life-extender. Though I can see the potential of it being interesting, but as like most single-player games made into multiplayer; it does not carry any true value for replayability. The servers are mostly empty!Overall, this game is an ace of a flying color and something to not miss out off if you're a fan for adventure or 3rd person action shooter.I am willing to give this game a rating of:[4.5 / 5]::Rating legends::0 - Terrible, don't bother getting or even looking for it.1 - Boring. Played only for the LoL of it. Not recommended to get2 - Could have done a little better but was a snore to play it. Not recommended to get but may interest a particular party.3 - Average.

This is what the new Tomb Raider is all about. Action and Adventure fraught with peril, suspense, with plenty of excellent story telling and history is why I love Tomb Raider (2013). I've personally never played any of the previous titles of the Tomb Raider series (with the exception of demos) but, I've always read up on them since they existed back in the young days of 3D Gaming. Which is why I'm glad I waited because the developers of this game really took their time to create a well crafted (or ""Crofted) game like this that blends well with just the right stuff. The graphics are incredible and pleasing to the eye while you plunder the Tombs for lost artifacts. Another interesting aspect of this game is how they didn't make the series overtly sexual like they did in previous titles. They made Tomb Raider attractive but more in a sense that the or her character as well as the player, caring for well being in surviving the adventure. Which made a fresh new take on her story as a character.  The controls are great, but not perfect. They're 100% better then the other Tomb Raider games before it and it really shines when the player engages in combat with the bad guys in the game. There are tons of upgrades to help Laura Croft defeat her adversaries as the Player progresses. However, in the beginning, the Player will soon find out that Laura Croft is very fragile and can die quite quickly if the Player makes the wrong decision, which in turn will get the Player killed (in vicious ways might I add), so tread lightly! All in all, the controls are Great!I give this game a 9 out of 10 and GORE_TORNS OFFICIAL SEAL OF APPROVAL!"

If you like platform jumping, wall climbing, pressing buttons on demand to get out of a sticky situation (Like God of War) then you'll like this game. But the combat is just as good. I loved using my bow to get stealth kills or once I was noticed, switching over to the shotgun for brute force. You can also dish out melee moves once they get real close and perform finishing moves based on the weapon you have out at the time.  If your completionist like me, theres a lot of things to seek out and collect for 100% completion. Then there's the story. From the beginning you'll be sucked in by the mysterious actions of the island and will want to know more about what has been happening here. And from there it only becomes better. The graphics are some of the best I've seen to date. The animations of Lara are amazing. I sometimes forget I'm even looking at rendered polygons and think its just a movie. I can't believe how lifelike they were able to make her movements. For example, she'll fling her hands downwards when she is treading in water to get rid of the water off her arms and hands. BUY IT!"

I can not recommend this game to everyone, so try it before you buy it. I did not draw any emotional connections to the characters and I did not feel interested in what would happen next in the main story line. But the game was a lot of fun,  beautiful, and exciting. The combat was excellent for a Tomb Raider game (or for any game for that matter). I think the best part of the game was the progression from point A to point B, swinging from ropes, jumping from burning buildings, etc. The puzzles were challenging enough to keep me interested, and were quite entertaining. This game accomplishes something that many games in the have struggled with in the past, it makes you feel as if you are an explorer, an adventure, it makes you interested in what you will find.

It was such a thrill to jump through explosions as the walls and floors of a building are being taken apart, never quite knowing what your next step will be.  The game tends to stear you in one direction so there it little down time (which is what I want from an action game!).  Also, they put in a great feature where puzzles and objections are made more clear (this also prevents any boredom).  The combat is easy and makes you feel like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥' champ.  It was quite a fun ride.  My favorite part was Lara's development throughout the game; it makes you excited for the next installment.Cons: Either the game is too long or the story is too weak.  I enjoyed the characters a lot more than I did the over arching story.  By the end of the game the resolution doesn't feel as rewarding as it should.  There were a few disappointing moments where I thought I was going to get do something (like face a giant boss dude or escape from some henchmen) but instead they played a cut scene.

Anyway, as a fan of every game in the Uncharted Series, I went in expecting to watch another company fail to emulate everybody's globe trottling native killing hero. That was a wrong mindset. Tomb raider so far has paced itself quite well. At the beginning I thought it was pretty bare in terms of core mechanics- but I keep getting new ways/unlocks for items/situations. Either a skill (earned via xp from doing stuff) or using Salvage (salvage loot :P) to craft/upgrade my weapon. That's something Uncharted didn't have- and it immerrses me much more. In addition there's a bunch of hidden items that forward the story (still mysterious to me) that makes we want to search every nook and cranny. (And I hate completionists) In order to let people get everything, you can fast travel from campfire to campfire, and a map of the island is provided. As far as I can tell, the story path is linear, aside from occasional backtracking on purpose (more like crossroads) but by provideing the map, and fast travel- I truely feel like I'm on an expansive island, despite the linear setpieces.Anyway, if you are thinking of getting Tomb Raider, and are on the fence, get it. If you enjoyed Uncharted, this isn't it-but actually more immersive by making you feel like it's your plight. And if you can, turn on TressFX (The effect that gives Laura realistic strands of hair/hair physics), personally I quite like it- But your PC might hate it :P Yeah- this game is georgeous. Final notes: PLAY IT WITH A CONTROLLER WITH RUMBLE. -----------------Also worth mentioning, much more gore than Uncharted. I don't need gore to have fun, it's not insane levels given what I've seen, but it makes it much more gritty than other games that pander to all ages.         I look forward to finishing this :)"

Perhaps that's a testament to the seamless enjoyment the game offers from the word go to the end credits, or maybe it legitimately needed more tombs to raid. In either case, it doesn't hurt the game much, and scoring 100% completion on this one was a joy.The graphics are spectacular (Lara Croft is arguably at her smoking hottest here), however the often stormy-dark atmosphere tends to mask just how good it really is. All the characters are nicely drawn out, with fantastic voice-acting. On the other hand, the script for the Solarii is overwrought with swearing which the series has never relied upon before and which, I'm sorry to say, cheapens the game somewhat. It's kind of a ""look-I-swear-just-like-all-the-rest-of-em-now"" sorta thing. When done right, Tomb Raider has always been a thrill on its own merit, simply as an adventure-puzzle-action game, and that's what we have all loved about it from the start.The story itself serves as a solid (if somewhat transparent) vehicle for the game's wonderful progression, and leaves the player satisfied once it's all said and done. Although, I must say that this same story-line leads Lara through at least one-to-many spill-and-tumble set pieces which grow stale after the first four-or-so.Musically, we have a nice offering from composer Jason Graves, who supplies a dark and percussive horror-action score, which suffers only from lacking a more memorable theme for Lara on her debut outing as a character.Game mechanics are much improved over previous titles in the series (the combat is literally galaxies better), but the large-scale puzzle rooms seem to be a thing of the past, traded here for more of an Uncharted-style concept.All-in-all a tremendously fun gaming experience worth any adventurer's time."

All of the quests to ""Collect 10 of these items"" really didn't add much to the experience and just seemed to be included purely to increase the time it takes to complete the game.Actually raiding tombs throughout each level was fairly boring as each design can be completed in all of 20 seconds if you have half a brain, and the same clip that shows Lara opening the chest at the end (but never actually lets you see the item she pockets) was fairly irritating after the first few tombs.I agree with other reviews which state they 'feel' for Lara as she develops on the island. Some of the death sequences are also pretty grim and well-made, and help to increase the feeling that she is a survivor after you complete the game.Multiplayer has been slated by various reviews but I actually find it quite fun and believe that it goes part of the way towards attoning for the extremely linear singleplayer. The level design is extremely poor but can be rectified by patches or DLC I guess. Weapons feel satisfying and traps are quite fun to use against your enemies (or to kill yourself as I happen to find on occasion).There are some bugs in the game but thankfully none of these are gamebreaking. Overall the game is worth buying and a great installment / reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise."

3728,Brumbek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/brumbek/,2,,1,16.2,October,"11,",835,0,1,"TR is an incredibly polished and enjoyable adventure game that smartly borrows a great deal from the Uncharted series. The biggest difference from Uncharted is the structure: Uncharted uses clear-cut chapters whereas TR flows from one island location to the next. But it’s mostly semantics since both games play out nearly identically: a well-designed, linear, narrative driven experience divided into exposition, exploring, and engaging enemies.The characters all deliver strong performances. The graphics are very impressive with excellent lighting effects. The environments are detailed and lush with excellent sound design. There are virtually no bugs. There’s a simple XP and weapon crafting system that adds slight depth. This is a ridiculously well-crafted video game.Sadly, the story only lasts about 8 hours and only takes maybe 14 hours to reach 100% completion. And there is virtually no replayability: there are no unlockable difficulties or arcade modes or time trials or bonus tombs or anything. You do get a lame multiplayer mode nobody wanted.Of note is how little you actually raid tombs. The few tombs that do exist are mostly 5 minute affairs with easy puzzles but fair enough. The only serious negative is the constant obnoxious Quick-Time events. The fact the game is so good despite so many QTEs speaks to the game’s true excellence.All in all, TR is a wonderfully accessible adventure that leaves you wanting more and feeling a sense of déjà vu (assuming you’ve played the Uncharted games). Games of this caliber don’t come along very often, so TR is absolutely worth playing just to be reminded of the power of a well-made AAA video game."

While it makes everything almost perfectly, its more than the sum of it parts.Collectables are quite the trademark of many new(er) open world, or semi-open world, and TR makes a good job at mixing collectables into the story and into its upgrade system.  The game is basically the mix of these - story and upgrade. Progressing the story unlock more locations, and the locations have collectables and various challenges to fuel the upgrade system of the game, which is a mix of natural progression and rewards, based on your gameplay.The story itself is pretty alright, its strong side is how much it shows to you. You'll likely figure out the strings before Lara tells you the whole thing, but getting through beaches, forests, tombs, bases, monasteries and ramshackle villages are the main attraction. Collectables give more info about the mysterious island and its inhabitants, past and present, which is a great extra lore if you don't really mind the few dozen diaries scattered during the game.The game's upgrade system is dual - you gain XP to unlock more skills and features, and you use scrap to enhance your weapons. The idea is great at the beginning of the game, but later gets quite flat - more xp and scrap is good upgrades, but powershot and the QTE-disable/kill counterattacks are devastating, most of the higher tier unlocks are absolutely unneeded. Weapon-wise it's useful to juggle multiple weapons and ammo types, but the bow is impactful, and most upgrades are not on par with a silencer for the A. rifle, or a burst mode for the pistol. Shotgun is as effective as throwing chestnuts at enemies.Overall the game was super fun. Lots of exploration, climbing, shooting bad guys, and unveiling the island's mystery. There are multiple difficulty levels for combat, and some upgrades can make the game easier (The DLC ones, but they are in the game as well), so it's pretty approachable. Tone-wise it's bloody combat with loads of horrible and visual ways for Lara to die, it was a bit shocking, and it is even now. Some QTE parts are really out of place and can be super stressful after watching Lara get impaled on scrap metal or pine trees multiple times, but things  like that only shows how good the other parts are. (It's maybe a 30s long segment with a checkpoint in the middle, at least they were forgiving)I'm a lot late with the TR reboot-series, but I'm really looking forward to the sequels after this."

It doesn't live up to it's heritage. It has a lot of wasted potential, - This game is BEAUTIFUL. Even by today's standard . The japanese-inspired set is magnificient, characters are well animated and lively, this made me want to go trekking on this island (if that wasn't for those pesky Solarii and Onis !) - The story is well documented and interesting, and while it could have been deeper, the team that worked on it deserves recognition. The characters too are really well written and endearing !- There's some really good details like Lara's clothes getting progressively ripped as she survives another day. It made it immersive.- This game is SHORT . Very short. I casually played for 20 hours and completed it 100%. And if that wasn't for all those boring and useless collectibles, it could have beaten it in under 3h first try.... That's really disappointing. I'm happy I didn't bought it full price back when it came out...- It's way too easy. Even on hard setting . No enemy poses any real threat, the few puzzles you have to solve aren't a challenge at all and there's like 5 in the whole game anyway. - It's completely linear ! That's a real shame. With such a beautiful island, I can't even explore it...- There's no side quest at all . The stupid collectibles scattered around the map doesn't count. I mean, getting documents and relics add to the lore that's good, but collecting mushrooms and eggs ? Am I playing Top Chef ??- It's really repetitive . follow the marker - fight some enemies - follow the next marker. That's it, you beat the game. No real gameplay diversity.- The enemies aren't diverse both in look and in function . Sure, some got better weapons, some have armor, some are melee only, but that's basically it. Oh yeah and the wolves too . For a remote island , it's really devoid of biodiversity . I would have loved to be wary of the rivers because I could find crocodiles in it. Or getting ambushed by stealthy predators. Or stepping on a snake and getting poisonned. It would have been realistic for an uncharted Island and maybe made the game harder.- Some areas seems to have been rushed . The devil is in the details. Like ropes parts of a mechanism going through the roof or a rock, or the skybox disappearing through some holes in a cave . - The only two bosses of the game have the EXACT . SAME . GAMEPLAY .... Come on... And they're not even hard... Lara deserved better (or worse)- It's too short ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ! Yeah I repeat myself, just like this game does._______________________________________________"

I was wrong.Once it was installed, I set all the graphics to minimum (except resolution, I MUST play on native [1366*768 in my case.]) And launched the game. After the five minute cutscene that leads into the game, I was amazed that despite my hardware and graphics options, the game looked really good, and ran at a decent framerate. It's got good gameplay mechanics too, with parcour that reminds me of AC2 (but with better controls). It has skills that you can level up, and every type of weapon is upgradeable with either gun (or bow) parts or attachments created from ""salvage,"" which is found around the map. I'm fairly sure it's semi-open world (the map is reasonably large), though I'm not certain, since I haven't really strayed from the main story. It has multiplayer too, but I haven't tried that.Also, it's the first game ever made in which Lara actually wears a singlet and trousers like a normal person would (what were they thinking with those obscenely ludicrous short shorts in previous games?).TLDR-good graphics-runs on a potato-large world-fast-paced gameplay-more fast-paced gameplay with parcour-shooting people in the legs with a compound bow so you can whack them over the head with a climbing pick9.5/10Definitely worth the full price."

The platforming is fluid, the gunplay feels precise and destructive. You will rappel, jump, climp, slide and mountaineer across a wide variety of terrains and structures. The story is your typical shipwreck-survival story and it hits all the tropes without failure. The characters save for Lara are all one dimensional stereotypes: the mystic native, the tough black chick, the ditsy asian girl, the grumpy scot and the publicity-hungry professor. I'm surprised there isn't a muscular hispanic and a dirty russian in this group (dirty russians seem to be reserved only for the antagonist group). However, Lara herself is well-designed. She grows from a scared greenhorn to an grizzled survivor gradually, though there is a kink in this graph right where she kills her first human. I'm sure other reviewers have pointed this out repeteadly, that moment passes simply too quickly and Lara passes from a woman crying over the body of her first victim to mowing down dozens of enemies in the space of like ten minutes. That jarring bump aside, I thought her growth was well dovumented and the player feels one with the protagonist and her emotions most of the time.On the gameplay front, It's the standard third person shooter gameplay, with four different available weapons which are upgradable and have multiple firing modes. It makes for some exhilareting set pieces when enemies are swarming you and you're using every weapon in your arsenal, every trick at your disposal, dodging and jumping around and firing shots. Although for a survival-themed game there is precious little surviving to be done by way of gameplay. Ammo is plentiful and your health auto-regenerates. The platforming feels breezy and free, and there are plenty of things to scale and rappel off in the game's many and well-designed levels. The game takes place on an island but this island is strewn around with a millenium-worth of human refuse. So you'll find hidden bunkers, crashed planes and ghost towns as well as ancient monastries and mountain shrines. It's all very well-done. The only real complaint I have on the gameplay front is the lack of intricate tombs. There are a few optional tombs thrown about here and there but they are embarresingly short, which irkes all the more because I really digged the new physics-based puzzles where you'd have to burn, throw, pull or break objects to solve them, and the puzzles really looked realistic - as in they genuinely looked like something real and not just a suspecious set of levers and keys conveniently placed in the middle of nowhere to be solved by the player. When they do have such a good system in place, why not use it more often? I don't know. A great game overall, and a perfect example of how to successfully reboot a dead dinosaur."

3768,///cl4ym4n.de >:3,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cl4ym4n/,1,,1,19.6,May,"14,","2,198",0,1,"Tomb Raider is the prequel to the original Tomb Raider from 1996 and basically tells a rather simple 'How it all began...' story of the young Lara Croft as she becomes a tomb raiding adventurer.As with a lot of the more recent games, Crystal Dynamics tried to come up with a serious and mature story to underline Lara's character development from an innocent girl to a gun wielding badass with boobs. Unfortunately, due to the story's supernatural elements, it loses quite a bit of authenticity and makes this all quite a lot less believable. The story-telling itself, though, is well done and doesn't get boring.While this game is about the young Lara, it baffles me how they could have made her look so entirely different from the other games. This is probably due the realism-factor of the game, though it is a really odd thing because your face doesn't really change over time, it just gets older. But well, you get used to it quite fast and she's still cute. :DCrystal Dynamics did a really great job on the modelling side and the level design. Large amounts of detail, high-resolution textures and a lot of graphics options make the game look really stunning. Square Enix, the publisher of Tomb Raider (and Deus Ex: Human Revolution and Sleeping Dogs), seems to have understood how to please PC gamers. Thumbs up for that.Being a third-person game, there are no surprises when it comes to the controls. Lara's movement and the responsive combat elements will instantly make you feel home. Since this would probably make the game look less authentic, you are no longer able to wall-jump off a wall while wielding dual pistols, doing a backflip and shooting at tigers - at the same time. It's a bit unfortunate because this kind of movement freedom was one of the characteristics of the Tomb Raider series. Another slight downside of the game are the numerous quick time events, as in press-X-at-the-right-time, mash-Y-till-your-fingers-bleed and so on. Even for basic tasks like prying open a door you have to do this. I can't see how this benefits the gameplay at all and actually gets rather annoying over time.The game takes place on an island, so it's the perfect place for an open-world free-roam game. In theory. While the game progress in Tomb Raider doesn't feel as linear as in your typical modern military FPS, you can't really explore the island freely right from the start. A lot of passages and areas only open up once you reach a certain point in the story or acquire a certain piece of equipment.It feels like CD weren't quite sure what they wanted to do: A linear level-by-level or an actual open-world game, so they decided to make it a bit of both. This isn't necessarily a bad thing and actually quite a lot less boring than the typical linear game progress, but it's neither fish nor fowl and feels a bit like an half-assed attempt to create the illusion of an open world.The currency in the game is called 'Salvage'. With it you can upgrade Lara's abilities, her gear and weapons and special abilities. You collect Salvage by progressing through the game, killing enemies and looting them, destroying loot crates, finding secrets, completing challenges and so on. So, yeah. Basic stuff there.With a game this large (level-wise), there are a lot of things to find and collect - A LOT. I can't really recall another game with so many types of collectibles. Fortunately, one of Lara's high-tier upgrades enables you to see those collectibles on your world map, so unlike in other games, it's a lot less frustrating and time-consuming to go for 100% completion.With a lot of exploration, dying from stupidity and messing around, it took me about 18 hours to beat the game and 100% it, which I consider a really decent value for money.Overall, Tomb Raider is an extremely enjoyable game with stunning visuals, great level design and gripping story-telling, so if you feel like taking a brake from your military FPS and play a decent game instead, make sure to give Tomb Raider a fair shot. It's well worth it and already one of the best games of 2013."
3769,Bunny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackGuardGaming/,3,,0,7.8,March,"7,",516,0,1,"Im doing a downvote because my review is negative, I do still reccomend the game on sale! This game's biggest pain in the ass issue is that is is literally little more than a snuff film for half of it. To ensure you of this, you get a quick time event in the very first area that DOES NOT tell you what button to push to survive (Press F when the bigger circle enters the smaller circle) So you will get to watch Lara die about a dozen times, bones crunching under rocks and her screaming, over and over. So you finally beat that and keep playing, do some ridiculous climbing in which she spends the whole experience... screaming again, oh well, maybe itll lighten up. few minutes later you get my favorite so far, a decently long cinematic with a 2 second Quicktime that appears out of nowhere, and if you dont click immediately (you are given no warning) you get to watch someone who has been sexually touching laura strangle her to death.I understand trying to show where the badass Lara i grew up with started, I appreciate trying to build it up. But this game plays like a ""Cabin in the woods"" movie for about half of the time you are in it, swimming through a sea of rotting bodies and falling on spikes, sexual threats against lara who is depicted as a little girl, it gets old, it makes you cringe, and honestly it makes that other 50% where you are badassing through a base feel like its just there to make you feel better for the constant screaming that you have to hear as she is beat, flung, stabbed, strangled, crushed, and hinted at sexual molestation. The game isnt bad, but im focusing on the big pain for me, the games combat. stealth, and exploring are fun and feel better as far as making it a growing-up story for laura. The tarnish from the snuff film feel doesnt outweigh the fun you will have, it just severely taints it. Play with a headset or your neighbors, family and roomates will start avoiding you/checking your search history to see if you like watching teenage girls get slaughtered.To drive my point home, heres some highlights that occured in just two hours of gameplay.Most of these occured while Laura was, as part of an objective, trying to heal a wound, so you can bet she has every disease known to man by the end of this. And finally, hard to capture with a pic, but men driven psychotic by the baddies being used as guard dogs, that will eat lara alive if she is discoveredThese were not taken in the same gameplay segment, each was part of a different area, all occured within the time played, two hours, as I said, if you stripped out half the game, you could make a B-rated slasher flick"

However, I beg to differ. The multiplayer  had me hooked the first time around even before I started with the story mode. Its like your typical multiplayer game with modes similar to deathmatch and area control. However, the way every match plays out is actually very different and in some ways feels very unique. Lets just say, skills matter. Wall scaling, using a rope to zip down towards an area or behind an unsuspecting opponent feels pretty damn good. Before you know it, you want to do it again and again. I just wish the multiplayer wasn't as under-emphasized as it is because it seems like no one is playing it. Finding a match is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hard. Even after you manage to find one, usually someone decides to leave and you're left with no choice but to queue up again for god knows how long. Besides that, I like almost everything about this game. Its story-rich, filled with action and has a proper ending.Lets just say this is one of those games that you won't regret getting even at its full price."
3786,Koozy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dkoozy/,1,,1,10.8,November,"6,",311,0,1,"This was a great step in taking the franchise into the contemporary gaming era. A lot must have been learned through the prior mediocre entries in the series. The game bring back the classic character Lara Croft, with a newer, softer, younger persona. She begins the story naive and afraid, but really rises to be a strong and independent character. If you want a very well done, modern (dare I say, feminist?) female character done right, here she is. The story of her growing strength, confidence, and abilities is very well done and you feel hand-in-hand with the story from Lara's perspective. The gameplay is solid from the third-person shooting segments to the landscape/platforming puzzles. The puzzles can be a bit challenging, but none to the point that I felt the need to look it up online. Everything is pretty intuitive, but hard enough to leave you feeling accomplished when you solve a puzzle. The shooting elements are fairly standard ""take cover and shoot,"" but it all feels very tight and the weaponry seems to have a real weight to it. The graphics are beautiful. This review is a few years after release, but it holds up wonderfully. The hair effects are especially a marked step forward. There are a fair amount of reused textures, but there are only so many ways to decorate an ancient Japanese tunnel. The character models are the standout, but the open world looks great and usually subtely guides you to where you need to go. The pacing is pleasantly solid; As I hit the 10 hour mark, I was notified that I couldn't go back until I finished the game. All told, about 10.5 hours for the main story and a few side quests here and there. Side quests include collectibles, or simple side-tomb exploration.Wonderful graphics, engaging story, and fun shooter/puzzle gameplay make this an easy recommendation."
3787,Hell Patrol,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bohlingc/,2,,1,20.3,February,"15,",567,0,1,"I have really mixed feelings about this game. It's frequently exciting and possesses a solid core combat system, as well as a number of breathtaking moments. However, it's also full of contradictions and gameplay elements that suggest that the development team's left hand was not talking to the right. Instead of making a list of pros and cons, I'll go over the basic reasons I still recommend the game despite its problems, and then I'll discuss the aspects of the game where it seems like the devs didn't think about what they were doing.The game's biggest strengths are its combat system, graphics, puzzles, and performance. The combat is fairly standard third person shooter fare, but the weapons feel appropriately weighty and AI is good. Enemies try to flush you out with grenades and coordinate attacks. Most of the time I wasn't able to sneak by them too easily, either, which I appreciate. The fighting is bloody and the kills seem appropriately nasty. As far as combat difficulty, I started on Normal but switched to Hard about a third of the way through. Hard is appropriately hard - Lara can only take a few bullets and the enemies generally can take several more. Even though the game is fairly linear, the combat stays fresh through the introduction of new weapons and enemy types consistently. You can also blow up barrels and bring down walls to help you in your fight. The weapons seem fairly balanced: none of the weapons can one-shot kill an enemy without a headshot (or the shotgun at close range).Graphically, it's one of the best-looking games I've ever seen, rivaling Crysis 3. Characters, weapons, enemies, animals, and foliage all look very realistic. There are some pretty stunning natural vistas in the game, as well, since Lara spends so much of the game up high. Unlike some games that are pretty just for the sake of being pretty, Tomb Raider actually uses the graphical fidelity to its advantage - a number of platforming scenes, such as the radio tower climb and the ziggurat ascent to the final battle, are stunningly tense specifically because of the graphical fidelity of the wind, sky, and snow. Generally, these impressive graphics don't lead to major performance issues - on my i5 3470/GTX 970 system, I ran at or above 60 fps 95% of the time with everything maxed except except hair on normal and FXAA. In a few cutscenes I noticed the bluriness typically associated with FXAA but I never noticed it in the game engine.The puzzles are also a highlight. Most of them involve traversing a number of obstacles in order to reach a high point, such as a tomb. The majority of the puzzles take place inside tombs (more on those later), but there are a few included in the main campaign. The use of the bow to create ziplines is a neat feature. They aren't exceptionally difficult, but generally they took me more than 5 minutes to figure out so they weren't too easy either.Since solving traversal puzzles and fighting makes up 80% of the game, its strengths in these particular areas are enought for me to recommend it. That said, the game does suffer from some notable consistency issues.Many have already criticized the game for its inconsistency of tone - Lara seems very distraught over her first kill but then goes on to kill many more people without a second though. This actually doesn't bother me so much - she's fighting for her life, what is she supposed to do? The story aspect that actually bothers me is the tomb raiding itself. They are optional, of course, but when Lara enters a tomb she simply takes whatever she can find and seems very pleased with herself. This doesn't make sense in the context of this story's ""realistic"" version of Lara, who is a university-trained archaelogist who wouldn't just steal relics from archaelogical sites. The amoral adventurer of previous Tomb Raider titles would, but we don't ever see the transition from goody-two-shoes college student to doesn't-give-a-♥♥♥♥ Lara Croft. That shift in tone was a lot more jarring to me than Lara getting accustomed to killing.There are also some gameplay inconsistencies, most notably involving moving in and out of cutscenes. Frequently you'll be taken into a cutscene within the game engine without any notice or shift in perspective - you only realize the game's taken over when you take your hands off the controls. This is par for the course for modern games and it doesn't bother me that much. What is much more annoying is that the game frequently returns control to the player in the same manner - without any indication. This would be OK if Lara was standing still in a safe spot when the player regained control, but in Tomb Raider it frequently happens in the middle of platforming sequences where Lara isn't standing on stable ground. Consequentially, you end up dying a lot before you realize that you've been given back control of the character. It's just a really poor design choice.The collectable system is equally ill-thought-out. Most of the collectables show up on the map, but some do not. This makes a 100% run a bit of a slog, since finding the unlisted (""challenge"") collectables can take some time. There isn't any  important reward for completing all the challenges, either, unlike in games like Far Cry where certain weapons and skills are locked behind certain items. In Tomb Raider, all you get from collectables is XP - and you can beat the game relatively easily even without the collectables XP boost. It seems like the devs assumed players would try to get the collectables just because they are there, and gave them no other incentive to do so. The collectables system in Tomb Raider is consequentially even worse than those found in Ubisoft collect-a-thons.Despite these several annoying inconsistencies, I still enjoyed Tomb Raider. I'd recommend picking it up in the Steam sale when it goes below $10. The issues are enough to make me not recommend it at full price, but for a discount there's a lot of fun to be had here."

My critiques of the game would be involuntary hints and clues when solving puzzles that cheapens the experience and the fact the game is too linear and doesn't allow players variety of options to complete obstacles."

3790,Echo419,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/,2,,1,40.2,February,"1,",819,0,1,"Tomb Raider meets Uncharted.Back in the old days tomb raider was a game about platforming, puzzle solving and the occassional shoot outs. In this 'reboot' of the series however, the gameplay has focused mainly away from the puzzle solving and more in line with combat ala Nathan Drake style. There a still puzzles to be had, but they aren't that challenging nor memorable. You have a variety of weapons available including the pistol, bow, assault rifles and grenades which you find along your travels. You can also upgrade your weapons as well as varies skills via campsites located in each area, using skill points earned through enough XP via combat or other feats. Enemy variety varies from dogs, regular gun goons, close range guys and some heavy guys. Firefight can get pretty hectic as mobs of guys try to swarm you, but you can take cover to avoid some damage. The gameplay is somewhat linear as you have to go to specific points to progress, but the big maps give you plenty of room to explore and find hidden treasures.The story isn't that great. Basically, Lara and her group of friends were on an expedition to an island to study the japanese relics there. The ship they were on gets caught by and storm and they are seperated on the island filled nutcases (Far Cry 3 anyone?). You then work with survivors to try to discover the mystery of the island and then escape. The voice acting is decent to bad. Lara's acting is alright, but some of the other characters don't sound that good. Plot isn't that interesting either personally. The weapon sounds are decent. The music is quite good at implicating the atmosphere, especially in the tense scenes.The graphics are quite good. There is quite a bit of terrain to look at, which doesn't hinder performance to much. There may be a few lag spikes as other areas of the map loads. There is also tres-FX which basically makes Lara's hair look amazing, but greatly hinders performance.If you ever wanted an Uncharted game on PC, get this game. If you wanted a game in the vain of the 'traditional' tomb raider games (i.e. mor puzzle focused), you will find this game disappointing."

The developers did a good job in the graphics and sound department and TR still looks pretty in 2017. Some shaders seem a bit overdone as they look like glossy plastic.Fighting mobs is fun and feels rewarding. Combat AI is decent and uses alternative routes, flanks you and generally comes after you even if you change floors.The idea to make cutscenes more interactive by 'press X not to die' events (QTE) is a bad game mechanic in my book and only very few gamers love them. Reading through the threads in the game hub you'll see that they might be game breaking due to input lag on some systems or if you 'suck'. Be it as it may, QTE breaks the immersion and it's no fun to have to replay the same cutscene to finally get the timing of your button/key pressing right. Another negative point for me is the amount of cosmetic DLC to milk a few extra bucks out of players. Story DLC like Tomb Raider: Tomb of Lost Adventurer is still broken in 2017. Multiplayer is obviously dead as I get the in-game message 'servers not available' (fixed). This doesn't impact me much as I bought the game for the singleplayer experience. Multiplayer map DLC is pretty useless though without players online.Despite all these cons I enjoyed TR very much and due to the game packed to the brim with side mission content (challenges, tombs) it may keep you engaged even after completion of the main story. As a diehard PC gamer, I played with KB/M without major issues. Finishing the game without diving into all the side content took me 15 hours on normal difficulty and 73% game completion. The game supports 4K resolution and gave me about 37 average fps in ultimate settings, AA off (i7 4790 K@4.5 GHz, R9 390X, 16 GB RAM).The island's story is well narrated in multiple layers through text fragments/artifacts you'll find throughout the game. The ending feels rushed as if they ran over budget/out of time.I bought the base game in a Steam sale for ~€5 and you should be able to get the GOTY edition on sale at an attractive price if you're a Lara Croft fan and want the whole package. Buying the DLC separately is a waste of your money. Like I said, be wary about the multiplayer part as it seems to be dead.If you enjoy TR you might also have a look at Rise of the Tomb Raider as it is like a twin to this game. The GUI and gameplay are pretty much the same. RoTR has more advanced graphics, a different storyline and more restraint in QTE events but you'll feel right at home."

I believe it is intended to be a prequel or reboot of the TR franchise though I haven't played any of the other games in the series. It tells Lara's origin story, of how she ended up in her famous line of work. The game itself is very story driven and it moves along at a breakneck pace- speaking of, this game is extraordinarily wince-inducing- this might as well be subtitled 'Lara's Worst Day Ever'. She is regularly dropped, beaten, banged around, and otherwise abused during the course of the game. It really contributes to you feeling like a survivor, though, and Lara is a pretty strong female protagonist. The game is semi-free exploration, generally of a large area, in pursuit of a specific story-goal. There are a number of side-tombs to explore that offer puzzles and various bonuses as rewards, and a ♥♥♥♥ ton of collectibles if that's your thing. The combat is interesting, and there are QTEs but they are mostly well done and infrequent. I heartily recommend this game to anyone and it's definitely GOTY-worthy."

3825,Slayster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slayster/,2,,1,18.4,December,"8,",473,0,1,"In my 25+ years gaming I've never actually played a Tomb Raider game. Of course the series has only been around for 17 of those years but that's besides the point. So seeing as the new 2013 Tomb Raider is complete reboot storywise it seemed like a reasonable place to start and a great start it was too. First let mention the graphics which are top quality and run smoothly even on my aging GTX260. However there is of course a lot more to a good game than great graphics. This is the story of Lara Croft's first adventure after being shipwrecked on a strange island filled with a bunch of crazy culists and ancient artifacts. It's an interesting story as you discover more and more along with Lara, but I think what really sells it is the great voice acting. The whole thing just progresses really nicely. After starting with nothing you slowly learn new skills and gather new equipment and just a Lara would you're learning to control them at same time. All until the end when you have put everything together to save the day. It's almost perfectly paced and even clothing gets damaged and major wounds persist over time. Although the amount of damage Lara can take is pretty unrealistic if you think about it too much. There were a couple of quicktime events with frustrating timing which annoyed me a little but not enough to ruin the game. Also there was one jump near the end which nearly made me quit after dying over and over again. That was until I realised I was being and idiot and doing it wrong! Overall an awesome game which I really enjoyed, even to the point of going back and making sure I found all the collectables which was fun rather than tedious. I doubt I'll ever go back and play the original games but I'll be striaght on the next one if Crystal Dynamics are still involved."

The parkour and map design are the best parts of the game, and it feels really nice. Combat is rather dull, but not too bad.

Not mucht to write about, then only that this game is inspiring, and you will find action and adventure on your journey to the final scene. Yuo should like cinematics and quick-time events to love this game and to understand how you can go survive.The bad side is that this game cannot be called Tomb Raider. Tomb Raider was jumping and shooting. Not cinematics and -SPOILER- crappy endbosses that you cannot kill on your own, but only in a quicktime event. After a long climb up, I just had to push one button to kill the endbos. Nice gamebreaker Crystal... -/SPOILER-Also when you watch the ""Final Hours"" and bought the Artbook, you got hyped up by the awesome art and jungle/mountain typed huge monsters and creatures, the game is pretty ruined. Even the mockupped version / pre-alpha edition of the game ""Ascention"" was better than this Tomb Raider. Also the ""Definitive Edition"" ruined alot for me. So, the pre-ordered edition I bought wasn't a final Tomb Raider game?!The game itself is Amazing, but you cannot call it Tomb Raider anymore. Sadface! Been a fan of Tomb Raider for many years, still love Tomb Raider II the most. And yes, I will buy the next Tomb Raiders, cause I'm a fan :D! Hope the next two Tomb Raiders are an improvement.

The AI try to flank you, do not give up and I saw very few AI glitches or problems.The story is good, if a little cliche and perdictable but not too much so.If you enjoy the Tomb Raider series then you will definitly enjoy this game,If you have either never played a TR game or found the platforming or combat lacking,then I would say to give this game a try because it is a complete reboot of the series inalmost all aspects and you should not judge this game on previous TR series games.Game Breakdown--------------------------Graphics: 9.5 out of 10 - The 0.5 because during some cutscenes the frame rate would drop a littleAudio: 8 out of 10 - Does the job and doesn't get in the wayGame Mechanics: 10 out of 10 - Everything felt fluid and precise. Nothing felt cheated or too easy or too hard, perfect handling.Story: 8.0 out of 10 - A good story, nothing that will change your life or anything, but servicable.Replayability: 8 out of 10 - After finishing the main game it does allow you to continue on and find or complete and missing items. Although, on first playthrough I did find 97% of items without having to look too hardMultiplayer: Does have it, but Not Rated. (Not counted toward score)Final game Rating:  8.7 out of 10--------------------------What do your Ratings Mean?Less than 1.0: Send an email to the developer and ask them what they were smoking when they made this. Demand any money back that you paid for this. Wipe from your hard-drive. Ask Steam to remove this embarresment from your account and from Steam.From 1.0 to 1.9"" Just ignore this garbage and any developer that has created this horrid mess. Does not run/crashes all the time. Consider trying to get a refund and warn your friends. Your honor bound to let others know how bad this game was.From 2.0 to 2.9: Give it away as a gift because it's not worth your time. Full of bugs/glitches. But, don't give it to any friends you actually like as that would be a cruel joke. You should also post a review explaining how bad said game is.From 3.0 to 3.9: Only worth it if free or with a bundle of other higher rated games. Don't complain if you got it for free or paid a bundle price for it, you knew what you were getting when you got it.From 4.0 to 4.9: Even die hard fans might want to stear clear of this one. Maybe good just to have a complete set of a series if the other games in the series were good, but I wouldn't recommend even playing this one.From 5.0 to 5.9: Only true fans should even bother. If you have other games in the series or have never played this genre/type then you might play it just to see if it has any interest.From 6.0 to 6.9:  Should be tried first, purchase with caution (try a demo first). If you like it then look for higher rated types in this genre.From 7.0 to 8.4: Worth it, but should wait for a sale if you can. Could post a review to even out perception of game.From 8.5 to 9.4: Worth the full retail (non-sale) price. Please post a review explaining what you liked/didn't like and tell your friends.From 9.5 to 9.9: A keeper, something you can enjoy for years from now.Definitely look for other titles from the developer/publisher and try to get other games in the series.Anything rated a 10.0 is considered Game of The Year/ Best in Class - You should own this game no matter what.You are honorbound to play this, get your friends to play this, and buy multiple copies if possibile to support the developer."

I loved Tomb Raider Anniversary, and Underworld. Why did I like them? Because the gameplay focussed on exploration and puzzle solving, with an ancient ruins aesthetic. Tomb Raider 2013 does not seem to have any of those things. So far gameplay feels like a series of inane situational response actions that string together a bunch of boring cinematics. I was really excited when I installed it. I was looking forward to another Tomb Raider Game.Even if I consider it as its own thing and simply an entirely new game with Tomb Raider flavouring, it still feels like the play is too constrained. It reminds me of what I always hated about the LucasArts games of the 90s. They spent so much time forcing the user through a scripted series of actions, that it didn't even feel like playing a game at all, just a lot of timed clicking.I haven't given up on this game entirely. I will  play some more and see if I get into it more, but I can't say I am terribly hopeful."

It’s a shame that this Tomb Raider reboot, which deals with Lara’s origins, fails to develop the character in any real way. She often comes across as little more than a reactionary, heavily armed punching bag. You could say her iconic top undergoes more character development than she does.All that being said this is still a solid game, with decent 3rd person combat and platforming. The addition of a bow also adds a stealthy approach to gameplay. It could do with a little more Tomb Raiding and less Ludo narrative dissonance, but I’d definitely recommend it."
3853,inter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/interFaZer/,4,,1,22.8,September,"28,",444,0,1,"The story is a bit cliché for a movie but pretty engaging for a game. A group of archeologists is looking for a lost culture based on a hunch and little to no evidence. , their ship wrecks and they end up stranded on an isle, which happens to be the one they were after. Good, right? Problem is, if they try to escape (ship, helicopter, plane, you name it) the weather will go crazy and their medium of transport will wreck and end up in the island again, like it or not. Why? Solving the mystery is up to you.This third person shooter is highly interactive, so you'll have to stay alert throughout the game because saving Lara's life in unexpected situations will be pretty common. Thinking fast is a requirement, tombs are optional.Improving your weapons and adding perks was more than addicting, and finding out you can 100% all the perk trees was a pleasant surprise, so don't bother hoarding skill points! Same goes for the weapons: if you're dedicated, you can 100% them all. The tombs are nice intellectual challenges but they're definitely worth it, so make sure to raid them all!The enemies are despicable as it gets but sadly none of them represented a challenge (well, the Oni berserker in the end was a bit hard), so if you're not a casual gamer you might wanna play it on hard mode. The gunplay is pleasant but it definitely feels different because Lara always goes to the left, you never really shoot from the center. Still, the game is easily beatable with a controller in normal mode.The graphics are stunning (though some textures are kinda blurry) and the soundtrack does its job. It can pump you up in the middle of a combat and give you the little kick that you need to kill them all. Not the kind of soundtrack I'd want to download, but pretty good still.Highly customizable, and partially left-handed friendly:None to make at the moment8/10 addicting, entertaining, but gunplay could be polished"

3888,Kraugel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kraugel/,1,,1,11.2,January,15,71,0,1,"Tomb Raider is the kind of game that makes you feel like Indiana Jones, minus the fedora and the cool whip. You play as a young and inexperienced Lara Croft, who is determined to uncover the secrets of a mysterious island. And let me tell you, this island is full of surprises.First of all, the graphics in this game are absolutely stunning. The lush jungles, crumbling ruins, and dark caves all look so realistic that you'll almost feel like you're actually there. Almost. I mean, you're still sitting on your couch, but it's the next best thing.The gameplay is a mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, and action. You'll be running, jumping, climbing, and swimming your way through the island, all while trying to avoid deadly traps and enemies. And let me tell you, the enemies in this game are no joke. You'll be fighting everything from heavily armed soldiers to giant bats, and even a T-Rex. Yes, you read that right. A T-Rex. And let me tell you, that was one of the most intense moments of my life. I was yelling at the monitor, telling Lara to run faster, and then, just when I thought it was all over, she pulls out her shotgun and blows that T-Rex to smithereens. It was epic.But the game isn't all about action, there's also a lot of puzzle-solving involved. You'll have to figure out how to open ancient tombs, decipher mysterious symbols, and unravel the secrets of the island. And let me tell you, some of these puzzles are no easy feat. But when you finally figure it out, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.The story is also really well-done. As you progress through the game, you'll uncover more and more about the island and its inhabitants. And let me tell you, it's not what you expect. There are twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.Overall a great game. It's got everything you could want in a game - beautiful graphics, intense action, brain-busting puzzles, and a gripping story. I highly recommend it. 8.5/10, would raid tombs again."
3889,SSJPrince,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrinceAzhakel/,1,,1,34.2,January,9,329,0,1,"I don't know another female lead character in video games that I could say inspires me quite like Lara in this ""Tomb Raider"". It feels highly unlikely and fictional that she would Rambo her way through so many near-death scenarios and so many people, however unlikely there is still a chance. Her determination to protect Sam makes her feel like a genuine badass when she's killing to survive, pushing through anger and sadness to see the mission to the end. She resembles a marine, she doesn't really act like the young lady she actually is, if this same game was developed and the character was a man there would be not much different other than the character dynamic with her and her companions. It was satisfying killing the bad guys and seeing Lara through to the end. And of course she's hot, ez + satisfying third person view."

Along the way, there are a bunch of cut scenes with over the top action sequences and a bunch of quick time events. The shooty parts of the gameplay bored me about halfway into the game, but the puzzles in the tombs are fairly engaging. I ended up turning off my brain about halfway into the game (and even turning down the combat difficulty to easy) to get through the story and finish the game. The story and writing is pretty underwhelming, and a bunch of side characters die for no reason. You're probably better off playing Uncharted or The Last of Us."

There is sense of an adventure in every corner of the world.Survival element is fun part of the game. You need to craft weapons and items to survive the wilderness. There are lots of predators that you need to look out for like bears, wolfs, leopards and cougars. Predators are hard to take down so you need to play tactically.There are lots of different way you can approach a situation when you encounter enemies. This makes the game fun. Stealth is very good in this game compared to Tomb Raider 2013. AI is smart, when they discover the dead body they alert the other guys and they then start to search for you.Environment sounds are great and Great voice acting by Camilla Luddington.Lots of weapons and gears to choose from. You can be a rambo with bow and arrows. There are different type of arrows to choose from like fire, poison and explosive arrows.Graphics is awesome. This is one of the best looking games I've played.Character animations and Facial Expressions are so life like that it is feel like you are watching a movie.Side missions and Optional tombs are very good. There are lots of optional challenge tombs in the game that make this game a true tomb raider experience. Puzzles in the tombs are very well balanced. They are not to hard but not so easy too.Challenges and collectibles give this game some replay ability.Lots of achievements which allows you to experience the game in different ways if you like to 100% the game.Story is very good. There are documents to find that allows you to dive in to the lore of the game further.DLCs are great. You can modify the experience of DLCs using cards.Optimization is great but to MAX it you need newer hardware.ConsNothing I can find.If you haven't played this game yet then you are missing a masterpiece. I give this game 10/10."

3948,RESENTMENT,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RSNTM3NT/,1,,1,14.8,July,"9,",261,0,1,"TL;DR:Good game, minor issue, played it four times on two different platform. Played it here for achievements.Previously played on Xbox and Epic and beat it four times. Uhhh, got the game twice. One here on Steam and the other is at Epic, the latter have all the DLC and the sequels for FREE. In this reboot, you still played as Lara Croft, an archeologist that ended up in a stranded island filled with Japanesse Warrior, protecting the sun queen. Your goal is to rescue your friend Sam after being kidnapped by the cult of the island who aims to resurrect the bloody queen.With it being the same as any Tomb Raider games, you shoot & kill enemies. This time, it is RATED M for Mature. So, violence is harsh! Yea. You use pistol, arrow, pickaxe, rifle and shotgun fighting against numerous enemies and gathered resource to craft a frickin' weapon. In addition to that, you climb up walls, God of War style. solve puzzles and collectibles.This is easily one of the most unique Tomb Raider ever created by Crystal Dynamics and they take this approach quiet well. From it's story, gameplay and themes. From action-adventure to action-survival game. Also Camilla Luddington (actress playing Lara) should be given a raise for being struck with a branch, death by sharpened crates and killed in numerous ways. That is a true woman, g0ddamn!The cons for this game was it's bugs that kind of ruined the gameplay vibe. The game suffers from poor scalling issue, because the UI sort of gone and QTE doesn't show prompts. But one of the BIGGEST dipSh!t is the designer of Crystal Dynamics who made a tomb part of the area (specifically, the Wind Puzzle in Mountain Village). Man, that sh!t is broken and whoever decided to make that puzzle bloody difficult after 14 tries, I hope you are in the bloody ground, cause that sh!t's hard and it's not fun. It's broken as hell!Either go get it ON SALE or claim it for free on any platforms you give a sh!t, maybe soon.8.4/10"

I originally played this game when it came out on the PS3, now I played through it again on PC. I remember watching my parents play the original games on the PS1 since my dad loved the old Tomb Raider games. While I played the PS1 games and the legend trilogy, this was the first iteration of the games I really got into. Replaying it now on PC, it still holds up for the most part. The exploration is still fun with plenty of treasures and journal entries to find, which are narrated which is nice. The optional tombs are my favourite part by far, with the only downside being they are over very quickly. Its something they did better in the sequels as Rise is my favourite of the reboot trilogy. The story is okay for the most part, the side characters do get fleshed out a bit through the journals but I didn't care about them as much aside for Roth. Lara is cool in this version. She is a little annoying in the beginning when she cries whenever she kills a animal or bad guy, but by the end you really get a sense she's turned into a badass. As for negatives, the QTEs are very annoying in this game, since this was the era in gaming where developers shoved them into every game and its incredibly annoying. Most of the deaths I had were through QTEs that I didn't press in time. Also annoyingly on the PC version they don't label the button prompts with the buttons you map like 'E' or 'F', so in the beginning I had to figure what the buttons were. The combat overall is okay, as I used to it as a kid. Now I find the enemy encounters to be more annoying as most of the time I just wanted to explore and find more secrets only to be shot at by annoying enemies. There is also no dual pistols in this game, they tease you at the end, but we never got to use them in the sequels which I honestly don't get why Crystal Dynamics refuse to do it. Overall though this a solid reboot of the franchise and a worthwhile game to play or revisit."

Only downsides to note I'd say after completing this, I still miss many parts of the older tomb raider series. This feels more like a hand held adventure, similar to many games these days, with the ol' Tomb Raider's you were left on your own more and it felt more of a puzzle adventure which was more fun. A lot of areas feel rather similar and the tombs you discover are normally simple puzzles that can be completed in under 5 mins each. They are also ""bolted on"" rather than feeling like part of the base game.Pretty great graphics even in 2022 and runs at a nice 140fps all maxed out with a 3060 Ti @ 1440p."

But I did really like how they tied in the secrets hidden throughout the map into the story line- very nice touch.3) The gameplay is easily the strongest part here. I can basically overlook all negatives cause the combat and exploration were very smooth and well done. With the large number of upgrades you can earn throughout your playthrough, you can change between many different playstyles.Overall, the game was very nicely made."

Tomb Raider was ok, but that's about it.The gameplay was decent and graphics are pretty good to considering the age of this game, but what really held the game back was the story. The story had its moments of fun, intensity, and emotion here and there, but overall it was bland. Most things I did felt like a task and I never felt like getting to the next portion of the game. That, alongside moments of terrible writing and poor plot decision, left a sour taste in my mouth. Of course it does have lots of content, so if you do end up really liking the core gameplay, you'll have alot of stuff to do and fill your time.Get Tomb Raider on sale - I wouldn't recommend anything more. If you want a better experience get Rise of the Tomb Raider, the games are nearly identical, but RTR has a better story."

I personally have really mixed love-hate feelings about it. Laras' Character is totally different from the Classic or even L/A/U Games, and she is supposed to be young, fragile, relatable ect. which on paper sounds already like a total different person then the badass, independent strong female character from the classics. In this Game, this Lara is basically the opposite of the original Lara Croft. No Braid, no shorts, no double pistols (???) and no acrobatics. Lara is constantly goes ""it is all my fault"" which gets really annoying.Overall the Game doesn't feel like Tomb Raider. Instead of the amazing silence with subtle iconic music every once in a while, you have music playing constantly. And since when did Tomb Raider become more of a Shooter than a puzzle Platformer ? Lara kills HUNDREDS of Humans in this Game. For example in the original TR she only kills around 3. And even when they were bad, she really doesn't like killing and only does it if she really has to. But not 21 year old Reboot-Lara. She kills for the first time, then cries about it for 5 Minutes, then for the rest of the Game kills LOADS and LOADs of Humans. She basically is a psychopath at this point. Ofcourse, the devs tried to make a ""Island-Survivor"" story, which could work for a tripple AAA Game, but they really drifted apart from what TR actually was. A Game about a british Women who felt trapped in the british High Society, and after a plane crash in the Himalayas she rethinks her whole life and searches for a Life full of Adventure. Her Parents disown her, yet she still does what she wants. Sounds pretty badass, right ? Well, a women can do what she wants, wear shorts (and yes, look sexy) and still be fricking badass. No need to be ""relatable, fragile and realistic"". Heck yes i want to shoot Dinosaurs while doing backflips in a lost Valley in the search for an ancient artefact just because for the thrill of Adventure ! No ""following my Fathers footsteps ect.""Well, this was my lovely little rant about how to NOT reboot a beloved and successful Franchise.I really don't want to make you think that the Game sucks 100%. (Well....maybe 75%) If you are a fan of Uncharted, Shooter Games and Games ""made to play for everyone"" this Game is for you. If you want to see your badass independent strong british archaeologist, rather play one of the earlier TR Games.Thank you a lot for reading though :)"

Boy was that a mistake.I grew up loving the adventurer genre, my childhood saturated with Indiana Jones films and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of similar animated stuff that i couldn't remember if you placed a gun to my head. Growing up enamored with Indy has he swung around chasing artifacts and near death experiences with God knows whatever the old man is chasing.But Lara Croft? I didn't really see her as an adventurer. For me she was a sex symbol and something more of a James Bond type. I guess it was a product of my first exposure to Lara which was the Tomb Raider movie with Angelina Jolie. With my mother probably regretting having to expose my 9 year old eyes to Angelina Jolie's side boobs and bare ass.But that was Lara for me, an action hero. So it did take a while for me to get into Tomb Raider 2013. Cause in my head, I had better spy action games to play.Little did I know, there was a masterpiece hiding in my Steam Library. This is an amazing game, from the Level Design, to the Narrative and of course the Gameplay. Everything meshes very well, from the way the game progresses and introduces new gear to how the simple mundane act of leveling up shows Lara's growth as a freaking Jungle John Mcclane (I think that's just Rambo). This chick is badass, and I'm not saying that cause I fell inlove with her tight ass, beautiful thighs and well rendered cleavage (Cammilla Luddington did a great job with the voicework here by the way). The game really ties into how the island they're stuck in, is forcing Lara to grow and evolve into the badass Tomb Raider we all grew up with. And she really does turn into that  Tomb Raider. But since it's a 2010s game, she is a ruthless brutal killer and all.I'd say more but I haven't really written much and am running out of juice. buy game, game good, Lara cool, Lara pretty, Lara kills"

4028,Bubbleslou,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057100282/,1,,1,8.8,January,"13,",234,0,1,"A different take on ""tomb raiding"".I have been a Tomb Raider / Lara Croft fan since the first (original) game came out in 1996. The 2013 reboot (or prequel, depending on how you look into these things) is quite good, I originally played it on the Xbox 360 and since it has been very cheap on Steam I decided to pick it up again.This game runs REALLY well and looks really good- I am able to get a consistent 144fps on my laptop on the normal recommended settings. I forgot how well it played- when I originally played it on the Xbox 360 it was abit blurry and choppy but obviously the PC version is the best version to play.For the game itself I am abit mixed- this is the weakest of the trilogy I might add - Lara seems very different to the Lara we all know and grew up with back in the day. I understand this is meant to take place before she actually becomes the ""Tomb Raider"" because if anything; the tombs you encounter in this game are entirely optional and are not needed to progress in the story. The map is a nice size- not big as to where it feels overwhelming but not too small where you feel like you're seeing the same thing over and over again. You can fast travel to different parts of the map; which is helpful if you are trying to find all the treasures and GPS caches.I've not played the multiplayer yet so I can't comment on that unfortunately.If you like simple action and adventure games then I do highly recommend this!"

Not that bad of a game, it had its moments, shoot everything that moves, moments of scenry if you are still awake.  2008 graphics. Very straight forward action. side tombs availible to raid and figure out their puzzles/ defuse their booby traps. Bought it for $3 on the aniversery.

4050,Quartermoon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/quartermoon/,1,,1,48.4,December,"27,",389,0,1,"The first of Crystal Dynamicses survivor trilogy, Tomb Raider 2013, is a fantastic adventure game that I liked a lot, but it shies away from being a Tomb Raider game. It looks to games like Uncharted for inspiration instead of its own series past. Ironic when you consider that games like Uncharted were clearly inspired by Tomb Raider. What you get with TR 2013 is a more rounded and broad adventure than Core's TR games, and finally introduces a proper combat system that's fun, rather than something you just wish was over so you can get back to solving a puzzle.When I think of Tomb Raider I think of lonely tombs and giant puzzle box levels with Lara bringing them to life, death always just a misjudged jump away. Combat was always a secondary concern in those older games, and not very good. Lara would auto aim and you just sort of jumped around and waited for the target to die, often unable to avoid taking at least some damage. In TR 2013 the priorities have switched: now we have impactful cover shooting and brilliant bow-and-arrow stealth, but spending hours in dusty tombs is a thing of the past.The tomb raiding is reserved for puzzle tombs that are - almost apologetically - optional. They're great, though. This time around the puzzles are physics based, with counter weights; pulleys; control of fire, electricity, and water; and lots of arrows and rope. They're fun, but incredibly brief. You'll be in and out of them in a few minutes. If you're anything like me, you'll be wishing they were an hour longer. You'll find nothing like St. Francis' Folly here. Not even close.But what you do get to do is fun. The game has a moreish metroidvania approach, with new equipment giving you access to new and old areas. Climbing, jumping, and swinging is all decent. It's not as stripped back as something like Uncharted, nor is it as demanding as the older games. It's a little too obvious where you need to go, so you'll never find yourself asking ""Can I make that jump?"", which is something I miss, but there are plenty of goodies and challenges hidden away that you'll enjoy engaging with. You certainly will sometimes be asking ""How do I get to that thing on the map? There's no ladder! Perhaps I'm missing something..."". The game is structured of linear mission areas that are all well done and often exciting, and large open areas that you can clamber around and explore at your leisure. It all looks wonderful, too, even in 2021. It tells a good story, and Lara is very well voiced and likeable, as are the other characters.I've played this game to 100% completion several times over the years. It has an essence of Tomb Raider and a lot of heart. It's clear the developers love TR, but perhaps they were a little too eager to please everyone and a little too shy about embracing TR's past. It isn't until Rise, and even more so in Shadow, that the developers leaned more heavily into tombs and puzzles. However, TR 2013 is a great adventure that shouldn't be dismissed as an Uncharted rip off. It has its own identity and feel, and more involved traversal than that game. Still, you'll have to replay Tomb Raider 1996 or Crystal's wonderful Anniversary to satisfy your tomb raiding urges."

I started with shadow of the tomb raider and worked backwards to this game. The appeal of the tomb raider games for me is really about the progression of Lara’s abilities and weapons, and exploring the game world. I am going to try my best to think of this game as it’s own entity though, rather than a part of a series. Tomb Raider has always been about exploring ruins and ancient settings Indiana Jones style. The climbing and platforming used to explore those locations is really nothing special though, especially since the island you explore isn’t very interesting in terms of atmosphere. The game really shines with its puzzles and combat in my opinion. The puzzles are often inside of the tombs and ruins you explore, and everytime I get to one it always makes me think more than I would if it was just more climbing. The tombs might be the best sort of the game if you ask me, they give the game its identity and it wouldn’t be nearly as fun if they didn’t exist in it. The gunplay and combat is really fun, even if it is a bit on the simplistic side. Guns feel good to use, but show little impact on enemies. There is four guns, each of them feeling different from the others. The bow has kind of become a staple of the tomb raider reboot trilogy and it deserves that, it is probably the most complex weapon in the game. It feels good to one shot an enemy with a charged shot and it deserves to be recognized for being a truly fun and iconic weapon in my opinion. The last thing I want to talk about is the story. The story is this game is good, nothing more, nothing less. Lara is awesome as always, one of my favorite protagonists. Seeing her grow into the battle hardened killer she is by the end but still retain her curiosity and empathetic nature is really entertaining! The suggested relationship between her and Sam is really cute and I wish that we got to see more of it in the sequels. It’s a very cinematic story, it’s most memorable moments are those in which Lara is put into intense situations. We get to see her be vulnerable and it is really easy to empathize with her and just overall connect with her as a character. She grows throughout the story and it is exciting to not know what she’s gonna do after this adventure is done. I think that the strength of tomb raider has always been the gameplay, which is just as exciting as always, but this game surprised me with its engaging story and I loved it. If you have an interest in this game I cannot recommend it enough."

The whole scheme of the game which most notably is Puzzles, Traversing/Platforming and Combat is fun but personally became a bit repetitive at times (maybe because Puzzle/Platforming games aren't my go to). For a game made in 2013 the graphics hold up very well and the visuals of the world are actually very good. The sound design and effects are very well done and the overall story itself was enjoyable but I personally wasn't captivated during my playthrough and likely wouldn't play it again. The combat and upgrading your 4 main weapons was good fun and the one main refreshing thing in this game was the gore. I feel more and more games are distancing themselves from it and the melee kills, cinematics and especially Lara's own death cutscenes are often filled with much blood and gore (Lara's death scenes can be pretty brutal). I couldn't find a Multiplayer game so reviewing that is out of the question. Bug wise I faced a few issues with the aspect ration being slightly zoomed in and random crashes which was kinda annoying at times, also the collectibles in this game were actually decent but still felt like a chore to complete all of them including the challenges. Overall this game was a great pickup for the couple dollars I paid for it, and I recommend it to anyone who has or hasn't played Tomb Raider games - or that style of game before - 7.5/10"

I do recomend the game at a discount, I bought it during the steam halloween sale for around 5€. The graphics are awesome when considering they are from 2013.

It has sections of stealth, action, puzzles and survival which is quite fun. The game weighs a little more on the action which can get a little exhausting. I think they could've paced the different sections in a much more balanced way but thats just nitpicking. Most important thing I noticed is that the climbing is much much less frustrating compared to previous games. The game feels very polished and thought out. The ending was a little underwhelming but it was a blast to complete this beast. 8.8/10"

This was the first game I have played in the series, and I think it was good overall.~{ Story }~The story was pretty good. It had plenty of intense, interesting, and shocking moments. The game's first few minutes were strong, and atmospheric. And the ending left me satisfied and with a desire to play the next title in the series at some time in the future. At times I found that the story didn't keep me as invested in it as I would have liked to be. But this was usually fixed by an interesting moment in the plot or by reading a diary entry that added mystery or backstory to the places, events, or characters.I think that the characters were good. Especially Lara, the protagonist. She’s awesome, and a true action hero. And the story did a good job putting you into her shoes. It also did a fine job introducing and explaining the relationships between characters. The antagonist on the other hand had room to be fleshed out more in my opinion. And I was a little disappointed that we didn’t get to see more of the queen and interact with her more. ~{ Gameplay }~The gameplay was fun. Puzzle solving was good, climbing and traversing the world felt dangerous and intense, finding collectables let you explore the environments in fun ways, and the combat was good for what the game is. One of the things I enjoyed most was finding artifacts around the world. And through that learning a little about different ancient cultures.~{ Graphics }~The graphics look great. And they hold up well to the time of this review.~{ Music }~The music did a good job creating atmosphere. That intern immersed me in the settings and story.  ~{ Conclusion }~In conclusion this game is a lot of fun. And it does a good job of putting you into the shoes of an action-adventure hero."

4128,Sorrow the Monk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sorrowthemonk/,2,,1,31.4,October,"21,",752,0,1,"How about a spoiler-free bulletpoints type of review?-There is so much to explore, levels are full to the brim with tons and tons of collectibles and many challenges -got to say, some of them are annoying though- it actually overwhelmed me at the start but I just wanted to 100% every area so I came back after finishing the story and mostly enjoyed my time finishing the remaining challenges and finding documents and relics, just, again, some of the challenges were a bit tedious and I ended up firing a guide up to help me out but you can figure almost everything on your own I believe, I'm a dumbnuts after all.-Graphics don't really show their age honestly, and in some places the game looks simply gorgeous with everything turned up to Ultra settings.-Controlling Lara was a blast, as I unlocked more attribitues she became way more agile and nimble and I just ended up jumping/rolling most of the time to go from one place to another just for the fun of it.-Overall writing, characters and the story was solid. Boasted with some quality voice acting, sound effects and mostly enjoyable bombastic action scenes -just some of them felt too bombastic for their own right in my opinion- it just ended up being a pleasant experience throughout. -Combat was generally fun but enemies didn't really pose much of a challenge, it added up to the feeling of turning from the hunted to an outright vicious predeator but it felt too easy on Normal difficulty apart from some mini-bosses who were mostly balanced according to the difficulty and were fun to go against.-I expected more and slightly harder puzzles, most of them felt like a breeze and were physics-based ones. Maybe a riddle here and a cryptic one to decipher there would've helped. Don't get me wrong some of those physics based puzzles were creative enough to be fun but maybe they could've added more?-I found the interface a bit weird. Again, creativity shines and they sure do look different from other, flat and uninspiring ones from other games but sometimes I didn't understand a button prompt and failed a part a couple of times. It was slightly annoying.-The direction of the mostly shaky-cam cutscenes gave me a headache (I blame you Cory Barlog), I basically got a continuous minor head-ache for the first 4-ish hours, tried to change any and all non-necesarry camera effects, that ended up not affecting the cutscenes but I got used to everything after a while.-The game's atmosphere was mostly superb, sometimes it was way more terrifying than most horror games sometimes really gave the feeling of being the historian/adventurer/extraordinare Lara is on her way to become. But maybe it could've used a different color palette for some of the levels but at the end it has a really detailed and greatly designed world, which of course -arguably- almost is the biggest factor when it comes to a good atmosphere. -Sometimes I felt it became too dark and gritty but I also understand it is done to really kick in and solidify the whole ""Lara is a true survivor!"" thing so not really a big issue with me.-I'm not the biggest fan of upwards level design -I'm a boring guy who likes their levels plain and boring, sue me- but I still ended up having a good time with every level.If you ended up passing this one and hopped straight into the newer titles, honestly you can come and try this one out, it is just as good as them I'm sure and it is a pretty solid game on its' own right. It's not that old and is pretty enjoyable."

It was my way of playing an Uncharted-like game without owning a Playstation, and I feel good about it.In this game, you have a very inviting, beautiful environment. It's immersive how you can interact with the environment and how it presents itself around you. The music and sound effects are very well done and adds heavily to the immersive experience too. I really did enjoy how everything steadily built up from a sort of ""innocence""  and you were there to be a part of that. On that note, I do agree & disagree with other reviewers in saying that her personality doesn't fully match the actions of killing. Lara naturally seems like a person who would rather avoid hurting people, let alone killing people if she had to--she's not an angry individual, she's a curious adventurer, and the biggest thing that I find reflects that is in her voice. The fighting aspect is in the nature of the game so it really doesn't bother me. But based on her personality, the only thing I felt didn't suit her was the level of brutality in some of the fighting. Perhaps the aggressive style was to simply appease being intense, or to prepare for the next two games, but that I'll have fun discovering soon! Otherwise, the gameplay was amazingly fun!Also, besides part of the game being between tombs and not, the discoverable tombs are all optional and the puzzles are easy to complete. They're fun to just discover and to see/feel the environments you go into. The world is also a partial open world. You can fast-travel if you want to go back somewhere, and some of the spots you can even just travel back through because they link in some way. It's great knowing you can always go back if you miss something because it's not super linear.I enjoyably sunk 20hrs on the hardest difficulty into the game and am only 98% finished (I like finding the secrets). The length of play for me felt fine enough knowing that there are other games afterwards. And the level of difficulty was a fair challenge for the sake that you try to find the most efficient way to get through the game and it feels satisfying when you utilize those options. As well, they have an upgrading feature in the game for your equipment & survival and I highly recommend that if you want to maximize potential--it's worth the effort.If you haven't played it, I recommend doing so if you find something like this intrigues you. It's fun and engaging. Beautiful and cinematic. Scary (at times) and intense. Lara is great and I'm glad this game is too!I'm super excited to play the next game now!!!"

It has an excellent storyline, great combat mechanics, challenging puzzles and is generally very fun to play. I'd particularly recommend to those who enjoy puzzles and finding collectables as there's plenty of time dedicated to doing those things. The only let down for me were the characters, they could have been developed further as you feel no emotional attachment to them. Apart from that, I highly recommend... especially when it's on sale for £2. An absolute bargain."

But I ended up having fun with it from start to finish! The combat and weapons in this game were fun to play around with, and as a person who's really in to history, the setting was right up my alley. Discovering each tomb and relic really felt like an accomplishment, I just wish there was more of it.The quick time events can be a real pain though, and the button to dismount ropes was never given a prompt (it's shift, had to look it up).Poor Lara can't catch a break in this game, so it was nice to see her turn from an archeological prospect to the Tomb Raider she's famous for. If you're a fan of the OG games, the duel-pistols will be teased a couple times throughout the story. I'm also impressed with how well this game ran on my computer (that might be because it's an older game, but still)!9/10, will play the sequel when I get around to it."

My time is low due to a new account but at this point I'd say I have about 80 hours total in the game. The combat is actually pretty fun once you find the flow of it, especially the bow combat once you get use to the aim and how it works. Once every weapon is upgraded you just simply feel the need to swap back and forth to unleash your full bad ass rage like your up in here like Doom. The weakest part was probably some of the crew member's rotational animations while they stand doing the same mechanical action over and over, just a very slight immersion killer I noticed. The story itself at times got a little wonky since in the start you're here to believe that, ""Oh this is a reboot, everything seems realistic!"" Then comes the supernatural parts - while interesting, but then you're like, ""lol guess I should of saw that coming."" There's plenty of moments where you feel like your running for your life when you get fully immersed and its actually just complete fun and awesome. The oddest feeling I've had while playing this game is the amount of things Lara went through, and weirdly enough it comes back to you like, man, good voice acting or something. Hardest difficulty isn't really a thing, sure you die a couple times but as a scale of difficulties, it seems like it wasn't a prime focus, at least combat wise. Personally in all my story runs, I've noticed whenever I reached a large beach area in the game, I'd lose motivation to play but only for a very short time. I think because large area, more ground I gotta OCD over, lmao. Easy 5/5 star game for me."

I really don't want those achievements that can only achieve if you play the online game mode, and some of the achievements are really annoying and almost impossible to get (I'm not that patient when it comes on doing a specific task) - To follow-up the first thing I don't like, the online is not that active anymore - The game is very short for it's worth, I recommend you buy this on sale (I got this when it was 80% sale)"

It shows how she started as an innocent woman and throughout the game she slowly starts to become Lara Croft the survivor.The game's controls are easy to learn and use. Combat is fun and gives you multiple ways of killing enemies. This game is also cinematic, which I love! The cut-scenes are well put together and full of action. The games actual story line is pretty short IMO, it only took me 16 hours on my first run to finish it, but on my second run it only took me like 2-3 days. 100%ing the game is also really easy, but can be boring and tedious, it only took me 36.6 hours in all of my 2 playthroughs to 100% the game. My first run I just completed the story line and stopped playing, but my second playthrough I 100%ed it. The game allows you only 4 weapons, but you can upgrade the hell out of them, which is awesome! I didn't purchase any of the DLC or play the multiplayer (yes there is one believe it or not), but you can change Lara's outfit in single-player and play other characters in multiplayer.Overall this game was really enjoyable and fun for me! It's also the game that got me hooked on the Tomb Raider series.8/10"

I have to say that the balance between cut scenes and actual game play was well put.

From cut scene to combat, you feel like you are in the game itself because , creating a sense of urgency and danger. Skipping scenes is possible, but if its your first or second play-through, do so at your own peril because Lara will go from chilling at a campfire to being mobbed by ten dudes with assault rifles! The game hasn't aged as well as I hoped - with a few weird moments during cut scenes that I don't remember being there before, but nothing game breaking with frequent auto saves preventing any frustration from them.  Also a little light on the side character development (obviously pretty hard to flesh them out since you play exclusively as Lara). One small, irritating, and easily fixed mistake is no option to turn tutorials off. In a game with hidden items, tombs, and achievements dotted all over the game world, plus the ability to fast travel between locations, it's extremely irritating to be prompted to head for the objective over and over again when you're taking a stroll looking for goodies. I've been a fan of Tomb Raider since I watched my bro play TR3 (I think) on PC when I was about 12. I just thought to myself ""now  is a badass woman!"". This title is almost nothing like the old TR from back then, yet I still love it and I think giving Lara an origin story was a very smart move. I haven't played multiplayer as it's not really my thing, but I highly recommend the single player mode to any who enjoy action adventure with a slice of story. Easy and normal modes are also a fantastic option for those seeking a more immersive story driven experience."

Lara Croft is back in a grittier and bloodier adventure where she and her archaeological team get ship wrecked to the mysterious island of Yamatai in their search for the Sun Queen and more when things go from bad to worse with scavengers and more forcing them to brutal survival scenarios in a fight for their lives!! A true test of Lara's capabilities that will make her a hardened survivor in a mythical island filled with more then just crazy cultists!! Tomb Raider 2013 is now more of an action-adventure game then mostly puzzles while the action-adventure takes point the puzzles are still there and are decent. They aren't tear your hair out kinds of complexity but they're be a bit too easy for old school fans either way are fun albeit short and a bit spaced out from each other. If they aren't optional tombs which comprises most of the puzzle content its parkour puzzles to navigate through for the story or to reach this or that collectable. Instead of being large sandbox levels its using Hub-&-Spoke model with varying themes for each level like Tomb Raider Underworld. Levels are either linear or open sometimes even a mix inbetween but each area feels like a new place to explore and look great while being not so much of a jog to reach one place or another but will sometimes require your parkour to traverse so its fun too. Gameplay is similar to Tomb Raider Anniversary and Legends for parkour with different tools to help you traverse or overcome varying obstacles like rope arrows and a climbing axe. You can also use stealth automatically when enemies are nearby like from Tomb Raider The Angel of Darkness though this feature is sometimes inconsistent but opens up stealthy takedowns. Taking cover is also automatic if enemies are nearby though compared to stealth is more consistent. Gunplay is more of your traditional Third Person Shooter feeling much more tighter and precise then before. Melee is a thing now with upgrades for you to counter and stun foes for a finishers. You can use the environment for more ways to dispatch your target too. Even if you only have 5 weapons as you progress and find salvage resources/parts you'll be able to upgrade your current arsenal. Each weapon also has alternate firing modes after upgrading them like a burst fire for the pistol or different ammo types for your bow. Lara also earns Xp to unlock more active and passive skills/abilities that add more depth to the gameplay particularly the combat. A new instincts mode is also available only being able to be utilized staying still and not in water with this new feature it will show hints to puzzles, story, collectables even enemies so it maybe a good or bad thing depending on you. QTE's are in-game but they're used in a cinematic way or to avoid getting killed though at times it gets kinda annoying. There are scenarios where Lara has to escape from danger so are played in a fixed cinematic camera angle where you have to parkour properly or die trying. Decent enemy variety with engaging combat as the AI will attempt to flank you, flush you out of cover, hide and etc. though accuracy really depends on enemy type. Collectables are easy & fun to find for the most part also give more lore plus you dont have to collect them all before you finish the story cause you still get to explore all the areas you unlocked to get achievements and/or to know the whole story and even to unlock concept art and renders. There's an interesting multiplayer mode with the gameplay it has incase you wanna play more though you need to buy the dlc to have more characters, modes and maps to fight in cause a bit lacking with stock content. They did great work with the visuals its very cinematic, immersive wherever you go plus its animations too are very visceral, brutal and weighty. Audio is ok but Soundtrack is kinda hit or miss there's good tracks but only a couple. The game runs very smooth and looks great only using up 12GB of space. I only got around 2-3 crashes not sure what caused it but i had to restart my game to get it working again. She's not the same Lara Croft of the original series but this is one heck of an amazing action-adventure that brought the legend back for both old and new fans in a more bad-ass cinematic modern light. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat with never a dull moment a must buy for both action-adventure fans and both old & new Tomb Raider fans alike!!!"

When this game was released I liked the trailer and saw the positive reviews, so I though I should give it a try, without expecting much... however I got blown away. This is surely one of my favorite games now, the graphics are awesome, even after so much later after the release, it is well optimized, but most of all I like the different approach. The realistic move of the character, the voice, the great environments and small details, also this being the first game as far Is I know that every single hair is moving separately. It was really intriguing finding all the relics and listening to all of the documents which added to the great story. I hope the second part is as good as this one."

The details in the game are pretty good but not amazing, which I prefer as to a certain point saving on storage is better than having a hyper-realistic environment. Only thing I would like to add in is that I was confused during the beginning when you're stuck under a rock and kicking the man away. When the circle came up to indicate a certain button needed to be pressed, I didn't know what I had to do so after around 10 replays I needed to search up that the f key needed to be pressed. Overall, solid 7.5/10 game, not absolutely amazing but would recommend."

4287,Juzefai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/juzefai/,1,,0,13.1,May,"31,",46,0,1,"I could not play the game, becasue of the shaky camera. It was wobbly even during sitting still cut-scenes, causing motion sickness. Did not expect that from a third person game. There is also no current fix.------------------Update ----------------------------After googling for an hour or so, I found the Yamatai patch. It is a hacker thingy, but with it the game is now playable. Only the cut-scenes feel like Hollywood hired some drunks to film them on hand-held smartphones. The graphics sure are beautiful, but sadly had to enjoy with all the shaking.Overall the game does not feel like a classical Tomb Rider. The creators are trying to re-invent the series. If this is good or bad, I think is more personal preference. The game is not bad, not bad at all.Personally I think here is too much ''RIDER'' and too little ''TOMB''. It lacks the thing I call ''romance of archeology and new discovery''. The game compensates this with lots of action and ''see bad guy - shoot bad guy or blow him up''. Blood, blood everywhere folks.Sometimes I wish, the game would give more breathing room between the action. After almost dying a few times, Lara almost dies some more. After the fifth near death experience, the sixth in the row makes you just deadpan ''sigh, here I go again.'' or ''meh, seen worse. Let's just get this over with, shall we?'' There is so much drama, you just stop feeling it after some time. Things that kept you on the edge the first few times they happened, stop being effective. I think if there were more leisure moments, for example Lara looking for some soap to wash of all the blood (a persistent thought I get every time Lara hits the dirt, flying debris, mud or takes a swim in blood rivers), the action that comes after a respite would be felt stronger, because of contrastAll in all, game is good, but I would not recommend it for the faint of heart. The shock factor is ... shocking, but story wise it is quite lacking. The villains are a one dimensional ''evil cult'', no more. I keep marveling at how bad Lara's karma is.Personally I call this ''little girl suffering simulator - road to bad ass''.It is fun to play, but will tire you out."
4288,ElfKnight,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141228856/,1,,1,62.0,May,"29,",429,0,1,"This is one of the better action-adventure games.  One of the best in my opinion.  It is so beautiful and well-done that it still provides enjoyable and immersive play eight years later.  It only takes about 15-20 hours to finish it as a leisurely pace.  But this is brilliant.  The game only asks the player to spend the amount of time on it that it is willing to deliver a tightly packed dose of fun, action, and story.  It doesn’t try to keep the player grinding long after all the content is used up or even grind to unlock it.  It’s a story and you play through it.  It ends while it’s still a blast and you walk away having had a good time. As far as the story goes, the characters are just as campy and the plot as straightforward as you would expect, but this is Tomb Raider.  It’s supposed to be like that.  All said, they did a great job and the interactions are deeper and more heartfelt than I had expected (for what it is).  Some have bemoaned the character design change from ye olde days.  But honestly, besides being a bit thinner Laura looks like Laura in real, human form rather than goofy cartoon form.  The modeling and character design is great, especially for the year it was made.  There is some jankeyness with the environmental interactions as well as the animations, and there are some bugs although I only experienced a few minor ones.  So it’s not always as smooth a butter.Highly recommended."

And it does not get in the way, the harder puzzles to solve are optional content you can do for extra rewards.The only downside is the combat, more specifically the cover system, can get clunky sometimes but overall the action is still very fun.Very good game that you can clear in less than 15 hours, strongly recommend."

This game is magnificent! Truth be told I've never been much of a fan of archeology, sure I did watch some Indiana Jones' movies back in the day, but those didn't quite get through me, but experiencing it at hand feels somehow feels different than just watching. What follows is an intense set of minutes, where Lara has to crawl through dead bodies in an underground cave, badly injured, struggling to find freedom. This sets the tone for just about the entirety of Tomb Raider. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐰𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐠𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐢𝐬 𝐚 𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐠𝐠𝐥𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐥.

As the player progresses through the game, pieces of the puzzle of the island are unveiled, resulting in a satisfying climax. The game is brutal, scary, beautiful. It’s a perfectly crafted setting.Tomb Raider's story wasn’t central to its actual story. No, I didn’t have a stroke in the middle of that last sentence. Tomb Raider was a game about the survival of Lara and her crewmates. Everything else that happens, the various plot threads on the island, serve primarily as a complication for this survival. You could also argue that the story is in fact about Lara herself.

Thank You to who ever had the idea to reboot the franchise with this game, as a Tomb Raider fan i am more than happy.Pros - Story is amazing because it forces the game to happen, without Lara becoming The Tomb Raider in this game she would have never left the island, animations are fluid and smooth, likable side characters, lots of weapons with amazing costumization, a semi open world that connects it all really well, lots of different environments, the graphics look amazing, lots of good and well put together collectables, voice acting is fantastic, physics are superb, fun puzzle segments, soundtrack is great and gives the game a feel of adventure, there is never a dull moment (great pacing), brutal kill cams for when she dies and kills enemies, very welcome but unexpect gore, optional tombs to explore and overall the gameplay together is fantastic, from combat to exploration.Cons - Terrible subtitle boxes, truly awful, some unexpected bugs caused by the physics.Nitpicks - Wish there were more tombs to explore and that they were bigger in scale not difficulty, also wish we got the PS4 character model version for the PC version as an update or even DLC honestly.Final Verdict is a 100%. (Final Verdict varies from 10% to 100%)"

I never got around to it, mainly due to having a huge backlog of games. But a few days ago I was really in the mood for a narrative driven single player experience full of adventure and discovery and then I came across the Tomb Raider franchise while it was on sale this past week and I thought to myself "" Don't I have the first one somewhere?"" . And Yes I did, so I installed it (Only 11 Gigs!!?) ,  started playing yesterday and I was not disappointed. To be honest, there was this initial doubt if I would still enjoy this first installment in the rebooted series because of its age. After all, the game can be considered an old game by today's standards in terms of graphics and gameplay mechanics,. But those doubts quickly disappeared after the first hour of playing. Sure, the Quick Time Events feel linear and dated but otherwise this game does not disappoint in the story driven adventure department. It really feels like you're trying to survive through the game. The by now well known survival gameplay mechanics (scavenging, hunting, upgrading, etc.)  still hold up and work very well in the overall narrative of the game. It's pretty basic but for a action adventure game like this it's enough to make it feel well-rounded and fleshed out.All in all I'm glad I pushed myself to finally start to explore this ""new"" Tomb Raider franchise and experience the birth of Lara Croft and I recommend you do the same if it has been unplayed in your library as well."

Although, I played TR reboot 7 years back,this is the first time, I'm doing the collectables and optional tombs,hence hit 98% of the game.Upgraded Lara as well as her weapons to the fullest, too lazy to find out the rest of the items to finish the challenges other than that, it was a splendid 14hr journey on my second run.I played the old trilogy and as for the reboot version, I am yet to play Shadow, but I'm sure this will be my favorite one of all Tomb Raider games released as of yet.I go by this opinion because, in this Lara Croft is a professional raider as in the previous titles, in this one, she is a survivor, trying her best to survive, a perfect origin story to one of the best female characters ever.A Survivor is Born"

Thank you to FERAL Interactive, for bringing it to Linux!I really loved the stealth mechanics and the weapons modifications! Lara is great developed as a character and is one of the beast female protagonist I've come across in a game! I really like the fact that Lara is both scared and brave, which show a complex character. I also really liked the depressing atmosphere.Some cons, while Lara is greatly developed the other character are a bit single-dimentional. Also, the story could be a bit more complex. On the other hand, all the collectable notes you find, along with a good voice acting make up to you. Also, the game is a bit short, about 13 hours long to finish the ""main quest"", but is really fast pasing, imersive and full of content, so the density of these 13 hours, short of make up to you, too.Some technical stuff.. The game runs perfect on Kubuntu 20.04 in high graphic settings on my AMD RX580 GPU and AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU. Also, I recommend VSync to be set on triple buffering."

I didn't, however, get to into the enemy encouters and fights all too much. It wasn't bad but just mediocre. It was missing something to make it special and felt a bit stale as a result. There was an abundance of subplots you could discover by finding collectibles scattered throughout the map but I didn't connect with the game enough to care and find them. I'd just watch a video or something.I did enjoy what I played, though, and would definitely recommend it for people who like stories in games and exploring open worlds.

However, now I got a new shiny new 3080 GPU, I wanted to start playing Shadow of The Tomb Raider but I thought it would be a good idea to start from the beginning with Tomb Raider since it probably looks good at 4K even after all these years and I can also catch up with the story.I have never been a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series released in the 2000’s but I can say that overall I enjoyed playing this game and would recommend it to anyone who’s into adventure/action games. Keep in mind that my review comes 6 years after the original release date but here are my pro/cons:-No real dull moments: I got hooked from the beginning to the end-Even after all these years, visuals look great at maxed-out 4K settings.-Action & gameplay is good.-Platforming / jumping is fluid.-“Hunting” enemies with the bow really feels Commando-style ala John Matrix, especially when you nail those headshots.-Weapon upgrade / skill based system is not overwhelming but just enough to keep things interesting.Laura herself as a character has depth and believability. Definitely progressed over the original series (These nit-picks only stand out because the game is good so no big deal in the end!):-Although Laura is a powerful character, she keeps making “boneheaded” moves during certain cinematic or QME sequences. For example, why would any reasonable person try to walk down a slippery wet incline in a cave where you’ll 100% know you are going to slip and slide down? During these times, Laura feels less like John Matrix and more like John McClain! -Too many QME events with “death-defining” moments where Laura always lucks out just the right way so the experience becomes less believable. Like how many times is the character going to fall out of a breaking bridge just to land on something that happens to be there to break her fall? How many times can a person keep falling like Laura does and not break a bone unless the bones are made out of Adamantium?-The environment and story are great but “believably” again takes a hit due to some artistic choices made by the Devs. For example:  Now that I finished the game, time to move on to Rise of the Tomb Raider and then Shadow of The Tomb Raider!"

The graphics could be more polished and sometimes physics are weird. Also some gameplay aspects are too extreme to be real even for an action game. Killing hundrends of enemies while jumping around like superhuman sometimes feels wrong, i mean you are supposed to be an archeologist. I was expecting a puzzle solving/exploration focused game with less gun play and not that many action scenes but to be fair i enjoyed most of the game so i will leave a positive vote."

You come across a game called Tomb Raider and just the cover itself (though old and quite pixelated or just overall not the greatest in graphics) it draws you in. Now when I played my first ever Tomb Raider game as a teen I truly loved it for all that it was and had to offer, in fact I was always hyped for when they'd make more because I wanted more of it that bad. Okay now that you're caught up to my childhood roll time forward to now, here, 2020. I honestly only ever knew of other Tomb Raider games from youtube and watching youtubers play through it themselves while I sat back in my chair going ""Gee that looks so cool, I wish I could play it"" And well ladies and gentleman I finally did. Now that I finally have a decent graphics card I have been on a whole new world filled of pure happiness and enjoyment and I have to say Tomb Raider today, brought me the greatest of happiness.I'm the type of person that in all honesty usually skips through any storyline if I have the option too because I enjoy action, progress, achieving things more than I do just listening to a story BUT with this game from start to finish I was there through every cut scene, every emotion Lara felt, I was just that into it. I never truly knew what it felt like to physically put myself in the main character's shoes until I played this game. Everything was just breathtaking from atmosphere to even minor details and of course Lara too. Most breathtaking of it all has to be her. I have to say I am not HUGE on puzzle type of games but I sincerely enjoyed the puzzles this game brought along with the crafting of weapons and upgrading them. This game just brought back so much of my childhood and then some and it was truly AMAZING. I clearly could not get enough of it especially by all the screenshots I've taken of the game (Sexy Lara especially.. sorry not sorry ^.-) 10/10 recommend, 10/10 would raid tomb's and raid Lara's tomb again."

First time I checked this game out when I completed ""Uncharted trilogy"". I wanted MORE bravely adventures. There weren't such games those days, you know. TR2013 lived up my expectations fully!  Despite that fact I played PS3 version, I was greatly surprised by game setting, level/art-design, unstressed platforming/shooting/exploring. Even trandy RPG mechanics are implemented quite fine, they ain't annoying at least. I would say ""all the elements in harmony"". Someone can say ""clone of drake, drake with boobs"" but I don't give a damn about that. What disadvantages? Hmm, poor character formation; we're seeying Lara is a cutie young girl without balls and frags in one moment THEN in 10 minutes she becomes  RAMBO  who does hiroshima and NEEGAN-saki. Immediately. It's weird I know, lul.In conclusion I highly recommend this game if you're an uncharted lover like me. *five minutes for hate*Generally I've never liked the classical TR series. It made me suffer in my childhood. WORSTEST control, CANCER riddles, TERRIBLE level-design. It's anti-intuitive in additional with the ""best camera"". That's why I didn't appreciate SHADOW THE TOMB RAIDER. They might have wanted to make a game with an old game-design on modern rails but it smells  for me, sry"

Looks amazing (still in 2020), has a story arc over three games and most importantly: it plays very fun. The story admittedly has some ups and downs, but luckily tends much more on the ups-side. After all it must be noted: a Tomb Raider game is a game of climbing and discovery and that was reinvented perfectly here by Crystal Dynamics. Only downsides in my opinion are creative decisions for the whole reboot trilogy: - No signature dual guns (maybe later??)- Less and easier climbing than it should be (compared to the old stuff!)- Less love for the Croft Manor- No traveling around the world- Again a new origin story (kinda weak)- (also to the story: why )These are mostly just different flavors to the recipe, in the end the reboot trilogy itself is an absolut must for every gamer, starting with this gem!"

The story is decent and keeps you pumped for playing more. From my perspective, some parts of the story are not developed enough to the point where they would have make sense (for example, the wolves in the cages held for breeding - The game had two or three total interactions with them, and just the first one during the introduction made sense to me).Each combat situation you are facing has something new - from the most simple soldiers on the beginning, to the complex one with armors and rifles. You are given a multiple options to end the wave of the enemies - from the most casual one where you go all in with the weapons that you have, to the stealthy moments or blowing up the whole area with the explosive barrels around. While most of the mechanics are simple, you still have the feel of uneasiness while stretching the bow or shooting multiple times with the pistol. These small elements added in the game really give you an extra survival experience to all the action around you.Graphics is decent even on medium and fairly enjoyable to play and absorb the atmosphere.Although it is worth the price, but I would still recommend waiting for a sale to buy it."

4537,Unexpected,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theunexpectedprofile/,1,,1,30.2,November,"22,",401,0,1,"This is my first Tomb Raider game, so this review is from the point of view of someone who previously had zero experience with this franchise.In Tomb Raider, Lara Croft and her crewmates are stranded on an island after a thunderstorm and run into a mysterious cult. Lara has to explore the island while dealing with the cult to try to find a way out of the place.The story is simple at first, but there are interesting developments, and it's perfect for the kind of game it is: it feels like you're playing through an action movie and uncovering the secrets of a mysterious, faraway island. The atmosphere is great from beginning to end, especially with how gorgeous the graphics are.Gameplay-wise, you'll be traversing the land by jumping, climbing and using a variety of equipment, as well as fighting enemies with an increasing amount of weapons. Each new area feels fresh, introducing new mechanics and creative scenarios, as well as great setpieces.The game's objectives are linear, but there's a heavy focus on exploring big areas to find optional items, and you can always backtrack to previously-explored areas to get items you missed or to get items that were previously unnaccessible because you didn't yet have the necessary equipment to get to them. The exploration is fantastic and feels very rewarding; I constantly felt myself encouraged to go back to previous areas to explore and get extra EXP to spend on upgrades.All in all, Tomb Raider is a great action game, with a lot of variety that will keep you engaged from beginning to end, and a gorgeous world that is sure to keep you immersed throughout the entire adventure."

I restarted it, to check it a second time before leaving a review, and oh boy, it is still amazing! It is my favourite Tomb Raider (and even one of my favourite games).The graphics are still amazing (even 7 years after the game got released), the environment is beautiful and well designed. There is fore sure some epic scenery in this game. It’s just wonderful.The gameplay is extremely fluent and just huge fun. Discover the ancient world and the mountains, while fighting against loads of enemies and big bosses. Typical Lara Croft style.The story is compelling and almost forces you to keep playing. There is nothing bad I can say about this game. It is absolutely perfect, in my humble opinion.Definitely a must-play for every Lara Croft fan out there. I might replay this a second time one day."

The focus is decidedly not on the exploration/puzzles from previous entries but more on action, story and combat. That said, I still had a very good time and despite its age, it looks fantastic graphically speaking. The camera in the game is very well done, super immersive with the close shots in claustrophobic areas and some vertigo inducing angles when climbing high, though the shakiness can be annoying. It has a kinda B-movie plot but it's a decent origin story. However, like I said, it doesn't really feel like a TR game. There are very few puzzles and the tombs are ridiculously easy (always leave me with a ""is that it?"" feeling) and the island genocide committed by Lara is hilarious. The combat got a little tiresome by the end of the game as well and at first I was also really turned off by the amount of QTEs but I got used to them. Also, the cutscenes are really too tough on Lara, I know we can't expect realism from a game where gun shots are miraculously healed after resting for two seconds, but for some reason the injuries in the cutscenes seem worse. All in all, it's no quite what I expected but I have to say it's a very well made game and it's great fun to play."

I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the likes of Indiana Jones, or those who like a good supernatural adventure story. And definitely for Uncharted fans.It's good to see such a strong female character and such a great female led game."

Ryzen 3600 and 5700XT. Also I preferred controller play because it just felt smoother than M+KB.Graphics, story, and game play are all top notch. Nothing wrong with the characters but I never grew overly attached to any of them. They're just OK, not much depth to them. I enjoyed how easy it was to upgrade skills and weapons because you don't have to grind for materials or XP to get the majority of the upgrades, just playing should be enough. Fairly short game at 9 hours for me to complete the story and the game says I completed 72% since there's still some collectibles for me to find. Unless you're the type of person who wants that 100% there's no point. Overall great, fairly short, casual game that plays well and is a good time."
4643,Azuki-Tan,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198837900841/,1,,1,44.0,August,"21,",47,0,1,I got Tomb raider for like $5 and then let it sit in my library for almost half a year when I had nothing else to do I decided to play it. Whew! Tomb raider even though it revovles around mass murder has an amazing story and excellent graphics. I like all the relics and optional tombs it's something else to work on taking you away from the Solarii for a while. Great cut-scenes all though not exactly Black Mesa quality facial expressions. Seemless acting and the perfect actor for Mathias great model too. It's amazing how they keep Lara's hair from clipping through her without making it collide and bounce everywhere lol. Honestly one of my Favorite games in my library!
4644,Margrave of Ivrea,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eastphalen/,1,,1,30.7,August,"20,",68,0,1,"Excellent game. One of the best games I have ever played in my life. Literally, almost every aspect of it is close to perfection: the music, the story, the gameplay, the graphics, the environment, the world and so on. The only complaint I can find is the multiplayer component of the game, which is the worst part of it anyway, and second to that, maybe only the level of realism in terms of story. Other than that, truly, a work of art worthy of every prize there is in this industry.It is fascinating to me how a game released in 2013 manages to be so gorgeous, to look so much better than so many games released in the past couple of years. The perfect usage of light and shadow, the level of detail present in the texture of the game and the realistic images produced by the graphic engine is unreal. It is a delight merely to explore the environment, to stop and admire some landscape, or just to gaze at the Japanese architecture or the WW2 elements.Then there's also the music, which adds so much depth to the atmosphere of the game. It matches perfectly the events and the story, it adds a certain level of drama and beauty to the whole thing, the result is, obviously, an immersive and complete experience. It is such a rare occurrence to find a world created so skillfully as that of Tomb Raider's.The story is another element which must be discussed. Overall, it is a good story. A little too much drama for my taste, a little too unrealistic in terms of survival and overall cohesion. A little too much movie-like and dead.island-like. That being said though, it is a beautiful story which takes you into a skillfully crafted world. It makes you feel for the character, whenever Lara got hurt by an element of the environment, it almost made me feel that pain myself. You care about what happens with your character, you feel the same emotions as your character, you get to have the same desires as your character, to share her pain and desperation, to share the feeling of loss and hopelessness. It is amazing."

It's unfortunately not as open-ended and puzzle solving based as the classic games, and other than the main story that involves shooting bad guys and watching cutscenes; the only other content are collectibles that give you XP and more story exposition. I tried 100%-ing the game but just found it too boring since audio tapes just expand on the story that already is pretty forgettable.If you're looking for a good singleplayer game to sink a few days into for a reasonable price, you could do much worse than Tomb Raider."

What dissapointed me was this heavy oni was only boss fight at the end.... I thought there will be more fights with that giants, but sadly no. Another problem of this game is how easy it is. Starting normal was kinda stupid, normal was too ez. Hard is kinda ok, brings at least some challenge. I really like secret tombs, but I would expect bir more from them. They were not the easiest ones, but still quite easy. This game is pretty good to play stealth, but really good to play run and gun. Some of mods for your gun are amazing. I really like progress of Lara, it really felt to me like she is getting from young innocent Lara to survivalist Lara Croft aka Tomb Raider. Graphics for 2013 did not feel that good to me, plus I did not have 60 fps for whole game long, while having quite ok setup. Oh and I almost forgot about hair thingy in this game, yeeeeeeeah that was awesome. For me this game is easily 8,5/10.

Now started the new Tomb Raider trilogy and now I'm obsessed with the story telling that makes you feel emotionally tied to Lara. Was used to the normal running, shooting & raiding in tombs. It's a breath of fresh air with the new style(albeit I'm a bit late to the party). Double thumbs up."
4718,Zoom,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205498684/,1,,1,11.1,July,"7,",82,0,1,"7.5/10 overallAs a previous fan of Uncharted throughout childhood and someone who hadn't touched a tomb raider game, this pleasantly reminded me of Uncharted while also being a new experience.Graphics 9/10 : To start off, the graphics are amazing and simply looking at the environment around you is pretty enjoyable.Combat  and mechanics 7/10: The shooting and overall combat is pretty fun, on hard mode you die fairly quickly so you actually have to be strategical about when to shoot and when to use cover. As for the climbing it can be fun at times, but a lot of it is pretty automated. By this I mean it sort of guides for you when you jump instead of aiming. This means you have a lack of control sometimes of your character because so many of the movements are aimed for you. I'm also not a fan of when the game slows down and gives you a few seconds to press a button. I know this is common in games like uncharted as well, but it just feels like the game is handing you stuff when it does this.Bugs 5/10: I encountered honestly at least 10-12 bugs during my play through, some pretty minor and others actually resulting in having to restart the game because my character was stuck. This was pretty annoying overall and definitely a big flaw in the game.Story and characters 8/10: The story was great and reading all of the clues around the island that revealed more about it was pretty cool. This is definitely one of the shining aspects of this game. As for the characters I feel like they're a bit lack luster as I didn't feel much attachment to any of them besides Lara, but even she wasn't the best I've seen.Would recommend this game, especially for 3 dollars."
4719,Ampao,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198193162241/,1,,1,14.7,July,"7,",111,0,1,The game follows a very linear gameplay that does not feel redundant where it offers a variety of ways to explore and progress through the game. The open world aspect is implemented well to the point where it doesn't feel like its out of place and offers a side mission style route for players looking to discover more about the lore of the game.The game however falls short with its repetitive use of QTEs that were implemented in a way that made the game feel wonky. It may take time to get used to this aspect of the game but it never became a huge problem with gameplay.The gun mechanics and controls feel on point and shooting feels satisfying enough. You are given a variety of weapons to use depending on which style of gameplay you prefer use in certain parts of the game. The hunting aspect of the game feels misused and out of place that does not serve a big deal with how you play and can be totally left out on your gameplay.

The graphics are pretty for a 2016 game, the gameplay is good, and the fact that it's ""open world"" is also an added bonus, giving you the feeling of being able to explore at your leisure, the controls worked very well, the variety of enemies and combat zones made fighting fun as they used the world as a resource.Now the cons, the story is very bad, there is not a good development of characters so you can't really get attached to them, and while the game goes by (Spoiler Alert) and you see that your buddies are dying one by one while the story becomes more and more convenient for our protagonist you start to lose the immersion, in some parts where you expect to see a proper reaction to the events that the protagonist is living, like a decline of her mental health, It was not appreciated at any time.6.5/10"

A mysterious story that isn't hard to follow, and ramps up the supernatural very well in my opinion.  Gameplay feels smooth and tight, and without a constant HUD it turns into one of the most immersive 3rd person action games I've ever played.

They handle the rebooted origin story very well and I think this is the best version of Lara Croft ever in the franchise. She was naive and so green but grows to become tough and more confident with herself. The best thing in this game I've noticed now after re-playing it is the semi-open world approach that works great instead of the full blown open world like most games nowadays. It balances the linear path and the ""open"" section in the map so the player can explore things and lores while still focused on the main path. The player won't ever stray too much away from the main objective while finding collectibles, weapon upgrades, and extra XPs."

4833,Oro Boroz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/not_macho_cheese_trust_me/,2,,1,18.7,May,"26,",100,0,1,"There's a lot to talk about TR 2013 being a near 7 year old game at this point, and how it blends many genres like action/adventure, collectathon, metroidvania, RPG, and some more genres more subtly. It's more of a jack-of-all-trades in these regards, with only lightly incorporating these elements, but it works in differentiating this from Uncharted, which this game takes heavy inspiration from. I'll try and keep this brief though.TR serves pretty much as an origin story for Lara being a reboot. Lara's transformation into an actual tomb raider is great, though a lot of the plot is extremely predictable. TR tonally can be a bit weird sometimes, where you have stereotypical characters that are very campy, next to people being brutally murdered or maimed, or a combo of both with having campy characters being brutally murdered. But at the least, the plot generally serves to keep Lara going and as a catalyst to becoming a tomb raider. It may sound harsh or irrelevant talking about the story as the gameplay is where this game really shines, but it's odd coming from the later UC games where there's more of an emphasis on the writing and story. I'll get to this later.TR is generally linear, though instead of playing through setpiece areas that you'll never revisit, most places serve as small hubs you can fast travel back to in order to get collectables, weapon upgrade parts, XP, complete challenges, etc. In a Metroidvania-like fashion, you get upgrades to your gear which can help you access new areas or be more efficient in general; it's very light in this regard as the only areas you access are mandatory and backtracking isn't needed, but it's integrated really well. A lot of the hub/level designs remind me of PS2 collectathon games, particularly areas like the Mountain Village that has a lot of vertically and platforming. Not to mention the texturework, models, and general art design still hold up great, with a lot of detail given to Lara. For just one setting, the art direction really makes every area look unique. Also hair physics.Really, the only downside to this game is that there isn't more of what it already offers: more exploration, more combat, more hub areas to find collectables and loot, and especially more actual tomb raiding. There are tombs which serve as mini-dungeons in a way, but they really only consist of one puzzle that's usually easy to complete. When comparing TR 2013 to UC, as much as TR borrows from UC, TR differentiates itself enough to be difficult to compare. A game like UC2 is a lot more focused on setpieces and witty dialogue between characters while TR is more level/ environment and gameplay driven; I think the best comparison would between this and UC4 which attempted a more serious story and more gameplay systems like a more fleshed-out light stealth system. Though, it's probably not fair comparing a game a console generation ahead with different goals in mind, when the real question is just is TR 2013 good?Yes, it's really good, and while it has aged ever so slightly, it stills holds up as if it was just released. The only problem I can see for people getting into this game is the intro, which is filled with tons of QTEs and exposition. The QTEs are made in a way that the button presses are related to actions you do in the game (melee, grab), but in the very beginning you won't know that, and it feels somewhat contrived. Just know that the rest of the game isn't like this.As a side note, multiplayer is still somewhat active, though it seems like a much lighter version of MGO3, but I can see it being a good time-waster. Also the voice of Kaz is in this game.So much for keeping this brief, but whatever. I've also really been sleeping on this TR reboot series, which I think is actually a trilogy now."

The story was alright.  Wasn't something to write home about, but it got the job done.  There were times where I was rolling my eyes due to how generic some of the ""dramatic"" bits were.  It seemed to follow every action trope in the book.  I don't think its even possible for Lara Croft to climb up a ladder without it breaking.  I've also seen probably an average of 5 explosions every 2 minutes  Much of the story was just ""watch Lara get hurt:  the game"".  I don't know who came up with this story, but they are a  major sadist for sure. I wish the writers would have also made the side characters more memorable.  I felt nothing for them since there was nothing in the game to make me care for them.  They were just terribly voice acted friends of Lara.  The graphics were very nice.  The gameplay was ok.  The combat was just ok, not bad, just not that satisfying.  All in all, I'd still recommend this game since it was a ok 7/10 game.  I'd say don't get it anywhere near full price.  On deep sale this is a worth while quick game to play on a weekend."

After a (short) while your head an stomach feel like you ate five plates of spaghetti then rode any roller coaster at Six Flags for an hour straight. It would be fine if you could turn it off, but the ""screen effects"" option (whatever that means) does not affect this. I would only recommend this to those who don't get motion sickness at all, or if you only play games in short 15 minute sessions."

I remember my first time playing and loved every second of the game. It features Lara Croft, a bada$$ female protagonist surviving the mysterious island while saving her best friend Sam. Despite it is a 7 year old game, it aged really well and the graphics still look top notch in my opinion. I am on a Tomb Raider marathon and jumping back from Rise of the Tomb Raider to this, I notice there are slight subtle changes in the gameplay mechanics. I notice some that exists in this game isn't in the latest reboot franchise. However, less is more in my opinion and I really appreciate the simple yet efficient upgrade menu in this while all the controls is still quite familiar. I start my run on normal, but definitely planning to beat it on hard difficulty after my first run (given I have more experience from playing both installments).Overall, love this game! There is a part in the ending (no spoilers) that blew my mind and it really define who Lara is from the previous classic franchise. When that scene happened, I was in my 'pikachu face' mode for quite a bit, before it turned into a smile. I promise you will love this game! Especially coming from someone who rarely replay a video game, I caught myself thinking of replaying Tomb Raider from time to time. It is such an exhilarating journey with Lara. Take advantage of this current free title and play to your heart's content!"

The story is well thought out and fast paced so it's very easy to get invested. It can get a bit grindy if you want to complete all the challenges but it's not necessary at all to enjoy the game.

I bought the game for a ridiculous price (about 2 dollars), and I can say it was worth it. From the beginning of the story, the game shows you're main character which is a strong treasure founder who wants to continue his father passion. Also, the gameplay is very well planned, the puzzles that you have to solve for moving forward in the story aren't so difficult at all, just to think logically. The graphics looks very good for a 2013 game, and you do not need more of it. It's just like the firsts Tomb Raider games.

Tom Raider has the perfect size maps, although they might seem small for some players. You don't get bored exploring them, or searching for missing collectables, the rhythm of the actions never falls, even if you are like me and enjoy playing it thoroughly, not just the story and later go back to search for collectables.The story is catchy and the cinematic scenes are visually beautiful and thrilling.The puzzles are not that complicated nor challenging, though they add extra time and adventure.So for me this is the best one to own and play, the sequel is amazing too, yet the maps are too long and tedious.This is my second time I've played it, nor be it the last one. It's thrilling and entertaining. On the other hand, the long maps of the other two sequels deter me for playing them again, I need to really feel I have time to go over those never ending maps.If you want to have fun this is the game to own and play from the trilogy, the other two are great, I have them and played them, nevertheless, they producers focused more on offering the players ""more game hours"" for their money, yet those hours are just searching for collectables and not game-play story.Tomb Raider is undoubtedly the best of the tree,Para algunas personas este juego podría ser considerado ""viejo"", pero  realmente creo que es el mejor de la nueva trilogia de Tomb Raider.Los juegos que continúan a la serie pueden ser gráficamente asombrosos, los retos más retos, pero no mantienen el ritmo de la historia también como este.Tomb Raider tiene el tamaño perfecto de mapas, a pesar de que algunos jugadores puedan pensar que son pequeños, no te aburres al explorarlos, ni se hacen interminables, ni siquiera cuando buscas los collecionables, el ritmo de la acción nunca decae, incluso si eres como yo que prefiere jugar al juego de una sentada, nada de primero completar la historia y luego buscar los collecionables.La historia te mantiene enganchado, las escenas cinemáticas son excitantes y visualmente bellas.Los puzzles a resolver no son complicados ni representan retos importantes, pero añaden extratiempo y aventura.Por lo tanto para mí, este es el juego a tener y jugar de la trilogía, las continuaciones están bien, pero los mapas son muy grandes y se vuelven tediosos, en vez de divertirte parece un trabajo forzoso.Esta es la segunda vez que lo he jugado completo, y no será la última. Entretenie y motiva a jugar. En cambio los largos mapas de los otros dos juegos que siguen a este, hacen que no me apetezca jugarlos otra vez. Necesitaría realmente sentirme que tengo mucho tiempo libre para dedicarlo a explorar esos mapas tan grandes.Si quieres un juego para divertirte es este, los otros estan bien por supuesto, los tenho y los he completado, sin embargo, los productores del la serie, quisieron ofrecer más horas de juego en estas dos últimas entregas, pero esas horas de más son aburridas buscando colleccionables y no siguiendo el ritmo del juego. Tomb Raider es indiscutiblemente el mejor de los tres."

I have played this game 3 times and I loved every single minute of it. It's an amazing origin story with good graphics and amazing characters that make you feel immersed in the story. There are moments that keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what happens next and great emotional moments for all the characters.First of all, the story. It's an amazing start to Lara's story. It shows her character developing from a regular girl who's uncertain about where she's heading, to a survivor who is ready to kill and sacrifice something for a greater cause. You can see how scared she was after she committed her first murder, and eventually how casual that becomes for her, as the story goes on. The secondary characters don't show much development, however they feel more alive, how they react to certain situations, their interactions with Lara impact the story even more making it more alive. The choices that the characters make during the story have a great impact on Lara's character and her development, as each loss has it's effect on her and make her a stronger and stronger. The enemies might seem boring and unmotivated, however in some parts of the story you can hear them complaining, being sad or even angry which sometimes made me empathise with them, however yeah I had to kill them eventually. I would also like to see a little more from the main villain, as you only know his motivation as trying to escape the island, and don't get to see who he is and how he even got to that island.The graphics are good, the game is 7 years old, but it has aged very well and is still great. The environment is great, the island with all the beautiful locations make you want to explore more and look more closely into the details, as you get to explore from old world war bunkers to Japanese palaces and tombs which all are amazing, and the tombs that you discover by exploring the island. The voice acting is done great and Camilla Luddington does an amazing job voicing Lara in this series. The music in the game is one of the strongest points in the game. It fits perfectly with the game and during the emotional or intense moments, the main theme of the game just fits perfectly. There is not much to say about the technical part except for Square Enix did an amazing job with this one.The gameplay is has no bugs, I personally didn't encounter any of them. The shooting, climbing and in general platforming mechanics are great, they are simple and easy to learn. The shootouts are repetitive as, sometimes you have to fight the same enemy in similar scenarios, however this doesn't happen too often and most of the time you're in a completely new environment so you don't get bored from it.To conclude, I highly recommend everyone to play this game, it's a beautiful story with a lot of action and drama, which amazing characters and a beautiful story line. I would definitely give Tomb Raider a 9.5/10, considering the graphics being a little old for 2020 and the lack of development of the other characters."

5009,Prudência Passinhos,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199036491147/,2,,1,15.1,April,"11,",12,0,1,"Lara Croft has been around now for a long time, killing dinossaurs, slaying dragons and jumping around extremely deadly tombs since 1996. It would solemly be a matter of time until Tomb Raider would get a new reboot. This time we meet a 21 year old Lara that ""hates tombs"" and trembles at the thought of killing a deer.This new 2013 game doesn't require as much from the player as the previous games (mostly TR I up until TR Chronicles) in terms of elaborate puzzle solving. However it offers the player and especially the long-term fans of TR something we were not so used to: Lara's fragile humanity and innocence.Yes, it doesn't have many tombs and the player is also denied the classic dual pistols, and for those who expected the very old Tomb Raider with better graphics, it might sting a little. Lara is not (yet) the badass adventurous that kills an enemy without blinking an eye. Nevertheless the essence of the TR is still there. The island of Yamatai is the place in which the older Lara (the one we were used to) was forged. It is refreshing to experience the beginning of the tomb raider in order to understand the character that (up to Tomb Raider Legend, 2006) didn't even have much interior life going on.The game is beautifully made and the exploration feels more real than before. All in all the game does feel like the beginning of ""something"" that is going to lead us eventually to more complex challanges, tombs and plot.The tombs are few and optional and having played Rise of The Tomb Raider (second of this trilogy) already plenty of times, it feels like this 2013 TR is a sort of tutorial. It is our chance to get to know Lara and the game dynamics before setting up to the ""big"" challenge.(A detail: I must however mention that - Sometimes - one of the mines from the Minesweeper Challenge has a glitch that will prevent you from finishing the game on 100%, that can be quite annoying, for there is really no possible way to finish it, since the Mine appears on the wrong location and even though you may try to hit it, it won't blow up!)Being a long-term fan of the franchise and the character, I conclude by saying I absolutely loved the Heart of Darkness vibe of the game, the new weapons and Lara's movements, as well as the carefully constructed many narratives of the story."

Interesting island to explore with lots of historic artifacts to discover and a mass of ‘cult members’ to practise combat skills upon.  Gameplay is varied, challenging, and rewarding.  Visuals are stunning (worthy of many a scenic screenshot!) and it is set to a score which is beyond useful in building the suspense of high tense situations.  However, I would like for the puzzle sections to be increased in difficulty.  It is fun spending time figuring out complex systems and I often feel these sections of games are short-lived.  That being said, the puzzles included are well thought out, in terms of being relatable to a real-life situation that one may encounter whilst on expedition of unknown areas, and they generally blend nicely with the over-arching story.Overall, another great game for the Lara Croft fans!

Another problem is that missions can get bugged, quite rare in my experience but It's infuriating when it happens and watch out for fall damage, there is no clear indication of how much health you have left (unless I'm missing something, if so, please let me know) so be careful, especially during battles.

There's also a lot of sliding down things which makes me wonder if that was some sort of new feature at the time of this being released because it happens A LOT.BUT, this game is v good despite the fact that the things that annoyed me annoyed me greatly at the time. Things get better once you upgrade guns and unlock abilities etc. There's some really nice environments (and some really gross ones too) and the story is p good (I spent a bunch of time predicting who would die). I liked the characters but they could have been a bit more developed (I found the collectable letters helped explaining more about the characters - especially Reyes)."

The game is filled entirely with handholding quick time events, and the puzzles are extremely easy. The game also feels so linear to the point you feel like you're just running down a corridor the entire game, also the story was extremely uninteresting and the game has like 2 semi boss fights that after little to no challenge. Game is also extremely easy even on hard, save yourself the time and don't play this game you will be disappointed if you're a real Tomb Raider fan."

So for example if the game is from 2010 and the graphics are good for 2010, it's a 10/10.)Sounddesign / Music: 10/10Duration: One Story Run: 10h - 15h, 100% Run (including Story): 20h - 25h Replayability: Yes if you whait a bitPrice: Game: 17,99 (Absolutely Worth it), Game of the Year Edition: 42,84 (a few dlc's that are included in the GOTY Edition are not necessary but nice to have.)Additional comments:In this Tomb Raider you are stranded on an island and you have to explore the island to find a way out. While you explore the island, you will get into many combat situations and have to shoot your way through or sneak your way through quietly.The Tombs on the island are really good and fun to solve."

I always watch some gameplay when I was kid vaguely remembering, this chick running, escaping dinosaurs, and Indiana jones esk temples and whatnot, and I gotta say I always wanted to play them. But I was not a fan of early era 3d based games, where spherical rounded shapes were ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with polygons and what not. But to the review.For a 2013 game, the graphics, are slightly above average, and more than serviceable. The landscape is beautifully rendered and textured, with proto-photo realism to sort of an extent. But the game does not allow you to explore every corner, nor does it allow you to climb or move around areas that seem to be acceptable in locomotion. The atmosphere is decent, in terms of when the game knows how to make you feel worried, relieved or victorious in certain situations. But the physical atmosphere which correlates with the environment, ties in with its structure, the sky is alright, so is with clouds, I mean I didn't expect much. Nonetheless, it is nice to acknowledge. Animals. There isn't a lot of wildlife in this game, I get this game was meant to focus on the  ""TOMB"" aspect of tomb raider meaning is an adventure game, not a tycoon game, but its a shame, if there were more animals associated with the Yamato aspect of it.Enemies, this game knows how to make you feel a sack of ♥♥♥♥ sometimes, but it makes up for that with the survival aspect of it. Where you supposed to be on your toes all the time. In the beginning, the enemies, could instakill you, ♥♥♥♥ you over time and time again, until you get the shotgun things to become more bearable. When you loot the,m, btw they're a looting feature in this game, which is pathetic, not even checking all the pockets to see what they have, they think it makes the game balanced, but it gets ladies.Weapons and loot. Not much to say, weapons are limited, which the idea of this game of a Bermuda triangle rip off, I would expect to find military/private militia caches hanging around, but no, just puny ♥♥♥♥ you unlock and a shotgun which is bearable, a not about the shotgun you could shoot your enemies point blank and they wouldn't even die, you have to make a perfect headshot, to be qualified as akill.The end of the game, gets easier, but all the stuff you learned means nothing, almost all the levels start like this, you start injured or worried, you gotta go climb to place, and slaves stuff, beat enemies, you think you've won, uh-oh crackheads arrive, your cheeks are stretched, what do you do? COnstantly blast this dude or run? Blah-blah only a few missions are fun the rest is just tedious.Characters and voice acting are alright, that one blond archeologist, I saw his face during the beginning of the game, that Hispanic Hawaiian dude, turned back for some reason in the sequel. That nerd seemed like he uses Reddit...Sam......seriouslly we as a society need to establish and organize gender-neutral names, like in endgame, who the ♥♥♥♥ names a girl Morgan? You gonna name an Asian chick Sam? Unless if it's short for Samantha than ignore what I just said.Overall score 7/10...just me looking at the fun aspect of it."

There is no sprint that I know of so you need to constantly hop and roll around to move faster, and it takes like a whole minute to enter tombs because it makes you walk. and the amount of times you need to crouch walk to get to another area or squeeze through a crack is too many to count. You need to climb almost everywhere so if you're trying to 100% the game it's going to be more than a little annoying. There's a whole bunch of QTEs in combat which i'm fine with but they made them in climbing sequences as well and by the time you get half way through the game you kind of just expect them. The game almost always ran at 144fps but about every 30 minutes the game kind of just froze for a second, and it crashed two times while doing this. The game crashed almost every time I alt tabbed. There was an elevator shaft that i glitched through and every time i jumped into it it killed me. One time I got stuck in T-pose and couldn't move, the game crashed shortly after. This could just be an issue with my pc but I don't think it is.It's really grindy to get all the upgrades and skill points which wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for how scarce the enemies are. Unless I just didn't get it, close ranged combat is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Using close ranged abilities felt really finicky and if you tried to use guns it zooms in way too much so you'll most likely just die. The ""bosses"" are some of the most anti climactic things I've seen, getting their own cut scenes and ♥♥♥♥ but they die within two to six headshots plus an occasional QTE (I was playing on the hardest difficulty). The last ""boss"" was a joke.I enjoyed the story but not enough to really care about it. It's a good looking game as well.tldr: mountain climbing simulator/action adventure game without any action"

So this review is not because of the discount. I´m liking it so far, the game is made in a way that I already feel a connection with Lara, because she gets hurt, some of her plans don´t work, and she´s still learning how to survive. Great diversity of ways to play, it´s not only a run-and-shoot thing. The graphics are good and it runs smoothly. I hope the puzzles don´t get too boring, that´s what kept me away from previous versions of this franchise.Actually, this game is so good that I can only play it little by little, bits and pieces at a time, to savour it like good food. I can only play it with undivided attention. I cannot disappoint Lara by performing badly.It will take a while for me to finish this game, and I´m okay with that. It you´re looking for a TPS that is not the same old shoot-them-all, blow-them-up, get this one."

Ironically, it was Rise and Shadow that I had written reviews for even when TR1 was the first game that I'd played before them. Well, that's what I'm about to do right now.+ Looking back at TR now, it is quite simple and dull but it should be noted that this revolutionized action-adventure games. TR's graphics are excellent given the situation. Good textures, good shadows and post-processing can still compete with few titles today. But to be honest, the color palette used looks dull which may symbolise the dystopian coast of Japan. Given the year that TR was created, no one should be complaining about low frames per second with the highest setting enabled. Also most cutscenes are not pre-rendered, which I like :)+ TR's gameplay is something to appreciate. Enemy AI can be a bit simple but I really like how they can move to different cover. Traversing the environment can never get better and the animations are almost spot-on. I appreciate the equal parts of exploration and combat. To make it even more challenging, I disable survivor sense as well as set it on hard difficulty as a mean to get the best experience. I recommend you try this out. Upgrading weapons is quite simple in this game, you simply collect salvage and upgrade it.+ TR's story is yet excellent. We get to know every character through dialogue and collectibles, and the theme of Japanese mythology is an inquiring start to the franchise. Through its average-timed story, we get to experience Lara's beginning into the tomb raider model she is.+ TR's soundtrack suits the game very well. When in combat, being chased or also the introduction. It is something that isn't appreciated by many, and I wish it could.+ TR features a PvP mode that I wish I could try when it was free to download back in March 2020, but now there aren't enough players to start a match.Tomb Raider features some DLC, but to be honest it's not worth the purchases and you're better off buying the plain game. Yeah there are outfits for Lara to buy but most of them break the immersion and originality of the game. The other DLC for Multiplayer maps and Multiplayer skins aren't worth it as well, while the DLC tomb is bugged.Now you'll probably hate me for this, but here goes my verdict: I love TR1, honestly do. But I will not recommend TR1 for newcomers or experienced players. Why? Well, for a few Dollars more you can get Rise and that has a longer story, better gameplay and better graphics. If you got it free back in March, I appreciate that you took your time to try this out. Sure you can get it for sale, but when Rise also goes on sale as well it's definitely worth what you are getting. The reason for the short review is simply because there hasn't been much so from a game in 2013. Rise and Shadow have built on many of the aspects on TR1."

Just as the 007 movies got silly and predictable, so did the Tomb Raider games (they just got downright embarrassing later on). The Bourne movies, with their gritty realistic style, showed audiences what 007 should be like. They later rebooted the Bond movies in this style, and they were much better for it.Tomb Raider got the same treatment and it wasn't just good, it was great. The style, action, design, and everything else is heads and tails better than anything else in the franchise. What really set this apart from the previous games is that Lara is no longer a super hero (and bimbofied), but a regular person who is forced to do extraordinary things in the name of survival. This makes her more connectable, and a much better hero overall. The new look and voice acting match this new image to great effect. I'm glad to say I'm a Tomb Raider fan once again."

Most of all, I love Lara's character itself. I didn't expect it, as there are a lot of ""strong"" female characters who are ironically weak and faint. But she's just a survivor, a girl who went through hell just to survive and save her friend. If you still haven't played it I absolutely recommend it. ""A point of no return"" is not a part of story, it's a part of the game. You can roam freely in the map after you finished the game, but if you somehow replaced your save file like I did (because the game didn't warn me and just said continue) you're gonna lose any chance of collecting the achievements after you finished the game, and you have to start a new game and go through all that again like I did (after 6 hours..).

I remember playing the first one and often having tremendous difficulties with the puzzles, and sometimes tricky action sequences that required pressing a series of buttons with just the right timing. Well, either I've grown as a player, or the developers have made this part a bit easier, but I found the new Tomb Raider to be more like a playable Indiana Jones movie. Yeah, there are still some puzzles and tricky timing sequences to solve if you want to raid the hidden tombs, but they are entirely optional. This game is a lot more story-driven than the older versions, and the story progresses quite linear, so you're never left wondering about what you should do next. That said, there is still plenty of room for free exploration, and the wonderfully detailed locations contain many hidden secrets waiting to be found. The graphics are top notch, it's hard to believe that this game is 10 years old. It is, however, a lot more violent than I remember the old games being, with plenty of combat and some gruesome death scenes that give the Die Hard movies a run for their money. All in all, this game is a modern classic, a worthy successor to a game that once revolutionized the genre."

The game builds Lara's character from the very beginning/to her triumph, they give you a lot of time to understand who she is as a person. The game just keeps you on the edge of your seat with the mystery how in the ♥♥♥♥ to get off the island, grips you with the stellar combat and action, and of course the story. This game was magnificent from its beginning to its conclusion, didn't seem that short although I finished it in 10ish hours. The movement was in my opinion kind of clunky at times but nothing that starts frustrating you, haven't found mayor bugs, some really minor that the normal eye doesn't even notice.

I would have liked a little more incentive to explore the beautiful world Eidos Montreal has created, but I’d much prefer too much content than too little.

It's a lot easier to progress in this new reboot because it's quite linear and there's almost no backtracking and puzzles are way easier compared to the older games because of the ""Survival Instincts"" you can activate which highlights all interactable objects and Lara will talk about the puzzles details if you are stuck for too long, so it's quite more casual in that regard.The game map consists of lots of explorable areas which are connected to each other and are part of the main story, you can go back to most of these areas after you've unlocked them. There's a variety of collectibles, challenges and optional tombs available in these areas which give you xp to earn more skills or unlock upgrades for your weapons.Combat can be as challenging or as easy as you want with the three difficulty options. There are four different weapon types, pistol, machine gun, shotgun and bow. There's also dodges and counters for close range combat.Overall it's a fun, sometimes over the top ridiculous casual action adventure game with some historical elements to it that I can recommend to anyone if you are interested in the title."

They're action adventure games based around exploring historical or fantasy settings. Having recently played through the Uncharted games, I decided to give the first Crystal Dynamic's Tomb Raider game a chance.And honestly, Tomb Raider compares quite well. For a game from 2013, Tomb Raider plays great and looks stunning to this day. While Uncharted has stronger characters and much better writing, Tomb Raider's environments, combat and action sequences rival the best of the Uncharted series imo.Gameplay wise, Tomb Raider is fantastic. I found all the weapons to be fun to use, other than the shotgun which felt useless in 90% of scenarios. The movement and traversal is near perfect. The island and most of its settings are stunning and the game features plenty of high octane action sequences and gameplay sections throughout its runtime. Highly recommended."
5499,Mattved,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mattved/,1,,1,21.8,December,"8,",428,0,1,"Awesome graphics for console games of the time. The game pulls you into the atmosphere and you get truly involved in the story. While you can run through the game without actually seeing any tombs, they have a lot to offer in terms of creatively constructed logical problems and the amount of XP they provide. The story comes through the game as well as set of primary (relics) and secondary (documents) evidence that completes player's full understanding of it. Not all relics make sense, though.Unfortunately, the quirks of console games like movement assist and location-triggered actions are still present and make it really weird. Sometimes. And with the way the game triggers audio events, you might get annoyed of certain lines. Just don't get stuck anywhere for too long and you will probably like it. Finally, as of December 2019, there is a bug with a research base relic, which will prevent you from reaching the ultimate achievement -..-I also had issues locating the enemies attacking me, sometimes.

As an adventure game, it's brilliant, captivating, immersive, and you just can't stop playing. Of course, it's impossible not to think about the number of times Lara should have broken her spine and fractured every single bone in her body, but some things you just let slide.However, as a Tomb Raider game... what the hell is this? It's so much different than any of the previous installments in pretty much every aspect. Even the tombs in this game are almost all optional. It would be okay to explore them on your own how you see fit, there's just one problem: let's just say (without too many spoilers, I hope) that in this game Lara has got a lot on her hands as it is, and she's always in a hurry, trying to survive. To think that she would take five from the VERY pressing issues she's facing and go explore a tomb of two for a change is just so freaking stupid it makes no sense to me. The best (worst) part, though, was Lara's very own words: ""I hate tombs"". When why the #%#@#$%^ are you even raiding them for christsakes...?!! Come to think of it, Lara Croft has become a lot more softer and fragile compared to the sexy badass she used to be in previous games.Anyhow. The whole gameplay is very different. What was once a puzzle-oriented actual tomb-raiding franchise is now a third-person shooter with heavy gunplay and psychotic human enemies. Sure, the climbing mechanics are still there, some tombs (which Lara now hates) also, but they've all become very linear, at least where the main story is concerned.I gotta say this is quite a bit different that what I was expecting - an action-packed darker, gorier, more cruel and adult-oriented version of Tomb Raider... which is not really a Tomb Raider. But it's an impressive adventure anyway, and once I started looking at this game as a separate universe from its ancestors, the verdict became none other than ""god I love this game"", because there's really so much to love despite what I said. So here's my kinda weird two cents."

Below I will post Pro's and Con's respectively, go to the bottom for the TLDR!- Story is great as well as characters and how they're developed.- Graphically still beautiful and it's a shame it doesn't have a photo mode.- Runs well for how good it looks too!- The combat and action sequences with the music feel timed right as well as feel great.- Trying to 100% this game can feel a little repetitive but the environment makes exploring feel worth it so just a little complaint there.- Couple of glitches that got me killed and was a little annoying but was pretty funny since at one point I just flew.  Despite a few hiccups with my playthrough I think this game still holds up in every way and I definitely can see why it has two more games after this one. I can't wait to jump into Rise of the Tomb Raider and see how the sequel is. I give this game a 9/10 with everything mentioned above, minimal complaints and an all around solid game. The game is still very beautiful and holds up well and runs great! I had a few minor glitches but other than that the game was perfect, I enjoyed the story and the characters.

Of course it wasn't at it's original release ( i think it was around 2013) but the autolock system was just off in my opinion. Then i saw the reboot which aired in the same year. I took me a good 5 years to buy this game altought i thought it was very good when i first saw it. But man o man it was worth it. And i'm not only talking about the ridicolous price when it is on sale ( talking about 3 to 4 eus) and it gets a LOT of sales.But the game. Its just such a good restart for the franchise.So the graphics.If you happened to see any videos or just checking the reviews here you'll see that almost (if not) everybody praises it's video quality. I can't say anything new. Still looks good today although it's more than 6 years old now.Music.It's good. Nothing particularly impressive but very nice. But there is one song that had satteled in the (NEW) trilogy. And that's the main Theme. Now you see every time something extraordinary happens the game will play the main theme. Or at least a part of it. AND IT FITS PERFECTLY.Story.I think this is one of the strongest points of TR (other than gameplay). It's very good. I really did enjoy every bit of it. It's not too complex but not lame. It's perfect for the 10 - 15 hours the story offers and does a pretty darn good job in showing us the past and origin of the New Lara Croft. And i think it's good enough to replay the game at least once more.Gameplay.Now this is where the game really shines (compared to it's predecessors). No more auto aim, no BS. A completly new take/turn for the franchise but it fits well (just like the new Lara design but lets not talk about that here).Overall:stop reading and buy the gamecmon go nowjust do itWas not sponsored by Nikeyy"

This is the first game that I've been sucked into and played through its entirety, almost 100% completing it (a rare for me), since Hollow Knight about a year ago. I love the cinematic feel of it, I love the reasonably challenging but manageable combat encounters, I loved the puzzles in each tomb. As someone who's new to the Tomb Raider franchise, I'm sure I missed out on several cool ""oh, that's how she started doing that"" fan moments, but the few I got were pretty awesome.I can't express how fun this game is and I can't recommend it enough. I'm not good at putting this stuff into words, and other people have said it better than I can, so I'll just briefly say a few things as I think of them. - As someone who has never played a single FPS game all the way through, the health system really caught me off guard and broke immersion at first, but I got used to it pretty quick. I prefer games where you die quickly if you're dumb, and this is ultimately that, just in a different package. - The puzzles are very enjoyable once you get into the minds of the developers, but often rely on laughable constraints of realism. Like, why can't Lara just push the boat...? But it's whatever, game be game. One of them is a bit obtuse because the devs decided to use gas containers that never appear anywhere else in the campaign instead of a regular, normal object as a weight. Don't know what they were thinking there, maybe they hit a deadline or something, idk. - If you're a sneaky-sneaky stabby-stabby, weave and dodge, glass cannon type player like me, you will probably find combat to be quite painful for the first few levels. I did, but that's mostly because I'm just plain bad at FPS's. Have no fear however, as there are some melee, stealth, and finishing options you can start unlocking fairly early on that expand your potential playstyles way beyond sit behind thing, wait, shoot. - There are quick-time events in this game. If you hate those, sorry. But honestly, I thought they were fine because they're well-telegraphed and consistent. Y is always hit stuff, X is recovering from a slip or strength-related, LS is recovering from surprise attacks. As far as I remember, these never change and I always found it very clear what I was supposed to do. And if you don't do it right, it's fine because the game always autosaves right before that point so you just watch Lara die horribly and then do it right this time.All in all, fantastic game, one of my favorites. Definitely will be buying the sequels and trying out the earlier games."

The story is interesting and fresh while finding a good balance between fast paced action and world exploration. The mechanics were easy to learn, but took time and effort to master and I love that there is always more than one way to solve a problem. My only real gripe with the game is the ending; without giving any spoilers, I found that the ending strayed away from the semi realistic roots of the rest of the story and left me disappointed. I felt that it was too abrupt and lacked a bit of explanation. Overall, this game is a fun experience that gets your heart pumping and your mind engaged in a very positive way."
5549,Ravenize > *,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/,1,,1,0.5,September,"30,",578,0,1,"The Tomb Raider reboot trilogy is a phenomenal series of games. They added a lot of Nathan Drake to Lara Croft, to great effect. Gone are the disproportions, the clunky controls, the meandering, directionless platforming through hard-angled, pixelated polygons. Everything is buttery smooth.I don't think diving in and over-analyzing these games is really necessary at this point. You know about Tomb Raider. What's worth saying is that I believe this to be the best incarnation of the franchise yet. And they're each superbly crafted games in their own right. I wish there were more like them.The few things I don't like mostly revolve around multiplayer and the DLC. There are too many achievements tied to those, especially considering how fast the servers empty out post release. And Shadow of the Tomb Raider has a difficulty level that's thankfully absent in the other games where they increase the challenge simply by removing most of the checkpoints. This is an incredibly lazy and stupid way to do that. If you're a parent or anyone else on limited time it feels really disrespectful.The one other thing you might care about these games that's not obvious on the surface is that Shadow of the Tomb Raider has really nice 4k support. But they all look good in general, regardless of resolution.The environments are excellent. The weapons are fun, and you get to upgrade them. There are skill trees and climbing puzzles, enemies galore and a few memorable boss fights. You learn about Lara's past, and you move forward with her. It's a journey worth taking.Now that all three games are out there's a sense of finality that's rare in this time of endless sequels. The total and complete experience is now available. If you like third person shooter games at all, you owe it to yourself to play 2013's Tomb Raider, and then there are two more games ready and waiting for you after that."

Gameplay elements focus more on action and survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. Littered through the levels are relics, documents and GPS caches, that expand on the narrative and help establish Lara's archeological ambitions. Extremely well made but with a notable change from explorative puzzler to  mature gritty action. This and the lack of substantial tombs might put off a few hardcore Tomb Raider fans but at no point is the experience anything short of awe-inspiring. The story is the strongest aspect of this reboot even though Lara's transition to action heroine isn't as convincing at times but the jaw dropping environments and asthetics make up for this."

Приключение не новое, суть в том, что существует остров, который было бы выгодно исследовать. Приятно, что в самом начале герои не слепо верят нашей главной героине и говорят, что только её рассказов об острове недостаточно для столь большой экспедиции. Однако из-за капитана  корабля, который покровительствует Ларе, они всё же отправляются  в путешествие. Дальше шторм, крушение корабля, и они оказываются на том самом острове, пока ещё не известном им. Это, вроде, всё, что вам нужно знать о завязке игры. Сама игра претендует на драматизм, об этом говорят и постоянно серы тона, и попытки выдавить слезу их игрока путём убийства миленьких животных ради пропитания, неоправданные убийства персонажей с целью  вызвать эмоции. Однако с этим меняется и характер Лары, что нельзя не отметить.Герои. Их немного и раскрыты они средне, а если вы не будете собирать дневники этих самых героев, то и вовсе вам покажется, что они были добавлены  для атмосферы или просто так.  Всего их восемь.  Добротный антагонист, мотивы которого понятны, который раскрыт достаточно и не вызывает вопрос. Подружка Лары. Дед-харизма. Алекс – парень, который хочет казаться лучше, чем есть в самый последний момент. Иона – милый здоровяк. Доктор Уитмен, второй археолог или историк. Не понятно, почему в плановой экспедиции только два человека разбирающихся в археологии и истории в целом.  Рейс, не очень понятно, какую роль она выполняла в экспедиции. Кэп – друг отца Лары, который яро нам помогает. Повторюсь, что без прочтения дневников понять, кто все эти люди и почему они ведут себя так по игре, будет не то чтобы сложно, но крайне не очевидно. Островок разнообразный. Тут тебе и древняя цивилизация, и военные, культ, который отстроил себе немаленькие трущобы с целыми канатными дорогами. Сказать можно то, что походу игры разглядывать остров интересно. Геймплей.Геймплей обыденный  для игр такого жанра. Переходы и элементы передвижения по игре – моменты как в кино. Много мест, когда Лара начинает скользить вниз, из-за вдруг провалившегося пола, обрыва, или бороться с бурным течением водопада. Уступы и стенки, которые кто-то специально покрасил белой краской, что бы нам было понятно куда идти.  Инстинкт выживания, показывающий, что нужно делать, если ты ничего не понимаешь, но есть даже такие моменты,  где даже этот инстинкт не спасает. Оружие – ничего особенного. Лично я даже не пользовался ничем кроме лука. Только иногда, когда тебя окружает большое количество противников, нужно сменить на автомат или пистолет. Я проходил игру на сложном уровне, но трудностей не ощутил, потому что это логично не встретить чрезмерной сложности в игре-приключении. Однако тебя могут убить одной очередью, если ты не успеешь увернуться. Навыки тоже не отличаются чрезмерной пользой. Например, навык для того, что бы прыгать со скал или просто с высокой точки можно было тише и сами прыжки наносили меньше вреда  Ларе, ну бред, ведь во время перестрелок вряд ли вы куда-то будете убегать, а тем более прыгать. Та же  история с навыком, который позволяют вытаскивать больше и без того огромное количество припасов. Графика.Ничего из ряда вон выходящего. Обычная графика, местами красивая, местами – нет. Разнообразные уровни, что хорошо. Хотелось бы больше ярких и разнообразных цветов, но попытка в драматизм убивает такой способ передачи воображения дизайнеров и художников игры.Краткий блиц о том, что запоминается в игре как хорошее, а что как плохое.Занимательная и интересная история. Стоить отметить, что история не самой Лары и её экипажа, а история острова. Такое ощущение, будто бы посмотрел передачу на тему затерянных островов. Не зацикливаешься на стрельбе и сражением с врагами. Можно проследить смену характера героев по ходу  игры, то же самое происходит с настроениями в культе. Графика и стилистика уровней выглядят красиво и разнообразно вопреки одной и той же цветовой гамме.Хотелось бы увидеть, куда применять так много оружия, ведь игру, по сути, можно пройти только с одним луком. Глупо ведут себя персонажи, которые не могут проанализировать ситуацию на острове. От чего кажется, что они не большого ума. Так много навыков, так мало пользы.  Головоломок хотелось бы больше. И что бы они были интереснее. Нелогичность. Например, когда мы стреляем из лука против ветра, который сносит людей. Или на уровне где нам надо было взять инструменты, то инструменты состоят из отвёртки и гаечного ключа.В игре, кстати, есть мультиплеер, стоит ли говорить, что он умер, не успев родится? Но вопреки тому, что на момент написания обзора он окончательно мертв, я успел в него поиграть, когда проходил игру первый раз. Ничего особенного там вы не найдёте. ИТОГОНу что мы имеем в сухом остатке? Всю игру я думал исключительно об острове, о предыдущей  его истории, о военных, которые там вели исследования. Драма меня не тронула, это понятно, ведь Лара постоянно плачет, что выдает неестественность. Шутер? Не смешите. Как история Лары и её экипажа? Герои недоделаны, нет предыстории, да и вообще, наши товарищи почти всегда отсутствуют. Игра-экскурс на островок и его историю, а там, что есть, то и показали. Специального растяжения сюжета нет, что тоже приятно, ибо в Bioshock, который я проходил недавно нужно долго и нудно бродить туда-сюда, можно, кончено, найти все артефакты, пройти все испытания, собрать тайники, расхитить гробницы и всё в таком духе, но никто вас не заставляет этого делать, что как растяжение сюжета не считается. Как игра ради не очень интересного приключения – почему нет.  5,5/10"

The graphics are amazing for a 2013 game and it has excellent environments. The controls are smooth though the combat may feel rough at times. The puzzles were way too easy imo and survival instincts did nothing to help that. There are many quick times events in this tho they are only in the more crucial parts of the game. The soundtrack is amazing too as at times it felt like a friking action movie with Lara climbing up a mountain and the music playing. And of course the story, it is probably the highlight of the game. It is a great narrative with excellent character development leading upto Lara's transformation into a survivalist. The Yamatai part of the narrative was also quite interesting and the document collectables did tell a great story. Don't bother with the multiplayer tho.Overall, i would highly recommend this game. This is probably one of the better games out there and I would give it a solid 9.8/10."

My point in prefacing this is im not a Lara Croft purist or a die hard fan and i honestly didnt like character prior to this game. so im approaching this game with fresh (or ignorant) eyes. I for one loved this game. it feels right at home with my Uncharted experience. id say its a gore filled, bloodstained genderbend Nathan Drake game. filled with treasure, guns, mystery, and of course ""tombs"". it lacks the light heartedness of those games however and this can be a pretty intense experience at times. Gorehounds wont be dissapointed with laras greusome death animations. this is NOT a game for kids. not to mention one of the goons nearly...deflowering Lara. the tone is consitantly dark and verges on hopelessness. i dont mind that sort of tone but others might so i thought id mention it. Very mature themes throughout.the levels are varied enough with good opprotunity to flex your patience at stealth and stratagy. you can go in guns blazing sure but i like the careful appoach and you can do that here. you get a bow and later some silencers for your guns. i never used silencers cuz weapon upgrades cost salvage and you never really need to get a silencer when you have the bow. there is a progression system here complete with skills and weapon customization as well as XP and challenges, nothing special, youve probly seen it before but its a nice addition and it fits well here. we have a semi sandbox structure to the enviornment. your free to explore (within reason) to find relics salvage for weapons, hunt animals for XP and raid ""tombs"" the story is paced pretty well and i was engaged enough that i almost completed the game in one sitting(about 12 hours give or take). its not a novel story but...nothing under the sun really is anymore. the puzzles arnt mindblowing but they stop you for a sec and break up the monotany. not hard enough to be unfair but not really challenging either. kinda meh. the skills you get make you feel strong without sacraficing diffuculty, so it hits a sweetspot. your tough but not invincible and the game balences this pretty well.i only have 1 real issue. and thats the ""tomb"" raiding. simple puzzle sections sure but thats not the problem i have. what you raid ISNT ACTUALLY A TOMB. at the end of the ""tomb"" you find a chest full of gold. not a body in a coffin surrounded by riches. just a chest of gold. kinda wierd to call it a tomb when theres no buried and sealed away body. these are optional sections you do for map reavels and XP. and its easily the weakest part of the game. i dont feel like much thought or effort was put into them and thats kindof dissapointing considering you are the TOMB RAIDER. not the ""box opener"". its bland and youll probly forget them after you finish them. the best part of this game to me is Lara. here shes fresh new and wide eyed as well as inexperienced. this is her first real adventure. involving guns goons and bad feng shui. this new lara felt more human to me. shes scared alone and out of her element. and most of the game is her overcoming her fears in order to survive and press on. you get alot more development with her here. which may turn purists off, but im not a purist so whatever. this is a lara i feel more connected and invested to. shes not a stoic one liner bad ass, shes vulnerable here. scared and uncertian. and i like that. she becomes more confident in herself, she gets stronger and more durable. you get the feeling she has a long way to go, and this really did feel like just a stepping stone in her evolution. im curious to see how her path unravels in the future instalments. 8.5/10 a classic to me. and an experience im glad i had."

5703,Snoopy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Snoopy101/,1,,1,20.4,January,"3,",233,0,1,"Ok. So. I've played through the 'Survivor' trilogy (Tomb Raider 2013, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider) quite a few times and can I just say, I love these games. All three of them. Even though the last installment is a little controversial for some, I loved that one too. I personally feel that Tomb Raider shines in it's story telling rather than its gameplay. I find that this is the reason why some people dont really like the third game. They want a fun game to play, not so much a story to follow. But you see I'm a little different so I get sucked into the story and I feel like the first game, this game, was literally one of the most interesting storylines I've come across. Now, that is 100% subjective. That's my opinion. But it is also my opinion that in terms of gameplay, Rise of the Tomb Raider is far superior to Tomb Raider and I found that because of that, the third game suffered from the much feared 'sequel syndrome'. It just couldn't go anywhere. It was literally living in the shadow of the first two games. BUT, Tomb Raider (2013), will always be my favourite and is definitely the most replayable. It's a fun little game and it goes on sale all the time. But I mean, I would honestly pay double its price for this game. It's the start of what I believe to be a great storyline for the Tomb Raider franchise."

5708,uygo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/halsor/,1,,1,11.8,January,"1,",229,3,1,"Tomb Radier is among one of my favorite series on Steam. This game is the first in the rebooted 2013 action-adventure Tomb Raider franchize. The main storyline in Tomb Radier is perfect in a way that advancing through the main story feels satisfactory. Lara is shiprecked on an island named ""Yamatai"" with her fellow friends in which Lara has to escape but a queen named ""Himiko"" is present to keep anyone from leaving the island. Her quest is to defeat Himiko and escape the island with the other survivors. The ending is just pure perfection and it's so satisfying to finish the game. There is no sidequests in this game and only a main quest to make sure you don't get confused throughout the game.In my opinion the gameplay in Tomb Raider is more ""great"" than perfect. There are many new mechanics compared to the other games in the series. You've got the simple climing mechanics but some classic mechanics in other Tomb Raider games are taken out for the sake of making the game more realistic, which in my opinion isn't a bad thing. The game feels similar to Uncharted (an exclusive series on the PlayStation) in terms of gameplay. If you're new to Tomb Radier titles, the game can feel a little slow in terms of running and walking. You will get used to it. As the title of the game says ""Tomb Radier"", the game isn't a whole lot about raiding tombs. Instead, there is areas while you progress through the main quest called ""optional tombs"" in which they are optional and does not help progress the main quest in any way. There are also collectibles in this game if wanting to complete the game fully. Enemies are a big part of this game. In some areas you can chose to be stealthy about your approach to killing enemies or you could go full fire on them and play super agressive. The combat fits all types of players in some sort of way. There is an uprgading system to buy upgrades for weapons with salvage you find throughout the map and a skill section to upgrade traits of Lara.Overall, there are some flaws to this game, but that depends on your playstyle. This game is super worth picking up and if wanting to play the 2015 sequel ""Rise of the Tomb Raider,"" be sure to pick up this one too."

For me, the gem in the rather ''meh'' plot was Lara's character development: from a young, inoffensive woman to a full fledged survivor, this sets the tone and re-establishes her as the adventurer she's about to become.+ The gameplay is your standard TR fanfare: puzzle resolving and action packed sections. There are more human enemies than animals like in the original trilogy though.+ It isn't a very long game, but it retains the open world aspect and it's fun to just explore, collecting relics and just plain doing acrobatics around.- While the game has classic TR elements, the tomb raiding itself is left as an aftertought, they're there, but optional and not really tied to the main storyline as a whole. The bow and arrow can be a hassle to control and use.- The story can be quite predictable, it's not bad but it is kinda underwhelming.Both as a standalone game or as a reboot of one of the most iconic videogame frachises, it's a good game that succesfully manages to bring Lara back to the spotlight and gives the series a much needed update."

The other collectible items include reading, finding utensils and return products to Garmin for refurbishing.The game frequently features Quick Time Events and seems to borrow a lot from the Uncharted series and Ubisoft games. Lara often finds herself in near-death sequences way too often, leading to extremely over the top cinematic sequences that are overused to the point they're unmemorable but still keeps the game from just being Gears of Croft.The biggest drawback is the Lara Croft character who is devoid of any sort of personality. Lara Croft's portrayed as a naive, overly nice and whiney character and that contradicts the actions you tend to do, i.e. killing over a thousand cultists on your own, hacking people with a pickaxe. Lara was always a smug, arrogant and powerful character. in fact, this SJW reboot of her ironically seems to fail that. It's also a shame because the story had plot pieces that could have benefitted from the old Lara Croft.Beyond that as a fan of Tomb Raider. The game lacks the mystical feeling you got from the earlier games. Is it because you're mostly in a tropical setting, traversting from point A to B, solving puzzles that are more beffiting in a Half Life game? Or is it because the game tells you where to go, what to pick up, what's around you? I do think it's the latter. Oh yeah there's also the modern game cliche of throwing in half baked RPG elements in there, to this games credit it's not as bloated.If they carried this formula over to the rest of the trilogy it would wear out by the first half of the next game."

There was a lot of combat, I had to take breaks from time to time because it was straining my wrist haha but very enjoyable and also very frustrating at times when I lost or got puzzled at some of the puzzles in the game.Overall, very nice experience.

5777,Mutant Overlord,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shin-MUTANT-Shredder-OVERLORD/,1,1,1,26.1,October,"10,","2,208",0,1,"Tomb Raider 2013 is just another generic third person cover based shooter with:a)platforming which feels floaty and slow. Its not super bad, yet its simple to the point of irritation.Every single climbable spot is indicated by white paint making less like a fun adventure and more like a braindead walk on the bridge while being hand hold by your parent.b)physics based puzzles that are so much obnoxiously braindead simple that its insulting to call them even ""puzzles""c)upgrade system which allows you to upgrade each one of 4 different weapons (bow, pistol, shotgun, machine gun) with ""salvage"" and gathering experience points for doing almost anything in the game to unlock new skills Funny enough the game rewards with free experience points for slaughtering every single animal and human, especially those locked in cages and prisons.Gunplay feels alright, enemies are easy to stagger and kill even without headshots. Unfortunate, all you shoot are generic male enemies and Lara is as healthy as a wet noodleTomb Raider has ton of slow walking scenes, unskippable cutscenes and heavy scripted moments to a sickening level. So much that it feels like watching a movie 90% of the time than playing a video gameEven typical action ""chase sequences"" felt like that. Barely any interaction, you just run straight forward and press jump button or QTESurvival elements that was advertised before release of this game were lackluster and basically abandoned. The hunting from the trailer was just an early tutorial section and killing animals is just a boost of expDodge system is completely useless and any upgrade for it is a waste of upgrade points because pressing a normal jump button is way faster and more effective in combat than fully upgraded dodge. There is completely no reason to use dodge button which ironically is supposed to be one of main in game mechanicsOut of nowhere generic guy in armor holding a hammer is a final boss fight.His attacks are slow as f*ck,you jump away and shoot him 5 times in the back,then do a QTE.Repeat 2 more times to kill himRight after that you have a QTE in which Lara kills a main bad guy in the most anti climactic way everBoat crashes on the island, Lara goes from point A to B, a bit of filler happen, Lara gets kidnapped like 5 times, she escape from the island save and sound.Thats kinda the whole story, because really nothing exciting or memorable is going on for the whole 12 hours.Story itself is a one big joke full of cliches and constant Lara's dumb decisions.Additional ship crew is there for a momen but it bring nothing important to the story.A character you meet from the start of the game is such obvious Villain #1 that its just painful to watch.What about Villain #2?A disappointing, easy forgettable cult leader that barely even appear in the game.Lara Croft herself is definitely the most inconsistent and the worst character in this game.Her personality is even worse than Kratos.She genocide entire island no problem. In a cutscenes? She gets beat up by a one guy. Multiple times.She had a whole 10 seconds to save a parachuter from a guy with a knife yet she didn't.She put a gun towards a helicopter pilot (who did risk to fly in bad weather to save her and other survivors) and all she has to say is ""I dont care that this terrible weather can kill us all - we are gonna fly down there to save those 3 people"" which results in laughable death of pilot and her friend.After sliding from a small hill,Lara falls down on the ground from like 2 meters and her ridiculously weak body gets wounded so bad that she need to look for first aid kit for the next 20 minutes. During that she gets shot at least 100 times yet she doesn't mind that at all. Lara had so many opportunities to kill Villain #2 in the whole game,yet she she didn't do that for some reason. Developers really undermined whole redesign of LaraKilling a human being is a traumatic experience. Her first kill is a elaborate dramatic cutsceneThen she pukes, cry, picks up a gun....and then you score extra points with emotionless headshooting next peopleShe supposed to be now a strong female protagonist and not ""sex icon"" yet this game is constantly shoving down your throat what her gender is,how weak and vulnerable she is, how evil males are, her ripped off clothes and her cleavage way more than all previous Tomb Raider games combined. Old Lara Croft was a badass thrill-seeker, cheerful, in charge of her own life and taking no sh*t from anyone – positive representation of women and a reasonably well-developed and unique character overallNew Lara Croft is a poor, sad, vulnerable, boring person who survives thanks to plot armor and you are gonna be reminded about her being sad and vulnerable every 15 minutes or need to protect this fragile womanIts even more jarring when considering that 80% of this game is a brainless corridor shooter unlike previous Tomb Raider games which did focus way more on exploration and solving puzzles than combat.Graphics is nice and shiny like any other double A game that was released in 2013. Nothing special about visuals tho. Here is the grass, here is Lara's hair, here are the lens flare, here is a bit of brown, here is a lot of white (mostly on walls)...A large map with lots of unique locations such as forest, cave, beach, forest #2, cave #2, cave #3, mountains with and without a snow,each filled with ton of collectibles.Kinda shame that every single one of them is a boring thrash with equally boring description.At least you get extra experience points for collecting them so they aren't completely worthlessTitular tomb raiding is uninspired as f*ck tho:a)Find one of 9(8 plus paid DLC)tombsb)Solve a puzzle that would take a blind paraplegic 5 minutes to solve itc)Exit tomb disappointedNo amazing visuals,artifacts or creatures in them - only small exp boost.Generic multiplayer deathmatch shoved in right before game release out of fear that singleplayer games are deadIronically, it was dead on arrival but that didn't stop Square Enix to fully milk it by releasing 20 DLCs (4 maps,6 weapon skins, 10 character skins)for it.You can buy 5 ""skill points"" DLC's(each sold seperatly) for singleplayer mode. Basically paid cheats""Tomb of the Lost Adventurer"" DLC - a small, boring tomb with a simple puzzle that will take you 3 minutes to solve. Unless of course your puzzle won't glitch out or Lara won't fall through the floor because this piece of paid DLC content is EXTREMELY buggy and developers didn't gave a damn about fixing it.Why this game is even called a Tomb Raider?Same reason why Bioshock Infinite exist.The game has nothing to do with original franchise in term of locations, gameplay or characters but IP sells so its a easy profit and you can bait people on nostalgiaAt least this game could have a moment when Lara need to cut off her destroyed pants into ""shorts"" and dual wield pistols while shooting a horde of deadly monstersThis game refers paranormal and supernatural stuff many times but there is no typical Tomb Raider monsters to fight?But of course they will taunt you with QTE where Lara is killing akimbo style main bad guy because ""Hey guys, you remember that this is a Tomb Raider game, right?"" ""Guys, lets remove all the video game fun and put more realistic scenario with focus on dull story with boring characters""Ok,this franchise is dead to me. Instead of Tomb Raider we get get another generic third person shooter about shooting generic humans?I take ANY of old Tomb Rider games over this so-called ""reboot trilogy"".""Uncharted: the Female Edition"" is definitely not for me but if you like third person cover shooters so much - feel free to give it a try,its around 3$ during a sale."

Combat and movement mechanics are smooth, although if I had to complain about something it would be that the Dodge Counter ability makes things a little too easy. In games like this the most annoying part is often looking for the last collectibles. There's a single egg you missed on the roof of a building in the first village or some such. Tomb Raider did this right. There's the enhanced vision, called Survival Instinct here, that highlights items of interest and there's a convenient fast travel system that places a waypoint in each zone, two in the extra large ones just for that extra bit of help. Completely eliminated any sense of ""this is tedious and boring because I'm running everywhere"" for me.On a sidenote, the multiplayer portion was bugged for me. Every time I launched the game all my unlocks and levels were reset. This made the achievement True Commitment (Reach level 60 in multiplayer) very interesting for me. I prefer not to do things like downloading other people's save files so I took an all-nighter to grind from 1-60 for twelve straight hours. True commitment indeed...

After receiving the Assault Rifle, it becomes more of a third-erspon shooter than a real adventure, and Stealth becomes optional, since you can mow everything down with good aim.Also you don't need to worry about ammunition or arrows, since you have plenty, if you use it correctly, so a survival feeling never really comes up, or only at the beginning fo the game.But all these things aside, the game was really fun to play.Story was good, nothing special but Tom Raider typcial good.You got tombs, you got ancient kings and queens, things to uncover and explore, and some jump and run sequences with small and easy puzzles.You can compre it to the Uncharted games if you want, which isn't a bad thing at all.Sound was pretty good too.Gunshots were loud and noisy.The Soundtrack was always on top with the scenes and the voice acting was also very good.All in all a very good an solid game.Probably a 7,7/10 or even a solid 8 for me.Nothing special, but still a very enjoyable ride.Can't wait to play the second game and the soon third one."

With the 10 hours of this game that I have played so far this game is extremely fun. It does a fantastic job with story telling and the stealth makes you feel like a boss. Even though the combat does have some flaws. You arent able to hip fire or blind fire which limits your combat options to sitting behind a rock peaking out with your bow to pluck one enemy at a time. The puzzles are pretty decent and require at least some thought. Over all if you are debating about getting this game Im gonna say this is a must have.

This is before she took up here title as the Tomb Raider, this is a story of girl who becomes a woman, innocence is taken as Lara is washed ashore the mystery island she and her crew have been in search for, but the myths were true, the storm that wrecked her ship and crew leave them abandoned and helpless. the island is full of hostile marauders who only want to get off the island themselves. From a innocent archeoligist turned killer Tomb Raider, Lara does what she has to. Survive, and protect her fellow friends and crew. I beat single player campaign in 9 hours with 74% completion. I played for the story in preparation for Shadow of the Tomb Raider. Story: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Puzzles/Tombs: 5/10Overall: 8/10Buy Price Reccomendation: $19.99 or lower ( I paid $4.72 ) ( I base a games worth on a model , i should get an hour for every doller spent, unless the story makes up and leaves a emotional impression. in this case the story was good but not life changing or emotional, i definently got my 5 bucks worth and a completion time of 9 hours.The game is centered around character development for lara, the antagonist is rather weak yet you understand the reasoning just not the actions. I did play this just to burn through story, but even doing that i cam across 5 tombs and enough collectibles that were in my straight path to complete the game at 74%. the puzzles are not that hard, usually if i was having an issue it was because i was way overthinking it and it was simpler than my mind was jumping to. The gun play is well worked with the way lara moves and operates, i played most of game just pistol and bow. shotgun and assault rifle i probably used four times. I focused on head shots, and the pistol fully upgraded is rather powerful with low recoil meaning john wick headshots and john wick speed. Upgrade and level up mechanics are just present enough to give you that rpg hooking good feel to keep you motivated to press on even if the story is slow at the moment."

5839,A Well-Done Skeleton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PanzSan/,1,,1,10.0,July,"23,",174,0,1,"Story: 4/5A pretty cliche story: People get shipwrecked on a haunted island with an evil cult. Nevertheless, I found the characters likeable enough to become invested. Also the collectables make references to other things that happened on the island, adding a bit more depth to the world.Environments: 5/5 All of the forests, canyons, and temples Lara goes through are quite impressive and well decorated. There are also a lot of places where you see large areas of the map at once, which is nice. This is pretty demanding on your computer however. Enemies: 4/5Tomb Raider has the basic enemy types: melee, ranged, explosive, etc. They're easy enough to deal with but become better protected as the game goes on, presenting a greater challenge. This prevents them from becomming cannon fodder as you unpgrade your equipment and keeps fights interesting. Occasionally you will run into a much tanker person in a sort of mini-boss fight. Gameplay: 3/5Basic third-person shooter with some parkour added. You can only jump onto things painted white, so climbing is pretty linear. I found the environemntal puzzles pretty interesting but easy enough to figure out quickly. There are a lot of relics and documents scattered around that you can find, but I'm not a completionist so I wasn't interested in hunting them all down. Weapons: 4/5There are four weapons available in this game: Bow (obviously), shotgun, pistol, and assault rifle. Each of them are pretty useful in different situations so I didn't find myself relying on only one. You can upgrade them to increase damage, reduce reloading speed, etc.Overall: 4/5While the gameplay is fairly unoriginal, the story and environments make up for this to give you a satisfying gamplay expierence.I recommend it."

Locations are beautiful.The game itself is optimised decently for a PC port.Most of the weapons are satisfying to use and trick kills have impact to them.The tombs, relics and journal entries are absolutely fascinating and make for a deeply immersive experience.But the meat of any game is still the story.The narrative itself sees Lara Croft starting out on her first adventure to discover the origin of the Japanese, the mythical kingdom of Yamatai, ruled by their legendary Empress, Himiko. The story recounts her many losses and the sacrifices that made her who she is today.When characters started dropping, there is a strong pervading sense of pathos, sadness and tragedy.""Sacrifice is a choice you make. Loss is a choice made for you."" -RIP Surrogate Father FigurePutting historical inaccuracy aside, the overall tone set by the reboot feels a tad too dark for the Tomb raider franchise. In fact, in its contradictions (""I hate tombs"") and overall grittiness, TR 2013 has failed to fully encapsulate what Previous games/movies built upon -the romance of adventure and the appeal of Lara as a character.The pain of trauma in this game is intense. It's incredibly hard to see Lara as the confident witty go-to adventurer that we all know and love. It feels like they are trying too hard to follow the trend set by Far Cry 3 or Uncharted, rather than doing its own thing.In addition, GPS caches and challenges are also an incredible pain in the ass to finish, esp. for challenges since they don't appear on the in-game map.If you can put that aside and the QTEs, the game itself is still a solid 8/10.Now for the mammoth in the room- the Multiplayer.It is dead, understandably because it is a game from 2013.And if by some misbegotten miracle, you managed to find a casual game, it is populated by hackers. The lag is real unless you live in Eastern Europe. Server crashes are frequent, costing salvage and time.It is also impossible to find a ranked match of any sort.That is not even delving into the virtual graveyard that is DLC.Considering there are 15 MP achievements,completionists and purists would find it infuriating.Achievements like 'Shopaholic' & 'True Committment' require a lot of grinding.The grinding process itself is enough to drain any possible goodwill that any person could engender for TR MP.The MP maps are nice to look at but not well-designed. Spawn-killing is a common occurrence and practically decides the outcome of matches. Weapons and abilities are completely unbalanced and Solarii also have advantages over survivorsTL;DR:In conclusion, if you are looking to purchase Tomb raider, do it for the Single player.If you are a 100% nutter, this game is not for you."

All collectibles can be collected until the point of no return, which is clearly marked.The only thing I didn't like about the game is, that there are many Quick Time Events (especially in the beginning).As i do not like QTEs, this is a negative point for me, allthough I should mention, that the QTEs in this game are pretty well done and didn't kill my enjoyment, as they did in many other games.Technically the game is also very good.I didn't find any bugs, which is a rare pleasure.I do have to mention though, that the game crashed twice in my whole playtime.

Being an adventure oriented action game with a mix of puzzle here and there, it was intriguing enough to make me stick around and beat the main storyline.What more can I say? The world is beautifully set and can be haunting at times as well.I enjoyed listening to documents by various characters especially those linked with the history of the island.Now that the good parts are done with, I did have some issues with the gameplay itself as I felt the movement of the character was not all that smooth but you can work with it. Also if we go storywise, it's still hard to believe that an innocent girl would muster up so much strength and courage to fight what lies ahead of her.Overall I had a good experience and now I'm off to read the lore."

If you're a fan off Uncharted (Like me) you will love the Tomb Raider reboot series and the 3rd one is coming out in a few months, so no better time than now to get caught up on the story.

This isn't helped by the sheer number of quick-time-events and scripted jump scares, which start out as impressive, but soon grow pretty boring.

The idea of group of people, separated from world and loosing their humanity in fight for surviving, is delivered great. As well as the feeling of forsaken places build by non-residents. Very impressive. Could chalange some titlles from cinema. But a bit enforced.(there are to many pieces that waited hundreds years to fell of when Lara is near) Well the mistic story is just fine. But I had a big problem with subcharacters. You are shown Laras crew on boat in short scene and than they get separated. So rescuing of friends in one of main motivator of Lara through game. And writers are trying to make you empathize Laras desire to save them, but because their characters are not disclosed in any way... I honestly just was thinking though game ""Who are this people?"" Archaeologist is someone who is supposed to be spend large amount of his life studing, but Lara shows just inhuman stamina on par with special forces. Seriously, Indiana Jones looks just faintly comparered to her. We are shown a bit of emotion scence whe she is uneasy of killing a deer or shocked after killing human, but than she is just allright cutting though hundreds. I know game protagonist usually do unrealistic things, but they usually have some backgound for it, be it soldier, expirenced adventure or magic hero choused by fate. But writers of Tomb Raider put some effort in creating unexpirienced image of Lara and than just pew and she is absolutely fine with anything. There are a lot of elements in game like puzzles, stealth etc. But considering the fact that dealing with enemies is mainly shootign you can say that this is shooter. And if you want just shooter than you can easely pick something better. The problem is that you have too shoot too often to see game as adventere, but shooting isn't that fun.Superposition.On one hand good game, no regrets of buying.On the other no shame in not playing. Can't say that you missed great expirience or something."

The game does eventually pick up and becomes more fun to the point where I wanted to finish it. I will say that there are a multitude of bugs and visual ""goofiness"" going on. I was never interested in the old school TR's in a similar way I was never really interested in the old Jame Bond movies: the character is a little _too_ invulnerable. This game she just gets her @$$ kicked. Repeatedly. It makes her feel human (also, comparing to the newer Bond movies: I like them more because he also gets his @$$ kicked.) Lara Croft has the best-worst (worst-best?) luck in the world in this game... I'm gonna avoid spoilers but holy crap her luck is just good enough not to die in plain horrible luck scenarios. Yes, it's a video game but gaht-dang!Overall I had fun in what was about a 12 hour game and I'd recommend it on sale. Maaaaaaybe even full price if you like this kind of game but If you can get it for $1/hr you'll be happy. Apparently there is some multiplayer components to it that I haven't tried so there's that.Also, the choppiness or ""lag"" you see in the videos here on steam are actually in game; it's not your internet crapping out...If you want to see the livestream gameplay of the game you can check out my !"

It's the same kind of joy I get from bad horror movies that take themselves seriously, well and beyond their scope, with no apparent self awareness (outside of death animations).Everything in this is turned up to 11, good or bad.A deer spawned ontop of me after a cutscene.A wolf was biting my neck before it told me the prompt to prevent that from happening.You can mash the grab ladder button to float in place.The first bad leader guy you meet starts on the obvious path to rape Lara at the first, and second opportunity.I opened a journal and promptly clipped into a wall and was pushed to the top of a building.Lara can use animal bones to make a pistol shoot burst fire.Enemies will set a building on fire to kill you, while they're inside it.Bodies will bounce into the air after being shot with an arrow.Lara opts out of taking available water or food from survival packs when in a survival situation, preferring to eat rats.Lara will happily light a torch after being doused in fuel.Lara will have her hands slip on pitted and rough ladder rungs, but be able to rapidly jump and climb with a single climbing axe.The man who trained Lara loses in a fight to wolves while armed with a pistol.A baddy opts out of kidnapping Lara for no clear reason.Lara can, in fact break, these cuffs.  Purely through strength is able to break five times wrapped rope around her wrists.The cut scene prompts use almsot the same icon for two different button prompts, requiring you to memorize or read the on screen assist text a lot of the time.Every single one of Lara's death is hilarious because of how the physics operate, or over the top graphic, and there are many such instances.This is the best worst game I've ever played."

For some strange reason I keep coming back too this game, sometimes I play from beginning to end, sometimes I gather some... stuff that needs to be gathered. Open world games, amirite? But never even once I felt like the game is boring, even though I've replayed it million times. I'm gonna try and tell y'all.Tomb Raider was my first game in the TR series, though I've played with the original one a couple hours before realizing it's not as fun as I though it is. Don't get me wong, that was years ago, since then I've finished most of the Tomb Raider games. But this one is easily my favourite for a couple of reasons. So, let's see: Even though it's nothing new - not in a negtive way - it kept me yearning for more. Sitting down to play a couple of minutes was a no-no, since I always wanted to know what's going to happen. Luckily, there are points in the game, where one can feel it might be the prfect time to stop. Deep and interesting enough story, to be worth playing for it, though I could name some games with better stories, so I would say it's kind of a 7-8/10 Though I hate rating a game based on graphics, it's becoming unavoidable, so here goes nothing. The game came out in 2013. I first played it in 2014. I was amazed how awesome it looked. Character models were so realistic, and then there was this tressFX hair stuff (which my PC was incapable of using), which made the hair look more realistic. The hair. Yep. Totally necessary. Well anyways, back then I would've given it an easy 10/10, but since then I've played older games with the same graphical level, so I'm going to say 8.5/10. Yeah. Okay, with that done, let's get to the fun part. Awesome. Simply awesome. Probably one of the reasons I like this game so much. Big (and I mean big, not unnecessarily huge, but big enough to enjoy) open world, some light parkour (nothing extra), rope sliding, rope arrow, wall climbing etc. About fighting, well, your normal TPS game, shoot 'em til they drop dead. Simple enough. You might wait for me to say: ""BUT"", but that's not gonna happen. Sadly. Though ""bossfights"" have quick-time events, it's nothing too extra. Hunting is fun as is stealth. No big puzzles, and they are mostly in lategame. Tombs are forgottable, and there are barely any, though it's fun figuring them out for the first time. All in all, it's an easy 9.5/10, probably the strongest part of the game. Fits, nothing extra. Good to listen to, but not a masterpiece. 6-7/10. Pretty freaking awesome. Lara's sound is just so nice to listen to. Really, it is. Others are good as well, but you won't hear them nearly as much as Lara. 9/10, as I personally never liked one of the main characetrs sound, but really it is up for individuals to decide.Ending & TL;DR:One of my all-time favourite games, which never ceases to amaze me. Everything is well done, and personally I prefer this over RotTR, even though both are pretty amazing. Play this before RotTR or (the upcoming) SotTR, as the story connects throughout the games. Doesn't matter if you've played the old games or not, since it's a reboot. Points for the review are in the spoiler tags, next to the headlines."

If you can get over that you have a great time. The single free roam levels are rather smallish but packed with things to collect. Speaking of collecting - you don't need any of the DLCs to 100% the game. I managed to get  all important skillz and weapon upgrades about midgame, I maxed out everything after the Survivor Camp Level and finished the game with 100% and over 3000 scrap parts left.Unfortunately the additional skins don't show the ordeals Lara went through, like the default skin and are therefore more distracting than immersive. Also unfortunately, melee is severly underdeveloped in this game, too. Don't expect any Batman-Style brawling. Rather expect some franatic cover-style shootings - they always come in hordes.All in all you don't need anything but the good base game."

The bad guy is about as generic as they come. The combat is stiff, scripted, and dull.Enemies aren't even really a threat to you on normal mode, often firing around you and not hitting you at all even if you aren't even moving. There are sections where the enemy instantly knows where you are so stealth is out the window, and the stealth sections force you to be quiet  if you don't there is normally something that will kill you instantly.There are WAY too many quicktime events that don't need to be there.The game is entirely linear with no variation at all.Everything in the game you find gives you XP or Scrap and nothing else.The upgrades are mostly pointless. More damage, less recoil, generic number changes. The level up perks do generic crap like give you more xp for headshots, carry more ammo, or find ammo on bodies.Ammo isn't even a concern it is literally lying around everywhere, why have so many skills dedicated to finding more? Most of the skills don't even really effect the gameplay.So much ♥♥♥♥ in the game is there to just waste time and you don't need to do any of it. Collectibles and side quests are wastes of time and leveling up does very little so there isn't even really a point to doing it since most of the fighting is insanely easy.Even getting new guns is pointless, the bow kills in one or two shots and the rifle kills in 4 or 5. Why do I even need the gun? It's even funnier when enemies go to take cover and their entire torso is sticking out and they don't even try to fight back for ten seconds or so.All in all the game would have made a great movie, but it makes a very dull game. So many areas where Laura flat out says ""I can't do that right now"" refuses to crawl or crouch until the game makes you do it, refuses to run untill the game decides its ok to run again.This would have been much better if telltale had been the devs."

5936,Cadis Etrama Di Raziel,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018443943/,1,,1,17.9,June,"8,",572,0,1,"Admittedly, I have always had a soft spot for the Tomb Raider franchise.  Since Tomb Raider 2 on PS2, I have been a fan of Lara Croft and her adventures.  So I was very excited when Tomb Raider (2013 reboot) released to glowing reviews.  I just finished the game a couple of days ago and I believe that it was a very fun, accessible and endearing experience.  Pros:+ Lara's journey as an adventurer and archaeologist begins with a bang (oh you dirty minded ♥♥♥♥♥, not that kind of *bang*).  It is interesting to watch her physical and mental evolution from start to finish.+ I loved the lost island setting with the crazed cultists.  + The level design is also very well thought.  + Exploration is at the forefront of the game, yet the combat is brutal, stealthy, and very satisfying.  The puzzles require you to think a bit without causing brain damage!  Also, the game has basic rpg character progression elements.+ Has some freaky moments with all the corpses and sacrifices... Makes you want to protect Lara from those dangers.Cons:- The supporting characters are boring and one dimensional.  Some of their lines made me cringe.- Would have liked a couple of good boss fights or so.- Some of the character progression skills/perks felt kind of useless.  I think they could have come up with better options.Final note: I didn't test the multiplayer as I was mainly interested in the solo campaign. Verdict: 9/10."
5937,gamer(shot),https://steamcommunity.com/id/gamershotty/,1,,1,17.8,June,"2,",98,0,1,"So, I finally got around to playing this.I'd put it off for long enough, it was praised in 2013 and it still being praised now. So, after all this time... is it good? Yes and no (mostly yes).The game starts of slow, but most adventure type games do, you always need some event leading up to something bigger. Tomb raider does this in regular fashion, crashed boat, unknown island, blah blah blah. But once you get further the actual game does shine through. Combat is both hard and rewarding, exploring is quite enjoyable as you search for hidden clues that will help you piece the story together and upgrade your skills and gear. It's surprising for a game to do this in a such an enjoyable way, usually finding all the hidden items is boring. Tomb Raider gives them a purpose and so making them relevant.However, some issues do arise when you get deeper. Eventually the combat felt annoying and painful. I had so many weapons that if you pressed one button you’d fire a grenade from your bow or use the wrong shotgun shell. Switching weapons hindered me in battle as I it would change the type of ammo. Hand to hand combat is alright, but mostly consist of dodging, doing a quick time event then mashing the F key. It does get a little 'samey'. Climbing as well was very enjoyable, but a lot of glitches came up where Lara would just miss a jump or not grab onto something. Leading to you trying over and over. I understand the game is hard (played on hard for reference) but it does become tedious.The other thing I did not enjoy was crashing to the desktop 4 or 5 times. I don't know if it’s my hardware, but my pc can handle this game easily. I think it was either due to the climbing mechanics or optimisation issues.Overall this is definitely an amazing game. You can see all the effort put into and does make for a very rewarding experience. It is satisficing to see Lara overcome and survive just like anyone else would have to do (easy to relate to). Some issues did ruin my experiences in areas, but not enough for me to stop playing.8/10."

Crystal Dynamics saved the whole Tomb Raider franchise with the 2006 reboot Legend, and continues to make great TR games ever since. This is another reboot from 2013, but it takes back to Lara's roots, and explains how she bacame an adventurer and ""tomb raider"", whom we all know and love.This game went to uncharted territories (pun intended) with the gameplay: it's basically an action-adventure movie, and a quite good one too. The story is interesting and well directed, the voice acting is great. Of course the characters are quite cliché (the young, sexy and smart adventurer, who survives everything, the nerd guy, who has a secret crush on our protagonist, the big, humble guy, the jerk, who only cares about money and fame,  the father figure,  and so on), but it's all expected, and doesn't bother me.As for the gameplay, there is never a single dull moment. The environments are beautiful and interesting to explore, and the game urges you to do so with plethora of collectibles and challenges. You gain experience and level up as you progress, and you can learn new skills this way, becoming more and more of a survival specialist. You can also collect salvage and upgrade your weapons too (the bow is freaking awesome btw).So if you like action-adventure games or movies like Indiana Jones, you should definitely play this game."

Although linear, the game does give the opportunity to play the levels again to complete challenges.The combat system is fun and challenging to play. The transitions between cutscenes and levels are very smooth and fluid. The upgrades that can be done make it worthwhile to explore the world.After playing quite a lot of horrible PC ports, this one felt really satisfying to play. The mouse sensitivity and the keyboard controls felt like playing a traditional PC game. The only thing I would dislike about this game would be the button mashing.

(Yes, I know this is a multiplatform game). The visuals are so beautiful and it performs so well. Even though the animations can get quite repetitive the developers did a superb job making me yearn for more and more as I progressed leveling up Lara and her skillsets/weapons. The level design was meticulously made as if with care by Michael Bay himself. If grandiose explosions and the occassional stealth approach are your cup of tea, I highly recommend buying this game. The only real two cons I have are more ""dungeony"" side tombs amd more difficult puzzles to solve as they were pretty basic. TLDRBUY IT. YOU DON'T NEED TO WAIT FOR A SALE.

Even the few tombs that are in the game are dead simple and takes less than 5 minutes. But if you see the game on its own and don’t compare it to the rest of the franchise it is a really good single player game with a solid story, good controls and gameplay, great graphics, great audio including voice acting that shows emotions really well and animations with a focus on detail.The multiplayer on the other hand is not much to look at, especially considering there are barely any players even playing it at this point which also means you cannot get all the achievements unless you happen to have a full server worth of friends willing to help you out. Multiplayer is a little fun for a short while but is definitely not the main factor (or any factor) to consider buying this game for.A quick tip is to not bother with any of the DLC, they include tombs that are beaten within 5 minutes and skins that don’t show the cloth degradation throughout the single player which is a bit disappointing."

However, I do have acknowledgement of the character and I have played some of the Uncharted series on PlayStation 4 which is basically a copy of the tomb raider games. The only difference between them is that the Uncharted series is about finding rare and expensive historic treasure. Whereas, tomb raider is more about finding lost artifacts to do with myths and legends. Tomb raider is an action-adventure, survival game. It’s set in a third person perspective, where you take control of a character called Lara Croft. Showing you her origin of how she turned from a frightened young woman into a hardened survivor. With little experience she must adapt to survive which means pushing her body beyond the limits of the human endurance.My overall view is that it’s an amazing game you have plenty to do whether that be trying to complete all the achievements or find all the hidden tombs or even just playing the game. The game isn’t to short or long either took me almost 15 hours to complete it. This game must be one of the best games I have ever played. If you havent got it, you should pick it up."

I recomend playing regardless!- camera shakyness: could of done without it. bit tiresome on the eyes when exploring.- at times it feels the AI will know your position when it shouldn't.- some cinamatic action scenes and puzzles are difficult enough to remove you from the easy going gameplay (at least in normal mode)- not much actual tomb raiding, but i guess the devs went for the gentle introduction to the tomb raider world, instead of putting the player into tombs for hours like the old games. it's more of an action shooter. which is cool though. in fact, on my second play through i skipped most tombs (seeing theiy're optional) as i enjoyed the more action part of the game! so maybe not enough tombs was a good thing."

I played one of the older TR games (TR: Legends) and I really enjoyed it.  I'm usually not one to care much for linear mission-based games, but this one is a bit different.  Instead of breaking it into missions, you one through without stopping.  It's technically still a misson, but it's hard to tell.  There are areas that are very large for collecting items and such after the story is over.  The story was very good.  They did a very good job of making Lara an unexperienced archeologist and turning her into a survivor by the end and throughout the game you become more skilled at hunting and killing with skills learned through level ups.  The characters are memorable and you can actually feel for them in their plight.  The weapons are better than old TR games, a typical third-person shooter dynamic.  My favorite part is using the bow; for some reason it's really fun.  The story was good enough I'm sure I'll play it again.  Definitely get it!:::EDIT:::For some reason, I keep coming back to this game. I've played through it a few times, and for some reason, it just doesn't lose it's charm every time. It's always enjoyable, and I always find something I missed the first time. I've yet to play the other two reboot games (probably getting them soon), but this is a great game for sure."

But you know full controller support.It's not often that you find a game that is not annoyingly hard to aim with the controller, without using auto aim, this one was pleasant, so if you are looking to improve your controller aim I extremely recommend. Enemies (AI) and Stealth:The enemies aren't that smart but if you play cocky you're gonna die for sure. One thing that I didn't like is that they always know where you are when you are first spotted so no running and hiding. That's kinda bothered me because I was looking to play stealth and sometimes when you ruin it you can't just get out of sight.Story and EnvironmentKinda silly sometimes, I was really driven by the lore hidden around the island, all the mix of different eras there made me hungry for more, there is also that amazing simple feature that you can examine artifacts that you find around the place. Sometimes it will give extra details about it. A very nice.AnimalsThat was kinda frustrating because I was thinking that I was going to play against some kind of survival element, the game introduces you to cold, hunger, hunt and fire. Then it throws it into the trash because it was just about farming XP. Thinking about why from the beginning to the end, Why?Even then the animals look stupid and confused about what to do with you, they run, hit their heads in walls and look like they are high and in a paranoia attack.ThrillOften the game is going to put you in a situation that you will feel your heart race, that was what I mostly liked,heights, chases, runs, jumps, vistas, they nailed that part. Maybe the speed when you're sliding some ropes could be faster and they definitely feel weird sometimes, but then I'm just being perfectionist.Customization:It's fine, I didn't even thought it was going to happen so it was a good surprise, nothing special about it.The game sometimes restrain your progress until you get some weapon upgrades, level design stuff but, you know, personal opinion, I kinda don't like to be restrained of some game área because you want me to follow a X story line.Overall:Pretty game, interesting characters and relationships, good story, good graphics, nice map, nice details. No regrets about buying it and I will keep playing and exploring the rest of the island.OH THE COMBATI liked it it's simple and objective, I played stealth so I tried to take all of them with a arrow through the eye, waiting conversations to end and them to turn their backs to each other. When you need to face them directly like some big enemies you will find, it can get a little desperate (They love to put you in tight spaces)."

(more than one time)Played on best graphic settings possible.--- this game ... a young unexperienced lady who never hold a gun before, goes on monstrous killing sphere, slaying hundreds of professional soldiers with automatic weapons and never ending stocks of explosives. This hordes of japanese, US and russian marianes are organized in squads, all sweeping every inch of the island with one single goal - find and kill Lara.Even with bullet-proof gas masks, inpenetrable shields (not even with a grenade louncher), cover, number and equipment advantages, they die faster than allies on Omaha beach back in 1944; every single one murdered by Lara.... the good thing is that Lara is practicaly inmmortal, surviving slides and falls that would break all her bones, still hapilly running after pulling a rusty iron rod out of her belly, floundering through toxic water with open wounds, successfuly hiding her total exhaustion in front of the player... a hidden island, always covered by storms and awful weather, which whoever enters can never leave. For several hundred years ships and planes of all sizes kept crashing on the cliffs with no one ever getting away, telling the rest of the world about such place. A tens of thousands men - soldiers, engineers, workers and builders has been needed in order to construct concrete bunkers and frotresses all around the island; both digging into the solid mountain and erecting massive steel construction dozens meters high, moving all material around in trucks which limited amount of fuel apparently wasn't any problem, nor even single suitable road through the mountainous impassable terrain.... besides the enormous number of people during WW2 and ships from nearly every century which sailed nearby, thousands of former inhabitants including elite samurai-style warriors, no one has ever been there. Oh, and I almost forgot literally milions of bloody body parts in various stages of decay all over the place - in every tomb, building, cave or source of water - making this place thanks to deadly diseases like typhus, cholera or plague a biggest and the most dangerous biological weapon on Earth. Needless to say that all of the medical equipement reaching this island has to be salvaged from the crashed wrecks.... the level designers made a great job on forcing you the usage of weapons they want by giving you only ammo for that one. This choice differs from map to map so once you finally start getting into one type of weapon, you have to switch again. And again. But in case you would like to try some fight you had fun in once again, after you finished the game, you have to play the whole game again to that point, because the savepoints are forced too.Must be a bless to have such godlike all-knowing a game designer, who already perfectly know what all the players will enjoy, so there's no need to implement anything else at all, other than the designer linear vision.---Besides all its flaws it is still an enjoyable piece of art featuring good action and breathtaking views.A great atmosphere has been built - at the expense of any sense.The game is drown down by 'quick timer' events, which are annoying, boring and wrong by design. What's more - bugged on several places, not showing you what to press.This game is clearly primary aimed at console players, however the PC version works even better IMHO."

The graphics are stunning from the diverse environments to the character models. The game does a great job at showcasing your beautiful surroundings. Tomb Raider has an excellent story that marks the transformation of Lara Croft the young expeditionist into Lara Croft the deadly tomb raider. You really get a sense of the internal struggle Lara faces having to transfrom into a killing machine. The cut scenes are emotionally intense and well acted. The game is very cinematic and sometimes you feel like your watching a movie. The gameplay is addrenaline packed and the third person perspective suits the action well. Climbing and traversing the terrain never felt so fun and dangerous. Melee combat is smooth and brutal. Your trusty pickaxe used for climbing makes a nasty weapon. Although there are not a ton of different guns to use, each has its purpose. They do a good job of making Lara feel powerful and a destructive force. Especially when you utilize the bow and arrow effectively you feel like your Legolas from LOTR. There are alot of unique caves, tombs, and other locations to explore. There is the odd puzzle that is never too difficult but adds a nice element to the game. There are tons of collectibles and lore to unearth. The multiplayer though non active is entertaining if you can find some people to play. All in all this is a must play for any gamer and a truly enjoyable and memorable ride."

There's countries in the world where people are thrown off buildings for lesser ""crimes"". Now that those unpleasantries are out of the way, I'll review the quality of the actual product on sale here. First up, it's a mobile app which doesn't appear to go full screen, so getting used to the somewhat ""windowed"" presentation is a bit of a pain. It also doesn't ""save"" or ""bookmark"" the last page you were at, meaning you have to remember this for yourself, then use the Contents page to fast-track back to it. Not exactly ideal. There's some novel interactive touches, like polls which feed back instant internet-based survey results, and photos you can pan around 360 degrees; a spirit of innovation which is regrettably sullied by the videos which lazily link out to YouTube, meaning you'd better have some extra bandwidth up your sleeve if you wanna get the full experience.This said, the content is nice enough, and of evident interest to anyone who either adored the game or plans on making games of their own. Is it worth two bucks? Guess so. Half that price on sale, easy. Though the more penny-pinching among you could probably save yourself the money by just Googling and Youtubing much the same information. For the rest of us who don't mind paying a small price for the quasi-convenience of it all, it's a nice enough package, if quite a ways from ""essential""."
6089,Being a Simp For the Homies,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297519230/,1,,1,21.6,February,"2,",58,1,1,"I absolutely love this game. Reboot, origin or otherwise, this is one of the best games to come out in a long time. So here we go with the review and what to expect from it. I'm not going to only compare this Tomb Raider to older games that have been released since Late 90's, simply because that isn't fair. However, I will touch on it around the ideas of how it is better. Here we go!First of all, the story. It's actually riveting and told so damn well, you get freaked out, giddy and excited at every single turn. Tomb Raider is no longer jumping around and climbing without knowing why then suddenly a weird or random cutscene. This means a lot to me personally. I grew up with this franchise, and in the beginning, none of it made sense, so seeing that being changed was very enticing and straight up badass to me. Next off, let's look at graphics. Lara Croft is not accentuated with a square rack that looks like the remainder of a Hungryman tray or a cafeteria pan anymore. She looks like a real woman nowadays, which is actually really nice. And the surroundings are absolutely beautiful as well. It all fits very nicely, and not to mention, Lara looks anatomically correct and appropriate. Sorry pervs and weirdos, no more watermelon boobs haha! Anyways... This is probably my favorite aspect, because every little detail of this game from wounds to people EVEN FIRE look and act pretty realistically, which is highly astounding and makes my heart glow warm. The graphic designs and details of Tomb Raider outshoot even games to the likes of Skyrim, which is known for super good graphics! Lastly, I want to say this. This game franchise and main character got a rework of a lifetime, and one it definitely deserved. If you are like me and picked this up in the days of old 1990's, you will understand what I mean. If you are new, let me explain the feeling. I personally was so very pleased with how everything changed, how it all looks now, and how it works. It shocked me to see an actual real looking Lara Croft for the very first time, and it really warmed my heart. A lot of fun and memories and precious moments with friends and family came out of this franchise of games, and the sense of awe seriously put me in such a state of nostalgia and love for the game, I can't even figure out how to word it properly. I love this game because of that aspect...So there you have it. Ratings, 4.9/5 stars, 9.8/10 ranking. I'm thinking realistically here, not giving it 10/10 Because it's one of my all-time favorites lol thank you for taking the time to read my review!"

6093,Toaster Bazooka,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198093221503/,1,,1,20.6,January,"28,",89,0,1,"I thought it was fun. Good combat, fluid controls and animations. Quick time events are annoying, as usual.The story is kind of boring. Basically, it's ""Hello, I'm Mr. Evil Dude. I kidnapped your friends and enslaved your sister, because.......I'm a  s u r v i v o r (that last part was taken straight from the game).Survival seems to be a recurring theme, despite how limited its actual gameplay implementation is. As much as I hoped the game would blossom out into a free roam survival sim, you only have to get food once, and it's perfectly fine to wear a tank top in -5 C weather. Also, you can tank multiple .50 cal rounds as long as you're not in a cutscene.The characters are all either one of two things: annoying or annoying. There's the dickish scientist who would stare down the barrel of an alien ray gun muttering ""fascinating,"" while his friends get murdered in the background. There's also the obligatory strong, defiant black woman who don't need no man. The heavy weapons guy made a nice appearance, but I'm not sure how I felt about his mohawk. Samantha is a twice-over damsel in distress whose very existence is tailored to the sarcastic remarks I mutter during every cutscene. There's Bill from Left 4 Dead, who they gave a Scottish accent. There's also the rugged, handsome father figure who's there to tell Lara she's strong after she murdered a small batallion of insane islanders.Then there's Lara herself. She's got the figure of a stickman, but she's stronger than a heavyweight champion. She also has this huge tendency to talk to herself. Once, she was crouched next to a parade of immortal weeaboo soldiers, and she muttered very loudly: I   h A V e  t O   k e E P   q U i E T. Her favorite word is ""bastard,"" which she screams to people who are attacking her. Lara constantly grunts, huffs, and screams her way through the pain brought onto her by the environment. She's basically a sadist's squeaky toy. She's also more attrative than most supermodels, as per videogame beauty standards.Now let's talk about the weapons. You have a bow, which is your standard stealth weapon for sniping people and giggling as their friends notice their corpse. Then there's your pistol, which works well for capping people in between bow shots. You also have a shotgun, which is my personal favorite character in the game. It blows right through certain walls, and you can upgrade it to shoot incendiary buckshot at attacking weeaboos. I had a lot of fun blasting people with the shotty point blank and watching them fly off of whatever they were previously standing on. The last weapon is a rifle, which you can upgrade to an AK. This thing's basically a peashooter, but it fires rapidly enough to justify its use. Eventually, you'll get a grenade launcher for it, which you'll forget you have until the game reminds you to use it.The enemies are standard fare morons who lumber about waiting to get shot. It's really fun to murder them, even if the whole survival concept starts looking even more shallow as you watch Lara beat men to death with a pickaxe before stabbing them in the eyes with arrows. I got a bit of Half-Life 2 deja vu when I noticed a building full of explosive barrels, which I promptly destroyed and watched as the people who built it fell into the fetal position and cried over their boss's terrible urban planning.All in all, this game's worth buying if you want a watered down version of Metro's stealth combat, mixed with some nice character animations. The shotgun was still the best part."

Once you start, be ready to stay glued to your PC. Take sometime off because you won't want to stop!I played the first Tomb Raider way back when the franchise started. Back then it was ahead of its time and playing this one brought back the excitement. I haven't played anything after TR2 so I will have to run through those after I do . This is from 2013 and looks better then other big budget titles released in 2018. It's crystal clear and part of the game makes you feel like your in it. Climbing a tower and hanging on for your life looking down runs chills through you.The story is Hollywood quality with A grade acting. Its like a movie. The cutscenes are inserted perfect which gives you gameplay and some awesome scenes bringing a movie and game together. I played the game on a GeForce GTX970 in ultra and it ran smooth as butter. No bugs or gameplay glitches. Playtime is roughly 10 hours nonstop. I left mine up on pause so i clocked more hours. You can do the optional missions and extend your game if you want to complete all achevements. I skipped a few but tried to do them all. I might go back in and fast travel to the areas i skipped (once you have most skills and gear unlocked you can really kick azz).If your debating buying this, don't! Just get it and you will be writing a awesome review :)10/10 - SolidTime to install  now!"

I must say it was All jokes aside. What I mean is that this game felt like a survival game without survival aspects, except for looting and salvaging. That combined with weapon upgrades, enemy spawn rate and survivor upgrades, made it crucial to actually run around looking for ammo, salvage and even collecting fruits and hunt for XP. Often while looking for this you would stumble upon tombs, treasures and logs etc. Eventually, finding collectibles also became a priority for me, just out of pure curiosity.I felt that the combat system in this game was a bit repetetive. There are locations where you end up in some sort of arena. The enemy will spawn in waves and from the same location aswell, making the combat feel like a clay shooting competition. There are moments where you can stealth but way to few. I can't think of a better combat system, other than perhaps focus more on stealth gameplay and tone down on the arena fighting pit. You will eventually get more upgrades and weapons to fight with, and with Lara's survival instinct give you more than one option in order to kill you're enemies.The Puzzles in this game was clever and fun. Made for a nice break in the combat and just action overall.When it comes to games in general, the most important thing for me is the story. If the gameplay has some flaws but the story is great, then i'm fine with it. That is the case for this game. I noted the game was on sale and I decided to try it out, hence I started the game with minor to no expectations at all. From the start I was drawn to the story and I was eager to progress through it. Mid to late game I started to lose some interest and I kinda felt that the story grinded to a halt. It picked up towards the end though and I finished the game with the The map design in this game was amazing. The Different scenery and just the building architecture was perfect in itself. There would be moments where I would decide to just stand still and enjoy the view. Not only was the map design great, but the character design was at the same level. Not only the main character's but also the solarii design was great. The design for each class made it possible to tell what class you where fighting and what to expect from their next move. Not to mention late game, but in order to avoid major spoilers I will let the game itself show it for you.  Shortly concluded. As far as it goes for a Tomb Raider game, and compared to the older games I am in no position to say anything as I have not played them. However speaking as a new comer to the world of Lara, I can say that this game was worth every penny. Combat could have been better but the amount of possibilities and weapon choices, balanced the scale. Clever and enjoyable puzzles. Amazing and beautiful world and character design. If you want to try out the Tomb Raider franchise then don't hesitate to buy this game. As a new player, it gave me a great introduction that's for sure!"

And all the extra bits to the story you gain by picking upp collectibles.. That's a nice touch.The only thing I would change is the somewhat extreme physical abilities Lara seem to have sometimes, and the GPS cache collectibles, which are a bit too annoying at times.

Players who love collecting stuff will rejoice.The game overall feels polished and a lot more approachable than older Tomb Raider titles. I guess some would say it's more casual, but in this case I don't consider it a bad thing.Multiplayer seems dead so I didn't get a chance to try it, but I didn't buy the game for multiplayer anyway so it doesn't matter.My only complaint is that the game is overly unrealistic when it comes to Lara's survival capabilities. I know it's just a game, but the amount of beating and punishment she endures throughout the game is really over the top and hard to believe.Bonus points for Linux support."

Tact on multiplayer that could have been improve with modes like -    5.1. Tomb raiding deathmatches/ team deathmatches   5.2. Hunting matches6. Very bland facial animations (really??)Seems like they blew a part of the budget for this game with the shietty multiplayer. But the game can only be judged on the basis of its singleplayer. And it's a 8.5/10 for me. Yes, the pros very much outweigh the cons. One of the best origin stories ever made for a aharcter. And the start of the credits...

Throughout the game I only liked the combat part. The thing about the parts where it requires jumping around and climbing stuff is that it is a bit clunky, mobility wise. Sometimes I intend to jump up, but because Lara's moving side ways, pressing W + Space still makes Lara jump in the direction her character is moving; to the side, which makes it a little frustrating at times as I fall to my death.But other than that, no complains.

6178,painedforever,https://steamcommunity.com/id/painedforever/,1,,1,24.3,December,"3,",376,0,1,"Just as a disclaimer, I've 100% completed the single-player campaign, but I'm not going to chase after all of the achievements because (a) many of them are multiplayer and (b) some of them are annoying. And I'm a bit burned out on Tomb Raider.So, Tomb Raider (2013) is a hard reboot of the venerable Tomb Raider franchise. I was never really a fan of Lara Croft's adventures, though I did play partway through her previous soft reboot, Tomb Raider Legend. I didn't get far, and kept getting killed during a particular encounter. I did like the exploring parts, and the mansion. This Tomb Raider is different however. It doesn't start us off with a smug-as-hell, confident-as-hell Lara Croft, who was played by Angelina Jolie and her massive lips. This is a younger, more naive Lara, probably right out of college, and not very tomb-raider-y.I'm going to preface this review by saying that this is a great game, and you should play it, if you haven't already. But I am going to start out by talking about what bothered me about this game, because I feel that's rather important to get out of the way. So, this game is essentially Tomb Raider: Origins. Consequently, Lara is far less experienced in tomb raiding, far less blasé about killing people, far more innocent. And I'm fine with that. But it's rather jarring when we get past the first combat encounter, and Lara's already killed more people than Billy the Kid did across his entire career. And then at the 68% progress mark (I checked), Lara's killed more people than the bubonic plague, and she's still sobbing and whimpering all the time, and sits huddled up at every campsite.I understand gameplay versus story separation, but this is absurd. It's exactly like this comic: Look, I'm not saying that I want Lara characterized as a psychopath, but killing that many people should have had an impact on her. If we wanted to show how traumatic this experience was, how about just having her killing people reluctantly? Give the player a chance to sneak past encounters? But no, each kill is worth XP, and it's hard to pass up on shooting people in the head when they're each worth 20XP. And frankly, Lara by the half-way mark is a stone-cold badass... except during cutscenes.And the bloody QTEs. I've died more to QTEs than I have to combat encounters and platforming combined. And this one encounter ate up all of my ammo because I had to keep stunning the guy because I couldn't get past the compulsory QTE necessary to kill the bastard.But all of this aside, the gameplay is really good. The platforming is wonderful, with all of the different types of surfaces and jumps and climbing. The platforming QTE aren't quite so bad, and the camera is just a dream. It turns to show you where you go, but does it in a very subtle way. Combat is meaty, and improving your gear has a definite impact. And the crafting is great.The optional tombs are fun little segments, but what annoys me is that you get XP and salvage, and an area map, you don't get any fluff on what's in the tomb. It would've been nice if they'd had that.But, quibbling. Tomb Raider (2013) is worth your time, and you really should put in the extra effort to 100% the campaign."

But sadly the game was to linear for my taste.And its one of those game were you are playing by smashing buttons to perform an execute of some kind, and if you fail you die and have to try again. The game isnt challenging and you just run through paths and picking up stuffs to upgrade you character on the go.It isnt a bad game, but its not my type.The graphics are great for its time and the gameplay is smooth without any bugs.5/10 Cant decide wether i should recommend ore not.

Bad because you can't adventure much.)-Easy enemies (There is a few fights were you might die a couple times but mostly easy)-Finding friends (Not going to spoil anything but every time you find lost friends the same stuff happens)This game from start to finish was a blast.

""Tomb Raider"" seems to has a completely different Lara Croft and completely different Characters as well as you will find huge differences between the old Tomb Raiders and this newer installment. Survival and hunting and gathering got a huge part of Tomb Raider and I really like the gained freedom of jumping around in broader areas though Tomb Raider maintaines the linear level design from its predecessors it loosened up on it by a tiny bit allowing you to stealth around enemies.I really like where they went with Tomb Raider as I liked how they tried something new with the Lara Croft games. Yet I believe calling it ""Tomb Raider"" might confuse many.Still awesome game and it runs smooth at high settings for me and I do have a low budget PC."
6276,nvaughn14,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065363684/,1,,1,17.7,May,"17,",304,0,1,"Biggest Pros: -I loved the cinematic feel, it really felt like you're playing an action movie. The absence of a visible health bar is a HUGE immersion booster.-Character progression is very well done. At the beginning, I was jumping at shadows and panicking any time there's more than one enemy shooting at you. By the end, with all of your fully upgraded weapons and all the perks, I was picking off enemies like a pro and meleeing with reckless abandon. (Still somewhat fragile, though.)-Dying doesn't feel like a chore. The autosaves are frequent enough to prevent you from losing too much ground, but not so close together as to remove any penalty from dying.Biggest Cons: -some enemies towards the end were very bullet-spongy. I don't care if you're wearing armor, a direct shotgun blast to the back of the head should do SOMETHING.-the optional tombs were ridiculously short, and often too easy to figure out. I've never played a Tomb Raider game before this, but I should imagine some of the older ones were better in this aspect.-not a big fan of the free-sliding events where Lara slides down a waterfall/river/ramp/whatever, and any wrong move to the left or right resulted in painful gruesome death. The earlier ones were fine for a cinematic vibe, the later ones were just frustrating.Verdict: GREAT game! Can't believe it sat untouched in my library for almost two years."
6277,Murderlol,https://steamcommunity.com/id/murderlol/,1,,1,14.4,May,"25,","3,043",0,1,"A great third person shooter with solid mechanics, a decent story and a fair amount of collectibles to find. The game itself is overall very enjoyable with my only gripes being that the UI is pretty bad in a lot of places and that the QTE's can be very unforgiving and will cause you to die a lot for no good reason, making you sit through the same part several times. Unfortunately they decided to put the buttons that need to be pressed away from where you're looking at the screen which often makes it unclear which button you need to hit (getting you killed in the process) or making you not even see what happened based on the button you hit.Despite that, the game has a lot of collectibles, skill upgrades, weapon upgrades and the combat feels solid. All of the guns sound and feel powerful and they're all useful in their own situations (although I feel like the shotgun becomes far too weak late in the game compared to everything else). There's plenty of content and the game runs 10-15 hours for your first playthrough depending on how much item hunting you do.There is also a multiplayer but I didn't have a chance to play it as there was nobody else playing it either, so I have no idea what it's like.Overall if you want a solid shooter with a decent story, this is a great game that you can get for pretty cheap during steam sales. I wouldn't bother with the DLC though, it's mostly either for multiplayer or just extra outfits you can wear."

Lara is constantly climging things and then falling down them through unforseen environmental changes. The game looks great, and plays great with a controller. I just finished on normal and am planning on playing through on hard. My only complaint is that it's a bit too short. I beat it in about 11 hours and I was constantly searching nooks and crannies."

The environment is astonishing and sometimes I try to take things slow to appreciate thee view.The music and voice acting was great.The story is basically an introduction to Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider world.. Lara starts off as an ambitious archeologist and overtime, due to some unfortunate events, became a badass who can single handedly take down groups of enemies.The only drawback of the game, for me atleast, is the short story. When I finished the game, I wanted more. I  tried to replay the game in another difficulty but it was still the same. But beside that, the game was amazing.In conclusion, I give Tomb Raider a 4.5/5."

However, before you buy, you should know that this is more of an action game then a puzzle game(See the first con).  8/10Pros:+The tombs and other puzzles are fun and challenging, and the collectables are all interesting.+The combat is pretty good, though theres a con related to this below.+The characters are great, and they all have good voice acting.+Beautiful game, they put a lot of detail into it.+The story is good, there was only one twist that I saw coming from a mile away.Cons:-As I said before, the combat is great, but theres too much of it. As much fun as it was to fight endless waves of enemies(not being sarcastic), that's not what one goes to a Tomb Raider game for. The amount of time speant exploring tombs or finding artifacts is way lower then the amount of time spent shooting at things. -The tombs might be fun, but individually are short. Each one is a single puzzle. I'm not asking for each one to be a full gauntlet, but when you only have a handful of them, atleast make them two or three rooms long.Small Things That Don't Really Matter But I'll Still Mention Them:+The QTE's aren't annoying, and happen rarely.+There's absolutely no turret sections, which I'm happy for since the game had many oppurtunities to lazily put us on a mounted gun.+The concept art you can unlock is good.-It intoduces a survival element in the beggining of the game, only to then get rid of it immediately after."

It's as shallow as they come.In this gritty reboot the classic franchise  you take control of the lass Lara as you try to regroup with your crew after a dastardly shipwreck. In the proccess you will discover the treasures and secrets of the island which have no actual effect on the gameplay or story unless it's in a cutscene. The game does a great job at making this a good ""origin"" story as Lara has the balance and strength of a intoxicated monkey with polio. How she makes it passed the introduction is beyond me. Of course within two hours Lara becomes a Xenomorph and . The gameplay elements are what'd you expect in a modern game, it's a cover based shooter and every location has hidden items. The collectathon and challenge parts are a nice charm but they're nothing unique to the game. You get  which lets you highlight key parts of the enviroment.Honestly if you haven't played a modern openworld TPS shooter in a while I'd reccomend it, if you play newer games to death then don't bother because you've already played this, you just haven't seen the cutscenes. If you want heavy platforming you want Tomb Raider 2007 not 2013."

It was my first foray into the games and first genuine foray into the collective series. Going in, I wasn't honestly sure what to expect. But what I wound up with certainly wasn't what I was expecting. But it was also so much more. I remember, before I played, seeing the trailer and all I could think to myself was ""this is a game I need to own; to play."" The game is brutal and engaging. It's interactive and challenging. It's terrifying and exciting. It's demanding and rewarding. And so, so much more. I went into the game not sure what to expect, but in all honesty, the game blew my absolute f***ing mind. Within the first 60 seconds I was absolutely hooked. I didn't want to eat, sleep, or bathe. I just wanted to experience everything the game had to offer. The game could not disappoint me if it tried.

Not for the just the fun factor, but how well the game creates the sense of being really a beginner at survival in the early stages of that game, to being a well versed combatant and survivialist in the mid to later stages.The sense of progression is just perfectly executed so you never feel too underpowered as you progress further into the game.I enjoyed the story of Tomb Raider quite a bit and enjoyed the epic scale in which it was presented.As I have a PC capable of 3D I played Tomb Raider in 3D, and it was just WOW! :) An incredible game in 3D as there are quite a large amount of 3D effects in the game that take full advantage of 3D monitors.It really made the experience of the game that much greater. While I have played the game in 2D it cannot compare at all to 3D. Just such a pity so many games take zero advantage of 3D.From my side, I enjoyed the game and recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy a nice epic long story filled game with action, intrigue and mystery.

I no longer miss old Tomb Raider games, as this one is great.I had a chance to first play Tomb Raider reboot on my PS3. And I sat in front of the TV everyday until I finished it. I bought it for PC later - mainly because I wanted to support Linux developers and show that there are in fact some Linux players who would like to play AAA titles. Much later I bought even Rise of the Tomb Raider.It was not until a few day ago that I finally went for it on my PC. I got new graphics card, bought the third installment - Shadow of the Tomb Raider - and I prromised myself I will complete all three games in quick succession. And the first was Tomb Raider, with maxed out graphics settings and playing on my TV with PS3 gamepad. What a ride it was! The reboot went flawless for me.I like the styling Lara Croft got in this game and her development through it. Story is ok, maybe a little short, but why not. Combat is great even on gamepad!

Good graphics, great controls and gameplay, compelling story, it's pretty much got everything. The game can be dull and boring sometimes, but the action sequences and satisfying combat make up for it pretty well.The only thing I dislike about this game is Multiplayer; no one plays it anymore, and being an achievement hunter, there's 15 achievements I can't get without boosting, which sucks. But that's to be expected if a game is a few years old (unless it's Call of Duty). So if you buy this game wanting to play Multiplayer, you'll be disappointed.8.5/10"

This reboot does move slightly away from the classic puzzle solving of the originals and is more geared towards the combat side, although there are plently of puzzle solving sections like you would find in the originals. The story is strong and engaging and although this is now a three year old game the graphics hold up fantasticly well and really could have been released yesterday. I have only played one game on MP but i managed to find a game quickly despite the age of the game. I would recommend this game even for the SP story alone, a breath of fresh air in a cesspool of mediocrity trying to jump on the nostalgia bandwagon."

This is such a hand-holding game and it seems Lara's new weak personality matches. There are quest markers... considering levels are more or less linear, they are redundant. Stealth is pointless, because enemies always shout before you see them, and AI is awful, it takes a lot to be detected, and when they do, it's odds on their malcoordination will cause no problems. The voice actress is the least fitting to Lara in the entire series. Do I like this game? Yes. Do I like this game as a Tomb Raider?

6360,AbsoluteDeicide,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004811351/,2,,1,11.0,October,"4,",817,0,1,"Lara Croft has been around the block a few times. From the blocky, triangle-titted, weird looking sex symbol of the '90s in her debut on PS1 to the soft reboot of Legend and Anniversary in the mid-2000s, Tomb Raider exploded in popularity from the outset and has had roller coaster ups and downs in terms of quality and relevance ever since. In the current climate of remakes and remasters where saying a long running franchise is going to get a “gritty reboot” is more often than not a hack joke, it would be easy to dismiss the 2013 game (simply titled Tomb Raider) as a cynical cash in on a once popular series. It's a gritty reboot, but it's a fantastic game that sets the standard for the action/platforming genre. Lara Croft reinvents herself against all odds and deftly, confidently defends her crown against any imitators and challengers.   Tomb Raider is an origin story of sorts; the young Lara seems barely twenty, fresh faced and eager to see the world and follow mystic legends. As she travels on a sea vessel with a college professor-type, bumbling and dangerous YouTube celebrity and a small crew, her ship gets caught in a massive, supernatural storm and is capsized on a Japanese island. Right away she's isolated and thrown to the wolves... literally. The island is overrun with a militarized cult that worships a Sun Queen, and is looking for a young woman to sacrifice to their ancient god. They set their sights on Lara's friend, so she takes it personally, and her journey from wide eyed rich kid to seasoned, murderous sociopath is a brutal trial that has her hunting for food, wading through rivers of blood, and leaves her previously perfect skin looking like ground hamburger by the end.   Drawing inspiration from Metroid, as you progress through the main path you'll come across inaccessible side paths and secrets that require equipment upgrades or new gear to explore. The game is structured as pockets of small open areas that can be revisited by backtracking or fast traveling at camps. The environments are littered with relics and GPS caches and notes detailing the history of the island and journal entries from your crew mates. Collecting these fills out the backstory and motivations of the characters, and also rewards you with experience points to beef up Lara's arsenal and tools. It's a very light crafting/progression system; there's only one currency to worry about (scrap) and XP is doled out generously by performing most actions you'd do playing the game normally (hunting, killing enemies, progressing the story, etc.). The results are very satisfying, however, as your bow evolves from a rickety wood toy that takes half a dozen arrows to down a deer to a death machine that launches grenades, sending armored enemies flying through the air behind a giant explosion like a cartoon.   The simple act of getting around the game world is incredibly engaging. Each area is set up like a giant puzzle, with smaller puzzles tucked away in little corners. You may enter a cliff side jungle with the goal of just getting to the top, jumping across bridges and ruins to achieve the main objective, but you can slow down and use your rope bow to construct an impossibly complex web of traversal options and shortcuts. It's that interconnected, well crafted (Croft-ed?) level design that I find so impressive. There are also one off, optional tombs to plunder that up the challenge a bit and reward your observational skills and encourage you to have fun with physics and fire. The key here is you always feel in control of Lara; the most routine of jumps never seems automatic or on-rails, and the little touches of animation like holding up a hand to steady yourself or feel around a dark cave never take priority or control away from the player. If you ♥♥♥♥ up and Lara takes a sharp stick through the throat it's on you. And you don't want to see that because Lara is awesome. Or maybe you do because the death animations are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brutal...   The gunplay is solid. You have the option to stealth through most encounters, using your pickax or bow to silently dispatch enemies before they can react. Or you can go full Rambo and scramble cover to cover using a machine gun and shotgun to blow dudes away. The guns sound as crisp as the cover based shooting feels; it's immediate, fast paced, and appropriately violent.   Tomb Raider is the full package; an interesting story that stays visceral and grounded even when it turns supernatural, the tightest platforming system in adventure gaming, rewarding combat, gorgeous graphics, just the right amount of challenging puzzles... It's an amazing, must play game. A survivor is born... then thrown into the meat grinder immediately."

6378,sahndrxx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mcqinparis/,2,,1,21.2,August,"1,",100,0,1,"Tomb Raider has the best story I've ever seen, almost EVERYTHING about it is amazing, Tomb Raider is actually the first game I've played in the series, and I think I'm probably going to get the rest of the games like Rise of the Tomb Raider, there aren't really many tombs so... You might as well call it... Lara Croft and the Island of Yomoto, or something like that, the game is very long, right now I'm only 60% into the game and I have 10 hours... Yea... The only reason I got this game is because I've heard a lot of good things about the stealth genre, and I don't regret buying this at all, it's definitely worth what it's worth (19.99) You can't ""Stealth"" your way throught the whole game, there are some parts where the game forces you to fight, at the beginning of the game, the first time you kill someone it was actually kind of a big deal for Lara (Doesn't really affect the game) So you can tell she almost just a regular female. Sometimes it's the little details in the game that make it good, speaking of details,  Most of I play GMod on the lowest settings, and it goes at like 15-35fps, I play this game on the lowest settings (Which is still beautiful) and it runs (30-60)fps, I was suprised it would even open xD but it did... I'm just going to do like a cons and pros thing nowPros:Good graphicsCan run on pretty much any computerGood, tailored by you-ish gameplayCustomizationMeh:This kind of depends on you, sometimes the game forces you to not use stealth to attack your enemy's one by one, destroying their chances of having a good life and fami- Sorry, I got ahead of myself, the game will force them to notice you and attack them to make the game a bit harderThe game is really long, like 15-25 hoursDLC add almost nothingCons:Almost no one is on multiplayer (Perfect for 1v1's tho)You don't really get attached to the characters like you do in movies or The Walking Dead game series, if someone dies- you don't ball your eyes outIf someone dies in the game the rest of characters don't really care, they bring it up then and again, but they knew this person for years, and they don't even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cry.I'm just going to get a bit more in depth with everything I haven't talked about earlier, when I said tailored-ish gameplay I meant you can choose your gameplay, do you want to take your time and examine everything, look at the scenery, get it 100% Get all the collectibles and stuff, or you can play it quick, kill everyone witht the assualt and shotgun, beat the whole game quicker or you could take longer and try to kill everyone quietly (Which I'm doing right now and it takes longer)Oh... And the customization... Sooo. if your a pervert, and you want to look at dat ass, you could change what your wearing (Most of them are just DLC) and you can make Lara Crotch look better, but I wasn't just talking about that, you can customize your weapon too, like for the pistol you can add a bigger magazine, a silencer and more, You could also upgrade weapons, a bow, could turn into a compound bow, I'll explain later,I've barely been on multiplayer so I can't really say much about it, the multiplayer has multiple gamemodes, four in total, Cry for Help, Rescue, Free for all and Team Deathmatch, in Free for all, kill everyone, first place wins, in Team Deathmatch, there are two teams, Solarii and Survivors, kill the other team until the game ends, in my opinion Cry for Help is the best one, it's kind of like a round based game mode, you have to send a cry for help  by activating radio transmitters, but don't let the Solarii get the batteries... Or else your ♥♥♥♥♥♥.... In Rescue, you have to get medical supplies, it is also round based, and the Solarii are tying to kill you without a gun and a melee attack, there are also Loudouts, which change the gun you have and such, everything else is pretty much self-explainatory... Except one thing...I didn't add this in the Cons and Pros, but I'm just saying... The currency in this game is pretty good too, in the game you find something called salvage, each time you find one it give's you like 30, and when you get 300 or so you can upgrade a part of your weapon, but, on rare occasians you find a third of a new weaon, so you have a bow, you find a big crater, you open it, it say's 1/3 of a bow, blah blah blah, when you get three of those, it adds more upgrades to your weapon, there's also something called skills, with these skills you can upgrade things about yourself, when you get a skill, you can pretty much kill everything with one hit with your melee, but that takes a lot of skill in total, there's like a three tier thing, once you've unlocked 6 skills or so, you get to tier two and tier three, last tier is tier three, then you get the really good one's like the one I just told youOver all this is a good game and I would rate it 9.5/10The multiplayer is the .5 percent missingEverything from below are the editsEDIT#1 I bought Rise of the Tomb Raider... Doesn't workEDIT#2 I recently found out about this site called ♥♥♥ but apparently it blocks it, so it's G3A but replace the 3 with a 2... In G3A it's cheaper, you can get a key for it..."

It's not that you will experience a deep rich story but if you're a Tomb Raider fan, it will be more then satisfying. Sounds are good, can't complain. Considering gameplay, I expected a bit more challangeing tasks and interactions. The amount of FPS was on limit.

Seemed like your standard multiplayer but nothing distiguishing in it- For a game that prides itself on the story, it seemed short (I completed it in 9hrs) compared to other AAA story-driven games - The story felt pretty generic, nothing special but I won't spoil it.- Other than trying to compliment the story slightly, other 'main' characters didn't really play a big part in Lara's adventure - I wouldn't mind if these characters weren't ever included.Overall I'd give this game a solid 8/10 and would say to pick it up on sale."

Loved it so far, can't wait to finish it :D"
6400,Axii,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046743901/,2,,1,59.5,July,"2,","2,479",0,1,"Tomb Raider is a 3rd person adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix. Tomb Raider is set as a prequel to the rest of the series and takes place years before the first game. You play as Lara Croft, a young explorer looking to make a name for herself by venturing into the Devil's Triangle with a crew of friends in search of the ancient Sun Queen Himiko. Most of the time Tomb Raider gives you plenty of side areas to explore and the environments as a whole give an immersive feel to the whole ""stuck on an island"" narrative.The story of Tomb Raider is essentially that you, Lara Croft, and your team of friends and explorers set out to find the lost island of Yamatai that was supposedly ruled by a long dead sun-queen named Himiko. One thing leads to another and the ship crashes on the shore of what seems to be a random island but, as we later come to find out, is actually the long buried land of Yamatai. The isle is inhabited mainly by a group of fanatic cultists who worship the sun queen Himiko but also features some animals like wolves, deer, and rabbits. Throughout your travels on the island you can hunt these animals for XP and salvage, a currency of a sort used to upgrade weapons. Speaking of weapons, or the surprising lack of, every weapon has various upgrades that you can purchase for salvage and as far as weapon upgrades go, almost every upgrade actually impacts gameplay in some way. There are also specific points in the game where you'll unlock story-based items and weapon mods and the different areas you explore will become more useful later as you unlock the means to fully explore them. Every zone has a sort of ""i'll come back to this"" vibe to it as there's various doors or chests you can't open or get to without progressing to a certain point in the story and unlocking one of the aforementioned story-based items. This sounds great in theory but problems arise since chances are you'll forget about the loot and never come back to it and, really, there's no need to come back anyways. The game rarely has you backtrack through zones so there isn't much incentive to go back other than a couple meager salvage crates that aren't really worth the trouble. As you progress throughout the game you'll engage in with the local cultists in exchanges that almost always end with bloodshed. There isn't really any enemy variety and that's somewhat disappointing but the enemies that you have are pretty neat in their own ways. Lara's character development is incredibly well told as you watch Lara go from a frail young woman who vomits after killing a man to a badass who will do anything to make sure those she cares about make it home. The characters are all different but yet have an element of similarity that seems to bind them together as they try to survive this nightmare. While the characters could use more development, they all feel like people instead of characters in a game and as some characters begin to die you may not feel bad for them but at least you'll notice that they're gone.The gameplay is a very standard third-person shooter with a light cover mechanic but Tomb Raider really fine-tunes it into something that almost feels unique. Most of the game you're following the linear main story missions but in a couple of areas you can choose to venture into one of the side tombs for a bit of extra loot. These side tombs are small side areas that consist of a single puzzle and a chest filled with loot that you obtain for solving it. The puzzles are all incredibly easy and throughout the entire game not a single one game me any real challenge other that a quick analysis and an even quicker solution. For most of the game you'll be jumping through puzzles or shooting guys but for the little bit of in-between time where you get to explore the island you really begin to get a creepy vibe. Cultists burning people alive to honor the sun queen and stringing corpses up inside of caves filled with ominous lighting and scrawled walls. The game is also gorgeous and still holds up very well to this day with graphics that truly bring these environments to life and pull you in. There's also little side stories being told throughout the various documents and historical relics that you can find littering the shattered island. All of these elements entwine to form a very creepy almost haunted island narrative that, as a whole, adds up to be an even better storyline than the main one.A surprisingly well made action adventure game that takes the Tomb Raider name and turns it into a modern classic that stands with the greats to this day."

The final boss for instance, you beat with timed button presses and mashes, far less interesting than some of the other challenges where maneuverability and aim are key. Generally the tombs were easy and the gameplay somewhat predictable, especially with survival instincts, an ability that pretty much shows you the solution to any potential puzzles. This is  a game designed to be beaten without too much trouble, which makes for nice, fun play-through if you want something mindless for a weekend."

The gameplay is easy to latch onto and the environments are fun to explore. One thing to note is that the tombs in this game, which include a lot of puzzles, are optional. So keep that in mind. Meaning if you don't go out searching for tombs and just continue with the story then that's perfectly alright.Personally I love having it be optional because I loved the old Tomb Raider games for their stories, the puzzles were fine too and I'm glad they're still included but I like that it doesn't affect your gameplay by a lot. I'd defeinitely recommend this for anyone looking for a game with lots of exploration, shoot 'em up,  and treasure hunting. One thing I loved the most about the game is how much story is hidden just everywhere. Tiny artifacts Lara examines and tells you the backstory of, journal entries read aloud via different voice actors, and idle dialogue between hostile npcs while you sneak up on them. There's just so much to know and explore in this game I definitely want more games like this with Lara and Sam. I get that by the ending Sam may not want to be an adventurer but that doesn't mean she couldn't help Lara in the following games with tech stuff or connections. Maybe aphone call or something? They seem so close I was almost certain they were more than friends. I'd love to see that more in the future games. Even if its just their friendship or a cameo photo or voice mail to Lara."

I loved the urgent game play concept which was enough to make my heart beat faster enough. Although I have not played for a long time, I enjoyed it. On the other hand, I am not sure whether I will be like to play this game again in the future.이 게임을 처음 시도해봤을 때 굉장히 어색했습니다. 버튼 액션 기반 게임을 해본 지가 기억이 안 날 정도로 오래된 상태였습니다. 하지만 메인 스토리를 완료했을 땐 진행 방식에 적응하고 있었습니다. 주인공 라라의 신체적인 조건은 자연을 넘어설 정도지만, 가끔 모션이 부자연스러웠습니다. 가장 마음에 들었던 부분은 긴박한 게임 플레이 컨셉이고요, 심장 박동수를 올리기에 충분했습니다. 오랜 시간 동안 해보진 않았지만, 충분히 즐겼고요. 하지만 나중에 다시 해보고 싶을지는 의문이 듭니다."

We start of with a fresh and vulnerable Lara Croft which evolves into the badass survivor we all know through the game. I've not played any Tomb Raider games before, but I felt that the game hooked me easily on the story and lore.The game set place on a island (I like to call it ""Skull Island"") where spooky stuff happens. Lara and her friends have to investigate and survive the island. First of all I have to say that the map is huge. It is not free roam, but you can fast travel to different areas on the map. Every area is filled with collectibles to find, people to defeat and tombs to explore (not so many situational tombs tho). I like how you can just relax and do what you want without the main mission nagging at you. The gameplay feels good and the graphics are great! There's a great mix between combat, puzzles, climbing and exploring. The puzzles are not too hard and really fun to solve. Climbing and exploring is also fun and doesn't get repetitive. Combat is fun where you have a upgrade system to help you out. Killing ppl gets you salvage and xp which you use in the upgrade system to get better skills and modifications on your guns. I personally like the bow which is silent and deadly. Combat can sometimes be chaotic when there are lots of enemies around. All in all fun to kick ass ^^ The multiplayer is dead, so I couldn't get the MP achievments. It doesn't really matter since I only play these types of games for the SP. Tomb Raider (2013) is a good third person game with interesting story and lore. The collectibles you find, ties in with the main story and gives you some good back story. Gameplay is fluent and I didn't encounter any major bugs. Graphics looks good and the game runs smooth on my computer.I recommend this game to ppl who loves adventure games with a mix of puzzles, action and a good story.

That doesn't sound like much but I pushed the time hard and am an old hand at action/adventure gaming. I worked the game methodically and enjoyed the story as I went. I admit that I had played through the first area or two on a friend's game, but that neither detracted from my play nor game me much of an advantage in the run through, excepting knowing where to find a handful of things.Graphics were clean and visually striking Audio is one of the few places where I don't have a lot for you, I could tell where things were at by sound if necessary but rarely used it as I was playing music for myself the majority of the playthrough. Surprises were usually surprising visually and aurally. In my opinion, the best thing that can be said, about the graphics/audio of this game, is that they NEVER got in the way between myself and immersion in the game.Story was good enough that I had to actively keep myself from running off after the next piece of story, when my gamer instincts told me I had to deal with that OTHER thing over there. The Scramble movement and the scavenging concepts (both new to me as of this game unsure of original creators of such in gaming world as a whole) were wonderful implementations that brought out the grit and survival aspects of the story as a whole. Along with adding a sense of growth over the course of gameplay. Having played a good deal of the origianal TR franchise, I thoroughly enjoyed the thematic mainainance involved, keeping the whole archealogical exploration with a side of ""there's more to life than what we imagine"" kind of feel, a la Indy and prior TR was awesome. The ""hunt these objects"" items didn't feel like a checklist of pokemon, so much as a ""keep your eyes open"" while you're doing what you do. As a gamer I would've liked knowing what the items looked like when entering a ""zone"" but as a player I'd rather have the story continuity of knowing once I find one.Controls were smooth and became intuitive quickly (using only mouse and gameboard). I never really had to engage with the saving process until the end but what I did do was clean and well implemented. I felt as though the stealth system was a bit sketchy with animals, regarding their sensetivity to the player (but I'm not that kind of hunter irl either) in alll other environments I never felt like ""the game gypped me"" I could always see where -I- did something wrong. Object collision was pretty clean, it was VERY rare that I jumped to grab a ledge, or whatnot, and could not predict the behavior of my actions within a pretty small margin.Overall with the exception of an hour or two at the end when I was losing a bit of my mind (I'm not the young gamer I used to be) I was engaged and thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my gaming experience."

When I saw the reboot in GameInformer magazine I was a little disappointed and didn't really have interest. Fast forward to 2016. I was getting bored with my games I had and I wanted something newer, but something I knew I would like. Scrolling through the Steam store I saw this Tomb Raider game. Until this point it had never really occured to me to actually look into it. I watched a few videos and read a few reviews and decided, Hey it's Tomb Raider, how can they mess it up? I was right. About an hour and a half into the game I was hooked. I love bows and the fact that one of Lara's main weapons is a bow helped sink the claws in. Anniversary was fun, but this was Tomb Raider. It had the same classic feel as the older games, but it also had a lot more than that. There was mystery, action, survivor-sense, some fear, and always loss. The voice acting is done extremely well and the main story is awesome.I certainly recommend this game to Tomb Raider fans and action/adventure fans alike"

I think think this game delivered well enough. It's not very open world at all, like say, Far Cry. It's much more linear, but it gives me enough choices to go the way I want, take the fight the way I want, search and explore for stuff, and upgrade skills and weapons the way I want. I thought the way youp lay though certain action sequences, like escaping a collapsing tunnel or falling bridge gave you just enough control to have fun, rather than just playing a cutscene, though I would have liked a little more control.I played through at what I would call a normal pace. I didn't rush through it, but I didn't lollygag around. If I saw a door or a room I would check it before moving on, and I completed the game in 15 hours, having ""completed"" 71% of the world apparently. For the sale price I got it for, it was definitely worth the money.I was concerned it would be a clunky console port, but I didn't get that feeling at all."

As a long time fan of the series, growing up playing Tomb Raider 2 riding around on the 4-Wheeler and running through the mansion, this was such a nice refresh! They do a fantastic job of making you, the player - really build a strong relationship with Lara again. I feel like this lacked in the previous ""recent"" Tomb Raider titles vs the old school three.-The gameplay is fantastic. Very fluid. Game runs VERY SMOOTH!!!-Good Controller support - although I very much enjoy these keyboard controls. Everything feels so good and easy to navigate on the keyboard/mouse which sometimes is missing from these ""adventure"" type games.-Simple - yet very good ""upgrade"" system for your weapons and skills (bow/melee-knifes/guns).-Game is just enough linear but has just the right amount of ""open-world"" for it to feel more open and enjoyable...just mixes well together. You can explore around and backtrack, but still isn't hard to get lost.-The story is not too bad - and I'm excited for the new one to come out on the 28th of this month (I don't own a XB1).-AI isn't TOO dumb, for a change. You have room to sneak but they still notice you and respond which is good. Solid cutscenes and stuff during the action.-Combat and action/shootouts are SOO much fun. Feels arcade-like but very enjoyable every time you take some one down, doesn't get too old....for me at least.****CONS*****- The bow is useful, fun, but does crappy damage. They need to bump up the dmg more.-The whole animal killing and stuff is fine I guess but hardly ever stop to kill animals I guess it's boring to me. I think too many of the skills like melee and guns that u wanna unlock and use u cant yet because you have to invest in the stupid hunting skill to hit the next ""tier."" Kinda LAME!-THE GAME LOOKS AMAZING! Hands down, best game I seen or played so far. I like to argue that it looks better than the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 just looks like the world around me is moving too fast or something...I just don't like the movement in the Witcher 3 I think. Tomb Raider doesn't disappoint at all in the visual department. At first I ran the game with a GTX 770 and 8GB of ram on an i5-4690k @ 4.0. It ran smooth as butter, on pretty much ultimate aside from a couple settings turned down (AA to FXAA instead of 2X or 4X SSAA, and maybe Reflections/Shadows turned down a bit). I just purchased a GTX 980 and now I can run the game all maxed aside from the AA. I still can't run at 4X SSAA without my FPS dropping to 40-50ish, and this isn't even on 4k or ultra-wide...just a normal 1920x1080...so that shows it's a powerful game - but it can run well with a lower card and still look fantastic! Just overall a fantastic job by Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix on the optimazation!Honestly, it's such a good game for $20.00 - I only have 8 or so hours on record and I'm already more than satisfied with my purchase. I haven't even beat the game yet so who knows, maybe the ending sucks? perhaps my review is too soon? Sorry..but the game is still awesome.BUY IT!"

Endgame leaves you feeling like you want more or some type of extention. The entire game is exilerating, action packed exploration and adventure. I just don't feel like replaying it, even though it was an excellent  ride. Just wish there was more. Game has side quests and mini achievements, dlc tombs ect.. Just don't really wanna log back in and finish that last 22% of the content after the game was beat. What a great story though excellent game 10/10 would reccomend to anyone that likes story driven game play any day of the week, havent played anything this good since ""The Last Of Us"".. Buy it, play it, beat it, look for part 2, they finally got tomb raider right, no more clucky mechanics, clucky gun play, and cheaply designed mazes. This is the one that is what tomb raider should have always been. (claps for the devs) Thank You for your hard work, you have really brought the game to life, the right way."

Now what to say about tomb raider?Its utterly outstanding on so many levels.Its graphics are stunning, and even on normal settings the visuals in this game are just fantastic.The combat system is smooth, fluid and extremely fun. I used a bow throughout the game and the upgrades you can get for it aswell as the other weapons feel extremely rewarding and give a reason for the constant search for loot.The story in my opinion is excellent. It never drags or becomes boring, theres always a new twist or turn in the plot and the game doesnt hesitate to kill off characters for an awesomely dramatic effect.Overall the game is a solid 9/10. If you're like me and you get it on sale, it'll be the best £2.24 you've ever spent. But even for its original retail price of £15.00, I'd still say its worth it!"
6557,Ken Masters,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ParrotMan01/,1,,1,20.2,January,"4,",428,0,1,"I've always hated the Tomb Raider series.  The clunky controls, the bad camera, the awful story, the most reprehensible piece of garbage of a female protagonist personality wise, I could never stand it for years.  Heck in Guardian of Light, the top down multiplayer game, I always pick Kane/Lynch or the Soul Reaver characters.This game?  Major improvement.  They turned it into a 3rd Person Spectacle shooter akin to Uncharted.  That's right, one of the inspirations of Uncharted took inspiration in turn.  That means for 98% of the adventure it is a straight line and be prepared to fall off EVERYTHING.  The sound design from what I've heard is really good.  Guns have a certain punch even though it looks like you are firing very old antiques.Finally, my thoughts on the character:This Lara was put into an impossible situation and expected to save everyone.  As such, all character development is portrayed through battle dialogue if you can believe it.  She'll start off telling enemies to leave her be or to stop fighting and gradually start telling them that she's going to kill them.  After what she goes through?  You'd probably be saying the same thing.  My only hope is that this version of the character won't turn into a psycho thief in the sequels to this reboot, IE: Killing dudes with genuine need of certain artifacts and taking them for herself just because or because she needed a new trophy that day.  This is what the original Lara Croft is like and this is not the Lara you will play as.  If this bothers you, stop here and don't bother with this game.  If it doesn't, get the game at a discount and enjoy yourself."
6558,什麼樣的陣容挨近,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981956784/,1,,1,20.0,January,"3,",588,0,1,"this is a game that even the most pleby jobber will just coast right through while their brain is on auto pilot. Even on hard difficulty, it is probably 1 of the easiest games i've played. Maybe they figured it would be anti feminist to see lara getting murked over and over. 99% percentf your deaths will come from quick time events or falling from a missed jump etc and you should just quit gaming if u die even once during actual combat. There is zero excuse for ever dying from the actual combat from enemy fire. IF you die from the enemy fire then you are a total pleb and probably should find another hobby other than gaming cause you are just not worthy. The combat is so brain dead easy your grandma could do a no death playthrough if you didn't count quick time events. This is supposed to be prequel of some kind that gives the backstory of how lara learned to become the warrior she is... WELL Thats non sense because she fights like an 80s active movie character right off the bat. This game needs a prequel of the prequel that shows how she learned to fight like rambo commando before this game takes place. If this was supposed to be the beginning of the lara saga, then where the hell and when did she learn how to nail bow and arrow headshots with 100% accuracy from hundreds of feet away? Robbin hood himself would be super jelly of her bow and arrow skills. Rambo, John matrix, the copy pasta navy seal, would all get jobber squashed by lara in a gun battle and this is supposed to be the ""backstory."" WHERE IS THE BACKSTORY OF THE BACKSTORY? WHERE DID SHE LEARN TO FIGHT LIKE THIS?With that said it's still a decent game cause i guess sometimes you maybe wanna relax and play something easy but if you are looking for a challenge you will not find that here. This game is for the ultimate casual who plays games on baby easy mode. If that is okay with you then pick this up i suppose. IF you are a hardcore gamer and have no time for pleb jobber easy mode baby games then stay away cause you will just laugh out loud how pathetically easy this game is. Seriously, If you died even once, even on hard,  during legit actual combat gameplay and not cheap quick time event deaths, then you are a complete jobber who doesnt deserve to call yourself a gamer."

She wasn't sexy before,  what with the large bosoms and large blocky lips.  No,  She became sexy by being a survivor.  She's able to be put through some tragic death scenes that would sicken many. Until now, we've pretty much exclusively seen men in that sort of situation.  Not that I ENJOY seeing Lara impaled, mamed, or otherwise gored,  It's just great to know that they had the guts to actually go through with it,  and the fact that you can PREVENT that from happening. Lara becomes the Tomb Raider for real in this fantastic reboot.  The feeling of progression is amazing, and Lara actually feels alive.  Let's just hope you can keep her that way.This game gets a 9/10 from me.  I kinda would like some fanservice, but frankly...  She's better without it.  Good on ya, Lara!"

The game has plenty of action parts, and plenty of exploring to be had. I have finally finished the game, which I never thought I could do, but now I want more. So now I will go back over the island to my last save camps and teleport back and forth, and try and seek out and find as many unfound items, relics and diarys that I have missed and perhaps complete some small task challenges as well.If your a fan of Tomb Raider and love Lara Croft, then this game is a must play, so if you have the game and have not gotten around to playing it yet, then you really should add this game to your ""to play list"". The game did not disapoint, and my laptop handled it really well, but I had to have all settings set to low and I was very impressed with the quality my laptop presented me. It does make my laptop run at higher core temperature's as I have noticed, but never crashed or coursed me any mager issues. I have not tried out the Multiplayer side to this game, and not sure if its still viable to do so. I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.Yeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.Anyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times."

6603,abmiS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/abmiSofficial/,1,,0,10.8,December,"16,",34,0,1,"This is not a review for all the fans who ever played a Tomb Raider game before. I'm pretty sure for all the true Tomb Raider fans it's a must. I myself actually never really played a Tomb Raider before. It's not a bad game but not the best in my opinion. Graphics are good - even if it's already 2015, nearly 2016. As in most games, the hair isn't really good. Only Lara somehow has moving hair, all the others have static hair :/What really made me decide to give a negative review is the story. Again it's not the worst story ever, but I always knew that if I'm really close to escaping the island, something new happens so I would have to do something again. For me it was like a really short story but the devs thought of some dumb things to make the story longer. Example: Oh we found a boat, but we need the tools that are like 10 miles away. Okay I got the tools but now all of a sudden the enemys are attacking again. 5 minutes before I'm there they take someone with them. Too bad you now have to go away 5 miles again to rescue said person. The game isn't that hard aswell. You have like 2-3 seconds to press the right key. The multiplayer isn't really a thing and you have to get like lvl 60 to get some cool stuff: not really easy, the game is already 2 years old. I only played multiplayer once or twice.I like that the game saves often.Achievements and Collectibles: I'm absolutely not a fan of them so I finished the game with 65% completion. They're just not really a big thing in the game. Hunting is like once in a kind of tutorial involved but I never ever did hunting again. The upgrading system is cool, you want to get some salvage to get your weapons better but I don't think they have a really big impact on the gameplay.Conclusion:The game isn't bad but I would appreciate some improvements to the story and some aspects of the gameplay. The graphics are really good - except the hair."

6607,Quadratic,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006982182/,1,,0,9.9,December,"14,",173,0,1,"Negatives:- The game is fairly short. I think 9 hours (whatever my total play time is) got me through it and I was by no means rushing.- Ran into a few bugs (eg: waypoint never recognized as reached) and some minor camera issues (eg: using the bow at times would not move Lara's body out of the way, thus could not see what you were shooting at).- Feels a bit ""empty"". Yes, there are hidden tombs, but aside from that it's a very linear trip and then it is done.Positives:- Upgrades are a good balance of being meaningful without being all-important.- Acrobatics and tools are interesting enough.- Puzzles, while not common enough for me, struck a good balance of being approachable while not being too obvious or boring.- Difficulty progression was well-paced.Overall, I would have been very disappointed with this as a $60 game, so I'm rating it based on what the original ask was. At the much lower 'black friday' sale price I'm happy with it though."

Mainly because there is what feels like one linear path across the island that zig zags back and forth making back tracking extremely hard.Overall its a wonderful game especially when it has a base asking price of $20 at the time of this review.Oh and it has a multiplayer mode with a ""progression system"" but good luck with that one."

6635,Meep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Malmas/,1,,1,21.0,November,"18,",438,0,1,"This game is very fun. The graphics are very, very good. The whole atmosphere of the game is a huge clash between Industrialization, old japanese culture and nature which this game presented very well. Forests were lush and detailed down to flowers and branches. Ships that were claimed by storm and lightning each had a different look that matched its time period. Some caves could have been done without so many skulls and dead bodies hanging around, but it added to the eeriness of the island and the mystery it contained.The music was good at setting the mood. It is normally quiet when safe to roam, letting the ambient noise enthrall you into the world. But the soundtrack picks up as action builds which just keeps you going. The drips of water in caves to the whistling of the winds comes together seemlessly.The pacing was just right. You backtrack to certain areas but with new, upgraded weapons allowing you to find new tombs and treasures. You can easily get side tracked, but not to the degree of Skyrim or Fallout where you could spend 10 hours doing something else. The main story grips you and you want to keep moving forward. The up and downs of action to exploration was very smooth and it felt like I had a lot more freedom than actually given. It's a semi-open world with backtracking features via fast travel. It works.The combat was tight and responsive. I wish it was a litle more difficult at times, especially in the 50-75% zones. Each weapon and upgrade was significant. The quiet but deadly Bow is the bread and butter of Lara's arsenals. The handgun can be upgraded to a fast mid-ranged weapon to clear out oncoming baddies. The shotgun is great for blowing off armors and fast close ranged fights while the Rifle was good for piercing through thin walls and picking off Snipers or Archers.There are other, more in-depth reviews out there so I'll keep mine at this length. If you like exploring, third-person action and collecting items/audio logs (that really do flesh out the story A LOT), Tomb Raider is an amazing reboot and you should give it a shot."

There are times when I'm in the middle of a blood bath and can still appreciate the fantastic scenery around me. There's a decent difficulty level. It's easy enough at times and difficult enough at times to make the game a challenge without making me want to rage quit.I expected the game to be somewhat misogynistic, but it wasn't.

I mean they are not bad the upgrades are not bad but it kinda feels you realy dont need them. I mean i never upgraded my assault rifle it kinda upgraded its self when i progresed (dont ask me how). The upgrades dont seem like they matter since i was mostly going stealth and using bow and arrow headshot and done the diference in aiming when you buy a upgrade for better aiming is realy superficial. Some armored guys i take out hand to hand.The cover system is realy idiotic. I mean when you cower behind a wall stick to it! Sometimes that stupid girl just gets out of cover and the enemy just spots her witch is kinda anoying.The story is good but you kinda get the feeling ¨The princes is in another castle¨ plus when you see how many times Lara just falls down in  the cutscenes you kinda wonder how did she not break much more bones. That kinda bugs me but oh well. And in adition when you get atacked from enemys and start killing them you kinda start wondering ¨Holy crap how big of a cult is this¨ And to get all the story you need to get realy ALL of the documents. Oh and when Lara kills someone the first time she barfs a litle  the facial expretions are good but after that its like ¨Fu*k it im gonna kill ya all you basterds¨ kinda hoped for more struggle.All in all it is not bad i would realy like to see more of survival elements it would bring kinda more depth in the game. The puzzles is also not bad. Not to hard just right for my taste since this is realy the first Tomb Rider i have EVER played.Anyway it was on sale so i got it for 4 euro it was not a bad deal so for the mony i would say it is a 7/10 game. Recomended.

I remember playing Tomb Raider I and II on my old PS2, and enjoying them a lot. Then, I saw the movies, which were only decent. But THIS, this game, it has the action, and adventure of the originals, and with tons of incredible new stuff. There are open world segments, weapon upgrades, optional tomb raids, and an even better story then any other Tomb Raider game I've played. Finally seeing an even better rebooted version of Lara's backstory, was amazing. There were some basic backstory cutscenes in earlier games, but this made the story way more interesting and fun. I think it's great that it's gonna be a complete reboot of the franchise, with the new backstory, instead of the old ones.The end of the game, bringing back the dual pistols gives a real feel that we are still playing a Tomb Raider game, wheras in a lot of other parts, you get so sucked in, you kind of think of it as it's own seperate game. And, bringing in a supernatual element at the end, which was suprising after the entire rest of the game, showed that the world of Lara Croft is still similar, and that the things we loved of the first Tomb Raider games like the supernatural artifacts, makes me love it even more.Scores:Story: 10/10Gameplay: 9/10 (some hard parts, a few tiny glitches)Acting: 10/10Cutscenes: 9/10 (unessecary segments, in my opinion)OVERALL: 10/10"

What you get with Tomb Raider is two things: Action and Adventure. LOTS of Action and Adventure.There are no loading screens inbetween the areas as that is solved by using short hallways, and overall the map feels very fluent and interconnected (e.g. you can see a landmark in the distance, coming closer as you play, with you eventually reaching it). The map and graphics overall make for a great atmosphere. Obviously the stuff that happens to Lara is not really realistic, but even though one knows she will survive, one still flinches because the gameplay designers did not choose her experience in this game to be comforting. As such, when she begins to struggle on a ledge or similar, I actually thought that she might fall. The experience and skill point system is good, every skill point spent actually helps ingame and the XP system rewards exploration. Ideally you want to use your weapons as little as possible, but they can be upgraded too and receive new features during the game. This makes backtracking to old areas rewarding as with the new equipment new tombs and areas are unlocked. The story is very linear, but the fact that the exploration and challenges are so enjoyable and larger areas yield many surprises makes up for it. Maybe I am just bored of sandbox and multiplayer games. It is just a long, awesome, action/adventure movie in that sense, as the cutscenes blend nicely with the gameplay, similar to the loading passages. There are a few not so ideal things, such as the mediocre combat system and enemy AI, however I would not say that it substracted from the game, but it did not add to it either. Stealth is possible for some areas, in other areas however, the game forces you to be discovered (at the same time some explosions are probably going on too). While I am a huge stealth player, I did enjoy being forced to go ""loud"" for once, as I ALWAYS try to get a perfect stealth run if a game permits me to do so.Graphical performance is optimised, I am able to play it fluently on a lower resolution (1080p :v) with medium settings on a low grade notebook graphics card. A proper desktop should have no problems handling it. The most taxing options that should be disabled if aiming for more FPS are: Antialiasing, Post-processing, SSAO, High Precision, TressFX (set Hair to normal).Overall I recommend this game very highly, I do not like x/10 scales, as everyone sees those differently. I however, thoroughly enjoyed this game and would it recommend it to my friends and that is all that matters in the end.(First review, please be mindful)"

And probably has every diseas from jumping in that pool of blood.The game is fine and all, but I always run into glitches in any game (I guess it's a talent). Graphics are good, althought I can't run it at 60 fps on high(sry master race pc, plz don't kill me) and I still found a few texture flickerings here and there.There's one thing that pisses me off the most - the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics. I get it, it can't be perfect from every aspect, but I still got confused in some puzzles where I want to finish it a different way than it's intended.Oh, I ain't fogetting about the realism. Yeah, I'm supposed to upgrade weapons and stuff, but how does a human being survive an arrow/bullet/flaming arrow/incendiary bullet to the head. And the whole Lara juicing thing.Apart from that, I love the game and it's cliches.Edit: Went back in the game two months after finishing it just to start over again and get a 100% completion. gg awesum gam"

Not to forget the boring, standardized, ""AAA"" upgrade system that doesn't add any depth at all, and how the game wants to give you the answer to every puzzle and constantly rewards you ""XP"" bonuses for any stupid thing you achieve.  HOWEVER, I still recommend this game because of it's amazing visuals, and great world design.

If single player was all there was, I'd be mostly happy - story was predictable but nice, you can go back after the last fight (which was a bit too easy imho) to get everything to 100% with a bit of backtracking and all is great. Unfortunately for completionists, the next part is muti...Why is multiplayer bad? 1) Cheaters with infinite explosives. 2) People exploiting lags to be invincible and teleport.3) Stupid achievements that are not possible to get without a group of friends playing with you (or crazy luck).4) Low number of people playing after 2 years, made even worse by a DLC that adds a multiplayer map which prevents matchmaking from finding people without it, even when you want to play on original maps.Seriously, if they wanted to release a DLC, it would have been so easy to add more tombs, or a survival mode (to help get achievements post-game), or even some timed challenges and leaderboards to make single player more lasting.

The game has an epic story, but it feel too short. Combat in this game should be a last resort. Combat in this game can be so hard that you will have to turn down the combat difficulty. Imagine COD, but the enemies are usually better equipped than you, unless you headshot an enemy they WILL require a lot of bullets, you have a really inefficient melee attack (especially during the end of the game), and big armored guys at the end that need to shotgun at a specific area, at a specific time and then you have too finish them with a short quick time event. There are quick time events (mostly at the start) that are either easy or so hard you will die a couple of times to get the sequence. I don't know if this is for anyone else, but one opional tomb at the very start for me will not allow me pass because of a glitch. I hate to rage about all of this, but these are promblems that can be looked over.10/10 Would be gun downed and try to survive all over again"

I played most of the Tomb Raider games, but I absolutely love this new approach to Lara Croft. New Lara looks amazing. The story is great, for the first time I cared about the characters in a Tomb Raider game. Yeah, there are alot of QTE events in the game, but they are really well done and look amazing. Puzzles (tombs) are not to hard and a bit small though. But the fight mechanics (absolutely loved the finished) make up for that. Also really liked the leveling system and all the collectibles that are in this game (different collectibles for each region of the island was a great idea).Overall a solid 9+/10Can't wait for the sequel. Hope they keep the way the new Lara looks."

The reboot is much better than the original Tomb Raider. In my opinion, the story writing, the setting, the characters, and most importantly, Lara is one breathtaking character. Graphics are breathtaking, music fits the mood, scenery has some horror elements and the overall presentation is excellant. If you are in for a streamlined adventure I give this on a 9/10."

It's so much fun. I have hundreds of games in my library, but this one I started playing and it actually held my interest. I played it. I played it a lot. Beat it. Collected every-damn-hidden-100%-world-scraped-clean item.I will shamefully admit that, even though I was born in '86, and  have been a long-time gamer, this is the first Tomb Raider game I have *really* played. I can't speak to die-hard fans of the series (who, from what I've read, also liked the game) but for me, given as this is kind of a ""genesis story"" for Lara, it's aperfect into to the franchise and the world.The graphics are great. Without going full-perv, the model for Lara looks good and really moves well. Pay close attention to how it changes as you progress through the game.Controls: I've also played Tomb Raider: Underworld. Compared to that game, this game handles much more like a tactical shooter. You can put shots where you want them, and combat is a great mix of shooting, melee, and interacting with the environment. I am a sucker for slow-motion killcams, and this game certainly delivers.Seriously, get this game. If you smart, well-designed puzzles, exciting combat, and an interesting but easily-digestible storyline, get it. Plus it's *soooo cheap* you have to buy it. I got on a slight sale but for this price you're crazy not to get it.Ok enough of my ""short review."" I would put this among the best games in my library, and I'll certainly be following any new Tomb Raider titles from Square/Crystal. Get it. Now.

It's very interesting to play because if you've had any of the previous games, Lara Croft is always at the peak of her career and is able to do everything professionally. However in Tomb Raider, she just graduated out of college and seems to be a bit amateur like and passive, unlike how we usually see her. It has great character development throughout the entire game. The graphics is absolutely amazing and it's great to look at. Voice acting is also spot on. If you suck at the game however, you get to see the main character die a bunch of gruesome deaths. The one thing I'm amazed about most is how Lara Croft is able to keep her clothes perfectly intact throughout the entire game. It's a mystery."

The characters were great, voice acting enjoyable, and puzzle elements were fun brain-teasers without being frustratingly challenging.  I purchased the game during a sale that allowed me to get all of the DLC for $3.99, and I wouldn't pay more than that, since some of the DLC is for multiplayer, which is more or less dead at this point; almost impossible to find a match.  I'm alright with that though, because I bought it for single player.The game isn't perfect, but it's fun.  Quick time events exist but don't become excessive, and for the most part when they're used, the surrounding action is so hilariously insane that you don't care; you're just watching Lara Croft escape a classic Tomb Raider ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.You can really tell that the people involved with making this game poured their collective heart and soul into this project.  From the gameplay itself to the end credits which thank (and list!) all the fansites, and even takes the time to thank bloggers, cosplayers, etc., it's apparent that this game is a labor of love.I've played through the game three times now, and like a favorite movie, I'll probably come back to this game in a year or so and play it again."

However, things get better on the run (Minus the dad, that one doesnt).The mysteruous island is half-open world: You can go around and check places, but there's a certain linearity that makes you feel forced to keep going where the plot takes you, this could have been improved.Personally, i cant play this game with a Keyboard+Mouse, so if you've got a controller, it might feel better for you.The gameplay itself is pretty nice, Lara controls well and most of the movement feels good... Barring the QTEs that can be a butt if they wanna be.Story is, so far, a tad generic, but nontheless acceptable, and the characters arent portrayed  badly, in fact, they're done well.As for multiplayer?

Combat is very good. I like this game. There are a few things to mention though.Charachter models, you can tell they put much more time into ""Lara"" than any other charachter. She looks really good, whilst the rest of them look quite generic. This might have been the intention of the game, seen as we play with Lara.The map, lots of areas look the same although I will say that they still had their own unique vibe.Tombs, some of them were easy, some were very very hard so they had a nice balance.FPS, well, it was irratic to say the least. I have quite a good PC and whilst mostly I maintained 60 FPS (with Vsync) the game did stutter from time to time which IMO took away from the experience. Did not seem like it was optimised too well. It was good for the most part.In closing, I do like this game. FInding the collectables was a challenge. I did play this on console so knew what I was doing for the most part on my PC play through. If you have not played this game yet, I would say it is worth. It has a lot going for it."

Dynamic camera angles make it feel like a genuine movie.  You can really tell the production values were top notch.  I really love when a story driven game can draw you in like this.

The only problem I have with it is that it gives you hints often, although not when you really need them. The game is really fun to play though and I'm so happy that it actually plays very true to the whole gender equality thing, where Lara is a part of this guy's team but Lara does most of the work that she likely won't get credit for as the other female on the team has been recording both Lara and the group leader guy (excuse me for not knowing names :p ) as the excursion continues. I find that the developers really knew what they were doing when they developed the story line. Could have worked more on the game play but all in all couldn't be happier with purchasing this game. Thank you for not disappointing this happy customer <3"

6812,A Certain Boss Who Is Big,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JohnPliskin/,1,,1,13.2,April,"8,",75,1,1,"New Lara is pretty cool...The game is quite enjoyable; the gameplay has its flaws obviously, specially with the ""covering system"", since it's sort of a dynamic thing, Lara will sometimes take an awkward position behind a box and the enemies will insta detect you, which in this game is extremely annoying... For the most part the gameplay is good, it has small details but nothing too bad, I really enjoyed playing this game, exploring the beautifully designed island and figuring some puzzles here and there.But now with the enemies... Please! The enemies are laughable! The AI is plain stupid, they just charge and spray gunfire at you, and this only works if they corner you... And this applies to ""Bosses"" too... Seriously, I kept upgrading my firearms because of Boss paranoia, like I kept on saving my Overkill shotgun for the giant samurai guy... And I took him out with the bow... Just like with 99% of the enemies, boss fights that promised to be epic battles where Lara's cunningness would've shone are replaced with lame Quicktime Events and the pretty obvious fight that you'd expect from the beggining never comes, it is, again, a cutscene with quicktime events...You can feel that the designers wanted to go for a more stealthy gameplay, but some of the scripted horde fights prove this wrong... And those parts get boring extremely fast, they feel so forced and unnecesary that sometimes you might have to save your game and take a good break.Characters are totally forgettable, literally, the only guy I remember is Jonah, the big guy and the scottish old man... Those two characters have more personality than Lara's mentor and even the main villain. The story is predictable, you see Lara and the other wondering about things that you can see from miles away even if you don't read the journals.Collectibles/extras are worthless, journals are a clear attempt of the designers into deepening the island's background/lore, but all you get are the same inconclusive inferencies made by people in different time periods... The challenges encourage you to explore the maps, those are good, but what about the tombs?The tombs are a big deal in this game right? Since it's called Tomb Raider? Well, not really... Tombs are really forgettable, and the puzzles are rarely ever a challenge, there are no traps, no enemies (seriously, you won't ever find an enemy in a tomb) and the ""Forgotten Tombs"" or whatever are always filled with gadgets and makeshift stuff that makes it feel stupid, just because there are a couple of skulls it doesn't make it a tomb, specially not after Lara crawled over mountains of beer cans and bottles... This was just retarded and it feels like the designers are trying to mock the Tomb Raider of old.Combat can get frustating at times due to the badly designed crosshairs, you will miss 30% of your arrows or bullets without real reason.As for Lara, as I stated before, I like her new looks, you don't really get to ""see"" her change into the skilled, cold explorer that the narrative proposes, but you can really get to like her, and you'll strive to avoid seeing her dying in the cruel death scenes, I know I did...Despite all this, Tomb Raider is a good game and you'll enjoy it for the most part, 8/10"

I still haven’t finished it but it’s alright.I don’t know from experience, but from what I’ve heard this game is nothing like the principle behind the original Tomb Raider franchise. I think this point is made even clearer when I say that to me, this game is just another high fidelity third person action adventure spectacle. There’s nothing wrong with that, but I’m pretty sure Laura Croft was more than that.Anyways, the game is gorgeous to explore and the combat is adequate. The tomb puzzles I’ve completed so far have all been satisfying but nothing really blew me away. Stealth is hit or miss for me; sometimes I feel like a ninja, other times it feels like the AI spots me simply because the game wants an area to be a fire fight. Because I’ve never played a Tomb Raider game, the story was largely inconsequential to me. That’s not to say it’s bad or poorly written, but I think I miss a lot of the impact seeing Laura in this pre-action-hero state.I think this game disappointed a lot of people, but as far as third person action adventure goes I think it’s acceptable."

The game was full of sphincter-clenching moments to the end. The storyline was pretty good, though I wouldn't say as deep and twisting as the old games. The shooting and fighting mechanics were pretty decent, though melee felt a little clumsy but maybe that was just me. I liked the new mechanics they've added to Tomb Raider and enjoyed the edge-of-your-seat feel I got to experience fairly often. In total I spent 16 hours completing the storyline with a 70% overall completion rating, which seems like a good length for today's standards and I still have some more to do. Overall, I'd give this game a good 4.5/ 5 stars."

I can honestly get past it well enough, but Lara is impaled far more often than any human being should be, yet heals from bullets, falls, plane crashes, etc within about 10-20 seconds.  Not to mention that she can jump like a pole-vaulting pogo stick.Pretty average/good things: - Combat is pretty decent, nothing fantastic but it's not necessarily the focal point of the game.  Though it's occassionally clumsy, overall experience is fluid enough and positive. - Level design is interesting enough but doesn't branch out too often, and in some locations runs the opposite problem of being too open and chaotic to want to fully explore.The great things about this game: - Voice acting is great throughout the game, there's never an instance of where the voice breaks character or does not seem to fit the actor, good through and through. - Mind games and horror - Maybe it's not your thing (not really mine) but the developers have created situations where you are pressured and forced to make difficult decisions and often witness the outcome of poor decisions, and while it gave me stress, it's definitely engaging and interesting. - Stealthy movement and combat is very enjoyable and one of my favorite parts, taking down enemies with a bow, suppressed pistol, or an ice axe while their comrades walk on unaware is exciting and never feels fake, and is aided by overall good enemy AI. - Controls are very intuitive and I never felt a need to remap keys in any way. - Storyline - The story is probably the single greatest part of this game; being guided through Lara's origin as a survivor is immersive and brings the character from feeling helpless and vulnerable early in the game, when wolves threaten your life, to single-handedly fighting hordes of zombie samurai and winning by the end.  Each of your fellow survivors has a distinctive personality, combined with the top-notch voicing to make them relatable and realistic (unlike Lara's life expectancy).Ultimately Tomb Raider is a great game that feels more like experiencing a story than playing a game, and should be enjoyable for anyone appreciative of a good story and gameplay, with only minor shortcomings overall.8.4 / 10 stars"

Tomb Raider is a fascinating game, it's rather addicting for the most part & I've gotta say, it's a step away from the normal.Many people tend to dislike this game because they feel it's another generic cash-cow that shouldn't be milked anymore for what it's worth, but I felt that it told quite an interesting story, especially since it's kind of like the birth of Lara Croft's life as the Tomb Raider all over game, just in a different perspective.It takes a turn, from following an ancient story-line, but give it more of a modern approach, the controls for it are very easy to go along with, but the game itself highly encourages exploration, I wouldn't know to say if it has any real replay value, but I think I'd replay it again, I feel that everyone is different, I highly recommend it, but others.. not so much, but I feel it offers something great to those who've been a fan of the franchise for years on end or even newcomers who haven't sunken their teeth into a Tomb Raider game before.I don't feel this is much of a review because I try not to spoil the experience for others, but I definitely say look into it yourself if you want to get it, sometimes people are too biased for their own good & would just hate at any chance they possibly could!"

I'm not familiar with the Tomb Raider series, but this game was quite enjoyable. It's really similar to the Uncharted series, with not overly complex puzzles, cover-based action sequences and amazing setpieces. It's not very long, but doesn't get repetitive at all. The only thing I didn't enjoy at all were the many brutal death scenes awaiting our protagonist. Well worth it's current price, it becomes a must-have for fans of the genre when paired with a decent sale. The DLC is largely forgettable, although the extra tomb was nice."

In the past, Tomb Raider has been about exploration, puzzle-solving, and the occasional dramatic combat encounter.  This one and the one right after it drop off the puzzle-solving and intellectually clever level design in favor of the same dramatic action movie experience that every other game has been doing already.  This is a disappointing turn for the series, but this is still a great game at what it focuses on.  As a cinematic action/platformer, the new TOMB RAIDER is fantastic.  The presentation is top-notch and the most difficult part of presentation to achieve, flowing from one thing to the next, is achieved flawlessly here.  Quick-time-events, cover-based combat sections, and actual cinematics combine into a perfectly-flowing story that tells a fascinating origin story for Lara Croft.  The only thing missing is what the old Tomb Raiders have; a sense of the unknown, mysterious discoveries, and using your own mind to think where to go, what to do, and how to solve the next puzzle.A freeform sense of discovering and figuring out this new world is very lacking in this TOMB RAIDER.  There ARE secrets to discover which have fairly good hiding spots, but that's nothing compared to the very introverted experience that previous Tomb Raiders achieved.  An unknown, mysterious world full of puzzles to solve and secrets to discover (including all-out secret levels in some cases) provides a tremendous feeling of satisfaction that a cinematic action movie experience can't compare to.  Instead of imitating action movies that spoil the plot in the trailers before you even get to see the film, Tomb Raider needs to continue providing a Safe Haven for the intellectually-inclined.  I want an experience of the mind that requires me to think and allows me to relax.  It's fortunate that the spin-off LARA CROFT GO provides that experience on the puzzle and relaxation side (which I highly recommend for your android phone).  Unfortunately, the latest reboot for the TOMB RAIDER series is moreso cinematic action movie game plagiarism.  Even the ""survival"" aspects are watered down and barely have a presence or effect in this game (the sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider DOES expand on the survival aspects).  I wish that TOMB RAIDER could focus on the feeling of being lost and curious as the series has before.  Bring back the puzzles, exploration, and sense of mystery before the series changes for the worse.Overall, this is a great game for what it is.  Definitely worth playing through.  DO NOT buy this expecting it to be Tomb Raider.  Buy it expecting it to be the cinematic action movie game that the majority of games already are.  And expect it to do that well."

The makers did a good job at making certain points eery and giving you the feeling that something can happen any second. At other points they did a great job showing the beauty of the island. The graphics and music they used for it just make it feel real. The extra tombes are a nice extra and give some extra challenge. Some more than a others.I havent played the MP of TB sinces I dont see the point of having one in TR. Might give it a go, but I bought TR for the SP, which when it ended i found a bit short. It took me 9 hours to complete the story with 77% completion. I did some searching for items, which lengthened the game. If you dont search i think you could easily finish this within 7hours. At the moment i dont see myself replaying this game at the hardest difficulty, therefor the story is to fresh in my mind..Summary:+Good graphics and animations.+Good storyline.+The setting is really great.+Good music.+Puzzles are not that hard that they get frustrating, but there not too easy that you can solve them without planning ahead.-I experienced the water bug a few times, but it didnt affect the gameplay.-Semi-short story. I have completed it in 9 hours, at 77% completion, with all the hidden tombes.-I sometimes to the feeling the recycled certains things, candles, bodies, certain animations.-Replay value is low.

6897,Vengeur Synthétique,https://steamcommunity.com/id/syntheticavenger/,1,,1,99.5,January,"16,",125,0,1,"I've noticed some people aren't big fans of this game, because ""it's not a Tomb Raider"". Well, I'm a Tomb Raider fan for almost ten years and I've played every game from the series. It's surprising how much the series evolved from 1996. The newest Tomb Raider is absolutely one of the best games I've ever played and the best game in the franchise. I like how Crystal Dynamics created Lara from the very beginning and though I liked the old Lara, I definetely love the new one! We're welcomed with a very interesting story, Lara and her crew being shipwrecked on the island and there they're attacked by some kind of freaking cult. Lara and the rest of the survivors have to find out why they crashed on this island and how to escape it. I'm not going to spoil the whole story, because it's really interesting, so I'll let you find out the rest of it.Some people may say that there's not much tombs in the new Tomb Raider. Well, it can be true, but everything depends on the point of view. Think about it, spooky island with no way to escape, insane cult and tons of dead bodies everywhere. Well, for me it counts as a one, big, creepy tomb! It is a Tomb Raider, there's no doubt about that. And this is very good reboot of the series. I like these few RPG elements, weapon upgrading system and the story as a whole. The graphics are also pretty amazing, music fits perfectly in this game. Actually the only thing I don't really like are other members of the Endurance crew. They don't have a ""soul"", thery don't have any interesting story, they just.. are.But Lara is just perfect. She's finally a human, not just a cyborg that kills everything around her. Sure, there's lot of killing in Tomb Raider, but it's an action game, it has to be that way. Also, the game isn't really difficult, so playing on ""easy"" isn't challenging even for the amateurs - keep that in mind while beginning your adventure with new Lara Croft.Anyways, Tomb Raider is an awesome action adventure game. I really hope Square Enix will eventually release its sequel for PC and PlayStation players not just for Microsoft platforms, because everyone deserves to know about Lara's new adventures. But that is yet to come and for now my final score for this game is 9.5/10 and I totally recommend it!"

The story is great and kept me hooked till the end. And the lore! the whole island is full interesting locations, tombs, and relics. I spent a great deal of my time just making sure I didn't pass up a tomb or hidden relic, and I still haven't found them all yet. My favorite relics though had to be the lore centered around the japanese soldiers that landed on the island looking for a way to control the storms there and maybe use it as a weapon during WWII several years ago. I mean the rest is good, but I just have a thing for WWII stuff, especially the things history left out at first. (even if it's Fictional History like this.)The combat system was great, the enemy AI was fairly smart and always kept you on your feet, literally they often flushed you out of whatever cover you had. They also reacted to your actions, sometimes in verbal form, example ""Damn she's a good shot"" or ""She's reloading"" sometimes they even cursed you or reacted when, for example, you shot a guy off a zipline,All of this made the experience feel more real, engaging, and just fun.The Crafting and skill level system are well done, and don't disappoint. Although they could have probably made it even more customizable than they did.And the action sequences are top notch. They're well done, fast paced, and highly entertaining. Some of them can be fairly challenging though, especially the button ""mashing"" ones.That all said, it's not a perfect game. As I said above, the button mashing sequences can be hard. Though it's mostly because it's not real button mashing. if you button mash it to hell you won't win it and most likely will die. in reality, it's actually tapping the button repeatedly in a certain rhythm rather than random ""hammer your key to death"" button mashing. Fortunately, it's very easy to figure out how hard and fast you actually need to hit the button early on, so this isn't a huge problem, but is still a fair nusiance at times, one that may cause you to die two or three times.Some of the camera movement can be ackward at times but is fairly rare for the most part. Though it does bring back nostalgica memories of some the older Tomb Raider games, the older of which didn't have the best camera and movement controls.The Puzzles in the game could be a little more tricky at times. A lot of them were good and had some real creativity to them but you could figure out most of them usually within a few minutes. There are some that may have you stuck for a while but not more than maybe an hour or so usually. Don't get me wrong ,though, they're fun most of the time, however you don't get as big a feel of achievement like you would with some of the older games which had some really brutal and unforgiving puzzles that would just make you scream in anger sometimes.In short, The story's great, the action sequences are awesome but challenging at times, The combat and AI are done well, the puzzles are meh but entertaining nonetheless, and the lore found in every document, relic, and tomb are beautifully well done and interesting.I would highly recommend this game."

6918,Jack Dagnalz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jackdagnalz/,1,,1,13.4,January,"3,",328,0,1,"I played many of the old Tomb Raider games when they were released.  While the first few were groundbreaking and fun, they don't really hold up today.  This series was in need of a reboot, but I avoided this release for quite some time.  Something about calling it ""Tomb Raider"" reeked of a Hollywood-style sequel cash in.  My first impression was wrong.  The new Lara is relatable and (largely) believeable.  She actually has a character arc and stands on her own without relying on her assets...  Although the story can lean uncomforably close to ""torture porn"" levels, I can see why they chose such a grimy tone.  Lara is forced to mature and develop in a short time.  Making players feel something, even discomfort, for a character is good.I wasn't a fan of the large numbers of QTEs in the game.  But, again, semi-adventure 3rd person games feel compelled to use this crutch, and when done right it can switch up the pace from the combat.  That's not to say combat was bad, though.  The more active aiming and cover system are improvments on the ""lock on"" system from the past.You can't have ""Tomb Raider"" without the Tombs and Raiding.  However, the developers' focus clearly wasn't on the puzzle solving this time around.  The puzzles rely on the player using a small amount of physics based tools.  Thus, they are much easier to solve than those from past games.  The ""intuition view"" highlights any object that can be manipulated.  This makes puzzles only a test of executing the clearly laid out steps from the developers.I recommend this game to all players, both fans and detractors of the Tomb Raider series.  It isn't perfect, but it's a good reboot and I will play the next one on release.  85/100 ish."
6919,Draden,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012273350/,1,,1,11.1,January,"3,",238,0,1,"Review after first playthroughThis game is certainly the most interesting one for me in the Tomb Raider series. The protagonist is portrayed not as a superhuman, but as a down-to-earth regular person who grows stronger as she goes through a challenging journey. The story itself is generic and not very memorable, a pretty standard adventure movie plot the world is full of. It is told through numerous cutscenes, listening in on NPC discussions and many items and journals scattered throughout the world. How the story is told works well, even if it the story itself is a bit silly.Gameplay is well done. Fight sequences are particularly enjoyable with all the sneaking, hiding, dodging and switching between different weapons to best fit the situation. There are some Tomb Raider style puzzles in the game, but I found all of them pretty simple. I would not have minded more challenging puzzles. One thing I really disliked was the numerous quicktime events. The problem with quicktime events is that it feels like random button smashing. If you fail once, you’ll make it the next time as you’ve memorized the right sequence. There’s no real connection between the controls and how the character actually behaves. It all feels very artificial especially when tacked onto a game where one has a high level of control of the character elsewhere. Plain old cutscenes would be better.Visually the game is impressive. The environment is beautifully modeled and diverse. The atmosphere in the game feels dark and gloomy, which I personally enjoyed. Nvidia 3D Vision works great in this game, really enhances immersion.All in all, a good but not great game. Recommended, but only on discount."

The character and environment graphics are awesome, and Lara is more human, as in: stumbling when she's hurt, holding a bow strained for a short time (and not like previous versions indefinite long), having more emotions (examples: expressions, panting, being hurt with a high fall), not forgetting the (rather) smart AI enemies (who will hide, move to another spot, and taking different amounts of damage depending on where they are hit, and stumbling after beng hit), and much more (but too much to write down here).If you liked playing Tomb Raider before, or just like to play an adventure/action game with goals and puzzles that will challenge you, this game is an absolute must have."

I don't mind being held by the hand as buildings blow up around me and my blood is pumping through half-scripted action & both subtle / obnoxious QTEs. I have room to love the rush of immersive & 'stupid' action scenes & to be a pretentious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ making appreciative references to Pynchon or Godard, blindly disproving his irrelevance. Tomb Raider gets the style it's going for so good, it pulls off the wannabe Uncharted action effortlessly, the island setting is designed-out-the-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to explore & fire arrows into the one deer you have to hunt and then the millions of men that follow it.Where the action immerses, unfortunately, the story kicks you out, cold, in the hammiest of hammy ways. Uncharted can brilliantly sit side by side with Indiana Jones after a weekend Whedon marathon, TR can't catch the b-movie feel for beans; a bad story that deserves more angry expletives than I've giving it, that smashes you, the player, over the head with condescending plot progression shown in cutscenes and then told to you multiple times in talking, overly-dramatic journal pages. Characters X&Y share a secret relationship, first shown in an early cutscene, then repeatedly the relationship's explained through the rest of the game in collectathon audio journals, making sure you, the player, know why Character X acts the way they do, despite remaining an undeveloped caricature alongside the rest of the undeveloped caricatures failing to serve any purpose to the story. Character Z&Mu let it known they're up to no good outta the gate, then again & again in every following cutscene, & yet here we are, getting paper journals recorded by them talking to themselves about how wonderfully sinister & malicious & 2-dimensional they are.Rest of the game rocks."

I highly recommend this game as long as you have a fairly recent PC like 3 years old or newer you should be fine :) (Unless its a PC that you bought 3 years ago and payed only £500 for) and anything old than 5 years you will strugle to have exceptable frames.  I mean I did have Tri SLi 780Ti and was only getting between 30 - 55 FPS until i reverted back to SLi 780Ti and im now still only running 70 - 110 FPS (its generally sits around 85 FPS mark). You can read bio for PC specs to get an idea on the PC you need although mine is a bit over the top so you could get say a Nvidia 780 instead of two Nvidias 780Ti's or the ATI card equalvilent.

6939,Palantír,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hickey23/,1,,1,8.3,December,"29,",175,0,1,The original games had emphasis on puzzle solving and the action was just for flavour.  In this game the puzzles are just a few physics based reaction tests and the action is the emphasis. From mainly tomb raiding and occasional action to mainly action and occasional tomb raiding. An ok game by itself but not really what Tomb Raider was about originally. Beware the many QTEs. They seem to be designed in such a way that you are bound to see Lara die in gruesome ways more than once.  As if the developers wanted to punish her for becoming what she is today. If you want to play as the female Rambo get this game.

6949,Frungi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frungi/,1,,1,39.3,December,"26,",651,0,1,"Bottom line first: Know what to expect or be disappointed. It’s a great interactive action-adventure movie, save for some of the shootouts. Though it controls well, it’s not a great game if you didn’t want to play through a movie, and the story’s execution had some issues.This game is filled with cutscenes that abruptly interrupt gameplay and then abruptly give back control. There were several times I wasn’t sure if I was supposed to be playing or waiting. There are also several setpieces where gameplay essentially consists of “hold forward and press jump to win.” One fairly early segment literally accepts no input other than holding Up to watch Lara dramatically climb a very tall ladder. Some of the normal gameplay’s jumping and climbing, while fun, even feels a little like it plays itself.I’m sure everyone who cares has heard by now that the story, or what they were trying to do with it, jars with the actual game. This girly archaeologist gets stuck on a hostile island, and no sooner does she come to grips with being forced to kill someone than she coldly murders everyone in sight. Other than that, it’s a well-plotted Tomb Raider story. There’s a legendary historical site, evil people want it, and surprise, the legends are true and supernatural; but it’s told well.The game is pretty linear, but it rewards exploration—at least until you find items to reveal nearly every collectable on your map. But running off the wrong way and discovering a journal you didn’t know was there is fun (until the game tells you where everything is). There are some simple and small puzzles throughout, but the game wants you to keep your forward momentum too badly to really give you a challenge. You don’t stop in the middle of an action movie to try to piece together a clever puzzle.That’s the whole issue with this game. It wants to be an action movie. If you go into it expecting anything else—for instance, a game demanding precise jumps and the ability to solve complex, area-spanning puzzles—you will be disappointed. That is not what this game is trying to be. Enjoy it for what it is, and get popcorn butter all over your controller (disclaimer: bad idea)."

The Positives:-This story is very good and there are progressions often, so you don't lose interest and for me that is a major positive in any game.-The controls make sense and are easy to adjust to.-Clara is a total badass whilst dealing with all of the challenges and crap she has to deal with.-The environments are breathtaking. You really feel like you're in some of the areas. There's one radio tower you have to climb and looking down made my stomach drop.-Reasonable price. I picked it up for 5 bucks but had I known how good it was I would've had no problem paying 20.The Negatives:-The extra tombs that you can raid, esecially the early ones, are almost too easy.-You can upgrade you weapons, which is helpful, but some upgrades are so small or pointless i just dont notice them and i feel like i've wasted my hard-earned salvage.-My only problem with the story is that basically everything that can possibly go wrong does, whether it's a badguy happening to walk by, someone being to stupid for their own good, or the ""island"" just being an ass.All in all this game is a solid 8/10, I hope this helped."

This game has its pros and cons, like every other game, but the pros outweigh the cons. There's only a few things that could have been better. I feel as if the game was a bit too short (I beat the game in 11 hours). Although, that could simply be because the characters were intriguing and the intro sucked me in. Lara Croft is very realistic, i'm not just talking about her looks, but her emotions and ambitious, unrelenting personality. I'd rather have a game that is short and deep than long and lacking in emotion and depth.The one thing that disappointed me the most was how small the world felt. You can only go backwards or forwards, there's not much to explore besides some optional tombs that are sometimes puzzling but not very difficult to complete. This game isn't hard to beat but it's still fun. Wait for when it goes on sale, I wouldn't buy it for $20 (I actually got it for $7).There's several ways that Lara can die and they're all pretty gruesome. I died once and after the death scene I vowed to keep her alive at whatever costs. I think the deaths really make you want to keep her alive and puts you in a sort of survival mode. There's not much to complain about, this game is action packed and it makes me want to start lifting because Lara has some amazing arm strength.TLDR; Cons: Short, not difficult, small worldPros: Great graphics, nice game play, Lara Croft is badass"

Story is really boring and so are the characters. I really like how the game visually looks, but I just can't get over the sillyness. Game makes you feel like you have no control what so ever over what's happening, things just explode and you try to press right buttons to not die. Miss one button and you have to do it aaaaall oveeer agaaaiin!+ It's fun to play + Female protagonist+ Extra things are pretty fun to collect+ Tombs- The story. oh god- Quick time events are not good at all. Have been done much better in other games- I don't really like how graphic her dying scenes are. Like really. why.- Overly sexualized voice acting. Really, the sexy heavy breathing every time she talks? Really?- GPS caches give you like 5 xp. Why.- Tombs are pretty simple, and the treasures aren't really anything interestingOver all, I guess it's worth the money, but I wish Lara was more in control like she usually is in Tomb raiders. I know, this is ""the origin of Lara Croft"" but she can basically kill army of guys in this so what's up with trying to keep that ""I'm sooo innocent what is happening"" attitude? You'd think she'd be pretty traumatized after this thing happening and not taking a career as a tomb raider in the future.I'm really mixed with giving this thumbs up or down, but I guess I would still recommend playing this.

I'm not saying its better than Last of Us, whos gameplay it does resemble, but I AM saying it's a pretty damn well-done game. Some of your first ever run through the game may involve a lot of trial-and-error ""sorry lara""'s. Pros:-Graphics are amazing, voices are on point-leveling/salvage systems are paced pretty well-Lara is hot as ever. I don't get bored of her voice the way I do with, say, badly dubbed MMORPG voices.-You don't miss out on much when you don't buy the DLC outfits; her default one is the nicest imho.-Plenty of gold skulltulas. AKA ♥♥♥♥ to find just for the sake of finding 'em, AKA replay value.Cons:-Nobody is on the multiplayer as far as I know.-Too much ammo. All the time. I don't want to spoil much, but you end up having 4 weapons and you'd have to be either blind or deliberately challenging yourself to be lacking in ammo. Ever. Which brings me to the next point...-On the most difficult combat mode, you've got enemies that mow you down too quickly with their automatic weapons and you've got enemies with bows and arrows that don't hurt you fast enough to kill you. On top of that, Lara has call-of-duty-esque health, while enemies' throwables (dynamite, molotovs) don't do a great job flushing you out. Lara also gets dodge-kill techniques, which basically render all melee enemies... useless and unchallenging. All these elements combined take away from the quality of enemy confrontation gameplay.-The storyline, as interesting as it is, is as full of ♥♥♥♥ as the Angelina Jolie movies were. You'll appreciate it with the right amount of imagination and ""sure okay""'s, but don't be too... nevermind. It's interesting.Don't take my fat paragraph of cons to heart, I've played the single player a lot and I really, really love this game. Possibly because I haven't played much of Last of Us. Possibly because Lara is hot. But the only other games I've played through twice in consecutive sittings are Batman Arkham City and Gears of War III."

However, as you come to the end of the story (no spoilers here, duh) you start to realise that Lara is a killermachine, which does not play into the role of an teenager that well...The story and characters are wonderfully introduced and are spoken well. (German, at least)In conclusion, if you feel like playing a different game for some time (or you like Assasin's creed like games) I would definetly recommend this game."

But i did. After their ship gets into a very heavy storm  Lara Croft and her team of scientists strand at this  strange island. Lara obviously knows more stuff about this island and old tribes, ancient treasure.. and after a short survival intro  she realizes that there a some strange people on this island doing very weird ococult stuff...This game is fast paced, packed with action, incredibly nice to look at, has really (!) brilliant graphics and  wonderfully designed worlds. The leveling system is decent, its a perfect mix between survival in the jungle, horror in dark caves, stealth / bow, intelligent & not annoying puzzles (great physics btw), incredible action and climbing.One could definitly argue that the story is a little shallow - i mean, again and again the group splits and lara is on her own for somehow not convincing reasons; also Lara seems always to know alittle more than  the player does, buts thats alright, we trust her.. - however, the tempo and the plot still makes the game intense enough, also because of the intense voice acting and the rewarding weapons and skills Lara learns, which alltogether give the game somehow a feel of realism.In the end u really get a rewarding final and a super exciting and actionpacked ending.Even tohough the designers tried to make the game a little bit of an open world game, this is probably more to see as an intelligent attempt to make the game somehow deeper, but still this game is clearly a linear game in which (for me) it doesnt make much sense to explore the (somehow ""dead"") island any further after the campaign is done, which was the case after 12 hours and 65% overall solved - there are no real new enemies or experiences waiting to be encountered, at least thats what i found after giving it a short try.I never found a tomb raider title really worth to play before - however - this one is more than worth it. Its THE perfect game for everyone who ever thought ""the Tomb Raider franchise has so much potential"" - this is THE adventure game u ever wanted - play it - you will love it.The game mixes the parcour from ""Mirrors Edge"", the climbing from ""Assassins Creed"", the athmosphere from ""Indiana Jones"" movies, the fighting and other stuff from ""Prince of Persia"", its is somehow hard an dirty like ""Rage"" (sespecially the games A.I is reminding me on that one) and  has wonderfully landscapes and light effects  reminding me of ""Halflife 2"".The game is nearly perfectly programmed, there was exactly NO situation in which i really had to look up the walkthrough, which didnt happen to me for quite a looong time ;)I give it 89/100"

The story in this game is really good too, the way you feel like you are a part of all the cutscenes and really start to feel for Laura is amazing.

6999,StableSystem,https://steamcommunity.com/id/stablesystem/,1,,1,11.5,November,"30,",153,0,1,"One of the best looking games I've ever played. Tomb Raider is a very intricate and interesting game with a story to go along. The main plot is great and easy to follow. Gameplay is just as good. While there are only a few weapons, they are well made and every kill is satisfying even after playing for hours. A favorite part of mine is the ability to  think outside the box when acomplishing tasks. The puzzle aspect is fun and the difficulty ranges from easy to rather tricky. All in all its a great game with great graphics, the multiplayer is... well if your getting it, its for single player anyways so who cares (also I've never played it). Although i bought the GOTY edition, it didnt seem to add much other then a few outfits which really arnt worth it, vanilla seems to be the way to go. Of everything, my only gripes would be that the story is too short (only took me 11 hours straight throught) however there is much more to do than just the story. My other gripe would be that it feels a bit too guided. Sometimes it doesnt feel organic enough and it tends to be narrow as far as diversity at times. Overall I would rate this game an 8.5/10"

The story seemed to flow well, albeit in an outlandish setting [but what video game isn't?] , the game mechanics were smooth and easy to adapt to and learn, and the pacing was consistantly good with just enough going on to keep you interested and enough downtime to let you explore a little if you want to. The single player run through was a sensible length, around 8-10 hours I believe. A fair span for modern games [although I maintain that modern games are too short in general and rely too heavily on making this up in multiplayer, but that's another rant entirely].It's also an extremely attractive game with some beautiful scenery. All in all I see no reason not to buy this game, especially since it's been around long enough that it'll no longer make your wallet cry."

First of all, I just have to say (especially being a girl), that I appreciated the more realistic approach of Lara's character, both visually and personality-wise. She was someone I could relate to. Instead of unrealistically conquering everything she does, this game really highlighted the true nature of how someone would react in this situaiton. Through both her hesitant actions, tough decisions, and the voice-acting of her character, Lara Croft became an actual person. Her actions, her emotions, it was raw and real, and I was grateful for it.But it wasn't just the (severely needed) change of character that made this game great. It was the actual gameplay itself. I enjoyed every aspect of this game and was on my seat the entire time. I wanted to know what would happen next (the story was very gripping) and I had fun in every scenario and location. There was the right mix of puzzles and combat, and the different actions Lara could do made the game more engaging. My only complaint is the use of real-time action, because sometimes it was unclear what you needed to do, and there were countless times where I was taken by surprise and died unnecessarily. However, I thought it was cool how in every step of a real-time situation, if you did happen to die, there would be a unique death scene that matched with the action. That was an added touch that actually made a difference in how I viewed the event. Overall, this game is fun, gripping, engaging, and definitely worth the buy."

Overall I would rate this game a solid 8/10, and here is why:+Amazing & entertaining gameplay. At all times will you be progressing; earning new skills and weapons.+Very beautiful graphics+Fairly long storyline. (Especially when completing all optional dungeons and looking for relics for exp and materials.)+Interesting mechanics like hunting, completing optional challenges and exploring tombs for exp.+Very diverse areas to explore throughout the game.-Little to zero replay value. Once you've completed the game, you have most likely seen all there is to it. -Somewhat linear game.

From the first 10 minutes and onward I was completely hooked in this very atmospheric game.. It's really great! I maxed the graphics and it looks fantasic, I just love the design.The story is actually really good and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I even liked the small artifacts and notes you looked for as an extra feature. And I don't usually like that type of things in game. But in Tomb Raider I think they really add something to the story.But hey, the story was great and all that, but did it really have to be so much enemies? The combat is okay but there's just too much enemies, it got kind of boring and eventually I did lower the difficulty to easy just for a smoother gameplay and a more flowing storyline.

Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.You start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.While you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.The graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.The enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.I like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the (""run for your life"") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.The game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it. The single-player is a definite must-play for everyone who likes survival, shooting, and gorgeous women. I love this game, and I recommed you check it out, espcially when it goes on sale."

I'm not sure whether it was worth the money despite the overwhelmingly positive reviews that this game has.I hated most Lara Croft games because of they're inability to be user friendly, at the same time complicated (am I making sense here?)This game is the real deal. After the intense doubt i have placed upon all tomb raider games, this one brought me back to life. The game feels like assassins creed in someways, though is much better overall. I can see now why this is game of the year in 2013. I truly love it.Compared against the older Lara Croft games, this one wins hands down. The other games are s***Overall, BUY THIS GAME!!!You'll love it i Guarantee you!"
7044,nexigen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nexigen/,1,,1,29.6,October,"17,",392,0,1,"This isn't the old Tomb Raider that was filled with puzzles and adventure.  It has some of that, but nothing like the anniversary edition.This is the prequel of Tomb Raider.  It is VERY linear with mostly first-person-shooter gameplay.  You won't get lost in this game easily, since there is constant check-points and beacons.  The graphics are excellent.  For what the game is, without comparison to anniversary, it's quite fun.  You play Lora before she became tough.  You get to watch her go from a fragile and scared girl to a warrior.The combat controls work rather well, I had no trouble with fighting once I got the hang of it.  And there's tons of fighting.  Everything was fairly easy to kill, I think, but not as simple as some games.  I think the stealth system might have wanted some more work, but overall the game seemed rather polished.  Though, I would love to see a tomb raider that didn't have any combat, just rock climbing and puzzles/traps."

The beautiful and amazing movement mechanics allows you to explore the world with ease and a visual satisfaction. The storyline is also magnificent and beautifully crafted. Although some sections of the game may seem predictable the developers have done an excellent job of limiting the number of them and adding multiple plot twists. This game will easily keep you busy for 10 hours on your first play through, without exploring any of the optional tombs. If you are a big fan of the Tomb Raider series either through the movies or the older games this is an excellent game for you that will keep you busy for countless hours. I would rate this game a 9.8/10 for its breathtaking graphics, amazing movement mechanics and great story. This game really does do a great job of engaging the audience with Lara's orgin story.

In terms of graphics and level design the work done on TR is fantastic.   In terms of plot and character development the work is astounding.  Lara Croft lives through this aventure and survives, and becomes the Tomb Raider of legend.  In doing so she becomes not only one of the strongest women in a game, but it becomes very clear why Lara Croft always was an awesome character.  Yes there are a few annoyances with scripted events forcing you down a funnel, but let's be honest, not many people play a game like Tomb Raider expecting the freedom of Skyrim, so I'll forgive it that."
7070,iabace,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iabace/,1,,1,15.9,October,"10,",566,1,1,"Do you remember Lara Croft? That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.This new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.The story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ♥♥♥ chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.To sum it up, just buy it. It offers an enjoyable experience regardless of whether you're familiar with the older Tomb Raider titles."

7084,TheSultan96,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSultan96/,1,,1,11.7,September,"16,",90,0,1,"I can comfortably recommend this game- the first thing to note is that it is, visually, just absolutely stunning, and the voice acting is totally on point.Whilst this game is, by definition, a free roaming game (as you can fast travel around the island to explore) I found that I didn't need to fast travel- not even once- through the entire campaign, and that is because Tomb Raider's true accolades lie with the incredibly strong storyline, which 100% makes up for the fact that the game is really quite linear. Even on the default difficulty, the AI behaves somewhat intelligently- enough to keep you on your toes. If you remain sedentary, they'll flank you, and they will keep you pinned down using bullets, arrows and firebombs. The game also has just enough suspense to hold your attention (as we've grown to expect from Montreal) as well as really fantastic character development- you truly do root for Lara.In terms of FLAWS though, I'd say that this game isn't perfect- if you play strategically and stealthy like I do (meaning you use your bow and axe as much as possible, and always go for the headshots) then you'll find the other weapons to be more like extra accessories, and you'll also find a lot more ammo than you really need. Maybe I played it wrong? Maybe you're meant to spray and pray? Idk...I also found the perk system a bit pointless- there were very few actually decent perks, and they really didn't change the game much. I'd also say that this game is just chock full of quicktime events. Like seriously. And whilst these take a little bit of getting used to, once you progress into the game, they'll become incredibly predictable (but I wouldn't call them tedious) and you'll see them happen long before they actually do.This game is definitely worth playing if you want to experience a really quality game, where you can experience the fruits of all of the hard work that went into creating it. It doesn't take too long to complete, but it really is a worthwhile journey."

Croft has been taken from innocence in this introduction! The gameplay and story line are amazing and they way the go, detail to detail is just superb. I managed to get 100% game progress within my first and only play through. If you're a Steam Achievement Hunter, you will be disappointed as (approx) 50% of achievements are multiplayer, which sadly, is dead. No players are online ( tested within full 30 hours of playing ).I cannot go too much into details on my review on it, because honestly, I will spoil things. So I will just go with a Pro/Con list for what I can immediately think of. Pros : - Controls ( via Microsoft Remote ) are amazing and layed out beautifully. - Graphically attractive. Some of the best graphics I've seen in awhile. - Storyline is simply superb. - Puzzles allow for thought and can sometimes be tricky ( I dispise games that have puzzles but are simple ). Cons : - Extremely Repetitive. Throughout gameplay, I found myself bored with doing the same old song and dance. - Multiplayer is dead ( which is a downfall for additional gameplay ). - Single playthrough game ( if you play with clearing each area ). I would recommend anyone to purchase this game, if you like puzzles and adventure, heck, you can even play ( most of the game ) with being silent. I love being a ""ninja"". 9/10- Poser Punx"

If you don't have a console then you will probably love it as there are few good games of this genre for the pc. The game takes place in a mysterious island  with interconnected paths though this is far from an open-world game.    About the characters and the plot of the game I have to say that I was dissapointed. There are the bad guys, the good guys  and the island you have to escape from...That's it!. Also none of the characters is remarkable and all of them are badly voiced acted except from Lara. Though  even her voice acting was just fine and nothing special.    The gameplay is good enough as Lara will have to climb mountains and other structures, use ropes and her bow in order to reach her destination in the island. There are also some very enjoying sections where Lara has to escape from collapsing structures. What i didnt like about gameplay was the gunplay and the riddles. Gunplay because weapons don't have the right feeling and riddles because they are too easy, repetitive and you use the same methods on all of them. Also I almost hated the game for not having a dedicated key for taking cover! You just enter cover automatically when you are near walls and sadly this does not always work right.   One of the strongest aspects of this game are it's graphics asuming that you have a powerful enough system. Everything is perfect here from textures to animations and... Lara's hair if you have an amd card! The sound however is a little generic compared to other games. Sound effects as well as the soundtrack are forgetable.  The multiplayer is also generic. It has nothing special to offer and you will probably get bored of it after 3-4 matches.   As I said before Tomb Raider is one of the few good third person action adventure games out for pc so yes I recommend it. On pc Tomb Raider is one of its kind. But if you own a ps3 like me (I am not neither a console fanboy nor a pc one, I like both platforms) as well as any game of the Uncharted trilogy you will find this game a step down on every aspect and it just can't keep up to the competition.

7089,King Johnson,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kingjohnson/,1,,1,44.5,September,"7,",537,0,1,"You follow Lara as she transitions from an innocent young lady to a survivor that must do anything and everything to survive.Graphically this game is beautiful, the way they was able to transition from gameplay to cut scenes so seamlessly was a thing of beauty. The scenes/views from mountains, beaches, etc. are stunning, while they was able to keep the eerie feel of a dark damp tomb. They kept the feel of the older Tomb Raider games by keeping the platformer feel and adding in some very unique puzzles, as well as lots of collectables and challenges. The platformer feel was done toperfection, its pretty seamless, and has just enough of it so that it feels like a platformer but at the same time doesn't feel like Mario. Lots of collectables and challenges that aren't to taxing to find while some are very hidden or require some thinking to get to or complete. The puzzles while not being to difficult do require some thinking and for the most part are pretty cleaver and unique, with each puzzle being progressively harder and requiring you to use a new unlockable. Character progression is as usual in these sort of games, as you progress in the game you unlock new abilities, weapons, and tools by natural progression through the story. You will then use exp. gained by killing enemies, locating hidden items, or completing challenges to unlock the unlockables. The combat system is surprisingly good, the AI aren't stupid but at the same time they aren't COD(veteran difficulty)AI. You have an assortment of weapons to use that have lots of different attachments, from an incendiary shotgun to a silenced pistol, to a bow with dynamite arrows. The achievements for this game aren't to taxing, with only one being missable. None of the achievementsare difficulty based, so you can play on easy if needed. There are collectable achievements but, since you are able to play after the completion as well as getting an ability that allows you to see the collectables it isn't tough. The only bad achievements are multilayerachievements, the upside is most of them can be boosted by your self in a private match. The multiplayer is fun at times, given that you can actually find a match but, can be very glitch and frustrating.All in all this is a great game that is defiantly worth checking out."

The skill progression and equipment upgrades are pretty much linear, and you'll get enough points for all  if you have been diligently hunting for the artifacts throughout the game. In fact I completed the game with more than enough xp and over 1000 spare salvages with nothing left to spend these on. Thus, for the serious gamers, the RPG aspect of this game may be slightly underwhelming.Replayability: I did not tried the multiplayer mode so no comments on that. But the solo campaign can be done 2 or 3 times before you get bored of the gameplay. Although trying to go for runs with no death, or minimal backtracking may take some time to do so.Storyline: 4/5 nothing too unexpected about the story, nevertheless there are some thrills, emotional scences etc. In fact on my second play through, i noticed how the collectible artifacts and notes/diaries breath quite a lot of life to the Island of Yamatai, and gave the story more depth for players to enjoy.Value for money: 5/5 during steam 75% discount. 4/5 at full price if you like story oriented action RPG."

Either way I love this game!I have played all of the Tomb Raider titles apart from Anniversary on various consoles (mainly PC) and I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. Seeing the previews back in 2012 about the ""survival instinct"" concept had me interested and I bought this title along with some friends. The summer of 2013 was spent completing the single player and eventually I moved on to the multiplayer PVP part of the game, which I found fun, although the small map rotation and easy camping spots made the multiplayer quite repetitive.However the singleplayer story was interesting. I enjoyed the ""freedom"" that came with fast travel fireplaces and have spent many hours outside of the story progression trying to finish ""world completion"". The upgrades system with salvage reduced the story immersion for me, but the upgrades were all useful so no other complaints there! Of course the replayablity of the story plot is very limited, as a year on from finishing the story I can still remember exactly what happens. Apart from that I enjoyed the encounters that happened throughout the story and have had fun replaying those trying to become as stealthy as possible, so although the plot is a onetime thing, the ambushes and stealthy killing is definitely something that can be replayed.Overall, a year on from buying the game, I think that Tomb Raider has been a decent success. I would definitely reccomend the singleplayer story and I am sure that the multiplayer has died down now, but that was also good fun at it's peak. Tomb Raider has been a very enjoyable experience. I only hope the sequel will reach my expectations. :-)"

Perhaps a little too combat heavy in places, but then again I don't really enjoy sitting around for ages in a game solving puzzles either. Perhaps if it had been a little more exploration based then?

(Since I won't be able to play it.) What I don't get is why the PC, and the PS3/4, and the Xbox 360/One platforms also got Tomb Raider, and then have Microsoft and Square Enix ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over anyone and everyone that don't invest in Xbox Ones to play the sequel. I played this game on PC and want to play the sequel on PC. Basically now there are gamers which have played Tomb Raider who don't own an Xbox One who now cannot play Rise of the Tomb Raider (like myself) without shoving AT LEAST $399 up Microsoft's giant wallet to do so, and I honestly don't see Rise of the Tomb Raider to be a 'major' system seller (like Ryse or Dead Rising 3, Sunset Overdrive (?), and TitanFall, two of which are now coming to PC, and one already on PC since game launch) or at least for me that is.So, unless it ends up being an Xbox One exclusive only for a while, until Square Enix announce it for PC, like Ryse and Dead Rising 3, I will NOT be playing this game, at all, because I WON'T buy an Xbox One for just this, now that their some of their AAA exclusives have been announced to be coming to Master Race PCs."

I knew of the previous Tomb Raider games, seen them, but not really played them before. By the time I was finished, I was blown away.The game throws you in to action pretty quickly, a scramble for survival. And the action just kept coming and coming. You never know just what is around the corner. You really get the full understanding how Lara progressed from young and naïve, to a total badas$.The cut scenes in the game are not superfluous, but build on the overall storyline. Generally the game isn’t “on rails”, you do get a lot of space to explore. However, it is (for the most part) obvious where you need to head to and what you need to do.Puzzles are generally not too taxing, but there are a few that might stretch the brain a little. Collectables can be a bit tough to get, depending on where they are. A lot are easy to get to, several are very difficult. But you can work through them by thinking it through.After finishing the main storyline, I went back to pick up the remaining collectables, and only one place did I get stuck (on the beach at the top of the broken elevator – couldn’t work out how to get back down!). Eventually sorted that out and got 100% of all available items.Graphics were great, even fine on my aging GTX580. Audio was nice, not overpowering, but lended to the situation nicely. Voice acting was fantastic. But the screams when someone is burning?!?! WOW!Overall, I haven’t been so engaged with a game that I couldn’t wait to get back into it for a long time. I’m seriously considering getting the remaining DLC content, a first for ANY game on Steam!10/10 VERY HIGHLY recommended."

7163,SanguinarySeraph,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sanguinaryseraph/,1,,1,22.6,July,"16,",459,0,1,"Tomb Raider is a great reboot of the classic franchise which manages to modernise the feel and the gameplay while maintaining a lot of the classic elements. It features some excellent level design and some of the most polished action/platforming gameplay i've seen. Lara's story is compelling and you genuinely feel for her plight (especially when she dies and you're subjected to a horrific ragdoll death animation...*shudder*).+ Great level design+ Really tries to make you feel for Lara and her struggle to survive+ Action/Platforming/General gameplay is very well done+ Environments are beautiful and varied- The two main elements don't mesh very well, it's hard to feel for Lara's struggle and sympathise with her horrible situation when she's murdering people in cold blood, or mowing down hordes of 'bad guys'.Overall it's a game i'd recommend, the game flows fluidly, the main character is actually that; a character - rather than a walking hunk of meat with the personality and dimensions of a fridge whose biggest struggle is getting from chest high wall, to chest high wall. The real issue I have, is that the gameplay doesn't match the emotional side that they've tried to implement. Skating over that however, it's probably the best action/adventure game i've played in recent memory."

It was on Xbox 360 and the PS4 remaster. I loved every minute of it. I also own it on PC but time has not been on my side to play it again. This game is a treat. Visually it is absolutely stunning, a feast for your eyes. The scenery, the particle effects, character animation, all of which come together to make for an immersive experience.  The voice acting is very nice and believable as is the story. Gameplay wise the controls are tight and the options on how you want to approach everything is there for your creativity. Usually I get pretty chapped at having things to hunt for in a game that do nothing but just give you something to hunt for but this Tomb Raider does it right. Everything you find you benefit from and makes scouring the land that much more enjoyable and worthwhile.This game is 110% worth your time and you would be doing yourself a disservice by passing it up."

Tomb Raider was the start of my life as a Gamer and as such has a special and sentimental place in my heart.  When I heard that Square Enix had their hands on the title I worried that they would take away some of the key aspects of the games that I enjoyed, making it more RPG than Adventure.On the contrary, I'm pleasantly surprised.  Pleasantly being an understatement as I have to admit out of all the Tomb Raider games, this one has stolen its spot as my favorite.  While the storyline originally took me 24 hours to complete (typical TR timeframe) the added content bonus of achievements and collectables has added hours upon hours of gametime for me in this game.  I haven't given the multiplayer a try yet, but its definitely on my to-do list.All in all this game has restored my optimism in the Tomb Raider franchise and I am greatly looking forward to its sequel!Great game!

My faith in the Tomb Raider franchise is restored and I am looking forward to the future adventures of Ms. Croft.The game eases you gently into environment and teaches you how to move, interact, and perform combat on a fairly gentle slope.  As you learn, you also earn a form of currency to spend to upgrade your gear and skill points to expand your growing bank of available tricks.As far as the story is concerned, like any action block-buster, you have to suspend your disbelief and just have fun with it.  There is an occult element mixed with the Indiana Jones-style tomb raiding (puzzle solving).  The voice acting is all very, very good to excellent and I think that I only winced lightly one time.All in all, a quality game that provides a quality experience - highly recommended."

The best thing from this game is seeing how Lara does what she can in order to survive. She starts as an innocent girl and around half way through the game is ends up as a bad ass. It's here own development during this adventure is what makes her seems so much stronger than other macho male video game characters you see in a lot of video games today. The gameplay isn't anything different from most shooters, but the story and seeing Lara grown through this journey makes the game worth playing."
7186,K!netic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/knetic/,1,,1,9.6,July,"6,",554,0,1,"tl;dr: well-made, very solid, pretty, and enjoyable game. But it doesn't do anything new. At all. Buy it if you want to kill 9 hours in a predictable setting, but don't expect it to break ground. Everything below this point is nitpicking, because it's not a bad game, and I'd probably buy it as a gift for someone.Look, i know we live in the UE3 era. I understand that it's easier than ever to make beautiful, tight, enjoyable games. I even know that a lot of gamers don't really want a new kind of game - but would rather jump into something familiar and enjoy their time. I get that. I can even appreciate how much ground this game covers, how many types of movement they had to build, the incredible depth to the environments and characters, and the sheer amount of area they had to craft - that's not easy, and it's impressive that they were able to do it all without a single piece of it feeling out of place or weird.But a big part of me was hoping that this wouldn't be just another third person shooting psuedo-platformer. The game is clearly divided into two types of gameplay. There are linear areas where you have to solve simple puzzles and then fight simple enemies, then climb simple platforms. In those areas, you don't have any choice whatsoever - the game will dutifully plod along as long as you don't die. It doesn't matter if you're quiet or loud, if you  want to go somewhere else or not, it's straightforward and asks nothing of you. The other type of area is a ""safe"" area, with tons of collectibles and jumping puzzles. The two ""modes"" of gameplay are jarring, and don't feel like they're part of the same game. Why can't i have the sweeping, open areas for more combat? Why is there only one level (shantytown) which remotely gives you freedom of movement in fights, but then does *nothing* with it? The enemies are clearly capable of moving around as nimbly as you (which pleasantly surprised me), but you never get the opportunity to engage them in that fashion, you're always either stuck in a corner, or stuck in a ""tube"", where you can only ever move forward or back, but never anywhere else.Worse, the platformer aspect is boneheaded. The angle and distance of your jumps essentially doesn't matter, because the game will spiderman-stick your character to the ledge you were aiming for. You'll never overshoot, and undershooting takes effort. This is a series which began as primarily a jumping puzzle, but now has devolved to the point of just pressing the jump button and waiting for your character to laboriously pull her tight body up the ledge. Great, we get to enjoy a really well-animated and beautiful character. After nine hours, that's old. Really old.Even more disappointingly, Lara's a little whiner. All of her dialogue consists of cry-shouting people's names, panting, huffing, and acknowledging objectives. I get that this is her first adventure, but she shows as much character as a middle-school girl in an anime. At the end she sprouts some stubs of personality and motivation, but it's literally in the ending credits. All the other characters try their hardest to be out-of-sight the whole time. I wanted to like them, but only one or two of them were ever helping me in a scene, and even then it felt scripted and cardboard. How can I care about generic secondary characters when none of them impact my game in the slightest?The characters might have been forgivable if there was anything interesting about them. Uncharted made a huge effort to inject humor (albeit sometimes lame humor) into the game, to give you something to connect with. Tomb Raider couldn't be bothered to include more than maybe three jokes, all by the same character, all of which are greeted by stern glances by his compatriots.I know that I'm only whining about this game not being GOTY-worthy. I know that what I'm asking for is a masterpiece, and I know it's not fair to be harping on this stuff as much as i have. I'm still recommending the game, after all. I think it's ""good"". But it feels disappointing that the makers came so far, worked so hard, and gave so much of their time to make a game which (with a few tweaks to story and a rearrangement of set pieces) would have broken its own formula and been memorable."

Extermely linear, with a laughable attempt at an ""open world"" concept. Yeah, you can fast travel back to previous areas to make an attempt at 100% completion... Whoopie! Compared to past Tomb raider titles the puzzle aspects were quite sub-par. That said, the puzzles that were there, were not obtrusive to the story, in that they did not require too much thought, and melded with the overall pacing of the game(movie), in that they did not overly delay the next cutscene. DItto for combat, which was simplistic yet satisfying. Though unfourtunately, both are riddled with quicktime events. These were about as well done as I've seen however, and were nearly ignoreable as a negative. The story was excellent and engaging with absolutely superb voice acting, and it had believable character motivations were cleverly fleshed out by ""hidden"" journal entries found throuought the game. Adding an actual story based incentive to finding them all. Somewhat pulling you into Lara's quest for knowledge.Overall a must buy at reduced pricing. An excellent playable film that will keep you well entertained for 12 hous or so driven on story alone. Well paced and well written, and the use of gamplay mechanics was well-done from a pacing perspective. If you're looking for a challenge this game is not for you. However, this is a game that knows what it is and excecuted it well. If you enjoy good story with a few shoot-em-up interludes this is a must buy.

It starts from Lara Croft when she's still a teen doing her 1st adventure and she found that doing a ""Tomb Raider"" is not always a fun things to do.The story and gameplay is linear, which mean you have to continue the journey to finish the game. But you can comeback to place you have been visited to get things that you haven't get.Aside from the story, the game itself is excellent (for me). From the graphics, gameplay, achievement, rewards, upgrading, and others.The hunting and craft is fun and easy. You just need 1 currency to upgrade the weapons, and exp to upgrade your skills.What I like is to find the hidden item (achievement) although sometimes I will need walkthrough (LoL).Don't expect this game will be fast past action like DMC, this game is more like splinter cell game in a more casual situation.Well, for the summary, this tomb raider version is definitely the best from other version/series. If you like action adventure game, then this game is worth your money."

It reads that the have tried  their very best to bring us an amazing tomb raider game. That they did.To summarise - this is the best tomb raider game I have ever played. Lara Croft has quite a few handy tools at her disposable that you can use to get around in the enviroment and to help you solve creative puzzles. Combat is quite fluid with every gun. Although I did feel like the shotgun was kind of under-powered. My favourite weapon was the bow hands down. Later in the game you manage to customise it to the point where you can even launch grenades at the tip of the arrow! A grenade bow!The stealth aspect was okay and fun. One thing I didn't like was how even where lara is making noise right behind the enemy she still wont be detected. You can literally run around, jump, heck take part in the olympics and she wont get caught. I hope in the next game they make the stealth aspect more realistic.Also I would have liked a bit more ""tomb raiding"". The current ones had simple puzzles to solve that weren't very challenging to me.The dual wielding pistols are absent in the game. That is what Lara croft has been recognised for. But you do get a tease for this at the end which suggests that in the next game it might be a feature.Amazing soundtrack. Brilliant dialogue. Talented voice actors. Just great all around.The story was very engaging and mysterious. It did a great job of luring you in and really guessing what force is behing the strange phenomenoms going on the island. The game developers did a great job at nailing this one. At no point whatsover was I bored. Every character that was in the game was very interesting and the voice acting added to that even more.I have an AMD FX4130 with a RADEON HD 7870.Not the best of systems but I managed to play this game on Ultra settings and getting between 40-50 FPS. This game has been greatly optimised for the PC.The tecture quality is amazing and I suggest you don't play this game on anything lower than Ultra. This is where the game really shines.The TressFX feature for a more realistic hair quality is a nice touch. But I noticed that it taxed my PC quite a bit so I had to turn it off. If you're system can handle then go for it.9/10"

This combination makes for an emotional roller coaster where your awareness and empathy for Lara is heightened like no game I've played recently. Likewise the acting and dialog is exceptional and the pacing is spot on. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes story based action games.

I won't spoil anything here but I felt the game started with a good mystery and didn't quite deliver the revelations I was expecting. Still, it turned out a good origin story for Lara I thought.Quick note: I played the game using an Xbox controller so bear that in mind when reading the below.Control mechanics are smooth and intuitive, and if you don't mind Quick Time Events you'll be hard pressed to fault the game on that score(there's not that many!). Both combat and acrobatics feel fair and precise, and I especially liked Lara's use of cover - you'll automatically duck behind scenery if there are enemies around so no more sticking to the wrong side of a wall, as I constantly do in other games.At time of writing it's £3.74 on Steam so there's no excuse not to add this to your collection.

But to put it simply this is a gem of a game thus far.  It surely isn't perfect, the games opening is extremely choppy and derivative.  But by the time you experience the first major twist it is in rare form.  I have only a thematic issue with its game play representation of character progression.  I think that gun play comes to quick into the game play paradigm, that stealth should be a default much longer to establish the vulnerability of our character.  Its hard to reconcile her as a human when she can take on 10 experience killers in one go.  Still that issue asside(and it only stands out because of the quality of the game) I already find it to be one of the best action/adventure games since uncharted 3."

Actually, there's not much gameplay in it. It's like interactive movie - you just have to hold finger on the arrow to move on. Literally, there are many moments when Lara moves are automatic, she loses ability to run, jump or perform certain actions in many locations. Crouching is entirely automated process, as well as drawing weapon (one of the most exciting part of classic Tomb Raider games) - you always know when there's enemy nearby as well when the fight is over.Emotions included in game are way too pretentious, almost embarassing. You just can't keep any immersion when listening to her artificial mood swings.The only good part of this title is it's graphics and artworks.

The gameplay and the upgrading of weapons plus all of the exploring of the very nice set pieces made this game a very very fun playthrough.

Other than that the game is pretty good with lots of stuff to do and a beautiful island to explore. Story is mediocre but what makes the game stand out is the action mechanics and the way Lara interacts with everything in the world. The survival element is strong at the beginning but after half an hour worth of killing baddies you seem pretty indestructible and able to take anything that dares to cross your path. That is quite inconsistent with the weak and vulnerable potrait they tried to give to Lara. Despite its inconsistencies the game handles amazingly and is a lot of fun. Would definitetly recommend to any action/adventure fun and to all others a buy on a sale.

The graphics, animation, controls, movement, personality, upgrade system, environment, it's all just absolutely amazing. I love this game, and I think I'm going to play it again pretty soon! It's a little on the short side, and that's my only complaint. Even with exploring all the side tombs and collecting all (or most) of the goodies on the map, it still seemed a little short. The production values and overall gameplay experience made up for it. It's also a bit more corridor-like than I might have preferred, but the Tomb Raider series isn't known for being open world.I would say if you can pick this game up for around $25 or less, it's a good deal. It took me about 15-20 hours to beat, but it's good enough for another playthrough. I can't comment on the multiplayer because I'm totally not interested in PvP and that's all the multiplayer is.

7292,Ghrasee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ghrasee/,1,,1,46.1,June,"24,",97,2,1,"After waiting to play this game for some time, I realised it was totally worth it. It's really rare to find an amazing game, with beautiful graphics and a FEMALE protagonist, who has not been over-sexualised and is just completely independent - she only needed to be saved a couple of times; with most games, the females are portrayed to be the weak characters who always needs saving by a strong, powerful male, it seems to be the other way with Tomb Raider, which is probably what intrigued me so much, thus encouraging me to buy the game.The storyline is also beautifully structured and well crafted; the strong friendship between Lara and Sam is really effective and just adds so much more depth to Lara, she does everything possible to save her best friend, Sam, even if it means putting her own life at risk. Even though that's not the same for all her other friends, the emotional bond between her and Sam just shows that there's so much more to Lara than a 'Tomb Raider'.I really hope the character of Lara Croft stays the same throughout the next Tomb Raider, it'd be really disappointing to see Lara's character change to appease the teenage boys who have been complaining about Lara not being as 'sexy' as she supposedly was before the reboot, even though the rebooted Lara is one of the most beautiful game characters I know of thus far...I'm usually not a fan of reboots, but this one totally changed that, and to know that some people won't play this game because of this reason really upsets me, because it is just an eminently beautiful game.However, there were a few glitches I found when playing; the game would sometimes freeze and I'd have to close without saving, which led to me having to re-do a some chapters/levels. The game would sometimes become unresponsive when jumping, but was solved when I died and tried again. Having the graphics on ultimate may have contributed to these glitches, but it did run pretty smoothly on ultimate, so I highly suggest you use ultimate graphic settings if you have a computer that can handle it."

BUT that doesn't take aways that this is one of the most fun games I ever played. Another thing wich is rilly impoant is that you don't have to expect the old TomRaider series.

It is definitely the best Tomb Raider ever. I am definitely glad I chose it, but I don't think it would've been worth $60, but I rarely pay that for any game (Steam sales, Humble Bundles, Amazon digital sales) so it would be unfair to hold that against it too much.It had enough upgradability for the weapons and skills, pretty cool QTE (Quick Time Events), and a nice mix of puzzles, adventure, cover shooting, and story. Pretty good stealth too (definitely better than Assassin's Creed, which thinks it is a stealth game).GRAPHICS ARE BOSS. Like totally unexpectedly amazing. Ran on ultimate and then kicked the shadows up one more (shouldn't ultimate be *everything* maxed out?) and played it on a 30 inch 1600p Yamakasi monitor. STUNNING.I play almost everything except strategy games and MMOs (and FPS, but I don't play those) with my PS4 controller. I use DS4Tool and the XBox One Driver from Major Nelson's page. Everything works great, even the touchpad, you just have to know the 4-button layout for MS controller, but what respectable gamer doesn't know both PS4 and XBox controllers.

I had my reasons, but the biggest contributor was the media shock at a supposed rape scene in the game's story. The controversial scene in question can be found on youtube, and articles date from immediately after an E3 Trailer for the game. Square Enix's studio head at the time clarified the scene on the Tomb Raider website following the blowout of misinformation mentioning how the point of the scene was to show how the protaganist was cornered and the only option left was to take another human's life. This is a major point of character development. This is a scene in which no clothing is removed, no sexual gestures are made, and every single event failure sequence ends in instant death (Did I mention the entire sequence is a Quick Time Event?). In short, I put this game away entirely because of the reports on that scene from E3 and didn't even bother to do more research into it until now. Once again, I have my reasons, but I regret not picking the Tomb Raider reboot up sooner.The gameplay was about on par with your run of the mill third person shooter. Playing with a gamepad I found no real issues or complaints as far as controls are concerned. I did however run into problems with the game's excessive number of Quick Time Events. It's almost as if Tomb Raider had some kind of run at beating Resident Evil 4 for the record in ""How many Quick Time Events can we squeeze in?""But they were small inconviences at best on an otherwise thrilling few hours ride. The story might start off a little slow and you know what Lara Croft will be by the end, but the journey of how she matures into that woman and the trials that she goes through to get there kept me going from start to finish with only a break for lunch in the middle. The side-stories of the diaries of those stranded on the island before Lara even pulled me into looking for collectibles.TL:DRI've never been a fan of Tomb Raider games. I put playing the revamp after the media controversy. I regret it.I'm a fan now."

The uses the same mix of third person cover shooting and dynamic climbing sections that have defined the Uncharted series.The next though to cross my mind was how much more enjoyable this game was compared to the Uncharted series.  The gunplay feels a lot tighter (this may have something to do with M+KB being VASTLY SUPERIOR to analog sticks for aiming) and the big set pieces feel much more elaborate.  The game also drops a traditional level structure in favor of having a quasi-open-world setting.  Many areas and secrets can't be accessed until a particular piece of equipment is aquired, and this gives the game a bit of a Metrovania feel.The visuals are stunning, and the game does a good job of providing locations with a variety of visual themes.  The camera work is particulary good, especially when the game wants to give you a sense of claustrophobia.

7347,ReedRothchild,https://steamcommunity.com/id/reedrothchild/,1,,1,11.3,May,"31,",892,0,1,"There are some incredibly gruesome ways to die in Tomb Raider. Lara Croft is the character players control, and even when she survives something, it tends to leave a grievous wound. In the first half hour her abdomen is pierced by a huge metal pipe. It's literally poking out both sides of her stomach. Games play fast and loose with injuries. Most action game stars get shot about 100 times during the course of an adventure. But generally when some horrible injury occurs in a cutscene, it's treated as serious. Not in Tomb Raider. Once she pulls that pipe out of her (dirty,) she holds her side like she just finished a 5k, then onto business as usual. But business is good. Tomb Raider is like Metroid. Explore a little bit, get a new piece of equipment, now explore previously unaccessible areas. There are enemies to fight, and they're pretty fun to kill. Platforming is typical Xbox 360 era garbage. Follow the one path and don't ♥♥♥♥ up the psuedo quick time events. It all works though. Tomb Raider is like the new Batman games, but the fighting isn't as satisfying. Though, Lara Croft can smoke wild boars and seagulls with an assault rifle and that's not something Batman's known to do."

Although it deviates from the original structure of the TR series, focusing more on the graphic style and storyline rather than gameplay, the game is not at all worse than its predecessors.The best point of Tomb Raider definitely is its visual style. The game takes place on a supposedly uninhabitated island in the middle of the Dragon's triangle, an area located east off the coast of japan. Lara Croft and her group of explorers set out to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai, an ancient tribe, who ruled a major part of Japan somewhere during 300 BC and 300 AD, but end up being stranded. Haunted by unpredicable storms, which seem to arrive the moment someone wants to leave, the island becomes a prison for the research crew who have to now find a way to survive and escape. There is a bigger and darker secret though surrounding the Dragon's triangle that Lara has to face. The beautiful scenery, ancient, Japanese-style ruins and dark World War 2 bunkers give this game an eerie but captivating atmosphere, different and original for these series.The game is definitely something worth playing, if not for the actual gameplay, then for the visual effects. There are some issues involving abbandoning the original game structure, making it more action and fighting oriented, but in my opinion this change makes the game even more interesting and altogether worth checking out."
7349,Arakanga.Ra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/arakangara/,1,,1,19.7,June,"3,",977,0,1,"I have mixed feelings about this game. On one hand, it has a decent story, good soundtrack (though not really memorable) and it provides an interesting take on Lara Croft's beginnings. Gameplay-wise, I can't complain. Although some interactive cutscenes nearly drove me crazy (especially the one with the wolf, there was a bug and I couldn't pass it without adjusting my settings), the game has a lot to offer. For me, the best parts are about climbing and exploring. Combat, on the other hand, is sometimes frustrating because to proceed, you need to kill every single enemy - and the stealth element doesn't always work as it should. Often you find yourself frantically jumping around instead of disposing of your enemies from shadows by a well-thought strategy. There are also two story-related problems - first, Lara's actions contrast with what she's supposed to feel. In one moment she is terrified that she killed a person - the next, she shoots every living thing that gets in her path. Second, other characters are boring, dull, stupid and can't do anything but get into trouble, get killed or cheer for Lara when she rescues them. ""You're a Croft"", duh. Suddenly, everyone thinks that being Croft means to be a superhero or something.What I dislike most about this game is something on which many people will disagree with me - this is a good game, but a poor Tomb Raider. This reboot destroyed or destroyed many great things from the Core Design franchise, from interesting characters to tomb raiding - because in this TOMB RAIDER, tombs are optional. Lara's character, past (AGAIN!) and motivations also changed. Many people argue that this Lara is young and therefore can be out of character - except we have seen Lara Croft even younger than this, in TR: The Last Revelation and TR: Chronicles, and her character was way more consistent. Although many people like this change, I simply can't relate to the character anymore.Don't get me wrong, I still recommend this game, especially if you never actually liked the original Tomb Raider games. The story is decent enough, there is a good replay value because there are many places to explore and artefacts to find, the climing is fun, level design is well-done and some scenes are just wonderful to look at.

I have played most of the older Tomb Raiders, and most of the time I got so tired with jumping from place to place and then falling and having to start the whole damn jump puzzle over again. This game isn't like that. There are jump puzzles, and they do make you start over if you fall, but for some reason I almost never fell. The combat in this game is fun as well. The enemies react to being hit in different spots, IE head shots normaly kill unarmored enemies, but shooting them in the leg slows them down giving you a chance to finsh them off. The story is great as well, its fun and engaging. They did a great job with the action scenes as well. Over all I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this game."

Even so, it's one of the nicest looking games I've played in a while and it was good fun too.The downsides for me are that it's sometimes a bit gory without the need for it. Do I need to see Lara graphically shot in the face, or fatally impaled, if I don't press the right key in time? That'll be  ""No"" then. Also there's a bug in the game for me. I have completed all areas to 100% and the 'All Challenges' completed achievement hasn't unlocked.In all, highly recommended, especially if you can pick up the ""Game Of The Year"" edition as I did for a fiver on Steam!"

Unfortunately with the most recent release/pre-boot Tomb Raider the game series was transformed into more action third-person shooter than anything else. Granted, with the success of Mass Effect I have no doubt that third-person action shooter puts the game in a more profitable position in the marketplace. I understand that it's a good place to make money but hardly does the Tomb Raider franchise justice. The gameplay seemed to mimic the feeling of Farcry 3, but without its charms. The killer for me was the constant interruption of cut-scene button smashing sequences, they became so constant and so annoying that the game was literally unplayable. The lack of puzzles did not help and aided in making the game an almost mindless FPS. There are some nice additions, such as the optional diary entries and so on. This game had a few nice things going for it, but the gameplay is so annoying, so fragmented, and disjointed that I think I lasted maybe an hour before I was screaming at my computer ""I'M DONE SPAMMING MY ""E"" KEY!"" This game was literally this most agitating thing I've played since Trespasser in the 90's. If I wanted to button mash, I'd play Metal Slug or Mario Party not Tomb Raider. Some people seem to like it, like I said it is not without its niceties, but also know that if you are expecting a Tomb Raider style game, perhaps you should look elsewhere."
7368,DeltaVector,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zmalqp451451/,1,1,1,28.1,May,"1,",235,2,1,"This game has its ups and downs. After playing some of the earlier Tomb Raider games i was excited to go on this new adventure, has it delivered?The opening draws you in, the intense gritty twist of the drama definitely was a plus, however how it looks is just one out of the other parts required to make good game. I felt compelled to aim for 100% with the collectibles and optional challenges etc. Only do this if you really want the satisfaction in the full completion of the game, since otherwise you'll be looking for mushrooms, eggs and other infuriating hard to find collectibles, taking immersion right out of the game.Another point to add would be the new style of skill points and upgradable weapons, not sure if this new system of gameplay works for me however it's good to be open to try out new ideas to give a twist to the traditional style of Lara Croft games. The quicktime events are very demotivational, instead of a big PRESS THIS message to help you, in small writing you will find out what key you need to press and by this time your neck will have been broken by a wolf :/ .1 final point to make is i found a sort of problem mashing e in the final cutscene, which i found fixed by lowering the resolution (no idea why this fixed it but it seems to be the general solution to this problem). Would i recommend this game? Yes, the action packed themes are great, just don't bother with the collectible challenges since these feel unrelated to the epic story and are soul destroying at times."

Not many female protagonists are great or do the gender justice, but this one stands out in nailing it down perfectly. People first complained about how she cried and moan about every little scratch she got, but it was essential to have all that in the beginning because in terms of a strong female character she was far from being that yet. The story, especially the supernatual parts, and her voice acting coupled with her facial animations and female walk/run/climbing/etc animations felt natural and...well, female.In terms of graphics this game was mediocre.

You may even occasionally attempt moving around during cutscenes as I did, or neglecting to move thinking you're still in the middle of one. There were only two or three hiccups to this.Initially, for whatever reason, the TressFX quality setting for the hair was a bit buggy. Cutscenes in particular, as well as some regular gameplay, would see Lara's ponytail develop a mind of its own as it started flailing about without the presence of wind. This eventually went away, and I didn't have issues with it again.The mechanics of the game are exceptionally easy to get used to and enjoyable. Storyline was greatly interesting, and the inclusion of random historical artifacts ranging anywhere from early A.D. to World War II era added that much more.Plus, the unexpected deaths you suffer when you make a mistake are almost a source of enjoyment, as well as a bit of an ""Ooh, that had to hurt,"" moment.I'd highly recommend this, and not just to anyone that has played Tomb Raider in the past.

Lara gets the #$^% beat out of her the entire way which makes her as a character and the world more believable and shows you she is more human than super human.

The textures and especially the character models look incredible. Everything from the expression on their faces to their body language is impecible. The gameplay is smooth and easy to get the hang of, yet it doesn't get boring or overly repititive. You can't barge into a group of enemies and expect to win as Lara is not bulletproof. Stealth is handled really well, along with full on firefights. The combat presents challenge as you are intended to use cover, timing, and the destructible environment to your advantage. There are quite a few quicktime events throughout the story but they don't get annoying or drawn out, and the action involved in them is intense. The story is fantastic. Immediately the game draws you in to the plot and the characters involved. The voice work is some of the best I've seen in a game. As for Lara herself, what a great take on the character. They've rebuilt her from the ground up and given her more personality then I've ever seen. She's vulnerable but determined. She has episodes of self doubt but soldiers on like a champ. I wasn't expecting this kind of game. Not at all. I've played the first Tomb Raider games and let them fall by the wayside somewhere around the 4th. What a great entry into the next generation of Lara. Square Enix and Eidos have truly outdone themselves here.If you like 3rd person action adventure and are considering this game, just go for it.

Its a beutifulf game also if your pc can run at max settings and even if it can't then is still nice.The only real thing that might put some people off in this straight forward story is that she goes from a mild manner person to stone cold killer in a cutscene or two. I just see it as she got put in the standard fight or flight scenerio and she came to the conclusion vary quickly if she dosn't kill them they will kill her.  I ran into a few bugs but none of them were reacurring or anthing. I fell out of the map once and fell through a ledge i was jumping for but only happened those two times.

For those that enjoy the old robotic controls and light storyline, this is not the Tomb Raider you're looking for.

The game focuses less on exploration than it's predecessors but makes up for it with an excellent story and smooth gameplay.  It manages to potray Laura Croft as a real person rather than a gamers fantasy of a female Indiana Jones.  It's on sale now for $4.99 which is a great bargain for a game of this caliber."

Lara comes alive in a way that she hasn't in a while.  Watching her develop her skills and confidence over the course of the story is captivating.  Gone is the highly confident, super-heroine of games past.  We now have the opportunity to see Lara grow into that woman, but with vulnerabilty that we have rarely seen.  Gameplay is great, visuals are stunning, and there is a nice balance of platforming and combat."
7427,Shred,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995293815/,1,,1,38.3,March,"29,",177,0,1,"In an era where shooters and 'Open world' games are becoming increasing popular Far Cry 3 took the gaming community by storm -and I still highly recommend it. If you liked Far Cry 3, you're going to love this reboot of Tomb Raider. While there appears to quite a few things to do in the world, they never seem to be out of your way to do them -and most importantly they don't feel like chores.Visually on highest settings this game is absolutely breathtaking -it's everything you'd expect asthetically from a AAA title. It's setting is immersive and refreshing, it lacks that linear sense of moving from area to area. The levels just seem to flow.Animations and the subtle nuances of Lara's movements during cutscenes and particularly during real-time control are some of the best I've ever seen. This includes simple things like the way she looks around in a new area, taken by awe at the view or even how she places her hand along a wall as she walks next to it. Even her hair looks quite convincing as it moves in the wind and to her own movements.Gameplay seems to flow cinematically even when in sections which feature no quicktime events or contextual stick wiggling (for you controller users). The music swells in all the right places and gives you a sense of anticipation as well as effectively colouring the mood when you step into ancient ruins. Combat feels solid and rewarding. Kills feel empowering and deaths are brutal.As far as voice acting and story goes Lara seems to shine out from the other characters -but not to a degree which breaks the atmosphere. You scramble to cover when you see enemies ahead and overhear them exchanging dialogue -while this dialogue seems to lack the typical tongue in cheek of most NPC exchanges, this would be out of place for Tomb Raider as it has a fairly serious feel.You really do feel like Indiana Jones in the temple of doom. The game seems to have struck a perfect balance between giving you adrenaline fuelled moments and leading you through a mysterious new tombs of discovery.I'm only about 4 hours in at this stage but it's one of the few games where after the first launch I didn't want to stop playing. Because completeing objectives in this game are a joy more than a chore, I can see this being one of the few games I can bother getting 100% completed.Being a 3rd person shooter it handles well with a controller and seems to feel quite natural -I havn't used keyboard and mouse so I don't know how those controls handle, but everything I've experienced so far leads me to believe it is an excellent portfor the PC.Tomb Raider is a standard setter for triple A titles and spells exciting things for big budget games to come. It certainly won't disappoint."
7428,Rumble,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rumble_mando/,1,,1,30.6,March,"28,",499,2,1,"Great game. In my opinion Lara suffers a tiny bit too much, making her appear more like a frightened little girl than the strong, badass, hot as f*ck young woman we all loved for the past 15 years. She falls, gets shot, bleeds, screams, moans, and trembles her way through the jungle, really making the player get attached to her. The graphics are awesome, and even though i'd have liked a bigger variety of weapons rather than all of these upgrades, i must say that the combats are really really fun. Luckily, there's not too much climbing to do (something i hate in most action games), focussing more on Lara's mental and physical struggle with the island. I was so happy I could get ahold of this game during a midweek madness for six bucks! I recommend it to pretty much anyone who likes survival feeling, third person shooters and open worlds. and to feminists. I definitely recomment it to feminists :Dgraphics 9/10gameplay 8/10 story 6/10"

Although it lacks any kind of puzzle challenge and has no real replay value, I'm just glad to see Tomb Raider cater to a mature audience at last and shake away the bitter failure that was Underworld."
7433,JediKnightSky,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102761464/,1,,1,33.0,March,"20,",356,0,1,"This game was just too much fun to play through. I cant help but still be thinking about my adventure on the island even a day later. Oddly enough Lara Croft has always been a unique female character that I as a guy have still always been able to embrace the role of when playing. Not many other female lead characters in games are that interesting to put yourself into the shoes of as you play them.I have a strong fondness for this franchise from the old days and the first TR from my childhood. So I wondered how the relaunch of the franchise would feel, and it took a holiday sale last xmas to push me past my indecision, that and Angry Joe's energized review of the game.Being able to experience Lara's first adventure, to see how her eyes are opened to the world of violence and mysticism is something adventure gamers will not want to miss.The actual game play mechanics are well done, and despite what others say I found myself far more comfortable using mouse and key board then controller. Granted I have a gaming mouse and took advantage of its extra buttons to refine my controls abit more then a typical basic mouse user.I do admit some frustration with the QTE's that litter the game, I was forced to for some at times put my graphics on low to muddle through them after a few seemingly endless cycles of failure no matter how hard Id try, then bam low graphics made it all work. Granted my machines card is like just above bare min specs so I guess that is to be expected to some extent.Frankly even if you didnt enjoy the old ones, found them a constant fight with camera angles and controls, dont let that keep you from this one, Lara has some kind of built in AI one might say to help auto correct in little ways to help feel more natural and organic in her movements.And the stuff she goes through on this island, she may be young, she may be innocent, but she is not lacking in ability, I am guess she is her great grandfather was Lord of Greystoke John Clayton and her nanny must of been a great ape to be up to the challenges she is put through in this game. The final ascent in the last part of the game would leave most grown men weeping in terror, yet she leaps and claws her way up the walls and through the battles as if nothing on earth can slow her down nor make her hesitate."

The story, character progression, skill upgrades, weapon customization/upgrade system, graphics, the environmental and the lighting effects as well as a huge world with countless hours of action, adventure and exploration!!!  Everything about the Tomb Raider reboot, is absolutely incredible!!  It is basically the equivalent of an Indiana Jones movie, with a female protagonist (aka. Lara Croft)!!  It is a must own for anyone!  From the opening sequence to the first time that Lara Croft has to kill for survival, and from the tombs that Lara has to explore and the adversity that Lara must overcome by surviving the attacks against insane cultist inhabitants, the wild animals as well as an environment that could be considered more harsh and fatal than that of the Bermuda Triangle.
