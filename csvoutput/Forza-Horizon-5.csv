The sad truth is, that I do not really see the point buying this when you have and played with Forza Horizon 4. The game is exactly the same, but it has a lot of improvements and a new map, and basically that's it. The problem is, that I already spent 100+ hours in the predecessor game, and this one just got boring. Worst part is that I bought the Premium Edition (although it only cost me 62,99€ instead of 99,99€) and never touched it since October 19, yikes. Maybe at some point in my life I'll play it again, but not now.In my honest opinion, only buy this game if you did not played FH4 to death, otherwise you will end up in the same shoes as I am."

20,some1pl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/some1pl/,214,10,1,220.1,December,"30,",390,14,1,"It's basically Forza Horizon 4.5.The map is new, the graphics are slightly better, most cars are carried over from previous games in the series, and gameplay modes are almost exactly the same as in Horizon 4. There are some quality of life improvements in the UI, some new multiplayer-centric activities, but overall it plays the same as the previous game. That itself is not a bad thing, as obviously the devs stick to the tried-and-tested formula that works. But this time it feels like they played it too safe. Who knows, maybe the DLC will introduce more new content and changes, while the devs focus until now was to get the base game done ready for the November release slot. To sum up:- If you haven't played Horizon 4, buy that one on sale instead of 5. It looks almost as good, it's sold at a good discount, it has more content and less bugs, and the online community is still active. -  if you liked Horizon 4 or you want to run with the cool kids and play the newest game, then I can recommend Horizon 5. - if you didn't like previous Horizon games, there's nothing new here that will change your mind."

27,-ˏˋ marruu ˎˊ-,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vehrimon/,86,1,1,273.1,January,20,257,0,1,"Complicated game to review. For context, I used to play Underground 2, Most Wanted 2005, Burnout 3, Burnout Paradise, Midnight Club 3, and a little bit of Pro Street, Test Drive, Blur and some rally games.At its core, FH5 has a good sandbox. There is a wide variety of cars ranging from supercars, tuners, muscle cars, offroad vehicles, and pretty much everything in between. The customization is good too - you can modify tiny little details about each car or download other people's creations and use those if you want to skip to proven results without much effort.The world available has almost every location type you could want in a racing game, however one key thing is missing - a metropolis area, or some sort of street/city scene. There's a very small town and the streets are way too narrow for high-speed racing, so that particular flavor of racing is frankly completely missing in this game. Otherwise the game offers plenty to enjoy, and because of a wide variety of different cars, tuning options, and adjustable difficulty settings, you can effectively move the slider between casual racing and simulation to lean towards one or the other.Then there's the online mode, which is a big let-down because of several core issues. The game has a very muted social aspect, lacking things to do together, and limiting player to player interaction. First of all, there's a lack of central hubs in the game, you mainly only find people at the starting area, with nothing interesting nearby. Because of that, people just drive around a bit and leave, you don't form groups to go do other things.You only see players who are near you, if you get distance between yourself and another player, they disappear from your map, you can easily lose a friend you could have made, and overall you never know if a place you're driving to has 10 other players there or absolutely none. This was never an issue in other games, you could see where everyone is, and most players would go to places where they saw other people.Other players are ghosts by default, you can't interact with them and you don't feel like you are sharing the same space with them. This has been very jarring. I can see other players around me, but it still feels like playing alone. I've never experienced that in other games, and it's just really sad. I have fond memories of hanging out with other players in Burnout, doing stunts together, racing, playing cops and robbers, crashing into players, I often stayed in the same servers with the same people for hours on end.In FH5 you don't feel any kind of server unity, you feel completely disconnected. Even if you find a convoy with other players (which then disables the ghost mode for people within the convoy), it still doesn't feel the same, because ghosts by default means everyone in the playerbase has a different mentality, almost like they have no idea what to do.You can honk at someone and drive off hoping they'd follow, and they're not going to, because they're used to everyone being a ghost they can ignore. This is in contrast to other games where a honk-and-run leads to people following you 99% of the time, and it felt like a secret code, if you honk at someone you've made a new friend.Lastly, in many other games like this, you'd have a wide variety of challenges to complete, which directed players towards certain areas, got them together and gave them things to do. FH5 doesn't have that. Horizon Arcade exists, but you need to wait in a small circle 5-15 minutes, which nobody is going to do. You could vote-start stuff like this in Burnout Paradise, they did it better over a decade ago.So all in all, this game is complicated to review. If you just want to kick back and listen to music while exploring a beautiful world with fast cars, FH5 does scratch that itch, and there's plenty of story content to keep you busy. But if you're looking for a fun and varied multiplayer component - you're going to be disappointed, because you won't find that here.I'm giving it a thumbs up regardless because even though it's not what I was looking for, it's definitely not a bad game and I have enjoyed my time with it."

36,AdamHemi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AdamHemi426/,573,30,0,"1,547.1",February,"2,",57,35,1,"This game is great. It has over 500 cars, a massive world to explore, endless possibilities of car builds that add fun to the gameplay itself, and a lot more that you should explore for yourself. So why the negative review?1. Post-launch updates and support is horrible and sometimes straight-up negligent. I'm primarily focused on the online open racing and here's a list of problems that I've encountered: - Broken Headlights: The developers have changed all online street races to night-time only, but the headlights are broken so the game constantly looks pitch-black. - Cheating. Cheaters who race online are not banned. Glitched times have taken over the top of every rivals leader boards and they're not getting banned or have their records taken off. If you raced a track in a blueprint event, your time has a chance to get posted onto the leader board as well. Yet if you made a livery with the North Korean leader on it you'll get a 800-yr ban or smth.- Horrendous track designs: this in my opinion is what turned most players away from offroad races. Have fun when you made a 3000-ft blind jump only to find a 3-ft wide checkpoint right next to you after that, OR ramps placed perfectly to flip your car/truck over. - Connection Issues: I use ethernet but still constantly got disconnected from online lobbies that I've already locked in. The game was flat-out unplayable online at launch but the developers managed to fix most of em. Long wait time still happens occasionally which could take up to 10 minutes from my experience. 2. Contents-Many cars were missing from fh4, which the developers claimed to be from licensing issues but some fh4 cars are still available thru seasonal rewards or forzathon shops but not in AUTOSHOW? wth?-Cars in general are more powerful in their respective classes comparing to the previous horizon: an A800 car in fh5 handles like ~S1/850 cars in fh4, which makes higher classes harder to handle, especially on S1 and S2 dirt and off-road races, where super cars or even formula drift cars with off-road tires more competitive than actual off-road cars/trucks.- Speaking of cars, meta cars are more dominant in this game than in fh4. Take a look at different leaderboards and the top is always dominated by them. While you can still make your own tunes and compete with them online, this issue is worse than the previous horizon, as in fh5 cars like Bone Shaker require little to no skill to be driven fast and competitive.>>So that's been said, is the game still worth buying?<<Yes! Personally I think the singleplayer contents are amazing. The expeditions and showcase events are well-designed and exciting to play. The story mode is fun and helps you get familiar with the driving mechanics too. Even if you're not into racing games or cars in general, this game could still be an amazing experience for the driving, exploration, and customization. Besides the car packs, which come with the premium edition, all the cars in the game can be bought in autoshow with in-game credits or acquired thru seasonal challenges. Kudos to PGG for making a game with virtually no micro transactions.At the very least, the game's graphics on ultra and extreme are just eye-candy and it's surprisingly well optimized on low-end hardware as well. You can get smooth 60fps with medium graphics on a GTX1660 and it still looks better than a lot of other racing games out there. As a matter of fact someone posted this test on YouTube where you can actually run this game without any graphic cards to begin with.>>So why the downvote?<<As of now, there are just too many gameplay-affecting issues that the developers need to address in future updates. As someone who mainly spends time in online lobbies, the experiences I've had with these issues are just not pleasant. Right now the series desperately need some competition in the same category: sim-cade racers, to show how PGG should handle post-launch supports properly.Until all the issues have been not only addressed but also fixed, I'll keep this down vote. Thx for reading."
37,Lunaboops,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaboops/,267,14,0,385.6,August,"11,",592,18,1,"I feel a bit mixed about this game, I'll pretense it by saying that I love this game, its fun and feels great to play - and was my introduction to the Forza series... However, something always felt off, and now that i've played some of the prior games, I feel like I know what it is. (I'll be comparing it to the previous title mostly as its the only one you can still buy on steam - idk for how much longer though)Graphics - One of the first things you'll notice is the graphics, they are impressive - if you have a machine capable of running it at max settings... Theres been no care into the lower visual settings, and that shows greatly on my system, I have a 1000 series GPU, Forza Horizon 4 looks GORGEOUS on it, and runs extremely well on the max settings, the cars & weather look stunning & every season is distinctly different in terms of colour balance. Whereas in this game, anything lower than High looks like a game fresh out the Xbox 360 era with just more polygons. Cars look almost like stickers on the screen, and weather effects look awful & can be really distracting while you're trying not to be wrecked by the AI.Forza Horizon 5 on Medium Quality... Looks worse than Forza Horizon 4 on Medium Quality (and runs a lot worse), and I dont believe there is an excuse for thatStory - if you could even call it that is uninteresting, completely uninspired & an absolute pain to get through. The dialogue is not entertaining at all, and often times just feels depressing to sit through. I dont even know how they managed to screw up the welsh drifty boi's dialogue, but it just wasn't as memorable as his appearance in FH4. Theres a distinct lack of interesting stories to do, and it feels like a very missed opportunity to showcase the unique environment of Mexico & its culture around cars. The Vocho story is a great example of what they couldve done, but instead that is the only story that focuses on Mexican car culture. FH4 has lots of memorable characters, each story felt distinct & THE BUSINESSES, OH MY GOD THE BUSINESSES - those are fun. This game does NOT have businesses, which were where a fair bit of my FH4 fun came from, an odd choice - and thats kinda what describes a lot of this games decisions... Odd.Car Selection - Great, but theres yet another odd choice in how its handled. Both Fiat/Abarth & Alfa Romeo are still missing even though it has been almost a year since the game has released, and despite massive amounts of asking from the community. Theres a distinct lack of unique American cars, brands like Saturn or Scion (both defunct im aware) are missing, theres a serious lack of saloons or other Consumer ""i can get this"" cars, Theres only 2 Cadillacs, 3 Pontiacs, 1 Oldsmobile (its a cool one, but still), and very few cars that would actually be common in Mexico... BUT there are ~60 Fords & ~50 Porsches, so it seems like they had their priorities straight when trying to add cars to this game :/. They also seriously like to add cars from previous Forza games & pass them off as ""new additions"" - I dont mind there being cars from previous games, but stop trying to gaslight us on the Forza Monthly streams into thinking they are new to the series. - We want cars we haven't driven before, not ones we've driven hundreds of times. And REALLY like adding supercars or sports cars, which I understand the appeal - but seriously I want my sleeper cars back, makes more sense to have them especially with an apparently ""better"" street scene in this game. Theres also a severe lack of appearance customisations, most cars have 1 spoiler option, and 90% have no options for bodykits, or really anything that most people would want to change. Its not too big a deal, but it'd be nice to have some more customisation options.Online & Bugs - OH BOY I have a lot to say about this. Theres been a day one bug, that continues to wreak havoc on our convoy sessions, that has recieved no fix or even acknowledgement by the devs. & that is the random freezing that happens occasionally when you rewind. In single player, this isnt much of an issue. However in multiplayer, especially if it happens when you accidentally hit rewind, it can seriously kill the mood of everyone in the convoy, and make even the most passive person ragequit. Fix the damn bug already. The online experience is awful, you cant join your friends convoy ingame anymore like you could in FH4, you now have to use the ""Xbox Game Bar"" otherwise you cant play with your friends, its once again an odd choice considering they already had the framework to join other's games in FH4. Its also a massive middle finger to anyone who runs this on linux through proton, since they can no longer join their friends games as its now OS locked.The biggest annoyance personally has been something that they absolutely refuse to fix, and thats the lack of balance between the cars. If you've ever driven the boneshaker (or most of the cars added by the Hot Wheels DLC now) you'll be aware of how absurdly overpowered they are, if you encounter a Boneshaker in A Class open, you will not be fighting for 1st place, you'll be fighting for 2nd because the boneshaker has finished the race 20 seconds before anyone else did. I want to love this game more, but the lack of care the developers have to actually rescore the cars to match what their actual performance is, its genuinely awful. Its worse knowing that these cars have been known to be broken since day 1, and there has been literally nothing done by the devs to actually fix them. So you'll always encounter them in Open or Tour.I want to say this game is good, I really do, I love playing it, and I love being in the game racing. But I feel like this game could be a LOT better with next to no effort from the development team. They could fix the unbalanced cars and instantly make the game 100x more fun to play online. They could remove cheated leaderboard scores & make getting the highest score mean something. They could actually add unique cars to the region, or listen to their damn community, but they won't. This feels like a ""safe profit"" game. A game manhandled by some execs into losing its soul just so it could be an easy game to profit from. It feels corporate, its not the same horizon you had as a child/teen on your xbox 360, and its not the same game as the previous title. Its a soulless husk of a game within a series that was at one point the greatest open world racing experience. I'm still going to play it, its one of the only open-world racing games & I dont exactly have a choice to fill that niche. I want this game to be the best it can be, but it really feels like i've joined just as the ship was going down. Good Graphics wont save a game with an awful experience, and this has been a champion of awful experiences lately."

Nothing beats the feeling of taking your favorite car, wrapping it in a cool livery, and going ham on the roads. So why am I not recommending it? Well, there are a few reasons, and it all has to do with how the devs are running the show. The devs will ban you for dumb reasons like making livery that's somewhat political in nature perhaps, but then they don't ban the clear cheaters on the leaderboards. There are speedzone records that are legitimately impossible without glitching the game, and yet, the devs seem less interested in going after those guys. There are bugs that cause physics rubberbanding, bugs that cause visibility issues, but the devs would rather release multiple patches to make it harder and harder to obtain super wheelspins. They straight up removed the super wheelspin masteries from several cars, because they were too cheap to obtain. The harder level AI is absurd and does not obey the same physics which bind the players, they will rubberband up to the the player if behind, but you as a player can almost never catch up to AI ahead of you. There's a running joke that you have to ram the AI off the road, or else you can't actually win. The rewards for a lot of the weekly seasonal challenges are garbage, like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ horns and crappy clothing items. Speaking of clothing, there are a ton of them littering the wheelspins, and you're probably more likely to get a pair of socks than a car. The game would rather license yet another Italian exotic, than license actual interesting D, C, and B range cars. There's a glaring lack of European cars, and yet we have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of Ferarri cars, and yet somehow we don't have the Testarossa. Where are brands like Alfa, Fiat, and Lancia?And I haven't even scratched the surface of the issues. Point is, if it's on sale, or you really enjoy driving and just wanna have fun, it might be a good deal for you, but I just can't recommend it."

There is no AI, there is no intelligence. Non-human cars do not obey the same physic as you do. They follow the racing line at a preset speed (which depends on the difficulty setting), as if they were on rails, no matter what car they're in.Only once you are very close to them does physic start to influence them, at which point they completely forget how to drive and usually brake, even if in a straigh road.So, your only chance to win (at higher difficulty level) is to take the lead very early, usually in the first few corners, by dive-bombing and ramming. Failing that, once the lead car get a couple of seconds in front of you (you always start a race mid-pack, so you're always at a disadvantage), you can forget about catching up. Just restart the race and ram harder...Oh, and obviously they cheat, they accelerate much faster than you, and in the off chance you get a significant lead, they rubberband back to you at insane speeds.Of course, you can lower the difficulty, at which point the game becomes a walk in the park. Not fun either.It is such a shame, because Forza Horizon 5 is a fun car game, but a terrible racing game...Edit : And to add insult to injury, the game is full of bugs (some small, some progression-breaking, all annoying), some of them having existed for months, and the devs don't seem to give a flying **** about it..."

50,The Shuttle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheShuttle/,61,3,1,298.1,February,21,205,0,1,"My first expectations of the game were based largely on the previous game in the series, not anyone but the iconic Forza Horizon 4. Unlike most people, I was expecting exactly a game that was quite similar to the previous one with very slight improvements, and it lived up to those slight expectations. My first impressions when I got into the game were kind of mixed. I certainly saw the improved graphics and I really liked how much fresher the game itself was based in Mexico. FH4, which was based in England, was quite ""colder""I'm pretty happy with the gameplay itself. Whether I want to play singleplayer or multiplayer I know I can have fun playing either mode. I want to pay more attention to the multiplayer, however. I spent quite a few hours in it and had quite a few good moments, but like everything else there were some downsides. I've run into hackers in a few sessions, but I've seen people complain about their far more frequent occurrence. I've personally seen hackers quite rarely, but it's not like they don't exist. I've also seen quite a few modded max level accounts and so on, which is pretty ugly and unprofessional for a game of this level.That aside the multiplayer is a wonderful place with room for everyone. Want pure races of various kinds? There's Horizon Open for you. Prefer to drift? There is a special place where all drifting competitions are organized. Or maybe you fell in love with the battle royale modе that was added in FH4? Well, it's here too, so I guess there's something for everyone to enjoy. The game currently has 97 achievements. You can do quite a few of them by going through the game's story, as well as through the Hot Wheels DLC. The ones you won't get by going through the singleplayer are pretty fun and show different details of the game that you might not notice unless you're focused on getting those exact achievements, but I really think it's worth the try to be completed.Aside from the intro to the game, you'll be able to alter your difficulty settings at any time in Forza Horizon 5. It pretty much depends on you. You can either make the game very easy for you or very hard. I suggest starting with the lower difficulties and gradually working your way up. I know you'll see yourself taking more money as you raise the difficulty, but you'll make a lot of money anyway just by playing and forget about watching your credits. Ignore them and you won't know when you have so much money that you don't know how you can even spend.The graphics are very beautiful. So beautiful that they make you feel warm inside while looking at them. And that big open world that you can roam around and explore... The graphics are so good that a lot of players like to just set up cruises with each others, drive slowly and enjoy. What can I say about Photo mode... I'll let the pictures speak for me.The Soundtrack of Forza Horizon 5 features over 100 songs available through six radio stations, each with a different genre and host. However i prefer to listen to my playlists on Spotify but some people prefer the in-game music and it ok so i don't mind it. I had no problems at all.Game tested on:The game isn't that new anymore and it gets discounted often, so I think it's best to wait for a discount and when you see it get it right away. The game is truly unique and worth your time."

Along the way you learn about the powers of friendship and ""family"" through cringeworthy dialogue that includes stories about Papa Fernandos V O C H O, and you being a superstar (even though you haven't won a race yet and you drive like you're under the influence of something because you've managed to hit every single tree in Mexico). After nearly winning several high octane races, some of which are illegal street races with heavily modified Japanese cars covered in big booba anime waifus, or highly destructive offroad races in big pickup trucks that make you feel less British and more 'Merican (Yee haw, pickups and 4x4's go BRRRRRR) you are rewarded with an endless supply of random Lamborghinis and Ferraris like you've just been visited by MrBeast himself. You are also forced to abandon the use of Mexican Pesos, and embrace the Horizon Festivals cryptocurrency of Credits and Forzathon Points that can only be spent on more cars, modifications for the cars, and tacky clothing for yourself.Eventually, after you've devoted several months to this never ending festival you begin to lose your mind as you realize all hope of returning to the UK to see your wife and children is gone as the hosts of the Horizon Festival are keeping you in Mexico against your will to race for the rest of your life to keep the value of credits and forzathon points blockchain up in the green. You then come face to face with the mastermind of the event himself, Papa Fernando, and his V O C H O in a 1v1 winner take all race for your freedom along the mountainside. In an Initial D F&F Tokyo Drift fashion you and Papa Fernando race to the finish with you winning it by a second. As you leave everything fades to white and you wake up realizing it was all a dream, and you're still in the UK fresh from having conquered the Horizon Festival from FH4.

Not because the AI is good, but because those lazy developers made it so enemy cars don't answer phisics. Change of road type? You drift like mad as they go on rails.High jump? you could bottom out and lose lots of speed while the AI simply lands softly without losing speed.Found a good trajectory? Sorry enemy AI slams you from behind!They could have just taken the top pilots, used their times and telemetry to actually make good AI. This is PURE LAZYNESS from the devs, who could have made us face the best of the best pilots of this game, and get amazed by perfect tunings and trajectories, forcing us to sweat to improve to their level.Instead they made the AI cheat its way to victory, forcing you to either slam into them to break their speed or find other cheesy exploits.This is why, until they fix the AI, i will keep a negative review. Fix the AI and it's a most-reccomended game.""Can you win at pro/unbeatable?""Yes, you can. Not impossible BUT. You will end up smashing into cars to slow them and slam into corners to keep as much momentum as phisically (im)possible. For a racing game it's tatamount to need to cheese the game to out-cheese the AI. It's not something one expects from such a AAA game studio.And of course, if you ever let the lead car go beyond 100 metres, it will completely ignore obstacles, so the small branches slowling you down or somewater will have zero effect on a too far away car, meaning you get the penalty of obeying in-game phisics as the AI ignores it completely.Update: it's useless to write ""lol u bad"". If you never saw the AI cars glued on the ground for what would have been a 100 meters jump, you are literally blind. Kudos on playing a game about cars while blind tho. That takes skill."
58,Shallie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShallieElminus/,106,5,1,"1,304.2",December,"12,",249,9,1,"Ok, so while I said that this is my review, its more of a comparison to FH4 and my experiences with it.Anyway, here we go~So, at the time of me writing this, the game's been out for a week over a month (since I have the premium edition) and I've sank 300h into this. Not that I didn't expect I would since I loved FH4 so much. Overall, the game feels like an improvement compared to FH4 in almost every way. The map is much larger and has a lot more variety compared to the map of Horizon UK. The overall feel of the game, looking the past the connection and stability issues, has been a lovely experience and I am definitely going to play the game till the end of its lifespan. The UI feels a lot cleaner and has less unnecessary elements to it, though I feel they missed out on a few things I'd love to have had that were in FH4. I find it harder to join friends compared to FH4, where it would show a friends name over a icon in the main page of the pause menu. Looking at players you follow for customization is more troublesome (and tuner ranks and such dont seem to work right now) since you gotta be in the festival for it, whereas in FH4 you could look at them anywhere. I also do tend to prefer the old cars tab of FH4, where it had smaller icons for your cars, thus being able to fit more in one screen, although I don't hate this new one at all. On the other hand though, I do like the new car collection thing where you get rewards for having collected cars and are able to quickly buy them through the collection. My issue with it, though, is that it nor the horizon promo do not show the base PI values for each car at the very least, (which makes things troubling if you're like me and end up tuning most if not all of your cars and when you need to have something for some championship, you can't just look at base PI values somewhere to get a better idea for what to build on but honestly, its fine, I can live without it). I do feel like Horizon Super 7 is misplaced. Poor thing is hidden in the creative hub where nobody will look for it (which is a shame cuz it was such a great fun idea to add on to FH4).The soundtrack is... While I think there's a ton of great tracks, I don't think its as good as the one that FH4 had but thats purely my opinion of it and Its not really that big a deal.Gameplay feel has improved. I don't know if its just me but while the physics may be a little wacky, cars seem to feel a good bit more responsive (even a bit too responsive at times... looking at you, Sesto FE, but hey, its an arcade racer lol).For example, they've managed to make RWD and FWD drivetrains a lot better. They do not feel super inferior to AWD anymore in my opinion.Its a little easier to find yourself alone in eliminator than it is in FH4 due to the size of the map which is understandable but its generally a very good time all the same.Horizon tours is one of my favourite things to be added into the game as they allow you to basically play Trials (with reduced difficulty) continuously with different car types and races. My only real issue with is that it currently needs more variety. The cards themselves are great but there should really be more than 1 set of races for each of them. Even with 3 different sets of races would be great for each card because it ends up being kinda boring that while you do still end up having fun driving S1 cross country with anything goes, its always the same 3 races. Speaking of which, freeroam rush (horrible gamemode) has been integrated into the tour which, while I hated it as a racetype in FH4 (bc its so luck based), I'm loving it with the tour. Its real fun to drive from one race to the next one. Perhaps they could make it so that in the future, ignoring big races like goliath and such, each card is just randomized (starts from a random race, then just looks whats the closes next one of the same type up close and has you drive to that one and goes on till you've done 3 races for the tour). Race design overall feels great imo. The way most of the races are designed feels fun. We no longer have dirt races where only 7% of the race is dirt! Hooray! The cross country and dirt races especially are some of the most fun races in the game, with the ones up the volcano being some of my favourites. PR stunts feel pretty good, although I find some of the drift zones a little... eh, compared to the ones in FH4, which is a shame bc a lot of my time in FH4 was spent on drift zones but there's lot to love here. They're all good fun. I love the addition of accolades and trailblazers (finally) to FH5. Those were some of the peak stuff from FH4's DLCs that I felt shoulda been a part of the game in the first place. Accolades give you a ton of stuff to chase for in the game. Even if you dont much care for the accolade score, I personally find it very satisfying to see those accolade completed things pop up on the screen (not to mention that a lot of them have great names, I love that!)Festival playlist, while being generally more or less the same, offering much of the same things as it previously did, now has a new progress system, counting points instead of percentage for progress and showing you how much each activity nets you progress. On top of that though, there's new stuff like the treasure hunts (no million credit drops like in fortune island though... C'mon PG, you can afford to give players more than just like 50k for that... even 100k would go a long way), the horizon open challenges and the eliminator challenges, which are a welcome addition, not to mention that there'll be player created eventlabs stuff starting from S3, which is gonna be exciting as well as showcase remixes and featured story chapters in the future seemingly.Events lab is awesome! The addition of Events lab gives course-creating and building up custom races a tons of new options. The addition of props is pretty much expected, but the budget for the lab seems pretty crazy from my own experiences with it. You can add like a fences and stuff and still be nowhere near the limit. Not to mention that beyond the props, there are the race rules that you can mess with to make effects for the race or even completely new rules as we've seen in the festival playlist a few times already. Its really exciting what can be done about it but my one complaint about is that you can't edit a track once its been finished once. Huge bummer if you end up testdriving the track and find out that you forgot something or that you placed something wrong.  Customization has its ups and downs. The loss of Rocket Bunny has left a good few cars without the bodykits that were so memorable on prior titles (RIP RCF and that WANG lol), but on the other hand, there's a bunch of new bodykits to love, like the KRC and TPC ones for the '92 RX-7. Outside of bodykits and such, basically all of the cars that were ported over from FH4 had their PI values adjusted and the PI system seems to work differently in some ways in general. The addition of more tire compound choices is especially something I am very grateful as it allows for a whole lot more customization (Driving hypercars in S1 is dummy fun, especially cross country!). In terms of livery customization though, while the livery customizer has certainly improved from FH4, I can't reaaaally forgive that they hyped up the new editor to be similar to like photoshop and such only for it to nab some basic elements from editors of the kind, though it is understandable to some effect.The carlist as of right now has plenty of great cars. basically most of the interesting ones from FH4 (Where's I.D. R tho?) and a whole lot more interesting ones coming. I for one am real excited to drive that XJ220S TWR. I ended up hitting the maximum limit for a review. Had a lot more to say but guess not lol. Too bad.Anyway, great game! love it!"

What's it about? What kind of game is it?Point is, these reviews are completely interchangeable. I bet if you took this exact review, and copy and pasted it to every game in your library, you'd get the top review for half of the games you put it on, even if you didn't change the check marks to fit each individual game.In my opinion, the Steam community should stop encouraging this format and instead downvote them all into oblivion. Maybe it's just me, and I guess it's not THAT big a deal, but for someone that puts at least some effort into the reviews they write, it is a little disheartening that the steam community prefers lazy checklists that ultimately don't say anything specific about the games in question. Plus I don't see how they could ever actually influence someone's decision to purchase a game or not when so little information is given.Anyone agree or am I the only one that wants to read legitimately helpful reviews for games I might be interested in?original review:why you WONT buy this game1. AI is cheating. unreasonably fast. huge different between ""highly skilled"" and ""above average""2. Connection problem. Connection suddenly broken in the middle of the event. Also, sometime it shows ""unable to join the session"".3. Narrow wheel controller angle. only have 180degree (if ur take it serious, go buy other sim)why you BUY this game1. Graphic is great,  (but more hungry than FH4)2. Tune car, comparing other cars sim,racing game, not much game can do the paint job and swap part for car.3. Good community? multiplayer, this remind me ""need for speed world"", you can roam and randomly race with sb on the map. chillhonestly, review is very subjective. why not try it and refund it (or keep it)? I suggest to watch some gameplay on youtube but not just review, nomatter what game ur consideringoverall 90/100.just ignore it🙂"
60,Rocket,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960693901/,608,20,0,181.1,November,"14,",514,52,1,"I really hate to check the ""do not recommend"" box but at this point I kind of need to.First... you should know that this game is a huge improvement over FH4 in just about every way. Graphics are gorgeous. Terrain and race tracks are much more varied and characterful. They seem to have fixed the issues with convoys and multiplayer queues crashing (we used to average around one race every hour trying to play competitive in a convoy). Tons of stuff to do for everybody whether that be drifting, road racing, or just roaming around and exploring. So many positive things it's hard to overstate how impressed I am.The reason I have to vote ""no"" right now is the most important aspect of any racing game... the racing. Right now the game is making such an attempt to be new-user friendly that what you actually do in a race really has no real impact. It doesn't matter if you carefully upgrade a track weapon, lovingly tune it, and then drive like a zen master. You will do exactly as well as someone who takes a car without upgrades and just barrels around the track wildly, crashing into every wall and corner. The AI will also ""smooth"" their performance to how well you are doing. Did you bring a 260 mph top speed missile? Every AI driver will be able to do 265, even in tiny little cars with a quarter of your horsepower that are designed to be nimble instead of fast. Did you bring a darty little car and plan to earn places in the corners? Every AI will take that same corner flat out, even when in massive muscle cars that should struggle to complete gentle corners.When every car feels roughly the same, when your level of effort and knowledge in building them don't matter, and when how you drive them has no real impact in how you place, then what's the point?I'm really hoping this is an initial bug to be worked out. If the situation improves, I will JOYFULLY recommend this game. But until that happens, be aware that a twelve year old picking up the controller for the very first time will be actively competitive against someone with 1000+ hours of racing experience under their belt. May as well just watch gameplay videos at that point."

63,ShelLuser,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shelluser/,96,2,1,32.0,November,"12,",554,3,1,"Sorry for what is going to become a lengthy review. But I intend to review the game and my experiences vs. just spouting of my opinions about it. For the impatient amongst us: this is  one of the best racing games in my Steam library. Not perfect, but oh so darn close!I haven't seen any better start to a game than this...  you're  dropped into the game and by doing so you'll also get a solid first impression of the general racing types it provides: from street / circuit races on tarmac (""asphalt"") right down to rally racing and let's not forget the rough offroad challenges either!But first, for those unfamiliar with the series: what's Forza Horizons? Forza is Microsoft's flagship game when it comes racing. Forza is to Microsoft what 'Gran Turismo' is to Sony.  though is an open world with a more casual approach to the racing genre. It has simulation options for tweaking your cars, and there's plenty here to make your racing life seriously challenging. But at the same time the overal focus of the game is on an ""arcadish"" gameplay where fun and excitement go absolutely first. And boy, oh boy did they deliver on that!Horizons then is  an in-game racing festival where the organization went completely overboard by boldly reserving a  chunk of land to host all their festivities in. 24/7. Going by storyline there are cameras and radio relays everywhere which makes it possible for the general public to basically follow every driver they're interested in. Of course that's storyline; it basically boils down to you, being a driver, becoming part of the racing event of a lifetime. And it'll be up to you to decide how you're going to experience all this.The general idea is simple: explore the massive landscape and go find the races and challenges which mostly appeal to you. Win, earn credits and get better. This game has it all... from street races (with or without traffic!) to challenging offroad races where you'll have to fight both your opponents for your place in the field as well as the elements to keep your car on the road. And more... don't be alarmed if you drive across the road minding your own business when suddenly... <flash>, you've been snapped! No, don't worry about a speeding ticket, instead worry about not passing this section of road fast enough for you to qualify ;) Or... just don't bother of course if you don't want to. The choice is always yours to make.Now, in order to race you're going to need some cars. And Horizons provides! oh dear... First you'll get a car for every racing type that's available, but that's only the beginning. As you progress into the game you'll unlock other cars as well. You can go ""car hunting"": trying to find a barn where a car wreckage is hidden (which, fortunately for you, your mechanic can fix up!) or... you can try your luck with the wheelspin: a chance game where you can win grand prizes, such as ... new cars.And then there's the car shop where you can buy new or used cars. And don't forget about the car auctions either! This is a  cool feature IMO because it allows you to sell your car(s) to the highest bidder. Or... try to place a bid on a car yourself while hoping that no-one outbids you.Once you have a collection you can always change into a different car every time you want.Houses then are landmarks where you can ""relax"" and sort things out with the events and your character (like customizing your character with new stuff). While they definitely look nice you can't really interact with them, so don't expect to get access to garages or garage boxes which might showcase some of your cars. At best you can consider these houses points for fast travel and to get full access to the game customization options. And... they're also rewards which will grant you a perk, depending on which house you got and have set as your home.Besides, sleep is for the weak, there are races and events to be done! :PWhen you're in freeroam cruising around you'll come across other players. Don't worry; they're sillouettes at best so you don't have to worry about running into them. Of course... you're always free to challenge someone to a race to see who's best ;)  Events then provide you with races to do and it'll be fully up to you how you want to approach them... either you go solo and take on the AI drivers, or you can (sometimes) hop into co-op or pvp mode where you'll work together or against other players. The game has it all!What I personally enjoyed the most about the Horizon series (I also played 4) is that you can fully decide on your difficulty settings. And gradually make things harder on yourself. By doing so you'll also get some extra difficulty bonusses when you win some of your races. For example, right now I don't play with a line that always marks the best place on the road (I only use these in corners to indicate braking points) and I've also set my damage to simulation vs. cosmetic only.But as is common for this game: you're  in full control!  Did you slam into an obstacle and now your car is almost totalled? No problem! You can just hit rewind, take the race back to a point before your crash and then try to avoid it. Or... you could also consider just dealing with it to see where it leads you to. Your race, your choices.No, this game isn't perfect, there are plenty of issues going from small to big that still need to be resolved, but I have full confidence that it's being worked on. There's also the issue that not everyone will be directly affected. I've read stories about people suffering from the game crashing on them while I haven't had any issues with that at all. So... your milage may vary, as the saying goes.But honestly?  This game truly comes close,  close to perfection and one way or the other can definitely be considered a masterpiece of its own. If you enjoy cars, if you enjoy driving and ""experiencing"" cars then I really think you're going to have the time of your life here. It doesn't only have to be about races and fast driving you know... what about taking a beetle (Volkswagon Beetle) out for a relaxing drive around the countryside where you simply admire the massive landscape of Mexico stretching out before you?Of course... it's also perfectly possible to grab a Ferrari, Lamborghini or maybe a McLaren or whatever other sportscar you fancy and just start burning some rubber. Or maybe you're more into getting a huge four wheel drive and go cross country straight through swamps or dense jungle terrain? Or maybe a desert is more to your liking while you're imagining to be in the Paris - Dakar rally?One way or the other I cannot help but be convinced that you're going to be blown away by the atmosphere of this game, just like I was. I  recommend getting this game. Unfortunately I cannot give it the two thumbs up it deserves because... then I fear crashing into something!  Don't review & drive kids! ;)Thank for reading!"

Recommended but waiting for a hotfix.Pro:- Seems like a worthy addition to the Forza Horizon series- Very interesting map with different terrain- Similar to FH4 with some improvements and additions(- as a Rally/Offroad fan the map design is quite enjoyable)Con: (-nectivity)While i didnt experience any major crashes myself, the Online Mode heavily suffers from Connectivity issues. Just roaming around the map with a friend online is almost impossible in the games current state. Doing races together worked for us without any problems, but exploring the map in a convoy ended in disconnection every few minutes. Other players cars just disappear into oblivion for a good minute or so, which obviously is a problem :D"
69,Boris,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199003021368/,269,10,0,189.0,January,"6,",42,0,1,"FH5 is a really great game. But I can't recommend it, because for me it's horizon 4 with a new map.I think the game mostly improved in the areas where it was already good, and became only worse in it's weak spots.So at this moment I believe that it makes more sense to buy horizon 4 with discount.Pros:Basically all the pros of horizon 4, so I keep it short.+ Graphics is great.+ Car sounds are good. Soundtrack is okay.+ Plenty of cars.+ Flexible tuning.+ Large map.Cons:- No feeling of progression at all. Game just throws at you the best cars in first 20 hours of gameplay. You can open almost everything from a wheelspins without do a single race. In a race game.- AI. Maybe it was the same in Horizon 4, but in this game it looks so fake. Many times I have a situation when I overtake all the drivatars, and they just form a train and ride like this (one after another on exactly the same line) till the finish. So they don't even try to imitate the real race and competition. And yes, they don't care about the game physics. If race has a jumps or water in it, drivatars have a huge advantage, because the terrain doesn't affect their cars.- ""YoU'rE a SuPeRsTaR!!!111"". It is way too much this time. All these radio announcements sound so unnatural, you are praised for absolutely everything. They don't reward, they just cause facepalms.- Stories are mostly meaningless and dialogs are weird. In one of the stories there is a phrase like ""Why people don't like sandstorms?! They're so fun!"". I mean there should be a line somewhere in being so optimistic and positive, right? Horizon has so great potential for a proper singleplayer campaign, but it's just a waste of time now.- Constant interruptions. New adventure! New wheelspin! New level after a race! Dancing before the race (WHY?)! Dancing after a race (WHY?)!- I can't say much about the online, because it constantly disconnects me, I was able to complete only a few races. And I still can't find an option to find a race in a specific class. It's so frustrating. Why I can't choose a race type and a car class so I can drive my favourite car in online race?"

Forza Horizon 5 in my opinion has been the best Forza game to date. Now the gameplay is still Forza at the end of the day however Playground games make up for this with the amount of effort that they have put into this installment of Forza. Seriously though all new reworked car sounds that sound almost 1:1 to their real-life counterparts, a whole bunch of unique cars which are still getting added and probably won't stop getting added till the end of the game's life and the graphics are a nice step up from the last game. The new landscape is quite alright, better than the UK but not as good as Horizon 3 or 2 in my opinion. Overall a really fun racer to play alone or with friends."
83,Okdef,https://steamcommunity.com/id/okdef/,54,,0,194.7,November,"13,",289,6,1,"TLDR AI cheats as bad as the crew or NFS. Don't bother, just buy an older horizon game. Forza horizon 5 excels in areas previous titles lacked and fails in areas the franchise had previously mastered. Car customization, map scale and track design are all excellent. The problem comes from the AI. As someone who played most previous titles forza 1 - horizon 3 on the top difficulty settings I expected the typical AI design but was instead met with the rubber banding of a typical ubisoft racing game release. The mechanics directly punish you for doing better as the AI gets shorter lap times whenever you do. This is further worsened by the fact that each race regardless of track size is flooded with AI racers that follow the exact on rails driving line. The AI brakes, turns and accelerates so similarly that every race feels like you are competing against a bullet train. You will NEVER beat an AI off the line since they have godmode acceleration for the first 5 seconds, and they will take corners at double the speed a player could realistically take. AI cars hit speeds normally unbachieveable at the class. To win a race, the strategy is to banzai bomb straight for the corner, and then aggressively block the AI for the remainder of the race. So long as you don't get too far ahead of them they wont gain rubber band acceleration and the AI all but shuts off."

85,GRIMM,https://steamcommunity.com/id/punishedtoplay/,128,5,1,406.6,November,"9,","9,737",11,1,"Forza Horizon is back, and bigger than ever. The folks who developed this game also managed to overhaul progression by quite a bit. IF you thought Forza Horizon 4 was a beast with all the different ways to progress, you have not seen anything yet. And the new modes they've thrown in are crazy fun. Can it be overwhelming getting started? Yes. Is it still fun? Absolutely. They managed to make things like the stories better and more engaging, by giving each discipline their own unique little story, and even giving more personality to your driver. The stories also are a good way to get accustomed to the different disciplines if you are a Forza Horizon newcomer, so definitely don't skip those early on.Weekly seasonal events are also still a thing, but they've tweaked them a bit. For example, you earn points instead of percentages. And you also now have car restrictions for seasonal PR stunts, which will make things a lot more interesting when completing them. For example, your PR stunt for a speed trap will not work by cheesing it with a 599 XX Evo anymore each season, and will now call for you to use a specified type of car. While some a small few may not like this, I'm sure others will enjoy it, as it will sort of give you more incentive to explore more types of cars. I personally grabbed the Premium Edition, and I think that is well worth it. But even if you grab only the standard or Deluxe, there is still a ton of content day 1 to get you started. However, if you look forward to the expansion packs, just grab the Premium now and get it over with. The savings are more than worth the extra $40 usd. On top of that, you get a boat load of extras besides the expansions, such some cool VIP perks, tons of extra cars, and more. And the cars are absolutely amazing this time around. I mean they've always been amazing, but I think they actually managed to make them look even better this time. And some nice tweaks too, such as improved tire smoke, improved engine audio, and even for a select few cars, functional convertibles. Sadly the convertible option is not for all actual convertibles, but it is there for some.  Mexico is the latest venue for Horizon, which has seen many other locations in the past.  Last outing we had a fictionalized tour of Great Britain, but while something felt oh so right, something also felt lacking. The Britain map was no doubt fun to drive around, but it was not that fun to actually look at. It sometimes had a dreary look to it Even at times the radio announcers would joke about this. Not compared at least to something like Forza Horizon 3, which was absolutely fun to look at. Bright, cheery, tropical, and just a blast to look at. But when playing 4, something seemed lacking in 3, 3 felt kind of, well, flat compared to 4. which was, well, a much more fun to drive around map. Lots of elevation. I don't know if that makes sense, so let me sum that up. 3 was amazing to look at. 4 was fun to drive on. Well, 5 manages to to get the best of both, and go bigger than both at the same time. The map is roughly 1.5x bigger than Forza Horizon 4. There are tons of elevated spots. Like massively elevated. Hell, there's a freaking Volcano in the game! There's sand dunes to go off roading on near a massive sprawling beach. Desert areas full of cactus to smash through. Latin inspired villages and towns. Tons of tunnels to rip through. Jungles! Ancient temples to drive around. There's just so much, and it is all gorgeous to look at, and most importantly fun to drive around. Note: Now for those who grab the game today, keep in mind, the game is still early, and you will probably experience some bugs (even some crashes), as a lot early access testers have talked about, but the folks at PGG/T10 have acknowledged these issues and are working on a patch to drop either tonight or over the next couple of days. They've already fixed some things, such as server issues that were problematic early on. So at least they are not sitting on their rears doing nothing."

Hot Wheels expansion is amazing, lots of things to do and you ultimately have free roam from the get-go, giving you the freedom to do whatever you want without worrying about story progression. Community liveries can be really impressive and you may find yourself sinking hours customizing and tuning your cars. Many exclusives available for collectors, and you can even find custom-painted ones being auctioned by japanese artists.I'll occasionally get some visual artifacts when playing on my PC which was only fixed by restarting the game, but otherwise it runs pretty much flawlessly. On the low graphic settings, it's also able to run a stable 30-40 fps on my steam deck, though with the DLCs installed it takes a huge chunk of storage (>130GB)."

However. It's one of my favorite titles even then. Forza Horizon 5 is an overall great experience if you're like me, and don't get bored by just playing the game, even if at this number of hours, where progression feels like it no longer exists, it's a great buy for veteran gearheads and student drivers alike. Most of the engines sound great, the tuning and driving feel good and engaging, and unless you're someone who tunes at least 2 cars a day like myself, there's plenty of cars to choose from. The balancing leaves a bit to be desired, as there's always just a set and defined ""meta"" in these games. With all that said. I'd recommend it, but.. wait for a sale. The online community will probably make you want to slam your router in the trash then go cry in the car if you're new."

Not sure what exactly caused it to work.Man, there are a lot of comments and awards here. Thanks to everyone trying to be helpful. For those reading between the lines and understanding that I just want devs to be held to higher standards, you're all based epic kings.I am keeping this review negative because things like this shouldn't be ""known issues"" on launch day. Especially with a soft launch a week in advance. Once this issue is fixed and I deem the game good, I will change it. No one (read: no one) should be making drastic configuration changes to their system to play a game. It's a PC game this stuff comes with the territory, I get it.

Why is it that common apps are stopping this game from launching on certain PCs? That's my issue. It's not running. Yes, I see that there are fixes, but it's late on *full* launch night and I work in the morning. When did we become okay with this sentence being written on an OFFICIAL support page?""We would suggest disabling ... any overclocking, hardware monitoring, streaming, recording, and any nonessential apps while you play the game.""FIX YOUR GAME.

119,Bellatrix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThorsMaiden/,37,5,1,84.9,February,"7,",149,0,1,"Having been a PlayStation gamer for many years prior to branching out to PC gaming, the Forza games were never on my radar.  Forza Horizon 5 was my introduction to the Forza series.  I wasn't sure what to expect from it, but it looked like a fun open-world driving game, and I wanted to try it out.The graphics are stunning, Mexico looks absolutely beautiful.  The cars look great with excellent attention to detail.  There's a huge range of cars to earn (>500) by completing various races, events, stories, accolades etc.  Some are also RNG rewards that you can win through Wheelspins.  Car customisation via upgrades and tuning options are great to experiment with to find the right set-up for your favourite cars.  I absolutely *love* this feature personally, but for those who don't, there's also community creations that you can use instead.  You're also able to create your own liveries with endless possibilities.  I also love this feature, although my favourite cars are almost all sprayed purple with black wheels and tinted windows... I have a type, okay! :) As for the story, it was meh.  Not memorable, some very tedious moments with non-skippable cutscences.  However, it encourages to explore parts of the map you may not otherwise experience.  I generally opt for more simulator-type games, i.e. realistic driving.  This game definitely does not fall in to that category, it's leans more towards the arcade-y style... and that's fine!  After a hard day at work / college, it's stupidly fun to drive around like a lunatic destroying fences, drifting, super high speed, big jumps etc. all while earning points and combos to gain fast XP.  It's even more fun with friends!  The tracks are decent and offer lots of variety in racing styles from drifting to circuit to rally.  The EventLab feature allows players to create their own tracks.  This is great fun - people's creativity will never cease to amaze me.A lot of the negative reviews I've read mention issues with performance.  It's been fine for me, just one stuttering issue in ~38 hours of gameplay.  No crashes at all.  I didn't experience connection issues to friends / other players either.TL;DR - Great game if you're looking for a fun, open-world driving experience.  Lots of styles of racing and tonnes of cars to choose from.  Looks incredible.  Lots to do.  8/10 for the fun factor."

127,Aeronark,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeronark/,207,22,0,202.7,March,"3,",166,14,1,"tl;dr, it's a great game, fun, big open world to explore and full of things to do, lots and lots of cars to get, upgrade, customise. Unfortunately, the multiplayer is horrible, it feels like it wasn't made by people capable of rational though, and it's been made for 3 year-olds.- Multiplayer is absolutely horrible. It's nice having random people drive around in your world, but there is so little of them. Unless you're on the highway, near the volcano, or at the festival you won't be meeting many people. There is this awesome thing they advertised so much called ""Horizon arcade"" that consists of, get this, 3 WHOLE GAME MODES!! Those are, team king, survival, capture the flag... or crash opponents 1, crash opponents 2, crash opponents 3. You do this twice and you're fed up with it, and fed up with people leaving your team after round 1, so you're stuck going 2v6. Online racing is either: you have the OP car so you're racing in the front or you have the non-OP car so you're stuck getting rammed in the back. Including when all players are on the same team against AI. Still getting rammed by teammates.- Creating your own events. This was also advertised as a great amazing fun thing. It really isn't. There is no option to save what you made, so if you want to make something worth while you either sit down for 10 hours straight or just not do it. These events are constantly shoved in your face, at random. So there is this thing, Super 7, it's 7 random community challenges that you have to beat. I did this once, and never again. Every. Single. One of them was just hold gas, drive straight, and jump and then ""WOAH you actually beat the distance you were supposed to jump, incredible job! Would you like to like this challenge???"". One would think that they would feature some actually worth while creations but nope.- Livery and designs. Oh boy, this is where the PG3 comes to play. Anything MILDLY sexual will get you banned. a sticker on the car that says CarHub that looks like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ logo? Yep ban. A sticker saying ""free VBucks""? Yep ban. An anime chick with giant breasts and barely any clothing? Nope, seems fine to me. Best thing about this is that they never tell you any of this stuff is banned, and even promote those liveries. When buying a car you get taken straight to a page with user created liveries to chose from. I bought the BMW Isetta, and the first recommended livery was the CarHub one. I used it for 1 day until a friend told me i can get banned for it, at which point i removed it. 5 months later i get banned for sexual content, which ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me over in the last day of a month long grind for an achievement. So i can redo it all again. Promoting bannable liveries and then banning people for using them, without telling them you can get banned for something like that. Hipocrisy at it's finest.- If the game is made for 3 year-olds why is the main reward mechanic a literal slot machine huh?- The games AI is some of the stupidest AI i've ever seen. At first i started at ""Above Average"" difficulty, and thought ""cool, the more i play the better i am, the higher i can make the difficulty, and the more rewards i get"", except, nope. The higher the difficulty, the more made up the stats of AI cars are. They accelerate from 0 to 100 in 0.2 seconds. They take a corner at 250km/h, they slow down from 250 to 40 in 0.2 seconds. It's so horrible. But to be fair it doesn't really matter, higher difficulty makes you get more money per race, but 99% of your money comes from the the aforementioned PG3 slot machines, so it's alright.- General bullshitting. They included lots of assists you can turn on in difficulty settings, Which is nice, if 3 year-olds actually play this game they have it easier. Except, they made the assists so damn strong, a blind person could play the game, literally. Most popular strat to playing the game? 50 laps of the longest race, place the controller in a way where it constantly accelerates, and go to bed. But the devs don't like this. Which makes me wonder why they implemented those assists in the first place, and why they haven't done anything about it for 5 months.- Information shown by the game is wrong in 99% of the time. ""This race can only be done in this class of cars"" so i click on allowed cars list, pick one, upgrade it, take it into the race, it doesn't allow me to take it. So i take some random car instead. Teammate next to me is using the car i wasn't allowed to use. Or, ""use SUV for this one thing"", took a car from the SUV list, did that thing, didn't count. Had to look up a guide and pick what car they were using in order to finish it. Basically if there is a challenge to do, just go to google, look it up, follow the steps one by one to avoid any stupid broken game design, and you might be able to complete the challenges.- The characters are the most annoying people i've ever seen in a game, unless you are the target audience, a 3 year old child.I already spent 100 euros on the game, and to be fair it's fun driving around your dream cars in the map. But is that worth spending so much money on? Looking back at it, no, it really isn't, especially with the way you get treated by Microsoft, but i should have known that."

They pretty much took FH4 and made it better in every way. Some parts feel more arcade, others more sim.. it's like they're trying to mix Horizon and Motorsport.If you think the vehicles understeer too much, set your steering to sim under difficulty settings. Even for dirt and cc races it feels alot better, not getting the same ""sim twitches"" as back in FH4."

There is just sooooooo much to it.                                   At heart Forza Horizon 5 is an open world racing game, with an added online component and a huge map, you can freely explore, which offers a ton of variety. No matter if you enjoy Street Racing, Off-Road or Drifting the most, there is an environment for you and a ton of events that go along with it. Beside all this I never touched a racing game that offered so many different vehicles and tuning opportunities. Thankfully there are pre-set configurations, also from the community, that you can use. But if you want to fine tune everything to the smallest detail by yourself, you can do that as well of course.                    The game looks absolutely stunning, definitely the most beautiful racing game I’ve played so far. So is the audio, the cars sound great, the music is good, there is a DJ in the radio has some good lines (which can also be turned off) Absolutely no complains there. So far I experienced some game crashes which happened randomly, so sadly no idea what causes them. But beside this Forza runs super smooth on high on my pretty old pc with constantly 60fps. They did a great job in the optimization from what I can tell.     The option menu is vast, there are countless options for audio, gameplay, difficult and graphics. You can fine tune the game to your machine. Forza 5 also has an own benchmark to check if you run into any issues. The game also offers a ton of accessibility options, which is really nice. It’s great to see that most newer games offer these now, so everyone can enjoy our lovely hobby to its fullest.      To make it short, Forza Horizon 5 is one of the best racing games on the market right now, and offers content for every kind of racing fan. The World is huge and offers a lot of variety, there are more cars than you can count and the sound design is fantastic. If you’re even remotely a fan of the racing game genre, you should absolutely give Forza Horizon 5 or you will miss out on a great experience."

I am someone who has played every single Forza game coming back from Forza Motorsport 3.Forza Horizon has just become a game only-for-kids, on one hand this is absolutely amazing - but on the other hand, the other Horizon games also tailored to kids in its own aspect. Have you ever went back and watched cartoons from your childhood? Do you ever notice how now that you're older, you understand some different jokes? Forza Horizon was kinda like that, it appealed to kids by being easy to pick up, fun to drive around with friends/AI, having their own jokes and it was one of the few games doing something .I would really like to recommend this game, but only due to its predecessors, if you get the chance to try out any other FH game, go for it. Forza Horizon 5 completely removed any idea of progression and throws you into the game as a ""superstar"" from the previous Forza Horizon game, which isn't too bad, but from the little time I have on this game(60 hours at the time of writing), I have over $25m and 500+ cars. I recently launched the game after about 2 weeks of not playing and I was given over 40 Super Wheelspins. They literally give you handouts for everything. I can guarantee you will never have to purchase a car from the Auction House or the Autoshow. I've completed the ""campaign"", all story missions and explored most of the map. The map is supposed to be ""massive and full of life"" but between the online reliability and lack of traffic even when it is there, most of the map is just boring. They have evenly spaced out cities, all with a single ""quirk"" about them and nothing else.The story is forced, lacking emotion and the devs are so out of touch on the cultures they're trying to re-create that it's actually insulting. I guess according to Playground, Mexico is literally only uncles building 70's VW Beetles, nothing else. Where's the focus on drag racing on the streets, meeting up with friends and baja'ing in the desert? Where's the tuned and riced out cabbies? This game has so much potential to be apart of one of the best racing game series ever.The only way I can recommend this game is if you purely want an open-world, fun-handling racing game where you don't have to grind (At all); but to me that isn't fun, the fun part of games like Need for Speed and Forza Horizon is actually going through the story, having to progress to unlock new parts or cars, and enjoy the immersion."

This is an utter joke now. What on earth happened to the team for Horizon 5? There has been so many changes and so many setbacks, that I'm actually starting to get annoyed and concerned.It's quite clear that there is absolutely zero consideration and engagement with the community. Most, if not all of these issues wouldn't be here otherwise. It was the biggest release for Microsoft so they have made their money. So why would PG care about the community and player retention with no micro-transactions to milk us with.I love Forza Horizon, I really do. But at this rate, I'm questioning on what's going to happen at the end of all this and I regret shelling out the money for the Premium Edition. Horizon 5 has been a mess, and I'm sad to see it go this way.- Cheating leaderboard times are still there.- Cheaters/hackers aren't punished.- Random mass player bans for ""offensive"" liveries whilst the cheaters have free reign over leaderboard times.- No ranked races because losing hurts my safe space. - Removal of wheelspins and super wheelspins from car mastery tree.- Super wheelspins now have 1, 2, and 5k ""rewards""...- Super wheel spin cash prizes are capped at 300k. - Unnecessary, tedious grind for all players and a big kick in the teeth for newer players to earn money. - Basic bug fixes from day 1 still aren't fixed. i.e. The game still stutters after any loading screen, or challenging a new player in The Eliminator. - Engine sounds cut out and stutter when navigating around any section of the vehicle upgrades. - All transparent surfaces are blacked out on the vehicle thumbnails. - Only two convertible cars actually have a convertible animation. - They removed online team, ranked and custom adventureAbsolutely pathetic."

Who cares just roll that free super wheel spin you got given and get 300k instantly. It completely undermines the experience. I have 100 hours on the game and I've spent 75% of it, sat in the garage, and randomly driving around, and I just don't seem to run out of money because of all the free ♥♥♥♥ lmao. Why bother racing.This game has lost a really big part of it in my opinion, I remember being on FH3 and I wanted the Veyron Supersport and I spent 6 damn hours grinding races to get it and it felt good to get it, and it was 6 hours well spent.

It takes nearly everything that worked about Horizon 4 and introduces a much larger, more varied, and overall better world to explore and some semblance of structure to its ""campaign"" progression. The racing is as good as it's ever been, the new Horizon Stories have some fun conceits, and the expeditions, while small in number and easily finished off in the opening hours of the game, do sometimes slow down in ways the game doesn't usually foster. It does carry over some UI issues from 4, however, and as of the time of writng, there are many issues regarding servers and performance.Still, this is an excellent game that I'm confident will keep me coming back for the next few years."
154,I can't believe I'm not butter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/squeakyneb/,257,34,0,4.3,July,"23,",739,21,1,"This game feels hollow and meaningless. There's no progression. You don't feel like you're achieving anything. You're not overcoming challenges. The game just feeds everything to you right from the start and only a few hours in I felt like I'd already seen it all. You know when you do a cheat code to unlock everything and turn on god mode, and it's cool for a little while but then you realise there's nothing left to do and it's actually not that fun? Forza Horizon 5 feels like that right from the start. You start with a tricked out Corvette and a sick rally car. About every thirty minutes the in game lottery will give you a new car and about half of them are also top class cars. Right from the start. There's six classes (D, C, B, A, S1, S2) and you START with S1 and A cars. The bottom three classes are basically meaningless unless you... want to do slow races, or something? There's no progression up from slow to fast, you just start at fast.Not that it matters! Almost all the races let you enter with any car and will pick matching opponents for you. There's no need to get faster cars to play the harder events and progress that way. No, you just show up in WHATEVER, and then just participating gets you 75% of the possible progression points (""accolade points"") that event has. Winning gets you the other 25%, which feels insignificant and is entirely unnecessary to actually progress, so why bother?The open map challenges are much the same. Three levels of difficulty to achieve - and you start equipped to very easily get two stars on all of them.The game becomes a very bland grind of driving around the map to do unchallenging and unsatisfying activities just to tick them off the list. It's so dull.It's a real shame, because it does look gorgeous and the car controls actually feel great, but that's not enough by itself. I'd rather go play NFS Heat, which is also gorgeous and plays great but ALSO has meaningful big-picture gameplay."

The driving is tight and responsive, not floating too far off either end of the sim-cade tightrope and striking an excellent balance with how the cars feel in weight and grip. (Most of) The tracks are engaging and a blast to rip through in a majority of cars and performance classes and the open world is varied enough in surface and style to always have somewhere else to go or a new style to try. The cars, even with so few actually new inclusions are still well detailed and the sound improvement over Horizon 4 is tenfold.Yet in good faith I cannot recommend this game to anyone, despite singing it's praises above.The core of the game while still indisputably Horizon is hollow and of little extra substance than Horizon 4. Campaign? Even more unengaging than the previous entry. Chocked full of style and cultural references without having any point or driving force, no escalation in car type or class and a story so forgettable it retroactively makes 4's look better by comparison. It's basically a sandbox and while everything is done well or at the least passably there's just no incentive to experience anything but what they railroad you in to with regards to the story.Online? Still absolutely plagued by the previous entry's problems, some even exacerbated throughout this entry.Load times have been made somehow even longer even on ssd, and chances are half your lobby is gone by the time the race actually loads. The convoy system constantly breaks and splits your party or makes them invisible or a plethora of other issues that weren't even present in FH4. The world system somehow feels even emptier even with the same amount of players, none are to be found roaming or racing along the highway or doing much of anything really, might as well be playing horizon solo. The racing? Again plagued by the issues of it's predecessor. The lead ai on higher difficulties getting rubber banding from p1 all the way to the finish and lower difficulties being absolutely pointless if you have access to any way of steering your car at all. As for online racing it's basically flipping a coin on if your opponents have functioning brake keys, constantly using cars in front and walls to take corners instead, which I can't even blame them for as there's piss all incentive to race cleanly or for anything but 1st. While the collision detection system has been improved from fh4, ghosting players much more frequently it doesn't do anything to mitigate the issue as at the next corner without any repercussion your opponent can just attempt to barrel into you or a wall with minimal issue, even in team races.Cars are again being drip fed through content which for the most part isn't a bad thing, but there's so few new additions you're basically playing to get cars that they removed from fh4 for no discernible reason half the time. The customization has been improved and although still meager is better than previous offerings. The paint and vinyl system is still fantastic and the community always has excellent designs on offer (as long as they don't get banned for being funny or having any ethnic iconography).Open world activities and timed lap rivals are infested with cheaters, any seasonal car is hoarded and sold for max price on the auction house making it unobtainable for the average player without some decent luck or a massive time investment to grind out the money. Event Lab while plagued by low effort content also has some amazing tracks and ideas by the community and is by far the best way to enjoy this sandbox racing experience.It pains me to have to be so harsh on the game but with such little innovation and constant issues there's not much of a reason to pick it over horizon 4 unless you've already played that one and even then this just feels like an expansion of that game.There's a great game core here, there really is but it's mired in a box without a soul. Just go buy fh4 instead, because this game is much of the same with even less charm."
158,Darmenias,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997677354/,151,9,0,342.1,October,"19,",137,13,1,"TL;DR:If you care about story, challenge and progression, about feeling the passion a developer put into a product, then this is not for you. If you don't have a car game community around you to play this game with, don't buy this.However, if you care about messing around with cars, tuning them to bits, drifting for high-scores, hotlapping, etc. then absolutely go for this thing. Just be aware that this game is not created through passion and drive, this is a market research product made with crunch through-and-through.There is no soul here, just one-size-fits-none and toxic positivity. It permeates this game.Good (in my opinion):- Tuning- Car selection- Physics- Trial racing- Rivals- Volcano roadsBad (in my opinion):- Lack of progression and meaning- Character cast is sterile and positive unto death- Limited scope of fun things to do on your own- Festival playlist (FOMO)- Zone instancing (world feels empty online)- Map emptiness (feels like a tourist brochure, not a place where people live)Details:The positives of this game is the sheer amount of cars available, the physics, the driving and the tuning. I love how much you can mess with a car and that most every single tuning slider has a noticeable effect on how you must drive. I like hotlapping and getting better at driving, perfecting sectors and all that jazz. I also would like exploring... if there was anything to explore.The bads are far more weighty than the goods. There is no sense of progression at all and this is the main gripe I see people talk about. This is a sandbox where there is no fun to be had from the top, developer-made excitement. The only excitement is the stress you feel when you know you've not played this week and that there are limited-access cars available that you're gonna miss. This game's entire replay hook is FOMO and it feels so unbelievable disingenuous that I refuse to partake in it. But if not doing the festival playlist, what else is there to do?Nothing. This game is completely void of fun for anyone without a dedicated community of people who want to play this game with them. I don't have that. I'm not a particularly social person online. My friends don't play car games. This means that all the fun I can have in this game is the fun I make myself, since the developer's entire vision is market-research-based and the game is targetted at the youngest of car game players.You know, there would have been something to be had social-wise in this game, but a new feature completely annihilates that aspect: Zone instancing. I thought this was a great idea before release. The game would be more alive because there would be more people per zone, since the game would make sure that every zone would be populated with players, unlike H4's 64 players per server instance being spread all over the map. But this feature is absolutely awful for this kind of game. People you interact with (with no text chat) have a 90% chance of just vanishing into thin air the moment you cross a river because you're sent to separate zone instances. The map literally feels more alive when you're driving around in offline mode.The map itself has some good parts. It feels interesting for the first few days of playing. The big mountain and the roads leading there, Guanajuato, the hotel area, Playa Azul and the canyon, all pretty places for sure. But I found myself missing something quite soon. The map is... a tourist brochure. It is so perfectly procured to give you a sense of 'Mexico at its peak' that it feels sterile. There is nothing happening anywhere on the map at any time, ever. The entirety of Guanajuato feels like it exists in a separate dimension where robots take care of the roads and houses. It feels so squeaky, digitally clean that you can't imagine anyone living anywhere in the city. Combine that with the absolutely awful and non-stop cheeriness of the cast and you've got a world that you can't connect with in any way, shape or form. It doesn't feel like it was made by humans for humans. It was made by market researchers for stockholders. It was made to ship units. The map is big just to be a selling point.So are most of the main changes made to 'progression' from H4. A large point made during the run-up to release was the way you unlock events and festival sites. You do some stuff, rank up and eventually you get a point you can spend to unlock a new part of the game. Sound fun, like something to do. But this is over in the first few days you play and it doesn't feel like progression. It doesn't feel good or even bad. It just is. You'll unlock almost every single race event immediately (another selling point, actually) and then it's just... accolade grinding. Or story mission grinding. Or, as it will be eventually for everyone, festival playlist grinding.There's more I could say here but others have said those things better. I'm gonna end this text wall here. I will still play this game once in a while, just to scratch that itch created by NFS Underground 2 and that era of car gaming. But I can't recommend this game to anyone who likes stories or meaning in games. If you like cars, go for it; this is the absolutely best CAR game of this style ever made.However, I'm getting more depressed every time I boot up the game to find something cool and fun to do with all these cars. My eyes are now scanning the horizon, looking for the next big thing in open-world racing. Maybe Solar Crown will do something for me, though it looks far too arcadey. We will see."

Most or all of the things that annoyed me in Horizon 4 are fixed. I should be fawning over this game, trying to get all my friends in on it, but I can't recommend it in its current state. There are so many problems, it's honestly laughable.The game crashes to desktop reliably, often without giving you the courtesy of an error code, and shows generally poor performance despite comfortably exceeding the developers' recommended specs. Online open-world play is basically impossible due to constant network problems, with players disappearing and reappearing around you. Offline open-world play is also undesirable because of brainless AI drivers that get in the way. Glitches and exploits abound and every leaderboard is dominated by blatant cheaters. Even basic features like daily challenges straight up don't work half the time.But the most annoying thing that ruins the game for me is that AI racers cheat by having impossible levels of grip, rather than being any good at actually racing. This is especially prevalent in cross country events where even on middling difficulty settings, an AI driver with a significant lead is uncatchable, because they can take the world's best line and always get perfect traction out of corners and jumps. There is also a powerful rubber-band effect, so you can never quite leave a field behind you. The AI really only reacts to the presence of the player, so they stay in their stupid little racing line, not overtaking, not defending, nothing, for the entire event if you aren't near them. If you play on a high difficulty, they put you in their rear view mirror and you never see them again; if you play on a low difficulty, they're shockingly bad and pose no challenge whatsoever. I understand that programming AI is difficult and processor-intensive, but this just feels bad to play against. The only way to get a decent race is against human players, but every lobby is full of rammers and ragers, so your only option is time attacking, racing other players' ghosts. For such a huge game, it's extremely disappointing.If these problems are addressed, I might change my recommendation later, but at present, if you really have to have an open world racing game, get FH4 instead."

Quite honestly, this game is a joke and I'm not sure if there are any actual programmers in this studio. Edit: But still, even with it's minor improvements I sunk in like a sucker that I am and I'm not as pissed as I was before.I've only played around 3 hours of 5 and about 400 of 4, to top it off, I played 4 on Xbox One so moving over to PC is already a massive improvement for me.I'll start with the positives, I'll omit graphics as they're obviously better:* Better physics and balancing, especially when it comes to RWD cars. I feel like in the end it'll all boil down to omnipresent AWD conversions, like in 4 and 3, but at least you won't be completely left in the dust if you decided you don't want to put a completely unrealistic conversion in your car. Ad. This is even more significant than I first believed, while it's still not an overhaul or made from scratch, it's really well tuned and gives a lot of joy.* Map looks pretty good, I haven't seen a lot, quite honestly, I've seen more in youtube videos than in my actual gameplay, but it seems really goodAd. After playing for a while longer, I have to say, the new map is really great, with much greater variety and it's slightly bigger as well. I like it more than the UK, though the UK wasn't really done right ( Then again, I know IRL UK quite well while I basically know nothing about Mexico)* Engine sounds are considerably better, comparing from memory sounds from 4 to the few cars I own in both games.* Very well optimized, I've got a pretty high end laptop, AMD 5900HX and a 3070 and it can run this game at extreme settings (higher than ultra) in 1080p at 60 FPS. Later on I'll try it on native res, since I've used an external display, but on the other hand I didn't even switch to turbo mode so it's a positive outlook.Ad. on my laptops native res 2540x1440 it does drop frames here and there, still very smooth, though I dropped as low as 34 frames. Still, it is really well optimized.* The new Horizon adventure is well, not necesarilly a positive due to horrible (HORRIBLE!) dialogue and unskippable cutscenes, but it is something new, gives some guidance and apart from story elements it's quite interesting.Ad. After doing a couple more, not all of them are horribly written, you won't find any sort screenwriting mastery here, it's mostly just bland/silly, but bland and silly is better than some of the atrocities I've witnessed in this game.And now the negatives:* UI is almost exactly the same as in 4, it's not as laggy, but I've played 4 on Xbox One. It's equally slow though, which is infuriating. It's astonishing they still haven't been able to add a simple little tick in the auction house to indicate you own a car and a filter to show only unowned cars. Simply astonishing.* Tuning is the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was in 4 and if anyone tells you different or you read somewhere that it's better you can immediately disregard any future opinions from that source. It's EXACTLY the same. And as in 4, you can go for style points in terms of visual tuning by opting to use manufacturer parts but only the Forza parts offer tuning. And as before, they look exactly the same,Ad. There are couple more options in regards to suspension tuning, and gearbox tuning (definitely the most significant change, you can choose up to 10-speed transmission and fine tune it), some additions here and there, some things missing (but not much) but still, definitely not ground breaking tuning revolution, it's more or less Horizon 4+.* The Showcases that I've seen are copy pasted from 4.* Unskippable intro, extremely cheesy narration.* They managed to reduce the number of cars and in result, car roster's missing a lot, including such obvious additions as all the Lanzias, not even a Stratos in sight,  or a 98 Dodge Viper GTS, which were present in 4, but instead you can choose a BMW M5, M5, M5, M3, M3 or Audi RS(insert number here), choose your pick. Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars in the game and you'll find one for yourself easily, but they've cut a lot of vehicles and barely added anything interesting, a Eunos Cosmo would've been interesting for example. Still, there are SOME new additions.* Character customization is a politically correct joke, you can choose implants, hearing aids and your pronoun, but there's only two voices to choose from (one female, one male, independent of the chosen pronoun) and still no facial hair. * I feel like the beginning is drawn out on purpose to give you very little time to get an actual feel of the game. While it's relevant on Steam, I guess not so much with the Game Pass.* You still don't get a single credit if you restart the race on the finishing screen (as in you finished the race, but want to improve your score, so instead of picking continue you choose restart event). This is quite frankly shocking, it was the same in FH4 and IIRC FH3, it just shows that the testers weren't really into the game if they didn't care about this massive time waste.I feel like this is a good moment to underline that this is a AAA game we're talking here in a long running series from a major studio and publisher.I was pissed at 4 that it wasn't enough of an improvement over 3, but damn, now I simply feel I've been fooled and cheated. I also overshot my refund window, though I feel like I could still get a refund cause it doesn't work on the Steam Deck right off the bat currently, even though it says it's playable in the store and I specifically purchased it from Steam to be able to play on SD hassle free, though all in all I think I'll keep it as I'm a little starved for Horizon and traveled 4's UK far and wide.To sum it all up, I'm sure I'll get a lot of enjoyment out of this game, as the physics have been somewhat improved (a major gripe I had with 4) but that doesn't change the fact that this game feels like a big expansion pack for 4, with some elements cut out, instead of a standalone product. If that what's you're looking for, more Horizon 4, then it's great. If you're looking for more Horizon that's also been significantly or even moderately improved, skip this one or wait for a deeper discount/ play on Game Pass.If you're completely new to the series, I'm honestly at a loss, it would seem that 5 should be the one to get, but 4 has a much better price and considerably more content, while lacking only some minor improvements.Edit: Out of further things they didn't improve on, simulation damage is still basicaly a handicap to the player and there were no accomodations made for that setting to be playable. In FH4, in cross country races, every big jump ended with your car being completely ruined, I discovered that they didn't change that in FH5 through a scripted event which ends with your car falling from a hill and guess what, I had to clunk my way to the last checkpoint at a third of max speed.

Before playing this, my previous favorite racing game was either Forza Horizon 1 or NFS Rivals, but this reminds me of all the things I loved from Horizon 1, on a much larger and improved scale. It does have a few annoyances and bugs at the moment which I imagine they will fix along the way, things to do with tree textures or online free roam server issues here and there, but regardless. It's what I wanted and more out of this game and I'm very happy with my purchase, knowing It'll my ""home"" game to play and relax in for the next few years.I could go on for much longer about the game already but I think most of it is best to be experienced on your own, so if you're debating on checking this out - it's worth it."

After approx. 1 hour of gameplay your GPU will stop focusing the FH5.exe and you will drive around with heavy stutters at the point where I pulled up both steam and the ingame FPS counter and well, the GPU is barely being put load on and I literally have only 30-40 fps at that point, all my convoy partners have this exact issue aswell after every full hour of gametime. (Bypass for this is to just restart the game, thanks 100€ version)Nearly on every single online PvP race the game will either crash, freeze or completely bug out to the point where all cars turn invisible. Me and my convoy partners all freeze at the same spot when doing these sort of races (especially when the scoreboard pops up after every race) and yeah the really only content we could do is this ""Goliath race"" which is a looong ass run but hey atleast we only crashed there ONCE.If you want to do campaign with your convoy, you can forget that because the convoy leader will get the progress and the rest not, you will realize that you have to do everything all over again to gain the progress (Exp and CR is given tho, but not the campaign progress) I paid 100€ and I am beyond disappointed. It was not worth it and I look forward to the devs fixing the huge amount of bugs/issues that they listed themself in their ""Release Notes and Known Issues"" section. The list contains more words than what I had on my exam essay in 10th grade, so good luck to the devs fixing all that.All these issues are mostly happening when being in a convoy, we do not seem to experience this playing alone, but is this game really fun alone? Think about it.Base game: Worth for those who play this singleplayer with current issues.Deluxe Edition: Nah.Premium Edition: Well bought it myself but nah."

FH5 also has a lot of cars and even continues to be added every event/update as well. FH5 Has very good car customization.Also what I'm most looking forward to is the Hotwheels DLC from FH5. But unfortunately, FH5 can't transfer save games because I previously played FH5 on Xbox Gamepasss, and I wanted to continue the Hotwheels DLC on Steam, but that couldn't happen and I had to start over from the beginning. Even so, I still enjoy FH5, for some reason racing games always make me very relaxed and make it a healing game.You should try this because FH5 has a unique story introduction and provides a more realistic and less arcade driving experience."

Not a bad thing, but personally I hoped for more innovation. OK: New location, new cars and a few changes to the gameplay. It's still a massive game under every aspect, graphically impressive, with an arcade but satisfying driving system.BUT: Liveries and tuning system has been the same. The photo mode never changes. When real garages (for 6-10 cars) to store favourite cars and take pics of them? Just to say.It's still a satisfying game, that's for sure, but take the full package when discounted."

Graphically it is nice, the music is...uh...it's music, I'm not a big fan of most of what they opted for but I'm certain a lot of current generation people think it's the best OST ever.Racing feels fun and the various cars all have a slight difference in how they feel as you drive them, which will easily result in personal preferences for any player.What bugs me, aside from the bugs and crashes and server connection issues, is much more fundamental to the game.Not only do we start out as the all star best racer ever, I'm assuming as a continuation of Forza Horizon 4, but the game throws the top tier cars at you immediately.This is a game with hundreds of cars and the vast majority won't ever register on your radar, because they're all so low tier in performance and potential that you'll never pick them up.Tack on their version of the Loot Box which is a ""wheelspin""(loot box), that randomly can give you a great car for zero effort, and the game guts any potential feeling of accomplishment in terms of growing as a car owner.Then we have the AI obviously cheating, and no game makers you can not make me think otherwise.  The AI will immediately leap dozens of yards ahead of you at the start of every race as they accelerate two to four times faster than your car out of the gate.This does not feel like a fun race, this feels like an uphill battle against a cheating system.  Toss in how the game will lock you into higher end difficulties which make the AI even more gamebreakingly capable and sometimes I want to just walk away from the game forever.On top of that the game is basically just a whole lot of everything everywhere, scattered all over a large overworld that is fun to drive across, and you'll end up spending more time driving from place to place rather than actually racing.One final gripe:  Can't skip cutscenes.This is 2021 people, it's not 1997.My friend bought me this game and I'm happy he did, I am having fun with it, but the game has some fundamental problems that'd make me say ""Do not buy this unless you absolutely love racing games, or it's on a good sale""."
188,crosea,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crosea/,64,2,1,208.2,November,"13,",254,11,1,"Do I recommend Forza Horizon 5? Yes, and no.  instead of buying it full price. (Right now, anyway.) The game is equally fun there, and maybe even runs better.The game is good! It's really just a re-skin of FH4, but that was a breakthrough game and there is nothing wrong with reusing the base of what made it so good. Physics are the same, the game plays the same, there is just more to FH5. In terms of gameplay, it is almost 100% the same. BOT opponents have become a little harder, but that is okay. I'm sure they'll look into that and tweak it some - I hope so anyway. There is more available in terms of racing, arcade like events, challenges, etc. Events can be made by the players, too. I haven't fully looked into that, but the possibilities are definitely there and seemingly endless. The game has a good variety of racing available: dirt racing, street racing, drags, rallying. It's all there, and it's done well. Drifting is also an option, although that was never really my favorite.Graphically, it lacks impact. While the Xbox game looks stunning with its highly optimized graphics, its PC counterpart has made little, if any, improvements over FH4. Textures are blurry and not as good as could be, and I have experienced that over longer periods of time (30m-1h+) the game starts dropping in frames. It feels like the game is incredibly poorly optimized for PC experience. Once again, I hope that over time the devs put in some work to make it look as good as the Xbox version, because that looks incredible. There is huge potential there.When the game initially came out, more issues became clear. They are slowly working on fixing those, with some bugs already eliminated. Given the work done so far, I do have fairly high hopes that more bugs get squashed and other issues are looked into as well.I have thoroughly enjoyed my every minute spent so far, and I look forward to playing again the next time. Feel free to ask questions, I'll gladly answer anything I can about the game."

It's almost impossible to join one and even after joining you get disconnected all the time.Multiplayer races are impossible due to connectivity issues with the game itself. Players get disconnected.Multiplayer leaderboards are filled with cheaters who don't get banned.Multiplayer eliminator races are unplayable because of the disconnect issues. Head to head also doesn't work.Achievements and accolades are a big part of the game.

An ingame content which was bought for real money..Blueprint and Eventlab race route creators are also full of bugs and have bunch of issues.The game is full of graphical glitches which can happen even on high-end hardware.Your save file can be corrupted and you'll have to start everything all over again. Even though there is a cloud save Playground Games support does not help you.Also if your save file doesn't get corrupted you can get a roll-back since you can't even save your game progress and it only happens randomly but when you crash it can't save.And much more...So there is no content in this game which is fully usable/playable and bug free.On top of this:Playground Games (developer company) bans people for any reason whatsoever:- Having an alcohol brand on your car (even if it's based on a real racing car 1:1)- Having a cigeratte brand on your car (even if it's based on a real racing car 1:1)- Having a website logo on your car- Having the name ""Brandon"" on your car (it really happened)- Having a paw on your car (literally an animal paw livery)- Having a General Lee livery from Dukes of Hazzard- Having a swiss flag livery on your carAnd much more... And you don't even have to be the creator of these liveries, you just have to apply to one of your cars and they will ban you.Who doesn't get banned?- Cheaters who fill up the multiplayer scoreboards with impossible scores- Creaters of real NSFW and really offensive liveriesPlayground Games refuse to communicate with the playerbase.

This is my first  game, so if you are here expecting me to talk about if  is better or whatnot you won’t be getting that here. I should also mention that if you are someone who plays a lot of  or  and you think you can play this game just fine too, you can’t. It will give you a feel on how to play it, however, don’t go expecting to be a pro.  is an actual racing game with real-world driving mechanics, and it will give you this feeling right when you start playing. has you tasked with joining an event as a celebrity racer called  and you will be going in this series of events in each outpost area. You can have standard racing, offroad racing, cross country racing, street racing, and more. Each race will require you to go through checkpoints to stay in the race, failure to do so will result in you going back to get that checkpoint. However, to prevent this from happening, you can engage a rewind feature that places yourself back near the checkpoint. I should note that missing checkpoints or using the rewind feature online, will screw you over big time, so I recommend successfully going through all of them in the race. is a very big place. You can drive through a dense jungle, a desert filled with cacti, through towns, nice shorelines, and traverse a volcanic caldera. Then there is the , think of it as a battle royal mode, where you and another racer battle in a head-to-head race. Horizon Arcade will make you go to these Arcade markers against other racers in challenges and minigames.!!My favorite race has to be  - it’s a giant race where you drive all across  and I picture it being a giant drive around the country.There are at least 526 cars for you to collect and you can either unlock them, buy them with the CR you get (the game's currency), or buy the DLC ones. You can customize the cars to your heart's content with a variety of colors, engines, horns, or skins. Go and get that nice cool sports car of your dreams and put an anime skin on it, or not, your creativity is your freedom.You can even change the appearance of your character, which to has a lot of options for you to choose from. There are only two voice options and I wish there were a few more to give you that freedom of choice for your character. The cosmetic options are very nice, and you can change the appearance at your house at any timeFurthermore, there are houses that you can buy, which will give you access to a new location for you to customize your cars or character in. However, you can’t explore them or even go inside the house so there is not really a point in buying them in my eyes.FH5 has a lot of nice things but it has a few issues with its gameplay that are noteworthy. My first problem is the fast travel locations; these will fast travel you to an area of the map that you want to go to. My issue with these things is that I just never found them useful as I just wanted to drive around to that area. Why fast travel when I can just drive to and through the jungle in my !! Of course, this is just my personal opinion and if you like doing that, then use them to your heart's content.Another issue I had was when it came to the  events, these are marked by pink circles and when you enter, you will need to wait a bit before the game starts. However, there are rare chances where you will go through a circle and will be thrown into the game with no intention of playing it. I wish they showed you the timers on when the game starts on both the mini-map and the actual map.There is also some downloadable content for you to acquire and these DLC’s can either be something that you can enjoy or a complete waste of money, depending on how you view it. Some of them give you extra cars while others are completely pointless, if you are someone who is a huge car person, then I suppose getting the DLC’s that have cars may be worth it.The  DLC might not be worth the price as it just reveals the locations of the fast travel locations and XP signs, where you can just use  and save your money, but it may hit the mark for those looking for quality of life DLCs. I also hear that  does not work at all currently, so I would pass on this one until you see confirmation that the issue has been resolved. has to be one of the most beautiful games that I have ever played. It shows us a rich  landscape and is really eye-catching. I especially love the night scenery when going through the towns, it just feels so nice to drive through. No other game has topped how great these graphics are and it shows that the devs have worked hard on making the game look the way it is.I tested the game on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 3GB, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X Quad-Core Processor 3.50, and 16 GB of RAM. You will need a good computer to run this game unless you want your old one to start smoking but I don’t think that’s a smart idea.I have also experienced some crashes when the game started which was rare or when I checked the ranked leader boards. I do hope they fix this issue with a patch someday down the road.The soundtrack consists of actual real-world music and has a decent selection of songs, like  by . That one has to be one of the best songs in this whole game, in my opinion, a straight-up banger. My only issue with the music is that there was no rock station but oh well.    is a fun racing game that offers lots to do, see, and explore. Regardless of if you are new to the series or coming from , I do recommend this game. There is plenty of content to be enjoyed throughout the game and with how big the game is there will always be stuff to do, even into the post-game. It has really beautiful visuals that will catch your eyes and plenty of cars to use or try out.However, I can't recommend  at full price. While I did say there are lots to do, it's not exactly the content that I would pay 79.99 CDN for. There are other games you can buy like ,  (plus it has DLC's that are worth the price), or you can buy food. The game is fun, and you will get some enjoyment out of it, just wait for a sale before buying."

It is obviously trying to be very accessible for anyone to play, but to my surprise, there is still a decent level of realism in the tuning system which can make a difference in how your car handles certain terrains and tracks.  It's a really fun title to play with friends and there is lots to do.  While I do wish you had to grind to earn vehicles and upgrade them, as that would give more meaning and value to each car, here I am over 100 hours later writing this review."
199,Nobody,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082152860/,50,5,0,78.7,November,"14,",80,0,1,"So let me preface this with the fact that I have owned every Forza title since the original Forza was released on the original Xbox. This will likely be my last Forza Title ever purchased.For a major title game by a major studio to have THIS MANY release issues is just straight embarrassing.  The game is virtually unplayable in online mode. constant disconnects and server side issues (oh, whats that, youve racked up a 100k skill score?? random server interrupt that makes your car act like it hit a wall and lose all your skill points). The game does funny things in solo mode too. Theres a free house with the VIP pack, you ""buy it"", access it, log out, and when you log back in you no longer own it, but when you go back it says ""free with vip"" so you click it again and it tells you that you already own it, but you can not access it.... Sometimes when you log back in youre in a different car than you were when you logged out (usually back in whatever car you started with). But the worst part of it is, through all the hype over new this and new that, this game feel, looks, and plays, EXACTLY like FH4. I mean seriously; races are named the same and have the same general layout, many of the barn finds are the same as they were in FH4. In fact, some of the cars from FH4 have LESS customizable options in FH5 than they did in FH4. But oooohhh, here, put a 10 speed transmission and paint the brake calipers; apparently that quantifies as 'unforeseen levels of customization'.The next Gen graphics are good, assuming you have something powerful enough to display that high of detail, otherwise, it looks the same... And in typical Horizon fashion, you start off with several million dollars worth of cars, and have no real challenge as, whether your racing online against other players, or solo against drivatars of those players, Horizon has never been about finding the best line and winning the race through skill; its about never lifting off the throttle and using the other cars as bumper guards to get to the end and win.Theres so much more that this game lacks in but if youve read this far youve likely read enough. I will keep playing (mostly because I wasted $100 on this game), but until the devs either fix a TON of stuff, or this game goes to 70% off, dont buy it."

207,no gpu lis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/amaryllis_vfx/,18,,1,202.8,November,"15,",160,1,1,"FH5 is basically an improvement over FH4 in every single way. Playground Games have taken user feedback from FH4, its 2 expansions and its live program and implemented it in FH5 to improve the experience. Looking at FH4, it's very likely that this game will also be supported for around the same time. The visuals have received a significant improvement over FH4 with the inclusion of higher fidelity car models and world geometry made with photogrammetry. The new Global Illumination system provides more accurate lighting in most conditions. The 12K skies captured on location are back in FH4 with 10 times the sky presets available in FH4 providing a wide variety conditions to drive in. Ray Tracing is available only in Forzavista but can be enabled in gameplay with a Cheat Engine hack. Notably with all these improvements over FH4, the spec requirements are still relatively modest with the game performing well even on dated hardware without sacrificing too much on quality.SFX have received a big improvement over FH4 with higher quality recordings as well as a greater number of them providing a lot more unique sounds to the wide selection of cars. Car upgrades now affect the sound of a car, meaning cars sound a lot more unique as every player customises their car differently. Ray traced audio has also been implemented; bouncing sound off of the environment (tress, rocks, mountains etc.) to provide realistic echoes and low tones. One of the important features of any Horizon game is the soundtrack and PG have curated an excellent selection of tracks along with many original tracks made in collaboration with artists they've worked with in the past specifically for the game. All the radio stations from FH4 are back with Timeless being rebranded to Eterna.The handling model is the most important aspect of any racing game. Horizon has always followed the simcade approach, providing simplicity to casual players and complexity to experienced players. FH5 improves on the handling model by making the cars feel more weighty and responsive and the new changes to the suspension model makes it easier to drive off road. Wheel support has also received a big improvement, adding support for more wheels. However hand over hand steering is still missing. Driving modes and raising/lowering the roof in convertibles in freeroam has been added, however currently the feature is limited to very few cars and hopefully the number will increase in time.The new weather events in the form of Tropical Storms and Dust Storms make the world feel more Dynamic and add interesting challenges to the gameplay by affecting visibility and traction. These storms can be seen from a distance and players can choose to drive into them or avoid them. The same is true with the Seasons system. Previously in FH4, players were forced to play in snow or rain depending on the season. However, in FH5, snow and rain are limited to certain parts of the map allowing players to opt out of them.Expanding on Blueprints and Super 7 from FH4, the new Events Lab feature gives even more control over custom game modes and props to users allowing for even greater user generated content to be made. Events Lab allows players to set their own game rules and create actions using If-Then type actions .The campaign is now called Horizon Adventure and adds a lot more progression compared to previous games. Players must earn accolades which are like mini achievements for completing various actions in the game which then unlock points that can be redeemed on various activities that further the campaign. The way that it's been set up allows players to earn accolades from any activity they liked doing and are not forced to do activities they don't like. Accolades provide incentive for players to play the game in different ways and explore activities they usually don't indulge in. The accolades leaderboard encourages competition amidst players to rise the ranks.The season system returns from FH4 with a slight redesign to adapt to the new location. The traditional seasons, Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, are now simplified and called Hot, Wet, Storm, and Dry. The festival playlist which ties in to the week long seasons is back with a few tweaks and the promise of including user generated content and making more substantial changes to the game world such as the world makeover for Christmas, adding snowmen and presents to smash around the world. Online Adventure is now called the Horizon Open and does not feature ranked racing (might change in the future). Eliminator has been added into Horizon Open, which is the battle royale game mode first introduced in FH4 and quickly became the most played online game mode. Horizon Tour is a new game mode which involves Team vs Team racing against AI. The extremely long loading times in FH4 sadly carry over to this game along with the inability to mute in-game voice chat. Whether the new handling model changes makes AWD and meta car builds less over powered will only be made clear with time. Forzathon Live events from FH4 have now been renamed to Horizon Arcade with some changes. The changes made to Arcade has made it unplayable as the lack of participating players combined with the small time limit and big score requirements makes completing the event almost impossible. As of the time of writing this review players are expecting connection issues which should be fixed soon. The game has 3 editions on offer- Standard, Deluxe and Premium. Standard and Premium offer the best value with Deluxe only adding the Car pass over the standard edition. If you're new to the franchise, the standard edition offers the best value. If you're a Horizon veteran and know you're going to put in a ton of hours in, Premium could save you some money on DLCs you'll end up buying anyway if you bought the Standard edition.FH5 can be seen as a refinement of the formula that worked so well for past Horizons. One of the best handling models in any arcade style racing game, breathtaking visuals and a soundtrack to complement it. Mexico as the new location is a great choice, providing a wide variety of environments combined with the new weather events adding more dynamicity. With this being Playground Games' 2nd live service program, and their history of listening to community feedback, the game is sure to improve over time and receive new and interesting content over its lifetime.tl;dr If you liked FH4, you'll love FH5. If you're new to Horizon games, this is a great one time experience even if you don't stick with the game but chances are you'll get addicted. Also skip the Deluxe edition.Update: This game deserved to be nominated for GOTY if not win the award."
208,Clear Vision,https://steamcommunity.com/id/clearvision-datcrosshair/,107,11,0,396.3,November,"10,",134,9,1,"EDIT 19/11/21: I've repurchased the game following the ""hotfix"" that was put out recently (nothing was immediate or hot about it, it was more of a patch), and my opinions of the game are now neutral, and I wish it was possible to leave a neutral review on Steam. I will leave this as a negative review for the time being, as I assume people looking through negative reviews are doing so to look for any sort of critique for a game, so here's my experiences after the hotfix dropped.One positive thing that I can say is that game crashes and being disconnected from online are much less frequent, making it actually possible to play in a convoy with your friends now However, other players will still disappear randomly even if they are in your convoy. This extends to even the Eliminator, I won a game of it without seeing a single other person despite the fact I wasn't going out of my way to try and hide. Racing online with your friends seems to also work a little better, although I encountered a hilarious one-off bug with one of my mates being desynced and falling out of the sky on a flat road right in front of me. That isn't to say that I haven't had a few disconnects though, and I've only had one game crash. If you want to do massive skill chains to get accolades for them, you're still better off doing it offline as if you get disconnected half-way, people are still losing all of their points for no reason but at least your car won't be stopped dead in the process.Something else that has come up that wasn't present at the time of my original review is that there are a  of cheaters now. On rival's leaderboards, on the accolades hall of fame, and even in online races. FH4 had it's fair share of cheaters in rival time trials and online too, but it's even more blatant in this game with far more people doing it, with people having very visible speed hacks in races and rivals laptimes of under a tenth of a second. The top 100 to 200 times are all cheaters depending on how many people have done it, and as for the monthly rivals, this extends beyond the top 500 all being cheated times. It's not a huge problem as this isn't meant to be a competitive game (ranked online modes have been removed), but I still like doing hotlaps from time to time and seeing how fast I can go. Wheel support, at least for me is hit and miss. I still often have to unplug and replug my wheel several times to get force feedback but obviously this won't be a concern if you exclusively play this game with a controller. Custom control profiles still aren't being remembered.The last thing I have to say for now that isn't necessarily a bug or exploit is that I hate what they've done with Horizon Arcade (the new Forzathon Live). There's no notification of when they start anymore, because there will be multiple Arcades per hour, instead of having one every hour on the hour like in the last game. Not only that, but there will also be two completely separate Arcades lasting 10 minutes each rather than one lasting 15 in FH4. Combine that with the goals being ridiculously high, it's almost impossible to get it done for the festival playlist unless there's a large group of players all taking part. However, that's not likely to happen outside of asking a lot of friends to join you because there's no notification for them. This is a serious oversight on the developers, as I've seen more people doing Forzathon Live in FH4 on a consistent basis, even if there wasn't anything super valuable in the Forzathon Shop.All things considered, would I recommend this game now based on how the average player would play the game and what they would care about most? Yes, especially if you have friends to play it with, and I've changed this review to a positive one to reflect that even though my views on this game are still neutral. The average player probably doesn't really care about setting the fastest times in rivals, or the cheaters online, or wheel support because they would be spending most of their time playing with friends most likely, or customising cars, or going through the campaign events and a few custom events too.  I anticipate the developers will address other important issues that haven't been fixed yet in the future but if you're reading this and debating on whether or not to buy the game, here's my verdict:- If you're more casual about things and intend to primarily play with friends, I would recommend FH5- If you are going to play mostly or entirely on controller, I would also recommend FH5.- If you're going to be playing mostly alone, I'm not sure. For a game that has had over 10 million people play it, FH5 sure does feel empty on the online side of things with servers not showing that many players.- If you're the kind of player who likes to do some competitive racing or hotlaps, don't bother. I don't think they will add a proper anti-cheat system and remove illegitimate laptimes or scores anytime soon.- If you're going to be playing this with a wheel, I would also say don't bother. It's seriously frustrating to unplug and replug my wheel several times in several USB slots until the FFB decides that it wants to work and then having to set my custom control profile again every time I launch the gameI'll update this review one more time after another update inevitably comes out to fix more problems and change my recommendation accordingly.________________________________________________________FH5 has a solid foundation to be a good game, but right now I can't recommend it. Too many problems with not enough urgency behind fixing them which has caused me to refund it. When it works, it works very well. The suspension and tyre model physics are improved from FH4, force feedback on wheels is better once adjusted (especially off road). But instead of fixing any of the actual problems that players are experiencing, they'd rather fix the bloody treasure map of all things.There are stability issues, issues with multiplayer (namely convoys and horizon life) not working, custom controls and preferences not being remembered and having to be set every time you start, wheel support being hit and miss (a feature the devs specifically said they have improved) with me having to unplug and replug my wheel to get FFB to work. Also, taking part in Horizon Arcade (the new Forzathon Live) will cause your game to crash if you weren't there at the very start, and they decided to reduce it down to 10 minutes (from 15) for some reason.I will pick this game up once the issues have been addressed but for the time being you need to vote with your money if things will ever change with broken game releases. Don't buy this game if you haven't already, wait for the devs to fix it."

There are deserts, canyons, jungles, beaches, a volcano etc. so it always feels exciting to explore.+ Vehicle sounds have been improved a lot and they change based on the upgrades you install.+ Hundreds of cars with huge variety. There is something for every taste, from JDM tuners to American muscles, SUVs and trucks to supercars.+ A lot of events to participate. There are the classic sprint and circuit road, rally and cross country races but you can also play drift races, a battle royal mode, player-made modes etc. or complete the story and open world challenges.+ Previously it was very hard to drive rear wheel drive cars without assists especially when they are upgraded to higher performance levels so people usually converted them to all wheel drive layout but it is much more comfortable now.+ The campaign is better than it is in Horizon 4. It was basically non-existent back then and the festival was present only at a small location. Now the festival atmosphere is better felt with different locations across the map.- In Horizon 4 you could select specific class and type of online races you wanted to join. For example you could choose ""A class road races"" if you didn't want other performance classes or rally and cross country races, but unless I am blind I don't see this option in this game, so you will always get a random class and type. The cons are nothing compared to the pros and how fun the game is so I definitely recommend."

So far, I've had an awesome time with the game. There's little ""progression"" and the story is laughably bad, but thankfully that's not the point. It's all about taking whatever car you want and letting loose in Forza's open world. The best part is, you get to play however you'd like. Personally, I did all the cross-country and dirt events first and still, at 80+ hours in, haven't even touched the street racing. The soundtrack is pretty good, personally Hospital, Pulse and Bass Arena are what I cycle through. The only real complaint so far is the net-code and online issues. Still haven't made it past round 2 of a Horizon Arcade, so here's hoping that gets smoothed out soon. If you're a filthy-casual like me, or a hardcore sim engine-tuner, you can enjoy the game at your own leisure.edit: 12/7 Horizon Arcade has been adjusted to amount of players which is great, but still online issues have not been fixed."

As someone who's played every Forza Motorsport game and Forza Horizon game, this is by far the most beautiful and polished the game has been. It's an absolutely stunning game and very well optimized, Mexico can't be beat. It is easily becoming my favorite map out of any of the Horizon games. There is more than enough things to do, earning money is rewarding, variety of races is endless especially when it comes to community blueprints and mini games. Music I'd say is good, not great. Pulse radio was always my go to now it seems like a pop station now, I find myself on Bass Arena now. Other stations are good lots of variety, there's something for everybody. The amount of cars and customization is one of the reasons why this is easily becoming my favorite Horizon game to date, endless cars. They've added more parts to add and customize, they listened to community and fixed the audio so I commend them for that. Final Rating: 9.5/10Only thing I continue to feel in the most recent Horizon Games is that there really isn't a campaign, well there is but doesn't feel like it. As they kinda just throw you in the world with 400 races and pretty much say ""Do whatever you want"" for me I miss the feeling of grinding for a purpose other than ranking up and buying every car I want which is nice but I want more out of it."

Alongside this, a narrator voice automatically comes on despite being off in the settings. 4 months since release and it's still not fixed???

However, Most of the content in the current game is recycled such as some cars which are in FH4 are placed in Festival Playlist in FH5 as new content. Those cars should be at launch if there are no licensing issues unlike the case of Alfa Romeo, Fiat and Lancia that is the actual licensing issue. Also some features like Midnight Battles should reward the cars that are new to Forza instead of the cars that already exist in the first place. Bugs and glitches haven’t been fixed properly even hotfixes in each updateDespite the recycled contents, The updates that FH4 doesn’t make into it is the new customization such as new rims, new bodykits from other manufacturers besides Rocket Bunny and Liberty Walk. The bodykit of Hyundai Veloster surprises me unexpectedly and it becomes one of my favourite bodykits. Eventlab creates new areas or custom maps for drifting, photography and more. This new feature in FH5 helps the community create new things.The main map of FH5 is mixed between FH3 and FH4, FH3 brings diversity in each area of the map and returns multiple festival sites and the airport meanwhile FH4 brings historic city into it but the issue of FH5’s map doesn’t have urban area like in FH3 map. So the map in FH5 is basically FH4’s map with many biomes. In terms of car list, Car Pass DLC is worth it for discounted price. Some cars are pretty good with proper customiztion but some new gen cars such as Audi should be free in Festival Playlist. New cars at the post launch don't have as much as I expected. Online mode is quite soulless unlike FH4 where most people are active in Forzathon events that make the event look like the car meet. Online racing and custom event is not different much as FH4Forza Horizon 5 is a sandbox-ish game where you can choose and buy one of your favourite cars to curise or race. Freedom and customizability are the key. So the overall score for this game is 7/10."
228,enzym,https://steamcommunity.com/id/enzymsteam/,10,,1,232.8,November,"11,",283,1,1,"Forza Horizon is since Horizon 2 one of my favourite franchises. I had high expectations and after 50 hours ive seen most parts of the game and can do a short review. For everyone who played Forza Horizon 4, it will feel like home if you first enter the new menu screen. There are some new features like the expeditions, but basically the game feels very similar to his predecessors. The difference between those games is the setting it takes place in. Every title has its very own feeling, because of the culture and the country its representing. In that case, Forza Horizon 5 is no exception.The map is bigger than everything we had before and the mexican style is implemented very well. There are many kinds of nature and scenery, like beautiful beaches, large fields, canyons or deserts with nearly white sand. The feeling of going on a holidaytrip to mexico just by playing the game is awesome. The world is beautiful made, with many details and some interesting secrets, the amount of cars is huge. Not that many new ones, but nearly everything we know is back. In terms of races you can choose between offroad- and classical onroadraces. Because of the beauty of the map you are going for some great tracks and with higher difficulty quite challenging races against the AI or friends. Other than that, you can do the typical drift zones, speed cameras or the ,,storys'' the game tells you. Those storys are a quite nice addition, which is representing the countrys culture but get boring very quick, cause the missions are very repetitive and the scenarios in my opinion are totally irrelevant. The first expedition into the jungle is sadly the only one, which stands out and was just awesome. Theres so much to do and you can choose what youre doing next or leaving out.But what would be Forza without the cars. Like i said, the selection is huge and nearly each one is great detailed, even the interior is realistic made. I love to spend hours in customizing my dream cars, set the rims i want, the colours, the grade of window tint, nearly everything is possible. Even the rims are licensed and some bodykits and spoilers too. In my opinion, its one of the best feelings in a videogame to build your car and drive it, while listening to your favourite music, through the beautiful scenery of the game. Hang out with your friends on the beach while watching the sunset, explore the awesome world cruising in your favourite car or race some other drivers. Its the feeling of a living world youre set in, a short trip to one of the most awesome places on earth. These things describe the best what Forza Horizon is to me. And thats exactly what Forza Horizon 5 takes you in. In the actual state the game has some negative aspects too. The AI is a bit inconsistent. Sometimes they let you overtake, while driving much slower or you loose the next race on the same difficulty, cause they are driving like on rails. Often you cant create a convoy or the game desyncs while in race. These things kill the awesome feeling i described in some parts, but the devs are working to fix those issues. In terms of performance the game is running fine. I can recommend this game to everyone who is interested in cars and/or racing. For me its the perfect mix between arcade (NFS) and simulation (AC). If there would be many games of this kind, which are as good as Forza Horizon, it wouldnt be that successful. Wait until the bugs get fixed and you are getting an awesome game.Thank you very much for reading and have a nice day."

I really loved FH4 and so far really enjoying this one. The beauty and detail are unparalleled, the creativity by Playground games is what really shines throughout the series. They obviously know how to make a good racing game but they also know how to make a good game ( If you catch my drift), I was a non racing fan for the most part of my gaming life aside from the good ol NFS MW days but when I play a Forza Horizon game, I really find myself enjoying the different degrees of freedom it offers whilst remaining true to it's core.That being said, the steam version recently got an update to adress some issues which many of us have faced during the first two weeks following the launch. After the recent patch I did notice few stutters while first booting up the game then it dies down 30 secs later. The LOD and draw distance are still an issue even on Ultra atleast for me but looks great in Extreme but FPS crawls to 25. After the patch, the draw distance is slightly better but far from perfect. Also I'm using MSAA 4x and it kind of looks shimmery at times, I remember this being an issue in FH4 which was fixed eventually.The thing is they are still releasing updates for FH4 and fixed major visual bugs in FH4, so  I am confident that they are more than capable of fixing some draw distance and shimmering in the following patches.TLDR; The game has few visual bugs but they will be fixed very soon but if you have a low-mid end PC anyways and you prefer lowering your settings, you won't be disappointed how this game looks and runs on lower end hardware."

Really?* Many bugs and issues still persist - for example, crappy auction house that is slow to use, lags and bids often fail for no reason.* Story reached new heights of cringe, especially with every other sentence being mix of english/spanish.* Lobby building seems to be much worse than FH4 - I logged into FH4 and saw 60 players on my map, here I never saw it past 15. This leads to a lot less interaction with other players, especially forzathon/arcade, you are lucky to have 1 or 2 other players doing it with you (there's also four happening at the same time, unlike single one in FH4).* Still not many visual tuning parts and wanting adjustable aero forcing you to use ugly spoiler on every car - please, just make adjustable aero some invisible checkbox.* No businesses* No ranked* Visual bugs and crashes that I don't experience in FH4For pros, car sounds are better, a few more performance upgrade options."

You will love this.• Other gameplay changes like event organization, more trailblazers etc• Optimized enough for my trusty old 1070Ti to run it on everything maxed at 1080p at around 60 FPS.• Steam version is not broken like FH4Cons:* Horizon Arcade. What was supposed to be a fun 10 mins like Forzathon Live, became a grind. Even after 2 weeks, it is not doable.• Some connection issues in between, which the devs have already said they are working to fix it; so may have already been solved.• Radio maybe? I really enjoyed song selection in FH4 more.• Not regionally priced like FH4 If you liked previous Forza Horzion games, you will definitely have a good time with FH5."

I do not recommend spending that amount for this, its not worth it. Give it a try on the pass first. If you get FH4 and FH3 ultimates together on a sale you would have almost the exact same game as this, better maps and more terrain and weather diversity and still have some money left over instead of buying this broken mess.*Mexico is underwhelming, uninteresting and boring.*Not sure if its the location itself but Mexico is by far the worst looking Horizon map, not sure what they were going for, realistic I guess but ended up with dull. Compared to FH3 and FH4 the visual presentation difference is night and day, they still look better somehow. To be clear, the textures are better, models are highly detailed and the number of props in the map are significantly more than the previous games but they just don't look good.*There are several technical and online issues atm, crashes and bugs. Same online problems as before, loading and sync. Haven't come across input lag so far which has been an issue since FH3.*LOD issues. The terrible draw distance makes the terrain and foliage, which are already bad looking worse as 70% of the screen and view look pixelated and low res including the skies, like a game from 2010s. Black horizontal lines bars due to SSAO, broken textures, low fps crowd, pixelated smoke and dust etc.*Weather effects are recycled and not even improved upon and imo mostly worse. The only new thing is the dust storm which is basically the blizzard effect in brown. No more than bare minimum effort was put into water and rain effects, weather effects on the environment aren't great either. You have look in the menu to find which season it is.*For a game centred around fun, festivals and party, the UI is as basic as a formal ppt done in the last minute. *Festival locations are meh. Even Australia festivals were better to look at, from near and far.*Character customisation is the same as before with just different hairstyles to chose on the very specific stereotyped 3D scanned faces that look like nobody. The player talks now so that's new.*Vanity items are just handful, the emotes and most things are recycled from the last games.*Woke signalling nonsense, pronouns, prosthetic and face masks for whatever reason and that too in a racing game. They could've easily done a balaclava or bandanna instead but NO! they've just got to insert their political bs at every given chance because 2021.*The handling and physics is almost identical, Unless you're deep into tuning, you wont notice the difference.*The new engine sounds are there but I assume most people like myself would just turn down sfxs to listen to their playlist.*I don't mind multiple Horizon releases in a gen, we get more locations to drive in and that's great, but this game is downgraded in more things than it improves upon. Now I know why they would talk about nonsense like graffiti for hours all the time because they had nothing else new to show. FH4 was an actual generational upgrade from FH3 and people still liked FH3 better and still do, so remember that, most of these ""improvements"" are subject to preference."

Also, no co-op with convoys and random players- Terrible light exposure where the map is too dark when it is afternoon- Lack of features compare to FH4- Wheelspin is now awful and grindy- You cannot skip dialogue in Super 7 - A stupid tree in the middle of ek balam CC circuit- Did I mentioned that Bone shaker is broken?- Drivatars are unfair and make you question life- You cannot do custom Horizon Opens: You are forced to race in Classes and race types randomly- Steering is still locked at 90 degrees. Where is the full 900 degrees?- Some livery artist got banned for making sfw anime liveries.- Playground games event is the same as FH4: a complete mess of a game mode- The Eliminator feels like a copy n paste, but different cars, horrible map and horrible stutter each time you do head to head. For some reason, final showdown does not have that horrible stutter issue. Also the game takes forever to reset your car, should it get stuck.- Playground game devs had years learning from their mistakes from Forza Horizon 4, but does not seem to care and poorly executed 5. Meanwhile Turn 10 are flawless with their support tickets.- Power builds are being meta- As of playing the game, it feels very unoptimized; constant stutters whenever you access the menu- Ui is too simple and not well designed compare to Forza Horizon 4. It's as if a 12 year old who has no experience in graphics design made it.- You cannot gift cars to specific players. Minor issue though- Leaderboards are still broken and filled with hackers filling up the top - Random convoy race is non-existent. The convoy in Forza Horizon 4 was fine, while 5's is too overcomplicate and inconvenient. In 4 you just go to an event, select co op or pvp and randoms could join in. 5 does not have that, because you have to create a convoy, state whether it is a road, dirt, street, etc. and wait for a player to join in before you select an event and start a race. Sounds complicated? Because it is!- Influences > Accolades  - The music in Forza Horizon 5 are mostly miss. Nothing is memorable and hospital music is bare bones. The previous Horizon games did it better- Ray tracing is only available in ForzaVistaI am aware that the devs are working hard to improve the game, but have they learn from FH4? The bone shaker being broken proved otherwise. In conclusion, I rather pay scalper price for a PS5 + Elgato capture card and Gran Turismo 7 than to play this repeated mess of a game."

Must be noted that game requires a lot of RAM either way it's gonna crash a lot (I've experienced the same issue with FH3/FH4 before installing additional 16 GBs of RAM to previous 16GBs)Even though this game is a ""Forza Horizon 4 reskin"", as everybody calls it, but it's still good. Devs can and will add feature with future updates like in FH4, of course this game has everything FH4 had, but it's now better and bigger and has a lot of time to become even better. The map is huge, elevation changes are insane comparing to previous games, different bioms and districts look great. Huge amount of different events, the biggest final races Horizon have had so far. Car collection is not that rich as it was in FH4, but it will be even bigger after a couple of seasons for sure.Seasons are great, but I miss ranked adventures. Without them usual adventures are full of tryhards with meta cars, overall adventures are useless unless you're doing daily challenges for season complition.EventLab should be mentioned too, - the tools that were given by devs are insane. Many players already have created stunning events with their own layout and rules and many yet to come.This game can be kind of boring, because it lacks good progression, but it's definitely good for chill racing or cruise alongside the coast. This game is the best arcade race you can find right now and probably in the next 5 years.Old detailed review under the spoiler:"

The devs have also setup social media for you to follow, some of which have been taken down or are vacant. The only news source for the games upcoming patches is a Q&A detailing bugs they dont intend to fix.

It would be well worth the money for the most expensive edition. Boy was I wrong... Between the accolades, seasonal events and other things that just don't register. The lack-luster game design, empty feeling map, no sense of progression. I honestly am very disappointed. The car selection is very good for release, but still some puzzling omissions. I've always been the biggest fan of the horizon series. I don't typically enjoy arcade racers, but Forza USUALLY hits that sweet spot. I dont know why they got rid of daily drivatars rewards... and where are the businesses? It just feels so grindy and pointless. You unlock all the races not through completing them, but special events? Where is the sense of progression? I could go on and on, this season has felt the most grindy so far. no variety at all. Buy this B series car and do a race, then buy this B series car and do a race. why not do races B through S1 and swap across race disciplines. I feel like they could have used so much more of the map as well. The beaches are empty and useless, near the west area, a whole off-roading area exists with no roads or anything.

There are various graphical and gameplay glitches that make the game extremely less immersive. - Anti-Aliasing sometimes will devolve into an early 2000's pixel platformer.- Black polygons will show up from time to time on the surface of dirt areas.- In online mode, the car will suddenly stop after being disconnected from the server, resulting in the loss of a skill chain.- Landing in some areas of towns in the game from either Danger Zones or ramps will result in being trapped by unbreakable walls, buildings, or other objects.- In online mode, some player's cars will freeze mid-air after being launched from Danger Zones.- SSAO will sometimes lower in resolution mid-game, showing bars across the screen from the Horizon, making it harder to see distant objects when driving. (Ironic, really.)- LOD will sometimes turn into the 1st generation Source engine.- Crashes.- Long load times, even with a NVMe SSD.- Level-ups will sometimes not register, resulting in the game showing you as a level higher than you actually are, even when the rewards have been given.On a good note, the northern Mexico map is vast with great detail and realism, although a lack of potholes from my few times visiting Mexico myself. The selection of vehicles in the game is also a great improvement from FH4, and the details are extremely photorealistic. In addition, the gameplay and races are highly varied, and the substantial amount of online interactivity makes this game one of the best online racing games on PC.Though these bugs can be ignored from time to time, I have ran into issues involving a multitude of crashes due to lack of memory optimizations. Consequently, I have lost numerous amount of hours of progress on extensive wraps and decal group creations.

In fact, driving, in general, feels worse. Handling is better granted, but the dreadful AI together with the terrible matchmaking ruin it. Unless you love driving around a mostly empty feeling sandbox world, or tuning cars, please don't buy this. It might be better with friends, but so is getting punched in the face."

278,M4F10S0,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091110242/,19,2,1,235.2,November,"28,",124,0,1,"You as a superstar of Horizon festival in the UK is sent to Mexico to help build a new festival. The opening scene is awesome. You jump out of the plane in a car and your adventure can start. There will be a lot of work but it will be fun and you won't turn off the game.The game offers so many activities to do. You will be building not just one place for the festival, neither two but 5. Yeah, 5! Each race type has its own festival place plus a place for PR stunts. To do it you will need to collect accolades. These are small challenges. Some are easy to complete but there are some challenging as well. Big map of Mexico offers many races but not too much. I must say devs made a good amount of races. There are 4 types of races. Road Racing, Wild a.k.a. Dirt Racing, Baja a.k.a Cross Country and Street Racing. Everyone will find his favourite. Thanks to the big map that contains different areas from desert through fields, jungle, city to a high mountain which is a volcano. Races don't feel the same as in Horizon 4. I very like new stories and expeditions. There is a lot of them and they add more story feeling to the game. The game feels more like a racing game with a storyline than just plain racing over and over. Also, moderators in radios are responding to activities that you do in Mexico. By the way, radio stations have a good selection of music.The visual of Mexico is stunning. When you will climb on top of Vulcano you will be looking at the whole map with opened mouth. Another great thing is car sounds. Finally, they are nice! Horizon 4 has some cars that sound really good but it was just a few cars. Horizon 5 is completely another dimension and Dodge Viper has proper sound too ;). You know what? Try to change the exhaust on your car. Boom! The car has a new sound. Cars are changing sound when you upgrade them. Isn't it awesome? Devs did a great job with car sounds.A very important thing in racing games is handling. Forza Horizon has the best car handling from the amount of all open-world racing games. You can adjust it to your preferences. Yes, you can't make a simulator from it but if you turn off all assistants you will need the skill to keep your car on road. You can feel the weight of a car. Cars don't feel like karts. I'm looking at you - Need for Speed. Ok, what about the cars list? Well, it's... nicely chosen. You can find there more than 500 hundred cars. Horizon 5 has a very good economic system that doesn't let you grind many hours until you can buy a car that you want. Trust me. You can really fast make some credits and buy what you want. Also, you will get many cars for free from wheel spins or by completing activities. The auction house is there too so you can buy some expensive cars cheaper here. Cars have two new features. The first is every car has launch control. Just shift reverse gear and then back to the first gear (or press downshift and upshift together) and hold break with gas. Release brake and the car will get perfect launch. The second is working convertibles. Well working yeah, some convertibles can put the roof down or up but also there are still many cars that cannot. Hopefully, devs will add this feature to all convertible cars. Also Mercedes AMG One has two driving modes. Would be nice if devs use driving modes on more cars.As with all games, this one has some negatives as well. The launch of the game was not the best. There are some memory leaks, bugs and connection problems but devs are working on fixes, and I hope many of them will be fixed in the next big update."

Instantly loved it, by October I had all the achievements and cars excluding 4 pre-order machines. Understandably I awaited FH5 since it was announced during E3. After 30 hours I can say the new instalment exceeded my expectations.From the moment menu kicks in with its captivating music evoking Mexico vibe so much, till the  Goliath race across the map, there’s so many aspects neatly executed here. It’s a step-up from the already good FH4 in almost every department.Graphics, lighting, map design (especially its huge verticality which I haven’t seen in any other racing title to date). Audio, highlight of which being the sandstorm both looking and sounding insane. Everything is . 1.5x the map size of FH4. Longer drift zones. Online Forzathon events more fun to participate in. Online racing revamped in an immersive way (you drive to another destination with the same people you just raced with).Horizon Stories now having different episodes scattered throughout the world. Trailblazers, treasure hunts and  challenges incorporated from FH4’s DLC. Weekly festival playlist with new event types and twists (car brand/class restrictions for PR stunts – I’m looking at you). Mexico rendition is so sunny and vibrant compared to gloomy Britain, with every part of the narrative telling its interesting culture.Driving model has also been improved upon. It needs a bit of time to get used to. Cars have more weight to them so understanding (and utilizing) weight transfer rules while cornering is more important. There are assist and difficulty settings to help you with the learning curve.FH5 runs great on my old i7-6700 and GTX 1060 GB. 60fps, bit less in intensive races (1920x1200 display, 'high' graphics preset which the game recommended itself). This was a nice surprise as before the launch I was sure I’d need to sell my kidney to buy RTX 3060.Online connectivity hiccups during early access weekend for Premium edition owners spoiled the fun, unfortunately. Seriously counting on some in-game compensation from Microsoft…To people saying it’s just another FH4, let me explain. The series has always had two words in its name, every time both of them being  and . It’s just the following number that kept changing, and boy… I wish every other numbered series improved at least as much from the previous iteration, simultaneously preserving its best features as successfully as FH5 does. 9/10"
287,jettacar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jettacar/,99,20,0,446.0,November,"22,",115,19,1,"Note: This review was written before the first patch. It will discuss issues that may not be present in the game anymore. I urge you to actually read the review before making an uneducated comment, because I actually don't hate this game. I genuinely love it, and will continue playing it. I'm simply giving an honest, unbiased review on some of the issues - as a long-time, avid player of all Forza titles.Forza Horizon 5 is the (buggy, dysfunctional) car game for non-car people.I really enjoyed this game. This is the most fun I've had in a Forza title in a very long time, and it's definitely miles above Horizon 4. However, I can not in good faith recommend a game that is clearly unfinished. This game REEKS of ""rushed for a holiday release"". There's so much wrong with this game, but they neglect to remedy most of it. There's a constant memory leak issue that reveals itself, usually around an hour of playtime, requiring a restart. I physically can not run the game on ""Extreme"" settings, even though my computer physically could. After ~5 minutes of driving around on max settings, the textures will begin to corrupt and the framerate will tank.Attempting to play with friends is a frustrating, grueling task that will likely result in you giving up and closing the game. Never in my life have I seen a game with such an unstable online mode, WHILE TRYING TO PLAY WITH SOMEONE ON THE SAME WIRED CONNECTION AS ME!The AI is also extremely frustrating. I have no idea what they did between Horizon 3, 4, and now, but the blatant disregard for the game's physics performed by the AI can get infuriating very quickly. The rubberbanding is extremely exaggerated in online play, as drivatars in completely stock C or D-Class cars will just decide to make manoeuvres as if they were on rails. Doing any sort of off-road race is a no-go unless you're AWD/4WD. Why? Because the AI will AWD swap every single car, without fail, every time. This makes attempting to enjoy a RWD or FWD rally car a very hard task, as every race will now become exponentially harder.This game is chock-full of graphical glitches too. Floating rocks, botched collisions, incorrect shading, the works. The Can-Am Maverick's rear quarter panels are void-black most of the time. I have no idea what factor plays into this, but it's not a constant issue. The Mercedes X-Class lacks a modelled engine (which it had in Horizon 4), and the Ford Racing Puma's hood will not open properly. Only the sound deadening of the hood actually goes up when you open it, the rest of the hood stays shut.NOTE: This next paragraph is entirely opinion.A personal gripe of mine that doesn't necessarily affect gameplay has to be the lack of vehicle variety and progression. If you're the type that likes steady, somewhat linear progression, where the supercars feel far more rewarding in the end, this is not the game for you. There is an extremely glaring omission of just, ordinary, everyday cars. The potential for upgrading could be so much better if we were simply given the regular counterparts of the cars, leaving the insane custom builds of them as a conversion kit. I simply don't understand this, because Forza historically, up until the mid 2010's was always very good about vehicle variety. Where is the Mexican domestic vehicles? I counted one. The Renault 4L. That is the only vehicle that is discernible as the Mexican market version. I would HAPPILY drive a Ford Topaz, Chrysler Spirit, Peugeot 404, Chevy Caprice, Dodge Ramcharger, Opel Fiera, the list goes on. They really dropped the ball on including Mexican vehicles in ""The Mexican Car Game"". Beetle this, Beetle that. The Beetle has been in nearly every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ title. It's not new. Would it have hurt to include some more obscure/ordinary Mexican vehicles? I would bet money that nobody at Playground Games has heard of VAM. Another thing! Why the ♥♥♥♥ is there licensed traffic in this game? Just include the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars! You guys literally have the models for all of them already, because they're just ported from older titles.Anyways, this concludes my rant. This game has so much potential, but it really drops the ball on functionality. I wish people wouldn't happily advocate for pushing developers to release an unfinished game with the ""it can be patched later!"" mindset. I'm very happy for the record-breaking launch on this game, but clearly something was done differently that breaks the multiplayer in this. I just wanna play the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with some friends.UPDATES:-Online sort of works now. Still nearly impossible to do a convoy free mode road trip, due to players popping in and out all the time. But I've had 0 issues within races as of recently!-The texture corruption glitch that happens during a memory leak has been fixed, but the memory leaks themselves still happen."

I wasn't expecting a game that looks this good to run really well, but it does (apart from a few dips here and there). The game rewards you for your time and you'll always be unlocking something throughout your playtime. If you're looking for another game to grind and to try and unlock everything, I'd recommend getting some of the DLCs or the premium edition to help with that. Otherwise, I'd recommend getting the base game/playing this on Game Pass instead, all of which will still get you a remarkable experience!"

310,Fairyteller,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fairyteller/,6,,1,475.7,November,"25,",451,0,1,"(A review of Forza Horizon 5 coming up as soon as I finish drifting down the volcano…)An open world racing game chock full of cars, races, drifts and sweet jumps, Forza Horizon 5 is a fun ride through Mexico that maintains the core fundamentals of what made Horizon 4 a lot of fun, while improving several aspects of the game. New and returning players alike are both guaranteed a lot of fun here. They are indeed, doing it better than any other open world racing game on the market!Yes. I usually start my reviews talking about the game’s story, but since Horizon 5 doesn’t have a traditional story, I’ll discuss the gameplay in detail.At its core, Forza Horizon 5 is an  with a lean towards the arcade end of the “arcade-sim” slider. You’re dropped into , complete with  After you’ve been dropped off in the hub, the game gives you a small number of races and stunts to complete so that you can earn points and unlock more races and story missions. It’s then up to you to decide what you want to do. Maybe you’ll explore the whole map, discovering new locations and collectibles? Or maybe you’ll spend hours drifting a Supra, testing how many millions of combos you can get? Or maybe you’ll work your way up the volcano  and see how far you can launch the Corvette off a ramp? Let’s talk about what Horizon 5 offers you in terms of racing.  You unlock every race type by progressing through the story mode and once unlocked, you can participate in any available race whenever you want. You’re also free to do any race with whichever vehicle you want and the AI will match your car type and performance class. Want to race down a volcano in classic muscle cars? You can. How about racing trucks through a rainforest? Go wild. With the exception of the weekly challenge races, the game never forces you to use a certain vehicle type for a race, adding immensely to its replay value. The game’s weather also changes every week, so a you might find yourself drifting in the middle of a sandstorm in the weather one week, followed by a race in a thunderstorm the next and then racing atop a frozen volcanic crater the week after that. One of the things that has had a substantial overhauling from Horizon 4 to 5 is the game’s progression system.  They range from the simple, like winning races or 3 starring a stunt, to challenging, like driving from one place to another in a certain car within a time limit or stringing together a specific skill chain. Once you’ve collected a certain amount of points, the game gives you an unlock point so you can unlock a chapter of your adventure. Every chapter costs 1 point apiece, so you’re free to unlock whichever chapter you’d like. Some challenges even unlock emotes, chat lines and new cars, so you’ll always wanna keep an eye out.I mentioned Horizon 5 being closer to an arcade racer than a sim racer earlier. Basically, before you start of any race, the game lets you choose from multiple available difficulty modes and driving assists, with harder difficulties and no assists rewarding you extra money. The game also has a pretty  allowing you upgrade a car’s engines and transmission for more speed and acceleration, or tyres and drivetrain for better handling and so on. There’s also a pretty  that lets you fine tune exactly how you want your car to feel. It’s not a lot compared to any serious sim, but it’s still pretty extensive. Unfortunately, the game doesn’t explain the tuning system in much detail, but for those who just want to get to the racing without having to learn about rebound stiffness and camber, you can always download player made tunes for any car and get straight to the action. Speaking of player made tunes, let’s talk about some of the game’s online features. The game lets you  If your work gets used, you even make some money in game! Every race in game can be co-oped against the AI with a team of upto 6 people, and you can also play PvP. Horizon 5 also offers two game modes exclusive to PvP, the Playgrounds mode and the Eliminator. Playgrounds mode is a series of modes where you team up with others to take on the enemy in games of tag and soccer. Eliminator is Horizons take on the battle royale, pitting upto 50 players in a game of survival. There are also hourly events, the Horizon Arcades, where you have to complete a bunch of mini missions with other players in 10 minutes for points that you can redeem in the game store for rare cars or cosmetics. Want a certain car, but it’s too expensive or rare? There’s the auction house in game where you can bid on cars against other people! With so many online features and the weekly challenges, it’s easy to see why Horizon has sometimes been called a racing mmo.Making an open world look and sound good is a huge part of the immersion. How does Horizon 5 stack up in this?Freaking phenomenally, that’s how. Each of the game’s biomes looks and sounds spectacular. A lot of detail has been put in the game and it shows. Even on medium and low graphics settings, you can go on top of a cliff in the canyons or the volcano and look around for miles in game. The world is full of little details, like small dogs and donkeys roaming about in fields and villages, who will always manage to avoid your car! Driving in the desert, through a sandstorm is as thrilling as you’d expect, because you can see it’s size looming over you as you approach it. The lakes and canals in game dry up in the hot season and then fill back up in the rain and storm season. All of this is exceptional attention to detail, and its brought to life with amazing graphics. The city of Guanajuato is also reproduced pretty well, with great recreations of its historic landmarks, streets and tunnels. A plus work all around in the graphics department.The game sounds just as great as it looks as well. The cars sound great, and when you change their engines or exhausts, that change is reflected in game as well. That is great attention to detail and a massive improvement on Horizon 4’s stock car sounds. The game’s soundtrack is good. I’ve already found a few new favorites, though you mileage might vary on this. Forza Horizon 5 is one of the greatest racing games I’ve played and certainly a top contender for best game of 2021. If you’re a fan of any sort of racing game, you’re gonna have a fun time playing this. Even at full price, this game is worth every penny."

It's hard to describe, although the steering in the game takes a little getting used to. I'm used to the way NFS plays, but it's kind of refreshing with this one, and the amount of cars is a bit insane. Beware the auction house, don't put a low starting bid on an expensive car, there are a ton of people lowballing players with auctions waiting for the last second buyout bid, learned the hard way, so if you have a million pound car don't put it up with a 40k start off, there's a good chance you'll only get 40k or 39k after they take their fee's out. I don't mind since i'll be leaving Forza soon, just letting you know :) Bids can't be cancelled, so once a bid starts you can't stop it, and don't start with a low bid unless the car isn't worth much. Later gaterz I sold some cars today and can't get what they sold for due to some error? Jesus guys, you've been around forever, the bugs still exist? I'm fanboying again . . .

328,BrianH1988,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BrianH1988/,11,,0,84.6,December,"10,","3,879",6,1,"For the record: I bought the Ultimate Edition. I have all prior games with all prior expansions/DLC for Forza Horizon, and almost everything going all the way back to Forza 2 on that side. I am massive, massive Forza fan and it's likely someone playing one of these for the first time may not even be able to associate some of these as issues, what with the game industry just generally being as unacceptably bankrupt with product launch and post-game support as it has been lately. I want to make it abundantly clear before the rest of this kicks off: I believe they can fix or at least remedy most if not all of the problems with this game... given a few months' time and a lot of elbow grease, though there may potentially be some things they just cannot patch out as issues- namely the current iteration of the driveatar system, or complete lack thereof, and what they appear to have replaced 16 years of Turn 10's work with.Because I'm going to be so harsh on it after this, let me point out some serious positives to this game first. Amazing world design overall, up there if not outright matching that of Forza Horizon 3 while adding the wrinkles of seasons from Forza Horizon 4. Graphically masterpiece-tier. The raytracing reflections on the car running on my 1080 make the cars look closer to what they did in Forza 7- like cars rather than overglossy plastic. I couldn't bring myself to play with it off, even with the performance hiccups it might be bringing- it was too integral to the feel of the game. Fantastically executed. The world, too, feels like a living, breathing place. Sandstorms will kick up in the dry season (in weird places, mind, and sadly do not affect physics or handling that much). Most of the map transforms into a slick during the wet season, and the mists that swirl in the swamp can and will give way to random bouts of fog. This game, for all its faults, is still without question a technical triumph on what they've put together (don't conflate this with smooth performance, more on that later). I recommend going to see Digital Foundry's video on optimized settings for FH5. I was able to get it to run at 50-60 on a GTX 1080 with those, for what metric that may be worth (I also run a setup with four 1080P monitors and it was running on one of those, so take that with a slight grain of salt).This game has also now beaten the desire straight out of me to play it until they fix some of the more glaring issues. Between the patch on the 3rd of December, and what immediately seems like they've completely dropped the work Turn 10 has done on the driveatar system to have a unique selling point... They have instead replaced the built up AI behavior, and just made what you're racing against based on replays which I can only assume they intend to use machine learning on (which on all difficulties are sped up). It's intensely annoying to race against, and takes me out of the experience so often.Graphically the game is a marvel... but you're going to drop well below 60 regularly even on a GTX 1080 because they omitted some very essential optimization features, not least of which is the intensive and GPU consuming process of cloud generation. There are no options for that, it thinks my monitor runs at 59 hertz and does not give me an option to force 60 for proper VSync to function, and on top of that, as Digtal Foundry has noted in their optimized settings guide, the VSync option provided will give you a fairly decent-sized performance hit regardless of system, and you're better off just turning on VSync in your graphic's card's control panel. The result is a game that cannot run smoothly even above natural refresh rate and literally required the game ready drivers or better to not be a total performance mess (bizarre thing I'm not sure how many have run into: at one point I had 3-5 crashes an hour, I was never able to track down a reason, it just... stopped at one point during my last week with the game). Give it, at minimum, a few months, I'd argue. Right now it's not the refined experience you expect if you've played a prior entry (even from the relatively jank launches this side franchise has had compared to the main Forza's titles), and doesn't even have many of the options and features of the prior entry that were there at launch. Whether you can look past these issues or not... do your research a little, because unfortunately, a text review cannot exemplify most of the problems this game has very aptly, nor are you guaranteed to have anywhere near the same experience as I did. As always, your mileage will vary.And thus, the condition of this thing smarts, and it smarts hard. It smarts that higher difficulties literally play out like sped up replays that have been spliced together. It smarts that the AI gets a massive head start and rubber bands like there was no conception of time in the game. It smarts that the AI completely ignores the laws of physics you must obey in accordance to these replays, breaking my immersion in the only way I have to engage with it much while I have no patience for the netcode. It smarts that there's so much good... hindered by so many issues. To the devs: Please fix, I'll wait. When you're charging $100 for the full product ahead of time, your fans deserve better than what you have delivered, and we have come to expect far better than what you have delivered on PC already from the past two games. Do us a solid and bring back the driveatar system, if it's even possible. It was a far better solution than this... thing... you've hackneyed together to replace it."

They're able to accelerate faster than the players vehicle (even when In the same vehicle). I finished a race that had a large jump at the end and I was several car lengths ahead, after the jump I lost all momentum but the 3 AI behind me didn't and shot past me. I rewound several times and couldn't escape the momentum loss. IMO this is a major issue that needs to be addressed, because it will cause you to lose a race even if you're clearly in the lead.Edit: looks like the original issue was fixed in a patch...but as much as it hurts I have to keep the review as a ""do not recommend.""The game is constantly ""trying to connect"" to online servers. Its safe to say that they're broken at this point. Please stop spamming me with that message. Continuing, when connecting and disconnecting there's about a 10% chance that you lose all of your momentum. In free roam its mildly annoying, in a race it causes you to lose the race. I blame the bean-counters for the server issues. C'mon guys.Week later update: Servers seem to be fixed and the AI seem to be fixed. So I'm throwing it to a recommend now."

Everything is basically the same with some improvements. Online has the same issues as FH4 had. You have to wait 10+ minutes to join the race.I`ve bought premium edition and the bonuses for VIP doesn`t work (or at least you can`t see it).On top of that there are a lot of bugs:- Lot`s of crashes- Constant disconnects from online- Unable to join friend's lobbies- Friends/Players vanishing in front of you- Sudden stops during race as if there is a wall in frony of you• Buggy textures (yesterday all of the buidings for me kept vanishing when i was near them)I like it because i enjoyed FH4 (also new car sounds are incredible) but i expected a lot more for the 100 USD edition gameDon`t buy it right now.

338,Volvith,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Volvith/,11,1,0,157.4,September,"4,",159,0,1,"After about 120 hours of playing, i feel like i'm finally at a point where i can definitively speak my mind.This game is fun, but i wouldn't call it a racing game so much as an arcade game.So, if i enjoyed it, why don't i recommend the game?...Well, as much as i love FH5, Most of it boils down to 2 things, the developers ignoring this community and our feedback almost entirely, and the AI in this game cheating.The AI cheats to the point of not adhering to the same laws of physics, them basically running along a train-track rather than driving on a road, and player-tethering where if an AI is close enough to the player, it will pretty much 1:1 match the performance of whatever car the player is driving.The latter is pretty blatant by itself, where if you get close enough to second place if driving in first, and then start charging as hard as you can, there will be a 10 second gap between 2nd place and 3rd, and maybe half a second between you and number 2.But worse is the physics problem.Cars drive (clip) through terrain in jumps, aren't affected by conventional slow-downs, have virtually infinite traction and are only affected by traction when the player bumps into them, and even then it feels like they have a literal ton of downforce front and back.The online games aren't much better, with cheaters running pretty much unchecked in this game.You'll have a battle-royale arcade section of the game, where you'll see players just speedhacking the game.Most of the leaderboards are populated by times that even Tool Assisted Runs couldn't replicate; Blatant cheating.So far there's been very little response by the devs, and seeing as it's been a long time, i don't see this changing.So both online and AI driving are pretty much broken to a point.Of course you can still decrease the offline difficulty to highly skilled or below (expert, pro and unbeatable are impossible to beat depending on the race type), so that's something at least...But we still got the story mode right?...There is an option to mute speech in this game, under the audio settings.If you decide to buy this game, disable all speech.This is by far the worst dialoge i have ever heard in a game, with the story missions and races being so loosely tied together, they barely even fit in the festival theme of Forza Horizon most of the time.The voice acting is somwhere between 'california karen' and 'what's up hip gamer guys'.This is a personal opinion, and you might have less problems with this than i did, so take this point with a grain of salt.Which brings me to the final point: Repetition.This game is a lot of fun, for about the first 20 hours.After that, it feels like an achievement grind with little to no reward.Many of the cars sound and perform the same, maybe with a little bit more torque here, and a slightly higher maximum speed there, but it'll start feeling like you're driving reskins pretty early on.And with 700 cars in the game, there's a lot of reskins.I could go on and on about this game.There's some things i love, the racing, the freedom, the scale and diversity of the map...But it just gets overshadowed by all the problems this game has.It's a grind in all the worst ways, with none of the reward.I can't in good conscience recommend Forza Horizon 5.When it isn't infuriating, this game can be fun, but it stopped being rewarding to play a long time ago for me.I want to love this game, but with all it's flaws, and with the developers' seeming lack of care, i can't.So my final verdict is to advice you to not buy this game.There's too many problems that will never get fixed, and more problems that are introduced from 'fixes'.And with the experience-ruining cheating of AI and online players alike... I want to love this game, but at every turn, at every corner and straight, it's trying it's hardest to make me hate it.If you're looking for a rewarding racing game, keep looking.This is the Skyrim of racing games, without any of the mod support that made Skyrim what it was."

Graphics, handling, map size, customizations, car variety and more.Not only have they rehauled the graphics making it look even more impressive and gorgeous than ever before but the maps drastic size is something to really behold. You’re able to race in the dry desert, to ruins in the lost jungle, to the snowy mountains, to the beautiful coast and beaches and then all the way to an erupting volcano. They have you racing through hurricanes, sand storms, going through rivers and waterfalls. I mean, the experiences this game has are endless. Bomb soundtrack, a more casual than competitive multiplayer, and car tuning (as always) oh and don’t forget anime liveries, tons and tons of anime liveries XD. All of these things will keep the longevity of this game alive for a while. The only small issue I have is they took away body kits that other cars had in the previous titles. They still have them for some cars but cars that had them before don’t have them this time.

As a bonus if you are not in to painting your nails as there is a collaboration between OPI and Forza to which you get a Ford GT with a fade pattern, nothing special right? wrong.These cars are tagged as ""DLC"" meaning you can not trade them, You can not buy them of the Auction house without already owning them prior but you can sell them on the Auction house for fellow owners to replace the ones they sold...The game also has Raytracing support....... In Forzavista onlySome of the vehicle models are ripped from the previous games as their License plates still use FH3/FH4's styleVehicle modifications have always been lacking even removing some isn't new like the 458 had a Liberty walk kit back in Horizon 3 but was removed most likely because of Ferrari not liking modifications being made to their cars but removing previous wide body kits from cars such as the '95 RX-7? That is right, in FH3  the RX-7 had the Rocket bunny kit as a widebody option, FH4 added ""The Boss"" variant to the list now in FH5 no more Rocket bunny but now we have the TCP Magic time attack body kits though are very nice widebody kits it doesn't change the fact that we still have 2 options for that carIn short.

The AI is really not great, it feels like they're cheating and in general the balancing is horrible. With some missions it's the easiest to become first or get 3 stars and with others it seems impossible. It feels like they did not test some of the missions themselves because they're ridiculous to complete sometimes. The Horizon Arcade concept is horrible because most of the time you don't have anyone participating, making it impossible to complete it and then it starts off with ""Drive 7km to the zone where the actual thing is happening."" They really need to rework this system. Other than that I've been having so much fun with FH5. This is my first Forza Horizon so I can't really compare it to the others but I've been definitely enjoying making the missions, doing races with friends or just creating good cars and nice liveries."

370,Jaxon_da_Bac,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BACnumber1/,17,3,0,199.1,September,"16,",143,5,1,"I adore this game but I can't recommend it for full price. It lacks too much to be worth the price. Big word vomit warning: I did not edit this very much it's all just a passionate word vomit. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive, all aspects of it are stumped in some way. Such as online events. The map while being big is also very boring in my opinion. There aren't any cities it's mostly just wilderness. While the wilderness looks good graphically, none of it wowed me aesthetically so the surroundings got boring after a while. The races in this game get very repetitive. There is very little variation in tracks they all kinda do the same thing. The only saving grace is the publicly posted races. I have so many nitpicks about poor game design I could write a list of 100. It's baffling. Like for instance half the road races are ""street races"" which is just another word for filler races. They just made half their races take place with ai traffic and pretended it was totally different when in reality all it does is give half the road races an extremely annoying ""feature"". This has me writing off half the road races as useless because of how frustrating it is to drive into the traffic and random crashes from the other ai cars. Also, half the races are dirt races which is okay but the vast majority of players play for road racing so it feels kind of a waste. All these factors make the races feel repetitive and unvaried. Which is a shame because the actual feel of the cars is really good. Another issue I have is that there is no form of progression in the game. It's basically just capitalism, grind for money, buy all the cars, that's it. That's the endgame. The ""story"" has you doing random events untill you unlock all the races after less than 20 hours of gameplay. It's really dumb. Truthfully some of the special events are fun and have you driving cool cars and even a parade float with a V8, but none of this stuff is very challenging. You just hold the accelerator and go forward until you achieve the scripted win. These special events are just made to be ""eye-candy"". Fun to look at and experience but shallow gameplay beyond that. Which brings me to the game in general. It was not made to be played for more than 50 hours, which is a shame given the insane price tag. It's all ""eye-candy"" for the mainstream audience. The game looks really good while maintaining very accessible performance. My system easily handles 120fps on high preset with an rx 6600 xt and i5-10400F (for anyone who knows what that means). For a game that realistically doesnt need more than 30fps this is very impressive. However I hardly call this a selling point, I wouldn't spend this much money on a dedicated impressive performance-graphics display. Along with this and the extremely repetitive gameplay that doesn't keep racing game and forza fans in mind, makes me feel left behind. Since the game makes for good ""eye-candy"" I spent most of my time listening to my own music or a podcast while I play just so that I can turn my brain off and listen. It's a good game for doing that, but again, not for the pricetag. The whole game was clearly made for people to waste money on, just to see the graphics and lots of cars and only play for like 20 hours. Plenty of my friends, forza fans btw, have bought the game, played it a bit to finish the story and get the cars they like, and then slowly got bored. The gameplay simply has no hook to keep people interested. It feels like another bloated racing game by a triple A company. For my final point, a subjective one, the Atmosphere is disappointing. The music for instance, is representative of my last point. It's not very good forza fans seem to agree. I've seen reviews from people who thought FH4's music was better, at least for the drum and bass music, which is a real shame because many people really love the drum and bass radio in FH4. My personal experience goes way back to FH1 which NAILS atmosphere to a tee. The music in that game makes the experience feel like a 2000's dance party. The whole thing has the proper energy it needed to stand out as a new racing game. Awesome music was essential because the Horizon Festival was a music/car festival with people visiting for cars and beats, and the hit soundtrack was representative of that. People who were fans of bass arena back in FH1 now find themselves disappointed in the new music, me especially. Go listen to the FH1 bass arena soundtrack yourself, it oozes with personality. Whereas the new soundtrack is filled with new pop hits, old rock scores, and lame ""bass"". Again very subjective but I think it kinda sucks lol. The atmosphere is lacking in general especially with the lack of a story. FH1 had funny memorable characters and a world you wished you lived in, while FH5 provides a cookie cutter world that simply exists to be the place you race in. Outside of the quirky mexican events the personality is lacking and I expect more from such a big publisher. The one good thing I need to mention before I'm done is that the gameplay is still 100 times better than NFS in my opinion even though I've been a big Need for Speed fan in the past, their gameplay is unrealistic and bizzare these days especially with their terrible ""drifting"". Eughhh... No don't get NFS they're too far gone. I got a PC just because all the racing games sucked on PlayStation. Except for the new Gran Turismo, but it's too late to go back now lol. Okay I'm done. Mid game overpriced. Go back to your roots playground games and turn 10. Wow me again like you did 10 years ago. Stop pumping out this cookie cutter open world racer nonesense."

378,coyotes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/001/,35,7,0,139.9,June,"13,",976,17,1,"this game kind of sucks man!The biggest problem for me is the voice acting and writing is so terrible it pains me; and I can especially say this because no matter what I tried, I couldn't get the voice dialogue audio slider to work and this is a problem I've seen others complain about too (and most can fix it by just setting it to 1 instead of 0, but that still made no change for me, mine was 100 volume no matter what I did). For 140 hours, I have had to hear the Mexican characters in the game (the very few the game ACTUALLY has) speak 3 words of English then throw in a random Spanish word in every sentence. It is so damn corny it makes me believe everyone that was in charge of the writing and dialogue for this game only speaks 1 language because no bilingual person in existence speaks by throwing in words from a different language in the middle of their sentences. This alone has ruined the experience for me because of how unbelievably out of touch it feels and almost racist with some of the stereotypes that are thrown in at times. Now I wouldn't complain about this so much if the VOLUME SLIDER FOR THE VOICE LINES ACTUALLY WORKED LIKE IT WAS SUPPOSED TO- But I digressNow beyond the horrific dumpster fire that is the game's voice acting and writing; there are many other issues with the game that I never experienced once in Forza Horizon 4, which I have at least double the amount of time playing. Some other examples of issues I've experienced in only 140 hours of gameplay:- Online matchmaking very often would have issues pulling me in, I would sit around waiting for the queue and it would say that it's pulling me into a game and it was really a 50/50 on if I would actually end up in the session or not.- Multiple times have I completed a seasonal events / challenges and not received the rewards for it, such as super wheelspins, cars as rewards, etc. Because of this, I never tried to finish an entire series (4 seasons) or complete more than 2 seasons in their entirety.- There is 1 barn find in my game that is completely glitched and constantly resets its progress. Every other barn find was completed within 1-3 days, but the last barn find I have in the game has had its progress reset over and over, and after well over 3 months of playing the game, it has not progressed any further. Of course, I can pay to have the restoration completed for 45,000,000+ credits, but that is an unbelievable amount of in-game currency for something that I'm supposed to get for free. I was intending on trying to get 100% of the achievements in this game but because of this bug, I'll never be able to get the last barn find and get the achievement for completing all of them.- Speaking of achievements, there has been multiple times that i unlocked an achievement much before it was actually completed. as an example, i unlocked the achievement for driving all roads in the game when i still had about 10 more to complete.A lot of these issues are things that should've been noticed during original playtesting and never should've made it to the public. These are things I never once experienced in 4, and it really feels like this game could've used just another 6 months of polish before its release. Now if I wanted to be REALLY picky, here are some other issues I feel were overlooked that I've noticed in my playtime:- While you're in menus, you can't press up at the top of the menu to go to the very bottom, and vise versa. There are many, many instances in this game where you have to press down or up 20 times instead of pressing it once to end up on the opposite end of the menu (or you let go of your controller to use your mouse to click on something). This should never be a problem in any video game nowadays.- Every single leaderboard in the game is ENTIRELY FILLED with cheaters. The Forza devs will find time to fix and nerf legitimate methods people use for XP and credit farming, and will fix any fun glitches that people find, but they can't clear the leaderboards of people CHEATING and going 500,000 miles per hour. Also cheats that have existed since day 0 still work perfectly and it doesn't seem like anyone has ever been banned for cheating either. This makes where their priorities lie very transparent.- This one is very picky I will admit, but there's easily 100+ trees and objects I saw in-game that were floating off the ground. They use the same models copy and pasted throughout many parts of the map that don't work on the terrain that they're being placed on, so many times trees are just completely floating in the air, I've seen XP boards floating, I've seen plants and bushes floating, buildings, etc. I understand how crunched the devs probably were during the development of this game though so this is a very small thing but it really shows the lack of polish this game had before release.Even though I do have a lot of playtime in this game I don't believe it was worth the full $60 I paid for it- especially when it's on Xbox game pass and you can basically get all the enjoyment out of this game in a 1 month subscription (and get plenty of other games to enjoy once your interest in this game drops off like a cliff, as it did for me many months ago!)OVERALL: This game is a 3/10 when you're using your brain, a 6/10 if you have no brain inside your head and perform no critical thinking while you're playing it, and 9/10 when you're extremely drunk."

For my case, the game's foliage (you know, the stuff that fills 60-80% of your screen) now looks like it was meant to. To me, the game is no longer the eye sore it once was. TAA isn't perfect, but it fixes the most glaring issues and makes this game look amazing. I'll feel confident moving this to ""recommended"" once they fix the broken online experience as well as the broken weekly events. Update #2 (6/14/22): I can't believe this game is still in the state it's in. Regular crashes, buggy online code, almost non-existent AA, and foliage looks like it's rendered in 480p. What a ♥♥♥♥-show.Update: A month in and I still say FH5 is a hard pass. Buggy and low-res textures are still commonplace on some screen ratios. The online experience is a tangled mess. Stutters, freezes, locks - it's all still there if not worse. Only thing keeping me in is to stay on top of the weekly rewards, but it's not easy. The left over code and assets from FH4 makes this feel like a bloated DLC, not a proper sequel. Development on this just feels lazy and more cracks are showing each day.The core game is fun (when it works), but I'd recommend holding off until they iron out the laundry list of bugs and broken graphics.

Also the amount of different cars is really awesome. There is a lot of variety especially as you can tune every car in many different ways! The sounds have been improved a LOT since Forza Horizon 4. Some cars are literally giving me an eargasm. Overall it feels very atmospheric, especially in the interiors aswell!The tuning - this has seen a not too crazy but yet still very good improvement from the last Horizon game. You can tune every car in multiple ways & really make it suit your personal driving style. Also visual tuning, with bodykits etc. aswell as the whole tuning menu have been revised and improved. The selection of rims is great, however many rims are not something I would ever put on a car myself. But there are enough for everybody to like. The fine tuning menu has stayed the same, you can put some time in there to really make your car feel better as always. It is great how it is!The map - oh the map! The size of it is just absolutely amazing! It really takes some time to go from one coast to the other. The variety with the map is purely awesome; you have a really big desert, a giant volcano, a huge jungle and a mysterious mountain area aswell as some fields. There are so many different vibes on this map that it takes ages to explore everything fully! There is a huge area of offroading space too! You can go whereever you feel like going. You want to be in a rainforest but are in the middle of a desert or on top of a gigantic volcano looking over the whole map and beyond? No problem! Just get on the long highway which is MUCH better and more fun than the last one and within a few kilometers you're in the middle of the jungle.The story, missions & exploration - is what is really fun about Forza. You can either just drive around and enjoy the vibe, or just do some PR stunts and try to beat your friends and make your way up the leaderboards. The whole progression system has been revised with category levels for street races etc. have been removed and you are collecting acolade points instead. You can fully decide what event you want to unlock next! There are multiple Horizon Events just like in Horizon 3 again which is great too! Also there are buyable player houses like introduced in Horizon 4 again. There is a lot to unlock and many story races aswell as Horizon Stories to complete. It's not too hard to 3 star them, but it also ain't the easiest thing to do. Overall you will have to take some time in order to complete every achievement etc.The ai has been improved a damn ton, as unbeatable ai really is unbeatable now. The highest I was able to beat so far is the 2nd highest one.Early connection issues and bugs - there are however a few issues and bugs with the game yet to be fixed. No game is perfect; especially not at release. We don't expect that and it is normal for issues to occure. At the early access release we had big connection issues, which were solved after around a day. Now with the release of the standard version they are back again. I expect them to be fully fixed again in 1-2 days tho. A few other bugs including abusing electric engines to gain massive amounts of hp & speeds can also be found.I don't think anybody read all of this but if you did, congratulations and now go and buy this game! There is a lot more to explore than I could fit into this review. Go & find out what it is!It's a great game, solo or with your friends! :)"

Past that, the CPU tends to cheat and give itself speed boosts past the fastest possible speed you can go and takes corners without breaking. I did a race and my time was top 500 at the time, and the CPU put a time that was 8 seconds faster than the #1 time. Not to mention the PVP is boring as all hell. People ram into rather than actually trying to race, even when it's a TEAM EVENT VS BOTS. At this point I'm using the game as a glorified drift sim"

Let's talk Horizon 5.First things first, if you enjoyed Forza Horizon 4 you will enjoy this title as well.Horizon 5 is easily the best racing game available on PC at the moment but it has its issues and it has a lot of them. Some are minor and some are pretty huge.I had my review ready when the game was released. I hold off posting this review because I wanted to give developers some time to fix some of the stuff. Nothing has been done so far. In fact, the number of issues has grown. It's absurd.  A full list of cross-platform and PC-only issues is at the end of the review. The list is HUGE. EDIT: The list is so big Steam says my review is 13, 264 characters too long so I will post a list of Steam related issues only.I got in four days early and put around 40+ hours into the game in four days. Now, a week later, I have only 67 hours of playtime. Why?Connectivity issues. I had this in my ""early access"" period as well but it wasn't as bad and I thought it would be addressed and fixed by the time the game was released. I was wrong. It has gotten so bad I have not been able to play online AT ALL. As soon as I start up the game I get disconnected. I might be able to stay connected for five seconds maximum and it has been like that for the past 7 days at least. It has been frustrating.EDIT: It has now been 17 days since I was able to connect to ForzaLife (online). I've tried around 10 different fixes, the game has patched itself 2-3 times and each time they have claimed to fix the connectivity issue but it's all just lies. Nothing works. Beware!Why am I giving this game a positive review? Because it's still fun to play solo and it has hundreds of hours of singleplayer content in it. Just be warned: As of now singleplayer might be the only thing you are able to do and that includes not being able to do seasonal objectives and unlocking cars in those seasons.Alright. That's out of the way so let's get to what I originally wrote about Forza Horizon 5:If you're new to the Forza franchise then Horizon is the more arcade-y spin-off of Forza Motorsport. Motorsport is a proper sim-cade/sim racer depending on how you want to play it.Horizon is an open-world arcade racer where you can do whatever you want and progress however you want. Now when I say it's an arcade racer, it is, but it's also important to knowthat you can turn off all the assists, turn on realistic damage, set the AI to the impossible difficulty, and enjoy a more sim-like experience.The Horizon series offers you everything you would want in a racing game: Car tuning, upgrading, and customization, a huge open-world map with different areas to free roam in, all kinds of different race types from drag and street racing to off-road dirt racing and user-made custom tracks. Oh, I should also mention there are quite a few different radio stations available to almost every kind of taste... Almost. The rock radio station is a bit lacking and plays more pop/pop-rock songs than actual rock tracks but it's still pretty decent.Car selection is bigger than ever as well. Forza Horizon 5 launched with 534 different cars with many more on the way. Yes, it's true Horizon 4 had over 700 cars in the end but that's with all the expansions and updates. Let me remind you that Forza Horizon 4 launched with just over 400-450 cars so give Horizon 5 a little bit more time and we will eventually have even more vehicles available than in the predecessor.Now let's talk about the online portion of the game a little bit.Forza Horizon 5 is a great singleplayer game with tons of content but there is also a huge load of co-op and multiplayer content on offer.Every race you see on your world map can be played in an online co-op with your friends but you can simply queue for player vs AI co-op races as well.On the competitive side we have the ""Eliminator"" which is a battle royale with cars, your usual casual and ranked street, dirt, and other races, and a playground in which two teams of players compete against each other in zombie modes, capture the flag and a few other modes.The open-world map also has ""arcade"" events in which players either have to drift or do other kinds of stunts to rack up scores together and earn Forzathon Points. Forzathon Points  can be spent on cars in an online Forzathon Shop. The shop is currently unavaible.Now talking of online, I actually have a couple of issues with it. Actually, one issue to be perfectly honest. You can choose to roam your map in solo mode or online mode, in which you see other players drive around and join the open-world arcade events that appear on the map from time to time. Now the issue with this is that I've had quite a lot of problems.The first 5 hours were hell for me. I got disconnected several times in a minute. In ONE MINUTE! The issue is not on my side. My internet connection is solid. It has gotten better but I'm still experiencing connectivity issues so beware of that.That's my only issue so far. Other than that the game is great. The performance? Absolutely brilliant? The game runs at a solid 100 frames per second with every setting maxed out and at 1440p. RTX 2080 super, i9-10900K, 32GB RAM, and with this hardware getting 100 fps at 1440p with every setting on extreme/ultra I can't complain. Runs better than I expected and the game is a real eye candy.I have experienced some graphical glitches here and there but nothing serious so they have not bothered me at all.Definitely worth the full price! Next season will have the DeLorean as one of the seasonal awards so hop on board, get driving, and enjoy the festival with crazy cars, crazier people, and even crazier stunts!STEAM Related Issues     Players may be experiencing performance degradation after extended time playing due to memory issues    There are flickering water reflections on low spec PC with AMD graphics card    Car dials have a ""white-ish"" texture and are blurred when car is moving on AMD card with integrated Radeon graphics    PC - While using 'Alt+Enter' combination the Title still reads 'Enter' button as an input    Upon changing hardware the game doesn't ask you if you want to re-run the graphics setup.

A lot of the same cars make a come-back from FH4, but that doesn't make it repetitive. For sure, more (new) cars are needed, but overall with stunning visuals (if you can activate Ray-tracing) an excellent soundtrack, and the same good-old gameplay that made FH4 so adictive, Forza Horizon 5 is an easy recommendation for any casual arcade drivers, or anyone that want a close to life driving experience."

It stopped being fun a while ago, but I continued to push on hoping for something that'll keep me going.Haven't touched the game in nearly a month, and I intend to keep it that way. I've put just a little over 200 hours into the game, and that's probably enough for me. I've already beat the four or five Horizon tours and some of the Horizon Stories but there's just no real drive to keep playing.And I'm not the only one- When it launched on Steam over 80,000 people played it. Now it averages about ~6,500 players not even 7 months later. Not to mention the litany of glitches and bugs that plagued the game at the beginning that scared off potentially new players.Honestly, the only thing this game makes me want to do is play older Forza titles. Because this just doesn't work for me anymore. Unless they manage to pull off something major that'll suck me back in, this'll remain uninstalled on my PC."

Shame on them for that one and shame on me for still financially supporting them.Now that being said, Forza is still by far the best non-sim racing game and it's not close. The driving and physics in FH5 are great, the car selection is solid (although there's some MAJOR omissions from FH4, including the entirety of Lancia and Alfa Romeo and many Lotuses which was extremely disappointing). The map has good driving roads though I do not find it anywhere near as aesthetically pleasing as 2's or even 3's. What's absolutely dreadful about this game is the supporting cast/NPCs. They have the worst dialogue, maybe in all of gaming history. It's torture to listen to them.Overall if you like racing games you will like FH5. However I wouldn't recommend it over its predecessor since it doesn't change enough things and it has an inferior car list overall - or so I'd say but FH5 finally added the greatest car, the XJR-15..."
402,DirtyEagle56,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DirtyEagle56/,7,,0,7.6,January,22,79,0,1,"Definitely not what I would want from a racing game. You receive tons of cars for free including the best car within the first couple of hours of game play, you receive tons of free currency for again doing almost nothing. My ideal game model would be to earn everything you receive i. e. save up for a favorite car from grinding and winning tough races. Instead the races are very easy to win, the ai seem to be easy to beat and won't try hard to pass you up if you make a mistake. Overall there are some things I like (the open world, customization, amount of cars to buy) but those things are ruined by the structure of the game and how you are rewarded (from lottery wheel spins for existing)."

I bought it right away.Forza Horizon 5 is a blast. It has a great variety of activities to do. It has an awesome number of options for driving that let you play a very arcadey game or a very simulationist one. And the cars. Oh my goodness. There are so many cars in the game. 535 apparently. The game hands you cars left and right. And I love putting anime skins on them and rolling around honking at other players with a musical horn. And I can race with my buddies!

The koop mechanic isn't balanced, doesn't make any sense and fun get's constantly ruined, because one driving error (or a NPC rams you off the street) results in driving way behind with no chance of making places again. Not to mention minor issues...3. WorldThe world ist extremely beautiful, even with low settings. And its gigantic and really divers. 4. InnovationsThe game adds some great features like drifting tires and transmissions, but its mostly the old game in a new world. Again there are a lot of cars to collect.5. Driving experienceThe cars feel good on every terrain. The difficulty on asphalt got a bit more difficult. The races are nice, the really long ones like the Goliath and Colossus are extremely fun and way better than in the old game.The tuning and customization are like in the old game.6. Racing experienceAfter you've seen everything, it becomes boring. The AI always acts the same. Either you carve through them at the beginning or they hold their lead no matter how good you drive or how you spec your car. Once you are in the lead, they fall back and they drive in one collumn behind you. They won't come back and won't fight with you. They don't seem to have any advantages or disadvantages. So if you spec your car for one specific perk, they will always match you in that regard and be better than you in the area, you have a drawback. So after the start you have to hurry and then you either loose after a boring race or you win after a boring race.7. FazitThe game would be really good, if it wouldn't have so many problems and become so boring.In singleplayer with a high end pc its great, with an a few years older PC its most of the time okay.In Coop it's not enjoyable."

Fortunately, Forza is back for some time. I will say straight to the point if you like Forza Horizon 4, you will certainly enjoy 5. During my almost ten hours on early access, the game was engaging, more than most racing games that were released in the past few years. - As always, Forza has a neat selection of cars to pick from. At launch, we have the choice to pick over 500 Cars!- Bigger map, bigger exploration! I always admire Mexico, the culture, the atmosphere, I'm biased to say this is my favorite location in the Forza Series aside from Australia.- New Sounds, handling improvements, the handling model too feels different but in a good way.- Graphical Improvements, weather effects, smoke effects.- A new fair addition to customizations, however, still not meeting NFS quality. - Connection Issues. Understanding the game is just released with a day zero patch, this will be addressed soon.- Lack of story (as expected) but brace for the cringe dialogue.- Lack of progression. I do like rewarding progression more, so everything is handed to you like previous titles.- Texture issues, map disappearing. However, this has been noticed and will be addressed.- Crashes, mostly GPU issue overheating. If you have a RX 5700XT I do have a workaround that may be a ((fix)). Please read below:Playground games cause a lot of stress for this card, for the people who have Black screens or Shutdowns in minutes of playing. I encourage you to look for Fan Curve Speeds and change it to 50% before playing the game. I went from 87C+ down to 73C and was able to play for hours straight with no problem. In my theory, the card does not cool down fast enough with factory settings as the game puts your card on 100% load instantly. If this does work for you, let me know, please. I mentioned this to a few people to try and has fixed their problems. these are the settings I tried and have fixed my Shutdown problems while playing a few minutes.Overall if you're looking for a decent Arcade-Sim, Forza Horizon is a nice pick. Though, I would also encourage you to try the game out on Gamepass if you're unsure as a demo. You do get a discount too as well for buying premium with it."

Leaderboards are filled with cheaters. Plenty of exploits to unlock all the cars and get stupid amounts of money. Frequent disconnects. Streets are empty and if you do occasionally find a car there is a good chance it will just fade out of existence right in front of you. AI blatantly cheats.If they had bothered to finish making the game before releasing it then it would have been a good game. Hopefully in a few months they'll have fixed the bugs. Until then the developers don't deserve your money.

Most of my time in FH5 is spent racing online or grinding rivals.Pros: handling model is great, graphics are stunning, and the map design is generally pretty good. Also Hot Wheels is pretty fun.But besides the pros listed above, this is yet another soulless cookie-cutter open-world racer. The map looks great yet feels empty and lifeless. The 'missions' are purely a waste of time. Characters are forgettable if not annoying at times. The car list is largely unchanged from previous Forza titles; the cars themselves lack detailed modeling and animating, and blatant errors somehow make their way past QA, such as mirrored textures or leftover placeholder textures. Online racing is lackluster and the ranked mode from FH4 has been removed for no reason.Overall, this may be a fine racing game for someone who doesn't particularly care about cars or the genre. However, it is a disappointing one for car enthusiasts and long-time Forza players with many core issues that are hard to address with their monthly updates."

Extremely low FPS, low GPU utilization, constant frame drops and stuttering. Running an 5900X + RX6800, 32 Gigs DDR4 3600 ram, all drivers up to date on top of a fresh installation. Game is allowed through firewall, etc. This game has had massive issues on PC since the start. For a while there, I was able to enjoy it, but in its current state, this game is unacceptable from such a major publisher. It's fantastic when it works, but just be wary of your own personal hardware and see how it runs for you. I assume I'm having issues simply because I decided to build an AMD PC this time around, rather than going Intel/Nvidia. Either way, I don't think I'll be buying any more Forza games for PC following the awful issues this one is plagued with. I should also mention that they still haven't fixed the constant disconnecting issues. It's nearly impossible to play with friends, which is the most fun part of Forza. You can't even run up and down the highway with the same players in a straight line without disconnecting. Between the constant performance issues and server issues, I can't recommend this game to anyone on PC. Sorry guys. This one is a swing and a miss. It's clear that it was meant for consoles and that PC was an after-thought."

Yeah it's similar to Forza Horizon 4 but it's not the same. The map it's huge and wonderful, 5 Horizon festival sites, over 500 cars and new songs. In over 40 hours in only 3 days I can say that the game is great and yes it has some bugs and glitches just like Forza Horizon 4 has(at least the Steam version).It has some disappointing features like the rendering stuff where everything I see on my screen which is far away instead of being rendered wonderfully, it looks garbage. Nothing even close to I dunno... Let's say Red Dead Redemption 2.Also the AI is way more difficult on higher difficulties than they were in Forza Horizon 4.On some high difficulties they use some ""upgraded cars"" which you can't even upgrade to those stats, for example the Ford Focus RS,I was only able to upgrade it up to S2950 and the AI had one at X999. The accolade feature is very similar to the progressing system we had in Forza Horizon 4 Lego DLC. It's not that much of a grind for 'em luckily tho. The PC port its good, not great but over time they will patch the game.For those wondering I used an RX 5700XT, a Ryzen 7 3700X 4.40GHz, 16GB DDR4 3000MHz RAM memory and I played in 1080P with MSAA off and beside that everything Maxed out. I also had the game installed on a HDD.I had in some points over  cities close to 60 and above, on the highway and other roads in the middle of nowhere 80fps and above. I didn't encountered any errors like game crashes or freezes but I did get a message saying that my 16GB RAM and 8GB of VRAM memory isn't enough. But that's all. And with that I said everything I can about the game and before I forget :Welcome to Mexico!"

Hands down it is the best arcade racing  game present. Playground Games did not risk to spoil the formula which brought success and cash to them in previous titles and without any serious rivals forcing them towards greater innovation they only added some new features to it . But this does not stop giving gamers the itch to play ""one more race"" in each playthrough.Here in FH5 you will be in Mexico which has a bigger and more colorful map with stunning vistas compared to FH4's ""a bit too sterile"" Britain . It is so huge and and there are overwhelming things to do, so many that the finish line of one race is likely quite close to the starting gate of another.  The map is positively littered with icons  -more than any Assassin's Creed game:)-  so filter will be your friend. -But still I can't help myself thinking Japan would be a better choice instead:)- Overall compared to FH4 the game looks better, sounds better. Apart from seasons now there are day/night changes, weather activites like sandstorms/tropical rain. You will not get bored easily since there will always be a lot of things to accomplish and game will steadily reward you for that forever.Keep in mind that this is an arcade racing game, it does not require a steep learning curve how to drive. If you want to exprerience a more serious racing sim you may go for Assetto Corsa or Project Cars instead. Yet still with lots of cars to unlock, nice setting and custimization options, fun activities and endless action FH5 is an open world racing dream for every player.Whether you are a racing fan or not you will like this game.Enjoy your ride.."

488,FueltheScar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FueltheScar/,11,,0,48.4,February,"19,",126,0,1,"I love FH4. Poured hundreds of hours into that game. Tuning, Racing, Drifting, Off-roading. I'd come on and complete every weekly competition to get the cars. It was amazing. This feels like a complete reversal of what FH4 was and still is. It honestly feels like a complete downgrade except newer cars, better sounds and graphics. That is where the only positives for this game are.To start off with, you are physically forced to do off-road and cross country races to progress. You can't just ignore them if you don't like them, you have to do it. Another thing, when you complete the acolade stage, you are forced to pick an acolade and goto where that is (a showcase race or new event area).Back in FH4, I honestly didn't mind the off-road and cross country races. They are not my favourite what so ever, but I did have fun with them when I did them. Not this game, what so ever. The tracks are complete ass, sharp corners then immediate jumps. Jumps that are so large, no matter what you do, your car bogs down however the AI is just fine. And to top it off with these races, the AI are absolutely insane with them. They can race around cross country races as if they are an F1 car on a race track! They don't worry about grip, traction, balance NOTHING; all while you are wrestling with your car to get around the corners and not go off the course. You do all this effort just for the AI to slam their break, turn in and pass you as if you are standing still. This isn't to do with difficulty, I play the entire game on expert/pro, yet when it comes to cross-country (due to the race being apart of the forzathon playlists to get a new car), the difficulty is Highly Skilled (around 1-2 difficulty notches down) and it feels like I am playing unbeatable drivatars (the top difficulty level). I have had to retry, rewind and redo each race numerous times. It just completely sucks the fun out of it.I mention all of this to not even cross onto the fact that this was all to unlock a 911 GT3RS, A FACTORY MADE TRACK RACING CAR. Why the hell should you do cross-country races for a car that is purely for track use! It' s completely irrelevant. All this does is force me to play races that I don't like and have tried my hardest to avoid just so I can unlock a car that is better for the races I DO LIKE.That was just the actual races and physics! I haven't even gone on about the numerous bugs, irritations and down-right rage-quitting issues!I will keep this one short as it is already long as it is.First: the on-screen narrator. No matter what I do, within Windows, within the game, the onscreen narrator will always start speaking whats on screen for the entire menu until you get into the game. There is no way to stop this, believe me, I have tried. It makes me immediately want to shut down the game, because the voice and the fact that it won't shut up is highly aggravating.Next: Force feedback on the wheel. It is a luck of the draw whether it decides to work or not. You can boot up the game, load in and wait all that time just to realise you can' t feel what the car is doing because the FFB doesn't exist (bearing in mind without it, the car feels like a weightless feather on ice). All of this leads to you restarting the game, multiple times, until it finally starts to work again. And as soon as you tab-out, there is a high likely-hood that the FFB will stop working again.After that: The constant resetting of my wheel setup. I don't have a clutch pedal, but I like using the clutch so I can drift. So to do so, I bind it to one of the buttons on my wheel, meaning I have to use a custom wheel profile. This is completely okay, I did that in FH4 and it was never an issue. The issue is that FH5 resets it back to default, every. damn. time. Every time I open the game, I have to go back into settings and set the mapping to Customer Wheel Controller #1. Finally: Something that is still not fixed, however not too bad, the fact that there are still graphical issues within the game. That being the glitching road textures. You could just be driving normally and then all of a sudden you pass through a stretch of road that is filled with rainbow colours. Not the car, not the grass, just the road. You could reboot the game, go back to the exact road and it will be gone. This isn't an issue with my graphics card or installation as i have checked both of these, however it is still jarring and does break any immersion or enjoyment.This is all just to say that with the numerous amount of bugs, I spend most of my time restarting, rebooting and remapping FH5 so that I can play it. This just leads to me not actually wanting to play the game anymore. It is the reason I have not played it as much as I have wanted to do. The hassle and faff just outweighs the fun that could be had."

Half of it with controller and the other with a G29 Sim Racing Wheel. So obviously I love that game. But after that much time you need a different experience and that is where Forza Horizon 5 falls short. Because Forza Horizon 5 IS Forza Horizon 4. It’s the same game. Im playing the same game again. The differences are like a FIFA game. Now for a Forza Horizon that doesn’t have to be necessarily a bad thing. Forza Horizon 4 was after all an almost 10/10 game. The only things that it had to improve was its sense of speed, proper spots for dirt rally on the map a GOOD CITY maybe some better mountains for more offroad fun, Hill and Downhill races. It also had a lot off small things like the shifting stile being a difficulty setting (very annoying with a wheel) and its rater suboptimal class system. But Forza 5 changes none of that.Actual significant changes Pros:Better sense of speed thangs to ssdMore realistic car feel (better weight feel)Better Force Feedback (Sim Wheels)Much better car soundsCons:Terrible and uncreative map when compared to Forza 4No seriously it ruins the gameA lot less cars than Forza 4 (for now at least)More bugs than cyberpunk (mostly coop related)Conclusion: When you play with a controller just play Forza Horizon 4. The Force Feedback doesn’t affect you and the weight feel doesn’t do all that much. The map is worth it. When you play with a wheel and you can’t get enough off Forza or never played 4 before than the Force Feedback might be worth it or you just play assetto corsa."

With an gigantic map that is full of twisting biomes and roads, it encapsulates a great and mesmerizing atmosphere of Mexico. Coming from past Forza games, the latest entry to the Horizon series is the best that Playground Games has churned out. The monumental changes to the lighting and particle effects are wonderful, the increased graphical fidelity and saturation of the world is great, and the new changes to how vehicles both handle and respond to the environment are perfect. The only ""but"" I would say is that, as of both pre-launch and after, the game has issues with crashing randomly when in a menu or trying to interact with the UI. I've also gotten into issues where I would get stuck into an endless online match search where I wouldn't be able to interact with the menu, but as far as I know, that issue has been resolved.

The pro :- Nice visuals- Enjoyable driving experience when alone on the roads- Love the designing tool (compared to The crew 2)- Love to be able to fine tune my car to my preference.The Cons- Grindy as hell- Nerf after nerf of the various ways to earn money- Some of the challenges are painfull, especially when having to compete against cheating AI.All in all, when played with friends (and the game keep in sync) it's nice and fun. Enough that I got 300 hours sunk into the game. So why the thumbs down ? Here is why :I did a 6 months break from the game, and decided I just wanted to take one of my car for a spin 2 days ago.I had the game using 100GB on my hard drive for the last 6 months, got the updates and all. But when I started it, reached the login to my Microsoft Xbox account, and then started the game, I got the nasty surprise to be presented with the Driver creation option and not being sent in my previous game.So here I am, 300 hours down the drain and having lost every singles of my achievements.After a bit of searching, I found out it's a common issue both on PC and console. A lot of players get corrupted save or error codes. In my situation I got nothing of such, no warning, no error code, just a complete reset of the user data save file.Now, after contacting the support I have to replay the Tutorial and reach the point that let a player go online. The very part I hate in every game who Gate the access to your friends through ""Tutorials"" and other mandatory things before you can join your friends online and can enjoy playing with them.Hate to have to do it a first time, or every single time a game decide you lost your datas (GTA 5, Dying Light, Forza Horizon 4 and 5).

I find it most fun to do private races with either slow, or moderately fast cars. I've personally found most S1+ class cars are too quick to even keep on the road, unless you like braking more than accelerating. I've found super slow cars like the 1926 Bugatti Type 35, and the 2010  Ford Crown Victoria are both super fun slow cars to race with. They're so slow you need to practice carrying as much speed around corners as possible. I feel it's a very fun change of pace from the hypercars you will see people driving normally. But if you don't like slow cars, I've found the 1988 Lamborghini Countache strikes a happy medium between fast and slow cars. It's moderately fast, and it has good handling. although it can sometimes suffer from understeer. It's honestly a blast to race it with your friends. I personally don't like the online racing with randoms. I feel it's nearly impossible to consistently do well unless you conform to the meta. Ontop of that, I've just found it's super sweaty and not super fun.TL;DR conclusion:it's a fun game to play with friends on xbone gaypass, but not worth it for full or sale price."

Played a bit of Forza Horizon 4 and enjoyed it a lot, and I have been super excited for the sequel to that game, which is this game, and it delivers. Amazing graphics as to be expected, but it's still just breathtaking to look at. This games open-world aspect is jam-packed with content, just race after race, and not just that, there are more than just your typical road racing which spices things up, and keeping it fresh for us the players, so we keep coming back for more. This game just fit every racing game play-style, You want to race and reach the top? go for it. You just want to drive around the map chilling whilst listening to your Spotify playlist? go for it. You want to create your own crazy wacky races? go for it. Love this game and I highly recommend it."

At this point I am level 117 and almost finished all horizon events on the map, raced in most of the races on the map and drove most of the coolest cars that this game has to offer, so I felt like it is a good time to leave this game a fair review ( at the given moment, as updates come out I will remove and re update my review with new information). Besides I am going through some problems with my secondary SSD which is problem at my end, so I wanted to post a review while my feeling from the game still not affected by anger nor disappointment. game is amazing but quick warning before we get to the review:Many people have low streaming bandwidth which freezes the game and crashes, I experienced it on my SSD which may be faulty and game now being tested on another drive ( will update the review later). But all I can say dev team already works on solution not to mention that I personally reported and contacted support 2 times and both times was greeted by real person who offered help and solutions. How about that? A game dev company that actually values their customers and lets a real person help them out. Some other companies should take good example! Convoy with friends doesn't work as expected, losing connection to each other, patch is in the progress scheduled for this week.Graphics: we will just leave it at that, they are incredible, I was actually very surprised that my i7-920, 18GB, 1070 G1 gaming GTX was automatically adjusted to Ultra settings and yes the game runs very good on 1080p resolutions, nearly perfect on 1080i. Extreme settings is when it starts having some FPS drops. Driving Physics: As someone who comes here from TDU games, the physics are very good. There is one downside to discuss down the review tho, but not here. Cars behave very realistically, understeer, oversteer, you gotta learn your braking zones, acceleration sensation is fantastic and high speeds really feel like high speeds. Your driving can be adjusted by ABS, traction Control, stability assist, and there is simulation mode which really ups the feeling up with cars behaving incredibly real. You can have fun with the simulation even with a keyboard as far as some of the assists are on and you at least half not stupid when it comes to driving. And you gonna love it (sorry, I had to) Customization and car selection: I was very happy that we didnt get spammed by bunch of new super cars, car selection is more than amazing. You have some old cars from the 90s and even 80s and even classic cars and muscle cars. Many of those can be engine swapped to racing I6 or racing V8 with 1000+ hp that will make it mad fun to drive. Ford has amazing line up in this game, you have Fiesta ST and Focus RS that can be turned into Rally cars, mustangs, amazing Trucks that easy turn into Baja beasts, or even new bronco that be swapped with a racing engine at 1400hp, top it off by Ken Blocks hoonigan Stang that probably one of my favorites car in the game with insane straight line performance and possibility to be driven at grip or drifting.There are a lot of old school and modern american sport muscle cars overall which really made it for me and nice older cars such older m5 and m3 and whats not....AMG ONE and VULCAN AMR are absolutely incredible, amazing demonstration of physics and grip around the corners. What a pleasure to drive!Everything can be customized, you can adjust your beasts to straight line performance, drifting or turn into real cornering race car. Wide body's that give huge grip bonus, or the other way around remove any aero and just rip it on the straights. or do a mix of both and than you really have to learn your car, its breaking zones and its limit on the corners. Map: if you coming from TDU 2, think of it as Ibiza on a whole new level. You have one long highway in the middle of the map where you can enjoy some top speed runs, than a lot of smaller roads around the map. But those roads really designed well, it is a mix of straights and corners where you have to constantly adapt as you drive and really get used to your car. The terrain is incredible, as you cruise around the map you go in the mountains, forest and desert, constantly climbing, speeding downhill or just enjoying the bends. On really fast car it takes about 15-20min to circle the map, but than you can keep circling vertically and through other roads. There is also a huge volcano with amazing hill climb section to get there that already occupied by ppl drifting there 24/7 and they are pretty good at it. Very fun to just watch em do it. The runways next to Horizon event in the deserts is already full with people challenging each other with drag builds. Online experience: any driver that is not on your convoy is a ghost for you. So yesss finally you cannot collide with each other yet you still see each other. Once you join the convoy you are no longer ghosted and up to 12 people can be in one convoy together. You can complete races in co-op, and you and your friends get rewarded no matter who was first who second, or you can go PVP vs other people. If you ramming during races you become ghosted for some time until you cool it down, and you wouldn't even be able to draft on the slipstream. Ai in races is nasty! It is very difficult to beat which makes it more fun. What is more fun AI will always match your car! So you can enjoy any type of race with any type of cars with opponents driving same equal cars.So with good things out of the way lets focus on the bad things:Some tuned are ridiculous and will easily allow cars to reach 500km\h or 300mph in ridiculous low amount of time...its fun but not as I would like to see it.Still connection issues for convoy, so the best solution is to co-op some long race after which you and your friends will stay with each other in the session even if you change cars...dont know why or how but it seems to work...Still some performance issues with the game , low streaming bandwith textures, freezes in the game, crashes. Hopefully get fixed this week as promised. A very impressive game, for a real car enthusiast to enjoy. That once gets fixed and patched will probably be perfect.Also, wanted to add the Horizon events races missions, are very creative and enjoyable. Also, the Baja races those did it for me. I am a circuit kind of a person, but maaan those Baja races are really take you to this Horizon atmosphere and maaaaad fun...."
528,CircuitMoon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/circuitmoon0772/,3,,1,329.9,November,"16,",115,3,1,"To put it simply, this is one of the best sim-arcade open world racers I've played, when it's not plagued by issues that's been haunting the Forza franchise for over 3 years now. I'll get into those points later on in this review. Let's begin on a positive note.The game is set in Mexico. It's not often you hear that especially if it's a AAA title like this one. Upon viewing the trailer for this game, I was worried about the map mainly focusing on dirt and off-road races. It was only when I played the game for myself that I began to understand the beauty of the map design in the game. To start with, there's a lot more variety in the map design and environment unlike Horizon 4. There's the massive straight line  to test out your car's top speed, the  which is the heart of Mexico, the , the , the  and a whole lot more. I could go on and on.There's even a proper Circuit in this game.The Race CIrcuits and Sprint races are also designed very well. It also helps that no two places feel similar in this map so all the tracks feel unique.In short, I feel like this is the single biggest upgrade FH5 has received apart from the Audio which I'll get to. It feels fresh after 3 full years in dark and cloudy Britain.  In this area, I am a bit disappointed as there's not a whole lot of new cars added but we have to keep in mind that this game already has over 520 cars and that number will only rise as new cars get added through updates. The cars are modeled to exceptional detail and look amazing when out in the streets of Mexico or in the Forzavista with Ray Tracing. I have no complaints regarding the level of detail on the already present cars.Coming to the Physics, it's still largely the same compared to Horizon 4. AWD is still just as overpowered as it was in FH4 and that's a bad thing as it reduces variety. RWD does 'sometimes' give you a slightly higher top speed but considering the fact that most races rely more on acceleration than top speed, there's absolutely no reason to use RWD if an AWD swap is available.I've noticed that the default tune most cars ship with when you buy them or upgrade them are better compared the FH4. They feel less slidey and are very usable. This is very helpful for the new player who doesn't know how to tune their cars just yet or in general, it makes tuning your cars an easier job.Some community tunes are still overpowered and/or glitched to completely break physics and it almost feels like you're playing a completely new game.Overall I'd say that the Physics in this game is good and is almost the exact same compared to FH4 which isn't necessarily a bad thing. As this is a sim-arcade (more towards the arcadish side) you cannot expect to have perfect 1:1 representation of tuning and simulation but for what this game aiming to be, the physics is very well done. This is something that was heavily marketed and showcased prior to the release of the game. The audio was something they had to improve from the previous generation as it was quite lackluster in this department previously.The sound of the engines, tortured brake discs, screeching tyres all sound phenomenal. It's no longer a monotonous revving noise you hear when you're redlining your engine at top speed, it's far more realistic and the audio has depth, is spaced out well and very crisp.Every engine sounds distinct and different. They all sound like they are supposed to unlike FH4.I've run into a few weird bugs when the engine wouldn't be audible until you switched up to 3rd gear but as it's a newly released game, some bugs are expected.Overall, it's a massive step up from FH4. This has to be the one of the best looking racing games I've played, period. Heck, this might just be one of the best looking games I've played. The visuals are striking, that is, when there are no bugs. There's a glitch on the PC version of the game where the Draw Distance is extremely poor even on Extreme settings and it does take a bit away from the experience but I suppose it'll be ironed out soon. I've also noticed the aliasing to be a bit poor compared to other games (I'm playing on 1080p with 2x MSAA) but I'm very picky about jagged edges so you might not notice it.The Performance too is very good considering how good it looks. It runs at a flawless 60 FPS even on a 1050Ti at Medium settings, In short, the cars look remarkable and even the environment looks spectacular apart from the draw distance bug.  There's a lot of things to do in Mexico in this game. You have Street, Dirt and Off-Road races, Barn Finds, Horizon Story, Horizon Arcade and so much more. You could also, choose to completely ignore them and just free-roam around the beautiful map. It's all up to you.There's not a lack of content in this game and it'll keep you interested in it or hours on end. So far, I've been highly positive about this title, but again, like every other game, this too has issues and bugs, so let's get right into them. • : This game has a lot of problems concerning multiplayer and online. It randomly leaves convoys or the server itself and it gets really annoying really fast. It also takes ages to load into and out of online races or sometimes it just gets stuck and the only way to get out is to Alt+F4 out of the game. This has been the case since FH4 and it's very sad to see the same thing happening again. I've also completely stopped playing online with other players just because of this reason, it's that bad. • : It does happen when you're tuning your car in a garage or at times, you cannot even drive a particular car as the game will instantly crash after you take it out of your garage. The game is quite unstable as of now.• : It makes all other people on the server invisible for you and this game mode is frankly unplayable as of now. It's a known bug and I hope it'll get fixed soon in the next few updates. It's an amazing game and I recommend this title to anyone interested in racing games. The issues I've mentioned might get annoying especially if you play online so if it bothers you, consider waiting for a while for patches before picking this title up.When it works, it's a remarkable game and a near flawless experience. It's easy to pick up and play even if you're inexperienced as it's not a full simulator.P.S. Nominated for Steam Awards"
529,FireEqual,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FireEqual/,3,,0,418.1,November,"14,","1,661",0,1,"- Servers are still not fixed. You'll get randomly booted from games, 50% of the time stating that you lost your connection to the Xbox servers.- A miriad of bugs, it's been a month since the last patch, PG is taking their sweet time to do anything about this game. Especially considering they took a holiday leave that encompasses American  European holidays. Examples of bugs: infinite late evening in multiplayer, unless you disconnect from the server once in 2 championships - you'll get a state of the game where it's extremely dark but no lights will turn on, because the game still thinks it's daytime; different start in races/rivals, for some reason some players gain control of their car (and throttle specifically) half a second before others, I reported this bug a month ago, still got no answer/aknowledgement.- Little to no care about community. Bone Shaker is still allowed in Online, despite being even more powerful than in Forza Horizon 4. I'm not even mentioning car manufacturers that paid for their cars to be better (Ford, Ferrari). Due to PG's error this week's seasonal challenge made you drive a very slow car for 160 km (12 highway lengths), their apology were a measly 100 Forzathon Points (1/3 of a Super Wheelspin).- Rammers and cheaters plague the game, but you have to do the work for PG and collect all the info about the person, then send it over, then maybe he'll be banned. You'll get banned for calling any of these people a bad word though instantly.- This shouldn't be anywhere near where it is in reviews, it should be at 50-60%."

540,Zentak,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006640506/,3,,1,21.2,November,"9,",461,3,1,"In short: if you liked Forza Horizon 4 then you will love the 5th, buying it is a no-brainer.There is a new Smactus skill, and Piñada smashing. Buy it.Ok, seriously, if you don't know FH 4/5, it is an arcade open world car racing game which has some bits of simulation in it but is definitely not a realistic sim. In this game you can chose between a wide range of activities such as road/dirt/drag/country racing, beat records on speed traps or try a 1000ft jump on a danger sign. You can also just roam the road and enjoy the scenic views, and smash a few cardboards collectibles.The 5th comes with improved graphics and it is gorgeous, the environment is packed with a lot of details which brings life to the world. This time the action is in Mexico which allows for even more variety than previous England: seaside, desert, jungle, volcanic mountain, Maya ruins there is a lot to enjoy. The weather system has been improved with thunderstorms and sandstorms: obviously since it is the first week I have only seen Spring season, so I can't comment on Winter for instance.There are new and really nice volumetric smoke/particle effects: I like how when driving in the dirt, the trail of dust behind the car gets illuminated in red when hitting the brakes. It's one of those small details that make you nod in approval. There is just one silly thing with that: if you happen to be in a drift event in a Forzathon with 3+ cars drifting you won't see the road anymore because of the smoke: I am sure this will be adjusted later. The team is very reactive and already fixed in 1 day an issue with network connections.The lights also have been greatly improved. However the RTX is only working in the static view of the car, not in the open world. It honestly doesn't matter much, the lights are amazing in the Mexican night, but still worth saying.The physics are also improved and objects such as rocks or cacti are now bouncing more realistically. The feedback has been improved on the controller with added feedback for braking and is now more fine grained for drifting and off-road. All the controller dead-zones can also be adjusted in the settings.Also worth noting are the accessibility options: the game speed can be changed, the palette adjusted for different types of color blindness, adjustable subtitles, screen reader and even text-to-speech and speech-to-text can be activated in the settings. Good to see that this is not an afterthought and is well integrated in the game, and hopefully this will inspire other studios.So to summarize, this is an excellent casual car racing game that you can play the whole winter and then some more, coming back to it every week to play solo or online with friends and never get tired of it. And there are also 2 DLC coming."

In my opinion the new map is really nice so I would still recommend especially when you dont own FH4. The graphics are a huge upgrade compared to FH4 which already looked great. The game runs very smooth and is well optimised but enableing the RTX settings causes some visual errors here and there. I hope they are going to fix this because there was no patch since day one yet. Hint: Buy the Willys Jeep, spend 5 skill points and get a Super-Wheelspin.

I liked forza horizon 4 alot, as the seasons where so beautiful, and the online experience racing on the highway or meeting friends was way easier. Alot of people would disagree with me on this but i wish forza horizon 5 had a smaller map..... Its harder to meet players on the open world experience than previous games.. And the online mini games are the same.They promised more customization with cars... But i didn't see a difference from FH4 for the most part in that category, but the cars do sound better, like WAY better. You know im a big fan of realism, and to be honest i really don't enjoy the map... The developers did a awesome job of highlighting the forest and desert areas(offroad), but the city and street life in nonexistent.... In forza horizon 4 there was more variety, you could fit in perfectly with a lambo in a upper class area of the city or drive a old beater in a rural road. Now its like im driving a 2 million dollar lambo through little village dirt roads to go to my little beach loft lmao like doesnt feel realistic. The developers only focused on the off road aspect of the game taking 80% of the map with mostly rural roads, then leave a little village for the streetlife and street races. If your a big fan of offroading and offroad races then you would probably like this.. But if your like me and like some need for speed action, or some nice city to rip up in a lambo... Then this game isnt for you. Theres alot of politics in this game too.... People getting banned for livery or the wrong stickers on their car, but cheaters not getting banned. The developers are slow to addressing issues with online cheating, but quick to ban anyone using ""hate speech"" and doing grey area petty things. I dont really care about these issues personally, but these issues seem to be getting worse with each game.Get this game on a sale, and try it out.... or theres always forza horizon 4 :)"
549,Flower,https://steamcommunity.com/id/UneFleur/,6,,1,147.5,November,"25,",548,1,1,"This is exactly like Forza Horizon 4, but better. I love how they kept the same formula. Just like the previous game, the game is well optimised despite looking so good. Cars sound MUCH better than Horizon 4, but also not the best out there. Still, a massive upgrade. They listened to the community feedback which is always nice for a game studio. However, I can still feel some ""recycled"" audio from cars to cars. Not a massive drawback but what can you expect when you have over 500 cars in the game. The game gives all the flexibility that you want when playing. Do you want a drag car? Drift car? Road racing car? Just relax and cruise? Anything is possible. Building up your car collection is easy as well. A bit grindy, but not so much. There's also multiple different race type and arcades that you can play. You can create/customise races as you want and even go as far as adding obstacles and stunts (GTA 5 style). For car customisation, I would say the only sad thing is that they removed all the Rocket Bunny kits from Horizon 4, but at the same time, we still got some new kits (Liberty Walk, Duke Dynamics, RWB, SSWORKS, Streethunters, TCP Magic, Varis, HKS, some Forza Originals and some fenders) and many more to discover (added content). They also added a new wing for many cars and the ability to space your wheels. I just wish they were more customisation but again, having 500+ cars is not an easy feat. At least the main or most popular cars got some nice available mods. They made some improvement on the in-game designer for all the people creating Itashas or any crazy design/logo.The map is okay. They made the roads very fun for a racing game. The only thing I hate is that it's missing buildings. You will find a lot of forest, dirt and sand but not enough ""town"". Driving all those crazy super/hyper/modded cars on a nature focused map feels out place sometimes. It's like they added more love to cross-country/dirt races and not so much for the street scenes. The map still looks amazing visually on maxed out. Knowing how they operated in the past, I am expecting a lot of upcoming great content. The game has a lot of room for improvement and I do not regret my purchase. Overall, the game is amazing and I recommend it for everyone."

So this game started off very well! I was a happy car boi for just under 2 hours. Then as buddies do, we start up a convoy to cruise in our first vehicles we've purchased and built. This is where I immediately, slid on a downhill slope that returned me to the shadow realm of being a sad car boi once again. This was the first time in my life I've witnessed a car just slowly disappear into thin air, and not only was it just one of my buddy's cars, it was all of them. And then there I was, connected with friends online but not really because once again I found myself driving alone. Depression is setting in as I realize that I had just pre ordered this game for 100 dollars, and the game barely works at all when it comes to online features. I will end on this, the game is very fun and the graphics are a sight to behold, but my god please fix your servers. My friends and I are tired of being sad."

Of course, I love taking in-game photos, so this was an auto-buy for me.I do hope they fix all the multiplayer problems though. I've got a few friends I'd love to convoy with and so far it's been a hit-and-miss affair, with mostly misses. They already have the problems on their known issues list, so here's hoping they get fixed before my pals move on to something else.Otherwise, this is still a must-own game for fans of the series, and casual racing fans like me.

Recycled Festival Playlist rewards, loss of small details such as glowing brake pads and pedal shifters, no proper Mexican cars or cars that are famous in Mexico. It's just a recycled game that has less details. This ""best racing game"" has no soul, it's just a fun driving game that lets you experience different cars. Don't get me wrong, I'm having fun with it. New engine sounds are great. Mexico is a really good map for the game. Accolades are keeping me busy.

Multiplayer in this game has been in a sorry state since day one, and while it has received some improvements, it's still a mess, with desync and absurdly long loading times abound. And, instead of fixing that, we get updates with stuff like nerfing wheelspins(which is your main way of earning money in this game). Which is a shame, because the actual driving and wealth of cars is really fun. That's not the only issue with the game though. It also has a really bad ""campaign"" if you can call it that. The writing is pretty bad, and everytime a character calls me superstar it just makes me cringe. Let me make this clear though, the game is not bad. It's actually pretty aight.

It's a sentimental homage to the thrill of road-tripping through postcard-perfect holiday scenery, and an occasionally silly but always genuine Valentine to Mexico's world-famous culture. It's a long-distance, MMO-inspired racer that's bursting at the seams with more races, events, and event kinds than can reasonably fit on some portions of the map – but it never seems overwhelming. It never forces you to do something you don't want to do and consistently rewards you for your choices. It has a lovely appearance, a fantastic tone, and is a joy to play. Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things, to be sure. Above all, it's the work of a master racing company, and it's the greatest open-world racing game I've ever experienced."

Easy to win/buy a car, easy to make money, easy to win races etc. this makes it incredibly boring. Multiplayer aspect provides a challenge as you can compete with other players in a large variety of games, races, jumps etc. However multiplayer ranking system for racing and Playground Games is based purely on experience rather than skill, therefore to be ranked higher you need to simply spend more time playing. Would suggest Forza creates a system based on average skill points/wins per race/games so that competitive players can be better matched and aspire to improve."

589,Marshmallow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessOfTheNight/,3,,0,77.7,November,"27,",810,0,1,"TLDR:This is an uninspired reskin of Horizons 4 and I could not in good conscience recommend it.Review:The game still suffers from various bugs and exploits that have plagued the last few horizon titles. As per usual, playing with friends in the open world and in races often results in disconnects promoting a frustrating time at best and at worst the desire to completely quit due to the inability to finish a single race. The lead drivatar still outpaces the rest of the race making it next to impossible to win on higher difficulties without driving like a total scum bag. The worst offense of all though is the laughable level of security which is on par with every other horizon title. You are still able to connect CheatEngine to the game and exploit credits, xp, and your car collection without fear of repercussion. Even worse is the fact that there are already a dozen or so publicly available cheat tables to automate this to an extent and multiple trainers. This has lead to compromised leaderboard validity, the inability to play pvp due to untouchable exploited clients, and a growing disinterest in the game as the rampant and blatant use of exploits continues unhindered for the fifth time.When players are driving around in unreleased unobtainable cars two weeks after launch that's when enough is enough. I fail to see what Playground Games and Turn 10 spent the extra development time on here. This game at it's core is nothing more than a reskin of the last title with a few new gimmicks taped on and a few old systems overhauled and rebranded as ""new"".If you want to do some solo racing, then it's good enough for that, but if you are looking for anything more, I would search somewhere else. With the egregious failure of security, distasteful gimmicks, borderline manipulative ""overhauls"", and complete lack of innovation or iterative improvement of any kind, it is impossible for me to recommend this game in it's current state or for it's current price. If you want to experience this game, go pick up Horizons 4 for a fraction of the price."

I still however believe it would've been in their best interest to fix these issues BEFORE launching. I will however change my review to a thumbs up as I can at least play the game.In it's current state I don't recommend you buy this game full price. I do however say go ahead and try GamePass to try the game and see if it's for you. The game released NOV 8th and as I am writing this review it's currently November 16th and this ""hotfix"" to fix all the performance issues and crashes just keeps getting pushed back further and further. First we were told by the end of the first week of release, the 12th goes by and we get an update saying ""next week"", well I expected early next week since they claimed the hotfix was almost ready, here we are on tuesday and we're being told we'll have an UPDATE later this week. Are we getting an UPDATE or the actual HOTFIX? There is no worse feeling in a racing game to be 12 MINUTES into a race and have your game crash in the last quarter. Oh yeah sure blame a couple 3rd party apps for the crashes... nothing like trying to divert blame when it's obviously your fault the game crashes constantly. Even cyberpunk 2077 which was seemingly buggier than this game I was able to get over 30 hours of gameplay CRASH FREE. FIX THE CRASHES PLEASE."

Mexico is probably one of the best maps in the series, if not in any open world racing game ever. - Fun side stories. - Amazing sound design. Huge step up from Forza Horizon 4 all around.- Variety (Street Racing, Mixed Surface Racing, Offroad Racing, PR Stunts, Stories, Expeditions, Battle Royale, Playground games, Livery customization, Custom race building, etc. etc.) - Dynamic and engaging driving physics. - Tuning. You can upgrade a car's performance anyway you want and make it do anything. You can make a cross country monster out of a Ferrari FXX and a quick circuit racer out of a 1956 Ford F-100. The freedom is paralleled - BMW Isetta CONS:- Horrible online. Every mode is riddled with bugs, server issues, long load times, and a lack of freedom. I have had to restart my game at least 15 times due to being frozen in a menu. - Rendering issues. - Horizon Arcade. It's such a step down from previous games that it baffles me. - No Custom Adventure. If you want to race online, you can't pick what class you want to race in or what type of racing you want to do. It was in Forza Horizon 4, why is it gone now? - No peel :(Overall it's definitely a great game, a solid 9/10 when it works, just be aware that if you're purchasing this just for the online it may be better to wait until those are fixed."

Coming from someone who played countless need for speed let me tell you this:The customization in here is insane. Engine swaps, body kits, community made liveries... all here. If that does not convince you, the game allows you to tweak it based on your driving style. You want full arcade? NO PROBLEM. You want a harder game with simulation physics? NO PROBLEM.But the most important thing for me is optimization. This game can run on a potato. That shows love and care from the devs. The only issue here is that the AI needs to be tweaked a bit since they do not brake in corners and will overtake you majority of the time.The graphics here are also insane. I have an RTX 2060SUPER nad I am just awe struck. The openworldness of the game is the cherry on top."

DLC will not display, which is something that I guess could be solved. However, graphics are a disaster. Yes, the environments look fantastic, but the cars display in mario brothers era quality. In the menus as well as in-game. The new menu structure and changes to what things are called also make little sense. If they sort the car graphics there is a case to argue for Forza 5. Until such time, anyone looking for a nice racing sim ought to just stick with Forza 4."

613,GH,https://steamcommunity.com/id/groegred/,15,1,1,269.5,January,"15,",385,0,1,"A worthy successor to FH4.After about 50h of playtime i completed most of the default ""singleplayer"" races and most speed traps etc. I still have about 50% of the ""stories"" left and hundreds of challenges and things I can still collect. It's clear that they tried to put a heavier focus on the multiplayer aspect of the game, by making it easier to invite strangers to a race and join a lobby. The general scheme of the game stayed the same, it seems they focused on improving upon the previous game, than trying to make crazy changes, which worked well. They do seem to have gotten rid of competitive multiplayer though (or I didn't find it yet).Unfortunately Alfa Romeo/Fiat are gone due to licensing issues (thank you Stellantis), which is a shame, but they might be added back later like Mitsubishi and Toyota were in the previous title. With that said, this is still probably the biggest car inventory of any new racing game on the market. The audio of the cars (which was a big complaint of the previous title) has noticeably improved, though it depends on the model.The map is very large and has many unique areas to explore. Finally there are some long straight roads to max out your cars, but there are also many bends and turns to make for some good races. It's also much bigger than Scotland; after my current playtime I've been to every corner but still don't know every road. I spotted a few visual bugs here and there, but nothing that annoys me too much (floating fences and so on). The graphics are just like the previous title -- amazing, just look at the screenshots.The soundtrack is okay, some songs I like and some I don't. In my opinion it could be bigger and have more variety for a game whose setting is a Festival. Sure, you can always have Spotify or some other thing playing on the side, but it won't be as well integrated. Also, if you turn the sound off, it will stay off (even after you restart the game), unlike the previous title. Overall I recommend this game, if you're looking for an arcade racer with a lot of stuff to explore. I bought it for ~50€ on sale which is fine, for what it offers. (I always try to keep my games below 0,50€/h of playtime and I'm pretty confident I can reach 100h in this one without getting bored.) I probably missed some things in this review, just because there's so much to this game, but for now that's all I have to say.Update 11/2022: The game has enjoyed regular content updates, same as the previous title (if not better). Each update introduces new-to-the-game or new-to-the-series cars and sometimes even new stories, hence I nominated it for the ""labour of love"" award."

For the first time I had to uninstall steam and in-turn Forza had to be uninstalled (due to many issues, figured a clean install of both programs may help and it did as far as performance, 20+FPS but...). I felt like throwing-up after I clicked uninstall (had a oh sh#t moment about not knowing the location of the cloud save file) and it was too late. Re-installed both programs, signed into steam which was showing my 600+ hours, achievements etc... all was looking good. Fired up Forza in steam, signed into game, signed into the pop-app side xbox app, everything linked and NSYNC.  Was thinking, sweet, all gravy cannot wait to race online wiith an extra 20+FPS on my brand new 4K monitor.... I hit continue at Forza home screen... FBR!!! BACK TO THE START OF THE GAME!!!!! Gutted! I couldn't really give 2F's about my campaign progression or even my rank for that matter, but my CARS!!!!! My legitimately  owned  cars!!!! I had every high-end car, that I wanted anyway, including my pride and joy, the NSX R GT!!!! Took me weeks to finally find one in the auction and actually bid at the right time to get it!!!!!! This car cant ever be obtained again, unless it's auctioned by accident! It sucks cause truth be told, as of recent, I finally found form and was placing in the last 11 races and then this happens to me. I could live without my rank and progress.... but, MY CARS I cannot! I requested a full refund due to this, as there is nothing more I can do. Funny enough, it says if you have put in a substantial amount of hours into the game, a refund may not be possible. Given steam conveniently shows the logged hours that will be the loop whole to reject refund request, Even though, I'm forced to start again with NOTHING!!!!! Anyway, Id be happy to start from scratch, provided that all my cars can be restored, at the very least, my NSX R GT. All I ever play is multiplayer and even if I sucked it up and started again, it would take me a year to get the garage of cars I had, and competing with average cars until then will be painful knowing I had the top end cars to compete in the first place!

Sadly I can't give a positive review because of a few negative aspects. Some accolades are way too hard to accomplish, you need luck, or spend way too much time learning/doing something or both at the same time, like the tunning ones or the paintings. And the biggest problem this game has is the fact that they remove every trace of competition from it. There is no point of playing the game once you have unlocked almost every car in the game, you have enough credits to buy or upgrade anything other than doing the weekly activities list. Every game mode is casual, there is no point of playing them, especially the Horizon racings, recently they added some levels to upgrade on Horizon Open and get some stickers on your name but still no rankings. Without a ranking system means that all the players are mixed together and it's very likely to play against people who is way better than you."

I'm not sure if it's my drivers or the game itself but unless I'm driving in-game it crashes, no matter what I do in Menu's like customisation, certain cars and certain parts like specific paint colours and wheels etc just crash the game once you try to apply them to your car its pretty much unplayable unless I just buy the car, keep it stock and start driving it. This isn't what I asked for when paying £80 in a Triple A game made by a well established Company that SHOULD know what they're doing by now..I mean come on it's been Months since Launch and I crash twice within 10 minutes of playing.. Also since Forza Horizon 3 the public have been asking for more customisation yet they feel the need to ignore that which should be a very fundamental part of the game, and instead add useless features like Pronouns and Prosthetics so they can push this ""diversity"" move on the consumer to make themselves look good. No offence to anyone it's a point that the company doesn't genuinely care about you it's just about their image.

Surely when you have maybe half of featured cars it will become a little boring but there's always something to do like grinding cash for another expensive car and etc. But right now it's starting to become like usual gatcha mobile game... Compared to Horizon 4 (stopped playing after horizon 5 launch and had almost full car collection not counting FE), the grind was not that very scary, you could just do anything and still manage to get millions without noticing it. For this title, right now skill points are limited to 10 while (if I remember correctly) forza 4 didn't had this limitation, rewards become definitely smaller (rewards are a joke right now) and drivavatars are so overpowered that it's impossible to drive normally and you have no other choice but ram to them and just slide with walls to pass them and hopefully finish first. Maybe it needs some time for drivavatars to learn tracks and so on, but it really makes them look unnatural when they are unmovable and have unlimited grip and acceleration that makes you frustrated. I haven't tried multiplayer that much but I heard that there exists cheaters (at least I haven't met one). And at least for me I don't see any point anymore to play further this game. It become just logging in for Forzathon event, get points to receive event featured cars and wait another week for another event, just like other gatcha game...Talking about graphics, it looks really gorgeous... if you watch a youtube video of someone playing this game on console. I'm using GTX 1080 and I tried so many solutions, but it still looks very crappy, Draw distance are very noticeable that it's just pain to look at it and overall I don't really see anything special. Forza 4 on the other hand looks better than this on my machine, so I'm guessing this is a issue with PC release because I'm not the only one with these kind of ""features"".Overall, I would not recommend this game for now, better buy forza 4 on sale (if they didn't nuke progression like they did for forza 5). I can't see a really good future for this game with these kind of changes, so my suggestion for developers would be fix their priorities, fix graphical bugs, fix AI, make game more enjoyable and worth your time so we could have a reason to play it every day (no heavy grind please)."
646,Siwkann,https://steamcommunity.com/id/siwkann/,3,,0,47.4,November,"10,",404,2,1,"I think this is the greatest arcade racing game there is. Far better than any nfs (except for the lack of cops). Graphics are amazing. Reminds me of BDO but much better!I totally recommend this game to anyone into arcade racing at the highest level of polish and detail.I won't upvote this game simply because it's lacking in 2 aspect that are very important for me personaly, so don't take them to heart.The first one is plot/writting. This game has the cringiest dialogs I've experienced. Seems like they tried to make as safe for work as possible, even when they are talking to street racers. Everyone is very bland. Also everyone calls you ""superstar"" and praise you everytime you race, which is embarrassing. It's like they think you are some sort of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and they feel sorry for you.The other aspect are the avatars. Everyone who knows me knows I like working with girl beauty ideals and trying to explore its reaches and aesthetic values/symbolisms (like how the color palette of the face can affect the compatible color palette for makeup, clothing and even hair). In a nutshell, avatars for girls in this game are dreadful. Even though they copy pasted the same racial archetypes from FH4, I can't understand why they made them look way worse than before. The eyes are almost popping out, yet eyes are smaller. Girls lack makeup. The skin is darker for all races. My favorite girl of HF4, the south eastern asia looking, has an off puting smile fixed in her face. I'm afraid to think they intentionally did these downgrades to imply they are more latin american now, but it's a possibility.I just make her wear a covid mask to avoid looking at her weird grin and I keep enjoying the game very much, always wondering if the devs ever going to fix the avatar, but not letting that take away from my experience."

Most machines are not needed at all.  Also, due to the fact that the developers decided to add such an amount of transport, they scored on detailing and elaboration.  Some cars are missing textures.Tuning is also weak.

649,'Jake',https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sklurm/,2,,1,205.8,November,"10,","4,197",0,1,"Absolute masterpiece.I cannot believe they somehow improved Horizon 4.  Handling: My friends and I were skeptical at first that they were tinkering with the handling because it was so precise in previous titles, but they added a weighty feeling to all the cars that make you actually use the brakes and be cautious of spinouts. It feels much better now. Setting: Cannot be happier with the choice of Mexico. The landscapes capture the richness of the jungles and the barrenness of the desert/dunes perfectly. They've spread the events and progression well in my opinion. It may seem like the map is overloaded with things to do, but they are giving you all the freedom to do what you want. Use the map filter if you want to focus on certain things, it is there for good reason. Graphics: Beautiful, possibly better than real life. 11/10. Ultimate edition has been worth every single penny so far AND still have 2 unannounced DLC's in the oven. Cannot wait to see what else Playground has in store."

But when the bugs are copy pasted from FH4 it just goes to show that they simply don't care about the server issues they promised to fix. The gameplay itself is fun and the map and tracks are fantastic. Engine sounds are much better. It's just everything surrounding the game that's problematic. Here's some of the issues you'll come across online:-Endless loading screens for online races. (exact same issue as in fh4)-Power doesn't cost pi for some rwd cars and they have even more grip than in fh4. Those builds can be up to 3-10 seconds faster on certain tracks-Starting event lab races that you created won't show added props for other players in the raceIt just feels like the alpha patch for the game. Clearly they did no testing for these issues or they ignored them. They always seem to neglect anything to do with online racing. They even removed GOOD features from fh4 such as ranked and custom adventure while adding nothing. So now you're forced into doing races you don't want to do like s2 CC (which has 0 cars that reach 998). I don't understand how things like this can be overlooked. In summary, if you enjoy racing online just give this game a miss until it's fixed and the CORE ENDGAME FEATURES from fh4 are added back in. Even if you enjoy just doing rivals then good luck, there are many easy exploits for rivals times that are allowed by the in game systems. Games nowadays don't seem to do any testing and it's unacceptable."

665,Hyokkuda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hyokkuda/,14,1,1,114.4,February,"10,",433,5,1,"Honestly, I was not really looking forward to driving around Mexico as I was in Forza Horizon 4 with Great Britain because there's too much off-roading going on for me in this game.This game feels like a copy/pasted version of its predecessor with a few upgrades & downgrades of the core mechanics, but that's not an entirely bad thing. As a completionist, every race, every objective I try to beat, new ones are appearing on the map like there is no end to it just like the previous game, which is nice! There can be so many icons on the map that I have to use the filter once again to see where everything I need is. If you're like me, and you've played FH4 then you might be disappointed with this one because a lot of ""Hard to Find"" vehicle can now be purchased straight from the autoshow. A lot of them are no longer locked behind races or by doing events or behind a wheelspin.There are still some cars that can only be earned by reaching certain levels or from different driving series like road racing, cross-country, dirt, drag racing, street racing,, drift, speed traps, danger zones for crazy jumps and speed zones. Others cars can be earned by just completing a car collection or by driving around the map & destroying private properties or kicking dirt with drift & burnouts in someone's yard & windows, or simply by driving recklessly & pulling dangerous near misses & stunts to increase various parts of the ""Horizon Life"" experience & reputation.The progression is now measured by an ""Accolades"" system & a level system. The more accolades points people earn, the higher their level is with a max level of 2999 or 10 ★ (prestige) still. Each action the player does in the game will be rewarding, including ramming into your neighbor's fences! I don't recommend doing that in real life, however. No matter how much you hate your neighbor. ""APs"" can be earned with the following steps I mentioned above and by showing off your taste & even your artistic skills. Taking enough pictures of cars or the beautiful scenery will give the player more points. But the same goes for creating some 3000-layer-stunningly good-looking paint jobs for a car of the player's choice to help them earn money & Accolades. On top of that, if you are a mechanic expert, then by customizing & tuning vehicles, it's possible to become famous & rich among other players by sharing the best tuning setups to make a car drive better. The same goes for creating paint jobs or just small stickers for everyone to use. So, in case you have none of those skills in you, you can always search for various stickers to put together & create your dream car and download someone's tunes to help you progress through a race you hate so much because the only car you own for a specific class requirement happens to feel like a boat.The UI is kind of bad. A grid rather than a slider feels like it's too much work when you just want to install the best of everything in the custom upgrade menu.And speaking of skills! If you're the kind of person who sucks at every racing game, you're just terrified of touching a simulator game because they're often too hard for you, well you shouldn't be scared. After all, you can always adjust the game difficulty along with the AI difficulty & turn them into brainless drivers. If that's not enough for you, there's even an option for assisted steering & brakes, which will pretty much turn the car for you & slow down before every turn. Although I don't know anyone who would use that, but hey! It's optional! Difficulty bonus can no longer go beyond 100%. Shifting set to manual, driving line, damage & tire wear, rewind no longer affect the difficulty bonus CR which is a shame in my opinion.Now back to creativity & AI for a moment. Those who are creative or even cheap & non-competitive can abuse this creation system by creating their race & drive around the map, drawing the race lines they want & the AI will follow. Other players, too, if they don't realize what you've been up to by creating a race track while drunk, ramming into every tree, trash cans & street lights. I'm telling you, the AI will follow! The traffic won't go away while creating them, by the way, so you can also tell whenever someone just crashed into a car while creating the race just because the line will suddenly have a Z in it.As mentioned earlier, there's a lot to be done in this game. There's a form of story mode related to Horizon Festival, but more is to be done even after completing those. So, a Festival playlist consists of completing multiple race events to increase the progression gauge up to 100 PTS for a ""Hard to Find"" car, or an access pass to new events & up to 160 PTS for a legendary ""Hard to Find"" vehicle, just like the previous game. That's the main ""story."" Then there's also a seasonal event that lasts about two weeks with another completion rate of 25 PTS & 40 PTS for random vehicles, which can also be purchased from other players at the auction house for those who hate grinding or for less-skilled players or even received as a gift now thanks to that new feature.Almost everything can be played with friends & strangers, either in co-op or against each other. I haven't played a lot of multiplayer modes this time around.Those who want to own everything in the game will have to work for it. Certain vehicles, horns, character accessories, clothes &... stupid dance moves can only be acquired by purchasing them with Forza Points (FP) from the Forzathon Shop. To earn points, the player must participate in a live group event that occurs randomly on the map. Everyone must participate to earn those points. But not to worry! There's nothing competitive about that event. It's similar to Burnout Paradise's online challenges if you ever played that game. As for the character appearance, the player will be greeted with a character customization menu at the beginning of the game with 25 character presets to choose, the ability to change change the hairstyle, hair color, add prosthetic arms/legs, identity to be addressed as ""he/him, she/her, they/them"". Along with two voice options for male & female. Now the character can speak. The player can change their character at any time from their home or from the Horizon Festival. As for clothes like tops, jackets, dresses, legs, ankles for socks, face masks, outfits & accessories, a lot of them will be locked behind a completion system. But it can be unlocked with wheel spins & super wheelspins, which is some form of loot boxes that can be earned pretty quickly by just leveling up (Similar to the Overwatch loot box system, if you ever played that). Lastly, the player can also buy houses, beach houses and some rich looking houses. Houses, houses everywhere. They don't do much other than looking great or bragging rights and setting the player closer to the desired location on the map. Some will give special perks, however, like double Forzathon points or the ability to fast travel.The game has no micro-transaction. There are no pay-to-win vehicles in the game. But yes, some paid vehicles from DLCs might be better & cheaper or even free upon purchases compared to what someone can get in the standard version of the game.And lastly, new weather system. But nothing too fancy. I barely noticed any storms outside of the prologue.Well, that's about it for now! I hope that this review was helpful to you! And I'm sincerely sorry for this wall of text! Feel free to comment down below if you want to know more about the game, or if you wish to correct something I said even though you probably own the game already & you're just a curious person!

There are way too many things to unlock in this game, so much so that it's overwhelming. This may sound like a good thing, but it's not. None of them provide any benefits. Also, you start off with a top tier car. That's stupid to me. I'd rather they port a version of Horizon 3 over here. This map is all bare desert, it is the worst aspect of this game. The Horizon 4 map is the best in my opinion, save for the highway. Also while the winter season and spring season sucked in Horizon 4, they were still a cool aspect and nice change of scenery."

The game has a lot to like about it: great graphics, great sound, very wide collection of cars that all feel quite different, driving is satisfying and the map is big and has a bit of everything. However, it's absolutely ruined for me because the game constantly throws things at me I don't want and can't turn off:The game hijacks control and opens the map when I get some unlocks.The game automatically starts challenges when I drive through areas where they're set up. This also removes collision with other cars (you can just drive through them), changes my destination on the GPS and triggers various visual effects, sounds and cringey dialogues, completely breaking immersion.The game constantly reminds me I'm not playing in online mode. And that this or that game mode exists. And that I can send cars to people. And all kinds of other useless crap I don't care about. These are just a few things off the top of my head. If I were to jump in the game and drive around for 10 minutes Im sure I could find more. I get that the game is supposed to be an arcade and not a driving simulation, but there's no reason in not letting the player opting out of being constantly accosted with things he doesn't care about.This isn't even getting into the awful writing pertaining any line of dialogue, scripted event, cutscene and story point. Everything that happens in this game tells you how amazing of a driver and person you, the player are. You can hardly find an interaction with a character that doesn't at least mention how you're the best driver in the world. Whenever you turn on the radio you're gonna find some ""news"" about how you're such a legends. All the cutscenes and scripted events are so grand in scale and hype that they remove any sense of realism or immersion you might have had left. Hell, there are even scripted races where you're slightly behind the entire race then make a miraculous recovery and get in the first place meters away from the finish line, no matter how good or bad you were driving. And it's not an isolated event, it happens over and over and over again, as if the player is too stupid to realize what's happening.For the same reason, I suspect, the progression in this game is messed up. You get your first supercar as soon as you start the game. Within a few hours of playing the game you already have more supercars than a billionaire obsessed with them and everyone refers to you as the best driver in the world.The annoying part is that they had a good game at some point in development. But then they created a bunch of content that seemingly came out of a chinese mobile game and shoved it down the players throat. It blows my mind that over a year after the release they still didn't give us the option to turn all of it off. The game, as it is now has enough good to keep me coming back once in a while to drive around a bit, but I always close it with a bitter taste in my mouth because of all the extra ♥♥♥♥ I can't turn off and embarrassed that I spent time and money on a game designed to make children feel good about themselves."

Sure, this is just a DLC to Horizon 4, but listen up.Could you drive Porsches in Horizon 4, or any of the previous titles, without the constant fear of death? No.Could you drive an Acura Integra without it feeling like someone put dinner trays under the rear wheels without you noticing? No.Horizon 5 has FINALLY, after pretty much 12 years since the release of FM3, made driving with this physics model/engine feel good and intuitive.For me that's all that Horizon 4 was missing, decent driving physics.Now, the game is still a sim-cade, more towards sim, with its own twist on what is considered ""realistic"".Take for example, all cars still feel heavier than they should, they rotate slower than you'd expect, more noticeable in cars that are extremely light.This definitely has its advantages, playing on a gamepad or even keyboard is made easier because the cars aren't super twitchy allowing more people with different driving styles to still succeed at the game.Keep in mind, playing this game on a wheel may feel rather disconnected due to this style they went for.All-in-all, Horizon 5 is a great way to say goodbye to this physics model, if the Motorsport reboot changes this (and I hope they do), and I'm really glad it exists.Gameplay wise, it's very close to Horizon 4. Open world, race what you want when you want, do the festival playlist, etc.Now you have the accolades, small achievements to complete, but once you're done with the ones that give you good rewards there isn't much else to do than the usual cycle of ""Tune car, try it online"".Speaking of the accolades, they found it a good idea to have some tied to vinyl downloads, tune downloads, and so on, which is great for completionists who don't have a platform to just boost their numbers...I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you're looking for a fun experience with cars in a very nice and diverse map.I wouldn't recommend this game if you're looking for fair competitive racing because their car performance measuring system is clearly not up to the task anymore, but if you don't mind sticking to a broken META, you should be just fine.TL;DRFinally, good driving physicsIt's almost like Horizon 4, but better gameplay in generalBuy if you want to have funDon't buy if you want fair competitive racing"

FH4 even had better houses, a better map, since the seasons changing kept it exciting in my opinion.That said, Forza Horizon 5 is still a really good and quality car game, but it should have offered more, and I feel like the new Hot Wheels DLC just adds insult to injury, that injury being that this game barely offered anything new."
695,Dirtman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GodDirtman/,2,,1,72.3,January,"4,",116,0,1,"This is certainly a game for everyone. No matter if you are an adult, teen, kid, or a graybeard, if you are a professional IRL driver, simracing veteran or you have never touched a virtual steering wheel before - you will find this game amazing and enjoyable. Forza Horizon 5 brings you an amazing open-world driving and racing sandbox experience surrounded by stunning graphics and tons of vehicles. There is something for everyone. Real hypercars, muscle cars, rally cars, drift cars, hot hatches, buggies, and even trucks are at your disposal. There are more than 500 vehicles and new ones are constantly being added. You can race on the road, drift, go offroad, play the campaign, do the side quests or just drive around and explore Mexico - you can have fun as you want. There are online and offline races, meaning that if you're not too experienced in racing games you can lower your difficulty level and just enjoy your drive with easy bots that won't leave you 10 km behind. Forza Horizon is all about freedom and having fun with cars.The graphics are stunning, this is clearly one of the best-looking games in 2021. The landscapes, VFXs (like smoke and water splashes), biomes, and Mexico towns... Just sit down and admire. The game has been released on older console generations (Xbox One) which unfortunately downgrades the graphics experience and raytracing is available in the Forzavista only (however, I think it isn't too good - i have an RTX 3060 Ti, so I have raytracing, but it hadn't impressed me too much). The car sounds are very good, they are definitely improved from the Forza Horizon 4. I still think they need some upgrades though. Character voiceovers are cool (real Mexican actors dubbed the Mexican in-game charachters) and the music is fine too (I liked FH4 radio stations more, but it's a matter of taste). And finally - our own charachter has a voice too!The story is about a Horizon Festival and the different activities around it. You are the Horizon Superstar, the most known person here and you are helping to build this show. The story isn't too long, but it's only the addition to the game. You get access to the next chapters by collecting accolades (which you get for progressing in the game). You can complete it in around 20 hours without speedrunning). The game itself can be played indefinitely - it's never-ending and always expanding!The game has a few issues and bugs, but Playground Games is often releasing updates with bugfixes. The game requires a pretty fast PC, it runs at around 70-90 FPS on my PC (Ryzen 5 3600, RTX 3060 Ti, 16 GB RAM, installed on SSD) with Ultra/Extreme (highest possible) settings at 2560x1440p (2K) resolution. Occasional lags or errors happen, but I have never experienced any crashes or other bigger problems. Talking about the price - simply, it's worth it. Even at the full price. You get an amazing game with a lot of content and features. I pre-ordered the Premium Edition and I'm not disappointed. Go buy it now!"

Having skipped FH4, FH5 makes me glad to have done so. In 30 hours of playtime (at the time of writing), the only differences I've found between FH5 and FH3 are a few set-pieces and the map. That's just not good enough. FH5 and FH3 feel exactly the same in all the ways that matter. I'm wondering if some of the people writing the glowing reviews it has been getting have played the previous games.Why haven't I refunded it? Because I enjoy the livery editor and I love cars. This is what Forza Horizon 5 capitalizes on.I guess I'll keep playing, but I'll probably be skipping FH6.Thanks for reading."

It's more than a week that there is a glitch that permits some cars to go way faster then the other cars. Devs are not fixing this quickly.- Online services for convoys and social life is still malfunctioning. This means that you will have often problems to see players in your convoy, that you have to recreate convoys when this happens, and that sometime you will have to start a race with not all the players in your convoy. Also, not all the players are usually visible in your map, some of them will only spawn very close to you.- Horizon Radios are very limited. Prepare your Spotify playlists if you want more kinds of music in your game.- VIP benefits are broken. There is a very strong possibility that you could not be able to have those.- Longevity of the game is very short. Once you complete the story, expect to do always the same things, just like in FH4.

736,Khaeops,https://steamcommunity.com/id/khaeops/,7,1,0,238.5,January,4,59,0,1,"Lifeless and lazy, is what I'd have to call this game.I tried really hard to get used to it and enjoy it, but at the end of the road, there really isn't any content in this game. I found myself constantly saying ""Need for Speed did it better"" at every corner of the game despite NFS not being particularly  groundbreaking either. The UI in FH5 is terrible - it's slow, doesn't make much sense and there's dozens of redundant prompts that get in the way every 5 minutes. Your party leader might queue you up for a race, but you're so deep in UIs that by the time you can back out of all the menus the 10 second (yeah, only 10) timer to accept the event runs out, and you get kicked from the party and everyone has to exit and re-party up again.The sound design of the cars is lifeless. Cars are tinny and there's little to no bass in any of them. To call it 'award-winning' is a joke. And don't get me started on the balancing. This is one of the most unbalanced, or stupidly balanced games I've ever played. Sure, the game gives you over 600 cars to choose from, but only about 10 of them are actually competitive, while the rest might have the same rating as another player's car but only have half the top speed, or slide out uncontrollably on near-straights.There are a very limited amount of race courses in this game, with the devs opting to allow the community to foster their own tracks and have them curated on front pages and in weekly challenges. The problem is people make awful tracks. I just want tracks that flow and have readable/sensible corners, with walls or props that indicate a clear direction. Instead, you get these wonky tracks with no walls or indication whatsoever to where you need to turn, so you spend the entire race staring at your GPS/minimap in the bottom corner of the screen rather than on the road.The story is pretty lacklustre as well, not to mention how 'happy' everything is. Everyone's way too cheerful and the dialogue is cringe. I'd rather not have the story at all to be honest. But it doesn't last long and after a handful of 'races' with random challenges you're on your own to just do whatever. There's no drive to do anything. Now, the game has some good parts to it as well. I very much prefer its physics over Need for Speed, and it's kinda pretty. But that's about it to be honest.I've played this game mainly as a social outlet to play with a couple of friends, and that's really what this game is. It's a social experience with racing, rather than a racing game with friends. But it even contradicts itself in that, as your interactivity with other players is very limited. To remove toxicity, there's no open chat, only a very limited chat system where you get 4 context-sensitive chat messages you can send, but you have to WIN them in lootboxes this game calls 'wheelspins'. You can't send cars or money to your friends without buying them with premium currency - speaking of which, I don't think you can even buy the 'premium' currency. They look like they're special, but you just get them from doing a bunch of dumb challenges.Buy it on sale if you have a bunch of friends who would be happy to join you, or if you're a car fanatic or just want to drive around for a while. But if you're looking for a serious racing game to play, this is 100% not it. Get any Need for Speed if you want basically everything mentioned in this review done significantly better minus the physics, or buy Assetto Corsa if you desire the physics and an open playground."

XP boards are bugged, game design and gameplay are just not thought through, and drivatar mechanics are completely screwed up.It seems like there wasn't much though between ""making it a challenge"" and ""just making it harder"". Anything above average difficulty makes it seem like the front running drivatars are a Performance class above, and the backmarkers are Stock cars with good drivers. As a casual player, it makes it frustrating to try and hop back in, do some seasonal events, and the drivatars are locked to Highly Skilled.Also, it's not just the drivatars that make this game frustrating...PR Stunt (Danger signs, Speed Zones/Traps, etc) placement wasnt thought out. You'll be doing a danger sign where you jump straight into buildings, trees, unlandable terrain, the speed zone by the main festival goes through the exit to the site from one direction, trailblazers are overly difficult...the only stunt still making me want to play is the drift zones.This game by itself is fun, but if you try to do events, or don't grind every day, I would not recommend this Horizon. It seems like Playground Games knows they can make money just by releasing a new Horizon, which is why i waited a year to even consider buying it on sale half off. A year later, it doesn't seem like any work was put, and FH3, FH4, and FH5 all cost same price."

It is probably fine with keyboard or controller but is basically unplayable with a wheel.  The control scheme is wild with sensitivity and the user definable settings to adjust the control scheme make it worse at best.  PS2 games have better handling models with wheel support.

Absolutely stunning visuals and super detailed car models from a huge selection of vehicles. Driving physics with a controller feel  amazing, even if you're not the racing game type of player. Only real downside as of doing this review are the multiplayer issues, meaning friends in a convoy disappear and reappear on a constant basis, also the online events such as 'Horizon Arcade' are barely able to be completed since some servers are just plain empty or other drivers are not visible. I would say that the latter problem will be fixed pretty soon due to being such a newly released title. Optimization wise FH5 is probably one the best games released this year considering the graphics, but that wasn't that difficult in 2021, but props where props are due, 'Playground Games' did an amazing job on this new sequel in the 'Horizon' series.Post Patch (December): 'Horizon Arcade' seems to be somewhat fixed due to it now being scaled down to the amount of players participating in the event which means they are achievable solo fairly easily. Convoys were patched as well, there's no disappearing issue, however either the convoy leader or the members can't see each other completely. Will probably still need some patience for this to work solid. - Fixed!First Expansion - Hot Wheels: This is one of the best DLC's I've ever played in any game! If you've never got to experience it in Forza Horizon 3 like me, definitely grab it for FH5."

This is my first intro besides a little bit of gameplay from Horizon 3, and my review will be limited to the premium edition as that's what I got and other players who only have the base game may have a different experience. That being said, my other friends don't have the premium and don't feel like they are missing out on much so do with that what you will, obviously the big bonus of premium is the future content/expansions being bundled and discounted rather than having to purchase them separately.Pros:Great variety and customizationGreat graphics and optimizationFun to play online with friends and take part in eventsLots of things to doThe way they are doing seasons seems interesting, but also wish that they could be longer than 3-4 days each for the small ones.The rewind feature works incredibly well, especially online. I'm honestly amazed at how they were able to implement it so seamlessly, and it adds a lot to the game and helps tone down frustration if you are trying to complete specific objectives in free roam as well. That being said, the only time I've ever had the game crash (2 at this time) have both been related to me rewinding and the game freezes and crashes shortly afterward. Haven't been able to notice anything in particular that might have set it off.Meh:Lots of small details in the game when you are playing, but also weirdly enough a lack of them, hopefully some features will get implemented later like skipping cutscenes, and other UI decisions that will probably be suggested by the Horizon community.I'm sure there's more stuff but I'll probably add stuff in as I play more.Cons:Story is forced and it's literally torture having to watch unskippable cutscenes with terrible acting and lines. Wish we could skip all the animations that are in the game like the barn finds as well.Other story events are annoying where you are racing some AI like in the showcase events where they look like they are rubberbanding all over the place. The first showcase event with the motorcycles has it bad, and the bikes literally look like they are floating on the ground while they are driving, there's no actual substance to their movements if that makes any sense.Online definitely has issues, constant DC's, being forced to go into free roam from whatever menu you are in just to reconnect, players in your convoy disappearing in front of you or on the map, etc. Also weirdly enough your car stopping anytime you get DC's, which is super frustrating for those who get DC'd often. By that time a restart usually ends up resolving it though.Some parts of online, especially Arcade are frustrating mostly because of a lack of players, there isn't much incentive to play them, which makes it all the more harder if you are trying to do any seasonal or whatever objective and there is literally no one at each point. Maybe a queuing feature could mitigate that? Alternatively just play with friends but they aren't always available.The XBOX live integration leaves something to be desired, sometimes it just won't connect to online even though in game I am online and can play with friends. It's easiest to just join a friend by sending them an invite through in game instead of the XBOX overlay, or them specifically joining you outright.All in all though I'd say the game has been worth it so far, and I look forward to the improvements they'll make and whatever else will happen down the line."

They pretty much said it was one of the best racing games ever. I owned FH4, got all the passes and DLCs and whatnot. So I paid 100€ for this one too, seeing as it was supposed to be a 10/10 game.So I bought the thing and quickly realized someone was lying to me. What was released was essentially a half-product, something that needed months of fixes and updates. And now, even after these months have passed, trees and leaves are still popping up when you drive closer and there's flickering in more detailed textures. And sadly this isn't on lower-end settings, I own a decent setup.How they still haven't been able to address this is beyond me, there are comments about this all over the net. There have been constant updates and the developers have acknowledged to having technical difficulties. So why a well-known review site have it a perfect 10 is beyond me. Sadly I've fallen for the hoax and shelled out a fair chunk of money for a game that isn't worth it even after several months of updates.FH4 was, and still is, a lot more enjoyable, so I can't fathom how they've managed to screw up the visuals so bad this time.  If they ever manage to fix the constant flickering and foliage popups, I'll get back to it, but for now, I've uninstalled it. Shame, if you ask me."

Many of the features such as accolades remain broken, online is still dodgy, and they have completely gutted many of the game reward amounts. Any new players will be hugely behind everyone who was able to get lots of money and good cars when the rewards were higher.Online works a bit better, but it's marred by bad matchmaking, cheaters, horrid lobby system, no ranked racing, and no way to enter into certain classes or race styles. Creative features do not allow you to save and edit maps (they've been promising this feature for a while, but instead prioritized reducing player rewards.)I will make one amendment to my previous review, turning off many of the driver controls, stability, etc makes drifting feel a lot better.==============Original review:The game itself is pretty good as a single-player experience but I can't recommend it for the multiplayer aspect which is being touted as the major feature. Most online activities are busted, Arcade challenges are bugged and when they do work you're lucky to get 2 or 3 players, limited communication options, player cars rarely populate into the world making it feel like a ghost town, and there are constant connection issues, not counting frequent crashes and other horrible bugs.I got the premium edition and so far it has absolutely not been worth it. The VIP benefits often ""forget"" to register correctly, the welcome pack cars are quickly outclassed by a few wheel spin wins or a decent upgrade.  I do plan on playing further to see if they can patch this game closer to what was advertised, and will revisit my review accordingly, but so far it's been a let down.Also of note:-Drifting is fun but drift scoring is wack. Feels like you get twice as many points drifting at 50MPH at 10 degrees than 40MPH going sideways.-Playing for one weekend I've already discovered 100% of the roads on the map, own a quarter of all cars and all but one house, did all barn finds, and found 90% of various other collectibles. The map is dense, but kind of small, I think I had a lot of time to explore because online doesn't work well..."

Hot Wheels is meant to be all about super high speeds and gravity defying layouts. The real problem is that Hot Wheels Park has absolutely terrible flow. It seems like absolutely zero thought was put into the layout of the map. Honestly, did the devs even playtest this DLC? Off the top of my head, here are some examples of track sections with bad design:> Sideways track (non-magnetic) that is too banked, so gravity pulls you towards the guard rail and you lose all your speed> Braking zones over a crest where there is low grip, so you crash into the guard rail and lose even more speed than is necessary> Uphill / almost vertical acceleration zones, where you take ages to build speed while the AI powers on and easily overtakes you> The half-pipe, which has absolutely no grip when you are not on the racing line, making it extremely boring to drive through> Extremely inconsistent physics on magnetic track, resulting in unpredictable car handling and acceleration> Sharp turns or heavy braking zones placed right after blind sections of track (like a loop) which are impossible to foresee so you just slam into the barrier (but the AI is programmed to take it perfectly)> The fact that you can't complete loops in most low cars because the force pushing you into the track is so great that the bottom of your car literally clips through the floor, losing you speedAnother problem with the DLC is the Hot Wheels Academy which is supposed to be the main attraction. Who on earth thought it would be a good idea to lock you out of using FAST CARS in HOT WHEELS and force you to use crappy slow cars that can barely go up a ramp? Not only does this make progression annoying, but it also just breaks the game. Even after becoming a Hot Wheels legend and unlocking X-class cars, certain maxed out cars (e.g. FE Sesto, BTTB) are UNUSABLE in Hot Wheels Park because their hidden PI rating is too high and the game thinks your Academy Rating is too low so it forces you to change car...Another big letdown with this DLC is the track builder. The opening race is - sadly - the best part of the DLC, because it takes you around the whole map and they even spend all this time explaining all the cool new track pieces (which is unfortunately plagued with cringe Forza dialogue). For some reason, however, they don't let you use ANY of these in Eventlab??? All you can do is place orange track, crossroads, and boosters... No Air Track, no Ice Track, no Water Flume, no Magnet Track, no Halfpipe. Oh yeah on the topic of massive disappointments, I should also mention that the Hot Wheels Goliath is garbage. It's meant to be the flagship race of the DLC but instead of taking you through the cool parts of the map it's just a mindless cruise around the perimeter with a few loops thrown in here and there. The weekly A-class event around the Ice Cauldron was more fun than the Goliath, which is saying a lot considering how often these weekly events are mind-numbingly boring.To top it all off, the racing is awful. The pre-made races are extremely short and like usual in Forza, you start right at the back. This makes it impossible to win at higher AI difficulties because there's isn't enough time to overtake everyone unless you ram into them early on. In addition to this, the track is narrow and the guardrail on both sides prevents you from dipping your wheels into the dirt to try and get past as is possible in the base game. Add to this the myriad of track layout issues I mentioned earlier and you get a recipe for disaster.Epic fail."

Absolutely recommend it, but maybe not for full price (idc how delusional western companies get with their prices, I'll never pay more than 50 euros). From what I've heard Premium Pass isn't worth buying either, because the content updates are insignificant, so beware. Just get the Hot Wheels stuff if you enjoy the game and want more.- , on par with what you had in something like DiRT 2/DiRT Rally, but with much better tarmac/grip physics. A bit simcade-ish.- Totally . I only have anti-break-lock assist enabled, but for some RWD muscle cars I also enable traction control. No other assists needed.- . You can play this game and practically enjoy a vacation to Mexico through it. You get to see 1:1 replicas of real-life landmarks (e.g. Aztec/Mayan pyramids).-  Yes, some are duplicates in different configurations (e.g. a regular 240SX and a Formula Drift 240SX), but it's still hilarious to me that people complaining about the car roster, when they probably haven't used a 10th of what's in the game. Admittedly, having some eastern-European car brands like Škoda and Lada would be nice though.- very . This is the 2nd prettiest RTX game I own (after Amid Evil). My AMD 5800X + NVidia RTX2070 run it at solid 75 fps on ultra/extreme settings with ray-tracing on.- The  - much stronger than in your average NFS game. Combine that with the spectacular car physics and you get a game where you actually have to know how to drive really well. On hardest difficulty you might even have to strategize in order to win, e.g. in one of my early races I started last and the 1st guy always built up a big lead and the race ended by the time I would've reached him. The trick was to not overtake the 2nd guy early, because he was able to stay in drafting distance of the 1st guy, so I basically had to do a slipstream train with him and bumper-boost him, until we eventually both overtook the 1st guy at the same time.- The ! It knows how to defend the inside line leading to corner and seems to have personalities: some are cheeky and will use you as a wall in corners, while others respect your space.- The  - this goes as far as everyone taking rally cars with official liveries if you take one like that, or e.g. If you upgraded some old Toyota Celica to 800bhp, the AI will also take old cars that got tuned up to beasts.- Nice , if you're willing to take different cars to races - take a buggy, trophy truck or SUV and you can get something like a DiRT 2 Raid or Landrush race, because the AI will match the car class. Also, it's not just circuit races. There's A->B rally/trailblazer/road race type races, as well as stunts drifting, gymkhana, rallycross, Baja off-road stuff... There's also underground street racing, which is a road/circuit racing but with traffic enabled. It is possible to take any car to any race type, but you're obviously going to have a bad time, if you take a RWD 1600 bhp Koenigsegg with racing slicks to an off-road race (then again, so will the AI, because they match your car class).-  is extensive. You can also set it up the aforementioned Koenigsegg with rally suspension and tires and change the drivetrain to AWD to fit it for off-road racing. Customization in terms of custom body parts however is not as extensive as in your usual NFS game, especially in the case of hypercars. Most of the upgrades are functional, affecting strictly only the car's power and behaviour.- . Other games (like NFS or DiRT) have you start with a slow car, which you can upgrade&tune to be better towards the end of the game, while also progressively unlocking better cars until you get a Lambo towards the end of the game. Forza Horizon 5 doesn't have that. You unlock stuff in the most random order. In fact, unlocking new stuff is partially tied to ""wheelspins"" (read: slotmachine), where you get a random cash reward or unlock a new cosmetic, a new car, whatever. Afaik, there's no way to buy additional rolls on the wheelspin for real money. You can also just buy new cars for in-game cash in any order you want. In just 2 hours I accumulated $1 million and the cars have their real-life prices reflected in-game, so I can buy almost any supercar with that money right off the bat. I started with a 2022 Supra, then rolled an old Celicia and a 2014 Porsche Spyder on the slotmachine. As you can probably tell, all 3 of these are in vastly different classes in terms of speed. Then I upgraded the Celica to the Spyder's level for less than 100k. So like I said, there's no order to unlocking anything.- . Also somewhat boring. I'm European, so seeing ancient Mayan pyramids is interesting for me, but only for the first time and some random latino guy going  kinda ruins the experience. Just speak Spanish or just English, make up your mind smh. While these are ""main"" missions, there's a not lot of them, and the races are very much fun. , do whatever you want, the game isn't really meant to be finished 100%.- Speaking of sandbox, after building some festivals, the game will take a crap on your world map and fill it to the brim with markers - basically you get the  but for a racing game.- The  have these silly side-objectives, where you need to run over some boxes in some area, take some screenshots in photo mode etc.. Some of them can be a bit annoying to get, but you want the accolade rewards from them for unlocking new stuff.-  is exactly what you expect it to be: just a bunch of . I was doing a weekly event in multiplayer where a team of players was racing a team of hardest AI. The more AI we overtook the more points we got. I got a good exit out of the final corner, which set me up to overtake the my teammate just before the finish line, but he pushed me into a wall instead. It wasn't even a case of getting extra points for 1st place because we were 3rd/4th. We only get points for overtaking AI, so he did it for no reason other than having a fragile little ego. There's no punishing them for this, you can't report unsportsman-like behavior like in simracers."

If you have played the previous, Forza Horizon 3 & 4. You know what's up ;) But for those of you who are stepping first hand into Forza, here's a bit about it:You are a well known racer, known for being able to drive really well, and gain a reputation. You can collect cars of a variety of brands, from Super cars, Rally cars, and even your Every day sort of cars. But with these cars you can customise them to your liking! You can design your own vinyl logos/designs, give it a new paint job, and even on the mechanical side of things, 'mod' your car to improve certain performances. Then, there's the fun part, Racing! Forza Horizon 5 is based in Mexico, where you can explore a wide range races, street races, dirt races, rally, etc. But then there's the Open World part. The world is stunning! Based on real sights seen in Mexico, with stunning details, graphics, sounds, and a whole open world to explore. You can play solo, or with friends, challenge your friends to races, or just mess around and drive Super Cars off the side of a Mountain... Whatever floats your boat really. In Short, I recommend this game to those who are interested in cars, racing, or just having a blast with some friends. And for those previous Forza Horizon players, if you don't have this game yet, What Are You Doing? ;) Hope this helped."

854,SUPER SHADÃO,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033553127/,2,,0,367.8,December,"29,",329,0,1,"This game slowly broke my heart.I've been a player since Horizon 1, my expectations were as low as it possibly could, let's be honest here, there are no racing games out there, apart from a few elitist sims that are just inaccessible fancier racing games for people to sink money into (which i'm guilty myself of), racing games for you to kick back with a pad and play are very dead, your only options being the subpar console exclusive gran turismo, far disconnected from its glory days, the NFS series which had a good entry, followed by a cancellation and a painfully cringeworthy, ADD hellscape of a grind simulator sequel.All I wanted was a mediocre, bare minimum experience to fill that empty niche, and SOMEHOW, Horizon 5 manages to disappoint.Are the physics bad? No, not really, are the graphics and sound bad? they aren't great, but are half decent enough, how is the gameplay? Really not bad.So, what's wrong with it? Literally everything else, game stability is lacking, netplay is horrendous, the UI isn't good, QOL changes were completely ignored and issues all the way back from Horizon 3 are still present, the online balancing and matchmaking are a joke AGAIN, the progression is nonexistent and modeled around player retention only.Let me walk you through the ""content"" of this game:1-Play through the core game, there are no real characters, duels, cutscenes, nothing, just sequences of races that unlock sequences of races, sure, i'm not expecting Racing Lagoon here or Mass Effect on wheels so I can vibe with that.2-After a dozen hours at most, finish most of the game's content, go see what else is there to do, find the blueprints and nothing else.From now on, that's it, you're stuck in a barren map, to replay the same races over and over again, you login every week, for a new season to start and a handful of new cars that the devs are holding over your head due to FOMO, god knows when they are making a comeback, so you don't want to miss them, right?You do a coop race that is everything but fun, the netplay is horrible, queues and loads take ages, the playerbase is more of a challenge than anything else the game can throw at you because they are SO BAD you'll need to win the race, and hold the bots back enough for the complete mentally challenged teammates to have a chance to pass, try that a couple times with a 12 minute interval between each 3 race stint and hope you get lucky eventually, then there are speedtraps, jumps and speedzones, for some reason mostly they are set to S2, the objectively worst class in the game and the goals are set so stupidly high, there is no point in trying them honestly, get a rimac or some unbalanced car, download an unbalanced setup and cheese them.Then there are championships, which are either a fun way to revisit some of the races with car restrictions and point system with the option of playing with a friend, or the absolute worst circuits you can muster with a car that should not be doing them, making it a frustrating mess.A little car specific challenge, which is usually fine, but sometimes takes a long, long grind to complete.And last and definitively least, treasure hunts and multiplayer challenges, the treasure hunts range from pathetically obvious to incoherent and the multiplayer...why would you even do that to yourself?If you have severe issues with masochism and enjoy having mental pain be inflicted on you, or if you are so desperate for validation that you're using meta knowledge to dunk on children to get a dopamine hit, you can play multiplayer.So what else is there to do? Nothing, nothing at all, zero, nil, nada.Wait for an underwhelming update that you'll play through in 45 minutes or a ""DLC"" that the devs will put minimal effort on. In a sidenote, how dare they release a ""rally dlc""? Who wanted this? Who was this designed for? The offroad cars don't even have an offroad model, NO ONE enjoys cross country, why would you theme an entire DLC around the worst aspect of the game? This feels like a slap in the face and was the tipping point for me to give up on this game.On a final note, the community, the devs actively support cheaters, communities of cheaters and the support is done by incompetent, unfair and borderline criminal personel, there are so many outrageous incidents that I cannot get into or this will become a twenty page essay, look up on youtube a video called ""The Dark Side of Modern Forza"" made by SP4 if you're interested in the shady, borderline criminal activity the devs are engaged with."

It extends and excels in many of the areas that FH4 was lacking. Such as the map, the car sounds, the graphics, and the overall detail this is apparent in every corner of the game. Being a major Forza series fan, I went into this game with my expectations held high. And boy was I not disappointed. Although the game is still rough around the edges, the sheer love and care that went into the game is simply breath taking. Everything from the scenery, ambience, diversity and cars. The game has taken every detail into account to the point that it actually feels like its own world. Cruising around the jungle quite literally feels like you are in a real jungle, with the intricate and realistic ambience that encompasses you while you play. One of the biggest changes implemented in FH5 is the change in breaking and suspension physics. Although very noticeable at first, both me and everyone I know prefer it, as it provides a slightly more realistic, yet easy-to-use driving style. It makes each car feel more stable and whole, allowing them to have more give, and ultimately more feedback. This paired with the amazingly detailed world (in looks and sound) means that driving around the FH5 map actually seems like you're going on a modern day cruise in your own 1 of 20 hyper car through the Mexican Desert. Something that FH4 was lacking. Each car looks, sounds and feels like its own beast, waiting to be unleashed. FH5 has captured an essence of open world car games that I feel FH4 never had. Emotion."

Horizon 5 is in a somewhat playable state on my Alienware Area 51-m Laptop. Horizon 5 does not work reliably on my custom desktop. Horizon 5 is an unfinished product that they clearly couldn't afford to finish without our investment post release.I will be returning Horizon 5 until it is discounted substantially.

Forza Horizon 5 is close to fitting in with the rest of these games, what saves it is the solid foundation that playground games has build over the last couple of years and the reputation of the studio itself.Forza Horizon 5 does not break any boundaries or revolutionizes the way you look at racing games. It does the same things the previous entries where known for (for better or for worse). The handling has improved while still having the simcade feeling most fans want from a Forza Horizon game, the car list is ever expanding and the graphics have been upgraded once more.The big gripe I have with this game is that these improvements all feel expected, what came as a surprise where the bugs that plague the game since launch. Especially the multiplayer feels incomplete and buggy. Long loading times between races and random disconnects from the online features. Try completing a Forza Arcade Event... you can't, most of the time. This might seem like I am not happy with the game. Then why do I recommend it?Playground games has proven that, different to other AAA Developers, they care about their games. I am quite confident that all the gripes I have will be addressed and that the game will change over time like the previous entry.For Fans of the Forza Horizon franchise it's a must buy, everyone else should wait for the first sale or the release of more content through the planned dlc."

The game had an strong beginning and actually held my excitment by receiving new cars, going through the story with funny attractions, new challenges and different types of races very stable. It gives you many opportnunities how you wanna play gameplay wise, such as if you wanna play alone or with other racers from the community, on which difficulty when you are alone, which kind of activity in general you wann do on the whole map in Mexico and much more.For people who like a more hyperactive atmosphere through the story and likes to tune and collect many cars as possible through honest work definitely worth playing!"

It's just built different)One of the many problems this game has is it's Mini stories... The writing and dialouge in them are so... Childish?And the spanglish forced into every single sentence is so annoying.If you like racing games or just cars in general i highly recommend you try this game out as it has a lot to offer. Street races, Dirt races, offroad and you can just pick whatever car you want and go with it everywhere."
948,Joshua Norton,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Apfelsator/,2,,1,22.3,November,"25,",288,0,1,"I really recommend this game for anyone looking for a casual'ish, relaxing racing game that neither demands you to have knowledge of specific details about cars nor that you have an extraordinary driving skill.it can be as relaxis as it can be competitive and exiting and with lots of setting-options for difficulty and driving behavior, i think it fits most people...or rather most people can make it fit their taste and liking, especially since you are able to adjust everything constantly.this isnt a gran tourismo or asetto corsa nor is it a mario kart but its a mix between those which i personally really enjoy.the cars feel realistic enough while driving, unless you create ridiculous tunings and go off-road with a sports car, but thats fun in itself.one downside is that most features are locked behind an online-demand, which is a downside but also nothing new to forza horizon.regarding performance, its pretty impressive how well this game runs with the graphics it provides as well as how big the world is, although there currently are issues with textures not loading sometimes or really slowly(for some walls, gates and so on).otherwise, these devs really put some techno-magick to work here.the mexico-inspired world looks great and has several different biomes, which add a very enjoyable variety, unlike the pretty bland world that was forza horizon 4's england-inspired map, so this is a big plus in my books(also, finally driving on the proper side of the road, ffs :p).just one advice, it can be *very* grindy as you can unlock *a lot* of stuff, there is weekly ""seasonal""-events to unlock vehicles which the game states are ""rare"" or ""hard to get"" which could lure you into grinding sessions but keep in mind those vehicles will not show up for only one such weekly events but several times a year.other unlock-mechanics such as ""wheelspins"" which are essentially loot-boxes(although completely free!) add to that grinding urge and being constantly rewarding with experience points for literally *everything* you do will add to that as well.just keep in mind that you are not loosing out on anything if you take a slow approach to unlocking things, this game will be around for a while for you to fully enjoy."

I recommend it.BUT it is not a frickin solo game, is it? I DO NOT recommend it if you want to play with friends or family. The moment you decide to do so the game turns into a Loading Sim and if by some fluke in the fabric of reality you connect to each other you can make 1 (ONE) race and then the whole thing starts again. Out of my 104 hours so far me and my friends have played TOGETHER maybe about 20 hours. And we continue trying to play because there is nothing else to play of the sort. (Can't wait for TDU Solar crown)If you want to play with other non friends or family people online, the game turns into a Bumper car Sim. The option to create custom adventures or whatever they call it in this version #5 is GONE. No more no-collision or custom class racing.I mean what THE FRICKIN HELL Turn10? Its like you copy-paste all bugs from horizon 1 forward and any improvements you made you delete and get a brand new team to design and program the game from scratch+the above mentioned bugs.I have been a loyal Forza fan for years and have played all games since Forza motorsport 1 to present. I was disappointed in FH4 and after this one I dont think I will buy any Forza ever.The game is basically in alpha so do not buy it at full price and definitely dont buy the premium version. The game doesnt have too many hours of solo gameplay (about 20 maybe more if you go for all accolades and achievements) and with the premium you will halve that."

The gameplay on this one is way more adventurous as it gives you rewards for collecting cars as well as taking part in different race and mission types. Some things you can do in this game include; story missions, special events, public arcade events, community challenges, and racing in dirt, cross-country, street and road racing scenes.One thing I would like to highlight though is that during early access there were no major exploitations going on, but now that it is finally out for everyone there are A LOT of money/XP exploitations going on. Lastly, the server connection (as usual for Forza Horizon games) is very poor causing constant disconnections, friends disappearing right in front of you and lagging.Graphics-☑ Masterpiece☐ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Will do☐ Bad☐ AwfulAlthough my computer is not powerful enough to run this on the highest settings, I can tell you that the game is still absolutely stunning, even on high! If you want to go past ultra there is an extreme mode, this plus ray-tracing make the game a visual masterpiece.Audio☐ Amazing☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Not too bad☐ BadThe sound effects and music in this game are both very satisfying! The engine sounds have had an upgrade, making them sound that much better. The SFX of the cars on different terrain also sound great and very realistic. Finally, the music is a perfect fit for the games setting and makes you feel fully immersed.Story-☐ Lovely☐ Good☑ Average☐ Not great☐ NoneRacing games (especially Forza) usually lack a good story and instead focus on the pure freedom of racing, this one is no different. There are story missions, however, these are more like ""main character syndrome"" races showing your rise to the top of the Horizon Festival and less about being engrossed in a nice story.Difficulty-☐ Just press a bunch of buttons☐ Easy☐ Significant brain usage☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Not so easy☐ Difficult☐ Dark SoulsThis really depends on what you're looking to do at Horizon Mexio. Looking to do some PvP and rivals? then I'd recommend trying to perfect racing a little as some people on this game are VERY good at racing. There are Co-op and solo modes you can play if you're not up for the challenge of facing other players and these modes have an adaptable difficulty setting.Grind-☐ Nothing☑ Only if you care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isnt necessary to progress☐ A bit grindy sometimes☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ InsanityNo grind required at all, unless you want to have every achievement, get to the top of the leaderboard, etc. This game can be as laid back and chill as you want it to be, take it at your own pace if that's what you want to do.Price☑ Just buy it☐ Worth the price☐ Wait for sale☐ Maybe if you have some spare money left☐ Not recommendedIt's an expensive game yes! But it's a brand new game and is one of the best rated games this year already. I don't see it's price dropping anytime soon so make sure to just grab it and get in on the fun, or get gamepass and play for free :)"

1028,Wiseprat,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198139841992/,2,,0,507.4,November,"10,",94,0,1,"I edited my review to reflect the current state of the game (as of November 2022). I went from recommending this game to not recommending this game. It's not much different to Forza Horizon 4, and the new cars aren't enough to make the jump in my opinion. All of the Forza Horizon games at the very least added something new from the previous iteration or at least tried to improve on a feature added. This game, on the other hand, actually removes features that was in the previous edition. There is no ranked racing, no custom championships (a feature missing since FH3), no businesses to name a few missing features that were in either FH3 or FH4. The game is also missing a plethora of cars that were in the base game of multiple Forza Horizon games such as the Lotus Esprit V8. Pagani Huarya , Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series, not the mention some missing brands that are staples of the series such as Alfa Romeo, Lancia, and Fiat. Even the famed barn finds are disappointing in this game with a solid 4 new cars only. 4/14 cars are new to Horizon. The rest of the barn find cars were cars found in FH4, most of them could be purchased from the Autoshow. In comparison, FH4 had 5/15 cars that were in FH3. The rest of the cars were new to the Horizon series. FH4 introduced the controversial seasonal playlist where the developer would bring in a time-locked car that is technically available anytime but is difficult to obtain if you somehow missed a week. That mode is back in FH5, but is worse. The time-locked cars are now mostly cars that were available at the start of FH4 that have been purposefully held back in the name of content.  There's also a couple of other issues I have with the game. The stories in the game have some terrible dialogue. Cut scenes can't be skipped, even if you've seen the cut scene before. There seems to be a big emphasis on adding useless cosmetics to the game (Clothing for your avatar who you barely see, horns, emotes, Forza Link Chat Phrases) that it feels like a free to play game. For all the stuff they add for your avatar, you can barely customize that creature. You can only select the default body type. There's no options for facial hair. The player models in Test Drive Unlimited 2 had more life to them. Yet every update, there seems to be an influx of added junk and not things that players actually want. Which racing driver is going to show up to a track meet with Watermelon Crew Socks? For a racing game, there is an actual lack of racing gear that's extremely disappointing. If you're gonna emphasis emotes, clothing, and such in the game, let me at least dress my guy like a racing driver.The worst thing is that this game is basically Forza Horizon 4 without the flair that FH4 had and that's saying something seeing as I thought FH4 was the worst in the series prior to this game. The first DLC was mostly just a re-used DLC from FH3. All of the recycling they do in this game is super noticeable and I've been noticing that even the most ardent fans of the franchise are not happy with the state of the game. I'll probably be playing this game a lot even with its glaring issues because at the end of the day, this game doesn't really have any competition in the arcade racing scene.TL;DR: The state of this game is disappointing and it feels like a visit to your local recycling center"

There is constant fun and exploration. The graphics are great, sometimes I stop and watch the car I drive or the surrounding details. I definitely recommend playing it.

1036,J.Jonesey#4002,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198354665212/,2,,1,317.5,November,"9,",203,0,1,"I have now played this title for over 30 hours since pre-release as i pre-ordered the Premium Edition of this game. Purely because i cannot be arsed, I will not be dwelling entirely on the fact that the game does not work for some people whether they are half arsed and cannot be bothered to fix it or just plain stupid.From a standpoint of when i first opened the game, I felt like i was finally entering the horizon i once knew back on the Xbox 360 during 2012, With Forza Horizon 4 i did not feel this at all. I loved the location of Scotland but it did not feel i was entering the excitable festival i now feel once again in this game. Although i appreciate this game may have some bugs for others on the standpoint of being able to play the game i have no regret's paying £80.Moving onto the review of the game from a gameplay standpoint. Once loaded in the first thing i took in was the truly cinematic graphics right from the start. It really hit me as too many games nowadays have the same sort of graphics i've always been used to for a few years now... But this game really nailed it with the entire graphics style and design. Unfortunately i cannot quite afford to play in 4K or on ""extreme"" but i can easily handle ""ultra"" on a good 60fps. But overall graphics are absolutely astonishing for artwork screenshots and amazing gameplay... I just advise not going of those who fake their shots by editing them to look completely different through lightroom etc. Try to go off legitimate straight from the game screenshots and videos. One part of the graphics i heavily took into consideration was the night time graphics... Their is not a lot of games i can say gives me amazing night vibes within driving. Titles i could name now based on driving would mainly be Assetto Corsa, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Grand Theft Auto V (With applicable graphics mods) and perhaps The Crew 2. But again this game nailed that factor with night driving... It is a true experience.One of the next things i noticed was obviously the sounds of the cars, Again comparing it to previous titles i would definitely say the sounds are best to date for every car in the game. Yes some may sound a like or unrealistic in certain ways however i find that most cars with a unique sound or iconic sound full fills that experience. Once car i chose out of pure curiosity and previously poor experiences was the 370z and the Fairlady Z (both Nissan) and the sounds are incredible for both of these cars. More of the Fairlady Z i would say... But yeah, every car has had an excitable sound in some way to be honest.Moving on from sounds as i know a lot has already been said about that. The scenery of the game itself as in the location and the map truly took me by surprise. I did not know much about mexico so i was kind of under the impression the majority would be dirt roads and tracks. But once i saw the impressive long distance highways and longer roads i was absolutely astonished by the level design and background as i was racing through the streets and on the highways of mexico. It feels incredible, especially for true top speed tests and just cruising along with whomever but overall the map does not disappoint with the picture opportunities and more.Coming to a point which was obviously going to be mentioned. Car choice and the car list, phenomenal, i couldn't help myself at first so i took a gander at the car list that was released on the Forza Website. I was slightly disappointed at some iconic's missing at first. But once i got into the game there was so much more that ended up existing into the game. I found myself at yet again an incredible choice of cars that were base game and although games like Assetto Corsa have a large mod choice. It's just not the same when all the cars are at the same level of detail and they are already all there! Finally i have always been a collector of many traits in real life with die cast cars etc. So the new collection feature is just so small but so incredible and i love it! It's like having some kind of top trump collection but inside of a game. It is so small but makes all the difference in my eyes.Finally to one of the few points i would like to make... There does seem to be some small time issues with online gameplay, Although it is fixed in the sense you can now connect properly with the allowing of the Protocol file inside the Forza Horizon 5 directory through the windows firewall. I have noticed me and my friend were still having session issues (not disconnection issues) once we were hitting around 180mph+. I feel this may have to do with the whole locational idea where you ""change session""? When you are in different long distance locations. Apart from this i don't really have anything that is a problem that cannot be changed by settings or personal preference!One more final thing i would like to say to anyone looking to buy the game, All these bad reviews you are seeing are unfortunate mishaps with the game itself unfortunately just not working on some systems due to whatever reason... I personally feel this may have to do with having too much safety in regards to anti virus as i only rely on windows defender and nothing else but that's just speculation. The other thing i am especially taking into account is this is Forza's first proper release on steam as far as i am aware? I know they ""ported"" Forza Horizon 4 but this has been a fresh release to steam as well as MS store and Xbox etc I just personally think a lot of people are throwing their toys out the pram and trying to sabotage others fun because they can't have fun themselves... If it doesn't work for you at all, Either wait or refund, If it does? You honestly shouldn't have problems with it... If you do become one to talk about the quality and say it's a copy etc, I truly think you need to experience how far gaming has come since the originals and if you are one of those and you still have stupid expectations. You are becoming one that is ruining the gaming community. Shut up.Ps, The wheelspins are no longer absolutely ♥♥♥♥ so you can actually win more cars than clothes and horns!!! Have fun everyone and hopefully see you out there!"

The basic formula is great, and the driving is fun, but the game feels like a DLC for forza horizon 4. They didn't improve on anything except the map and weather effects.Online freeroam is actually worse than before. If you are looking for a world full of life, with other players around you doing their own thing, look elsewhere. The few times when there's players around me, it's 3-4 of them max.The hourly forzathons were reworked, and now, instead of having the whole lobby rushing to do it, you're stuck doing them on your own.The team has put absolutely zero effort on making the UI more user friendly. Filtering is basic, and the filters aren't ordered properly. Menus and car classifications oftentimes make little sense. In online play there's no way to decide on what kinda race you want to race, and many more things that could have been addressed with this new installment.The team seems to be lazy, and doesn't take the time to address the players (except the sad excuse for a Q&A once a month on stream). The big events (christmas gifting and world cup) are just pretend. The outcome is predetermined and the bar progresses as the season does. In the patches up to now, they've focused more on removing fun aspects of the game, instead of actual bugs and cheaters. All leaderboards are riddled with very very obvious cheated values. Removing them wouldn't even require much effort on PG's part. Wheelspins were nerfed to all hell, and my VIP (that I paid extra for) has been rendered completely pointless.There's many more issues and many more promises they haven't even tried to keep. As of now, I can not recommend the game for the price. Get yourself FH4 on sale and have a blast with a better populated world until FH5 drops in price.I regret pre-purchasing the ultimate edition, total waste of 100€.Edit. The only reason I keep on logging in is the weekly playlist and my fear of missing out on something. I still hope for a better game in the future. I paid for the expansions, so I'll keep on logging in until then. The DLC's could be good, but as of now I am not optimistic."

1073,Cheesy Wotsit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cheesywotsit/,4,,0,81.0,December,"26,",189,0,1,"Forze Horizon 5 is a good game but an awful racing game.Let me qualify this, the game design, presentation and gameplay loop is engaging and fun. It is all delivered at a pace and speed that means players are constantly being bombarded with new content and new races and on the surface it looks like their is a huge wealth of content and way to much for a player to ever possibly see or do in the time they have the game. The issue though is that all this content is puddle deep in it's complexity combined with a no limits approach to car selection, racing, difficulty and course design and a gameplay loop that is designed to keep players engaged with a near zero difficulty system that can be described as do a race, do a thing, win a prize, forget about it move on to the next race. The net result is that while the game is indeed fun and engaging it is a shockingly poor racing game.Traditional racing games engage the player by giving them a host of cars, a host of tracks or race classes and a structure that is meant to engage the by teaching them race craft building their confidence with the courses and progressing them through ever more powerful and capable cars placed in to more challenging race competitions or AI.FH5 does none of this. On the surafec it has the cars and it has the race class and it has the varying courses and race types but unlike other racing games where a Rally Car tuned and set up correctly would only ever have a chance on a Rally course in FH5 you can choose literally any car you want and race it under any circumstances you wish. To put this in context I raced a Cross Country race in a Ford Bronco (an Off Road 4 x 4 perfectly suited for this type of race) the next three opponents had a Mazda MX5, a Golf R and a Mazda RX7. Want to race a 1930s Ford against a modern Hyper car and win, easy run the vehicle through the auto modification set up and you are good to go.The game has a wealth of options that are all designed to remove ANY blockers from players doing exactly what they want and while this sounds like it should be a good thing the long and short of it is the game has 300 cars in it but you could do almost everything you want in the game with the car you start with. Run it through the auto modification set up prior to whatever race you want to do and you are good to go. Their is no limitations on this and no advantage or disadvantage to using a non suitable vehicle and the Ai itself is tune matched to whatever car you turn up in.Difficulty is set by the player themselves prior to starting the race but again the purpose of these settings seems to be less about making for engaging and challenging racing and more about keeping players engaged.The keep players enaged gameplay loop badly affects the 'racing' itself. The majority of races are over and done with in five minutes, quick burst, win a prize forget about it and move on. The issue here is that the sheer number of courses, combined with how forgettable they are and the lack of defined race structure (the player always starts off in 7th and has to battle through to the front for some reason respective of difficulty, class of car, how much or little it is tuned) and just how short the races are means that the player has little if any opportunity to apply typical race craft techniques (learning the course, brake points, turn in points, etc) but even with this the game is truly odd with it's approach. Players are rated with on skill and style points the game wants you to go through corners with outlandish power slides and fancy moves but on the harder AI difficulty settings combined with the power matched opponents and the fact that they are predicatble to a fault with their driving style you have no option but to apply correct race craft if you want to win.It really is one of the strangest games I've played, it doesn't want to put any limiters in the way you play the game. It wants you the player to define how hard or easy the game should be for you to play it, it wants you to choose the style that you play it and it throws it all together with a rabid fire play and forget style of gameplay loop that keeps players going by constantly rewarding them with more, mostly useless stuff it makes for a fun and engaging game but it's lack of defined structure makes it a shockingly bad racing game."

But set the difficulty 1 notch lower and they forget how to turn or drive in general.- People are being banned for the weirdest reasons when making liveries. Even for recreating historically accurate liveries.- Accolades being broken, some flat out refuse to be unlocked even when meeting the criteria.- Eliminator being so broken that it's nearly unplayable, yet you're forced to do 1 round every week due to seasonal challenges.I'll delete or change my review if the situation changes, but imo just wait it out till most of the issues are fixed before buying the game."

Online still has some issues, but nontheless fun to play if you don't take it too seriously - there's not much at stake, any multiplayer races that are needed to progress in Seasonal Playlists, are co-op, not PvP."

I don't even know why I keep playing this.. (it's the pvp I enjoy but damn) it's hard to keep playing with all these issues the Janitor Team of PGG can't seem to fix. The game has more graphical issues than effin cyberpunk. Pvp Race transition crashs.. sudden crashs out of nothing. Cheaters.. omfg the cheaters are so blatantly obvious .. it effin hurts.. it just hurts because I really really love the franchise but PGG dropped the ball.. nearly a year later this game remains a piece of broken ♥♥♥♥. Screw you PGG your next game will be gamepass only if I even bother with it. Even if you magically fix this absolutely horrendous code. I can't accept paying 100 euros for such broken unfixable ♥♥♥♥.If Turn 10's Motorsport series also ends up being this broken.. Forza T10 and PGG will be dead for me.----Ah current years major Media lie for the Gaming Awards. Every single Gaming Journo praised this Game as a perfect installment of the Forza Horizon franchise.It was only to flex themselfs for the Gaming Awards because this game is broken on nearly every single aspect.New smoke? Half broken (red smoke from street race checkpoints pixelated)Multiplayer? Nearly totally broken. This games Battle Royal Mode called The Eliminator has heavy sync issues resulting in dead matches where everyone is invisible.And when it works.. there is a high chance you can't challenge other players to get better cars .. again resulting in a dead match.Loading into pvp races via horizon open ""can"" take up to 10+ minutes if the forza gods decide to annoy you even more.(same issue in fh 4 tho)This games Forzathon Life called Horizon Arcade.. broken because of no players willing to do it on the map there is no notification no matchmaking nothing.. guys on the map have to see it and have to be willing to do it which literally never happens. That results in accolades (this games progression) becoming unobtainable.Which is a huge problem since not only these tied to Horizon Arcade are broken. Some challenges won't even register.. again resulting in a frustrating gaming experience and a lot of wasted time.Then there is the convoy coop in the open world. Broken. Same problems like in the The eliminator mode.Leaderboards ofc full with cheaters. No surprise there. But instead of banning them. The devs ban designs apparantly ""violating terms of service"". Yes.. weed leafs can get you banned out of the ability to share your designs.Their known problems list is filling up with countless problems... but no fixes in sight. Since release there was 1 patch. FIxing nothing besides nerfing their own design mistakes. Like buying 100000 jeeps to get super wheelspins out of their skill progression window. Or afk racing 50 laps of the biggest race. There is literally a bot mode that drives for you. Just hold accelerate to win ! Even in pvp. Wet dream of every gaming journo.AI isn't fun to drive against. Either they are to hard or to easy. No inbetween. Boring as hell. At least rivals works where you can compete with friends/clans/randoms times. (just dont pick a cheater or you want to uninstall the game) Rivals is the practice mode that can make you a god on wheels until you arrive at...Horizon Open Meta Racing.. you can't choose the kind of racing.. you can't choose anything. You have to pick what you get and race. Don't want that awful S2 Cross Country racing list? To bad .. do it or return and repeat until you get a playlist that you like. Can take a while tho. Again.Oh and if you are really really unlucky you might get some kind of memory leak that degrades performance after a hour or so.Only scratching the surface of all the problems. Like crashs out of nothing.. AA out of hell. Texture streaming issues that makes some trees look like vanilla minecraft.Sigh... I payed freaking 100 euros for this. Because I loved fh 4. I never had issues with it .. in the windows store... thats why I bought fh 5 on steam at release to support the devs.But they don't need support. They need devs getting their ♥♥♥♥ together and fix the damn game.I have a love hate relationship with the game at the moment. When it works it's fun. Really fun. A super good car sandbox packed with content.. dev made and user generated.When.. it... works.. tho.Will update this review once they get their ♥♥♥♥ together otherwise I can't recommend it. I just can't.Throw it on the market for the gaming awards and fix later. The game. Sad times in AAA gaming. I honestly believe it needs to collapse to change. But won't happen. We sheeps buy it anyway.---Updating review because of the new Patch 12.03.2021...Again a large patch that fixed nothing major. Arcade still ♥♥♥♥.. Eliminator still broken... Horizon Open Meta Racing now even more for children with attention spans of a goldfish since they decreased the races per playlist to 3 from 5 and removed the long races like goliath from it entirely. ( Yes it sucked if you joined a game and they were racing on it resulting in you waiting a long time... but actually racing in these is hella fun and I liked it.) Never seen someone complaining about it but that seems to be a trend with playground games patches.FIxing minor stuff and changing fun content that nobody ever asked for but ignoring the ♥♥♥♥ people complain about since inofficial release. Major disappointment. It's like the only support the game gets is from the Janitors from PGG HQ within their basement. I'm speechless how they still can't get it right. They just have to fix the mp.. how hard can it be? When former games worked flawless in that regard? Mindblown.---Updating again because of last patch of the year because devs need holidays too I suppose. Who cares about a broken AAA game ? Game Awards are done so mission accomplished ?Online seems to be more stable and we actually now have traffic in horizon life ! Hurray.. but what about other players? How many people did I see within 5 minutes driving through the map... 3. Yes three! People. Other than that. Eliminator still has 1-2 second freezes while starting a head to head race. Arcade still ghost towns (at least it's now scaled per person so solo is possible, bandaid from the 12.03 patch). And Horizon Meta Racing still has some weird sync issues. Some accolades still reset. Seasonal Tressure Hunt still broken. Not one season without bugged challenges. Gotta love it !"

However, this improves the experience a little bit, making the car have a bit more weight in the feel, thus making it a bit more predictable to drive on.-  Some wheels had issues on launch, such as Force Feedback not being recognized on launch. Some managed to get it to work with some shenaniganry like replugging the wheel when running or some other method. Some wheels might not work at all (some Fanatec gear, I've heard)- I've still found this version to be way more enjoyable to play on a Gamepad, however. Good to see some improvements though for those who want it.Bugged Accolades/Challenges- Some Accolades are impossible to complete, such as PR stunts in a specific car.- This is only an issue for the completionists, and absolutely will not feel the need to do till 70 hours into the gameTrigger happy livery bans- I have seen a lot of people get banned for weeks or 8000 years (not kidding) without warning on doing minor rule breaks on the liveries.- A friend got banned for having ""who tf is"" in a car for profanity, and a person on Reddit got banned for ""sexual content"" when doing the classic Harley Quinn pose in a skin-tight suit. The latter is understandable, but for 8000 years with no prior warnings? Sure.- Also inconsistency on rules is shown. A vinyl group of a beer brand can get you banned, but the tobacco brand Malboro doesn't?As long as you follow the TOS, don't expect much from wheel support and play with friends, you're going to have a lot of fun with the seasonals and custom blueprint races."

The story is pretty average, you dont really care about what you're doing or the characters you're doing it for its more of a turn your brain off and try out the different kinds of races and cars. I love the landscape of mexico and its a big step up from FH4's map. The selection of cars is huge, though it is missing some pretty big brands we've seen in previous games that I used a lot . the creative hub is still pretty much the same and i do wish they would make it easier for things that arent from content creators to get the recognition some of them deserve. (such as a search for new, though i do understand it can be difficult with a big player base.) I bought the premium edition of the game and i can say that i think it was well worth getting to play the game early plus not have to worry about paying for future dlc, but i think that its a little buggy for now and would recommend waiting for a sale or buying just the normal edition if you cant wait. the game is really inconsistent with how it runs. I am using an rtx 3080 and ryzen 5800x, and i can get up to 60-70 fps with almost everything maxed at 4k, my problem with it is that the game will start to use less and less of your gpu/cpu and end up dropping your framerate significantly while also causing stuttering. i haven't had it crash on me but it definitely gets annoying playing for a few hours and having 20-30fps lower than what i had earlier. overall id probably give this game a 7.5-8/10 and would highly consider making it higher whenever they decide to fix all the bugs and the problem with gpu usage."

Same art going on now, see ^ pics. Motion blur turned to 11. Look close, see the decade old assets, poorly met textures etc etc.Those who voted for Outstanding Visuals need to open their eyes, throw some god rays and some DoF and these people orgasm. The map is naff. Its like the Forza 4000 just spat out another random map. Mexico apparently has the same sorta junctions/intersections ( + y ) /corners and sweeping roads as Scotland and Australia. TBH I'd expect Mexico to be more open with long roads and straight roads, not the curvy stuff you'd expect from a hilly place. Which brings me to...Location, it's rubbish. Mexico is boring, Mexico has no real motor industry, Mexico has huge rates of poverty so Horizons a bit of a kick in the face. Mexico is another arid map.Wanted Japan, huge cities to push our consoles and PCs along with rolling hills to drift some of Japans finest. But the devs went with Mexico? The Mecca of nout.MP is a huge step back, like HUGE! You connect randomly to people around your map location, sounds great but nope. Meet someone on a drive, take a wrong turn and gone. Looking for curse meets, good luck as not on the map. The game didn't build on play styles in the last titles? It made it worse. What is the point on openworld MP in this game? It doesn't work! Take 4 and the way people played in freeroam and build on that, not take away? I would love an active world with meet points for cruses, drifts, top speeds. But in this its pointless, its temporary, its BS.Racing. Racing is much the same, testosterone fueled teens using you to corner cus the cant brake due to the latter. You miss checkpoint flags, you see no point. This is a franchise with a Lego DLC, aim low in driving standards.Cars. Usual line up we have had for years which is a shame, they keep dropping cars, even cars they have charged for, while adding others like those China cars.I mean, throw the old cars into a 2nd hand bin, make them available at least! 2CV, Tuscan. Why not? Just expand the game FFS! From EA to now I give it 6/10. A cheap map pack in my books. Nothing new, much the same, different map, worse MP experience. My hearts not pumping in races, my brains not interested in bland environments when the MB turned off. Try harder for £90."
1167,BavGod,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/,2,,1,369.0,November,"28,","5,141",0,1,"Playground Game's beloved arcade-styled open world celebration of cars and insufferable festival dialogue written by middle aged people desperately trying to find the pulse of youth culture is back, trading the damp back roads of the UK for the volcanic mountains, swamps and deserts of Mexico. Forza Horizon 5 has taken everything Playground Games learned over the continuous development of Forza Horizon 4 and has remixed the flow of the game, in some ways for the better while in others the game falters.  Playground Games has eschewed fans demands for a Horizon game set in Japan, instead crafting an open world inspired by the varied terrain of Mexico. This game world is larger and more varied than  Forza Horizon 4's, offering the long stretches of highway, twisty mountain passes, long straight drag strips and plenty of water, mud and sand for players to plow through. It's richly detailed and gorgeous, which makes hunting down the fast travel and experience granting collectibles less of a chore than it may seem like on paper. In somewhat of a departure from previous Horizon games, there isn't really a traditional major metro urban area in the game, instead the game features a small city with labyrinthine streets and tunnels which is an interesting change and allows for some really interesting more technical races. Progression in Forza Horizon 5 is a remix of previous games, allowing players to ultimately construct multiple horizon outposts that represent each style of racing present in the game (road races, street races, offroad races, cross country races and PR Stunts) and within each outpost there are a handful of unlockable activities. In order to unlock these outposts and their activities, players must obtain accolades. Accolades are available for almost any activity in the game: online races, creating liveries and tunes, taking photos, free roam driving and of course winning races. No matter how you choose to spend your time in Horizon, you will make forward progress which allows any type of player to see the entirety of the main game. Unfortunately this is a two edged sword, the game doens't really feel like it builds to much of anything. Unlocking everything means entering the hall of fame and unlocking a new series of accolades as well as Trial challenges. If you are one of those players that wishes Horizon would force you to start with a clapped out hooptie and climb the economic ladder, your prayers haven't been answered here. Horizon 5 throws cars and credits at it's players constantly, but with so much content, completionists will appreciate this fact.The driving in FH5 feels much the same as previous games and that is fine by me. Each car feels distinct based on it's drivetrain layout: mid engine cars handle differently than front engine cars, front wheel drive cars tend to understeer, all wheel drive cars launch incredibly and hold traction well in a variety of terrain but understeer, rear wheel drive cars are prone to spinning if proper care isn't exercised. It's the perfect balance of realism and arcade, whereas cars Need for Speed and The Crew feel roughly the same with some cars simply being faster than others, you will fall in love with specific cars in Forza Horizon basewd on the way they compliment your strengths and weaknesses behind the wheel. The faint tinge of realism also makes the game world more compelling to navigate. The biggest shortcoming with FH5 comes in the changes made to arcade mode. In FH4, arcade events would spring up on the map at the top of the hour, and all players would receive notifications with a fast travel option to participate. In FH5, arcade events happen every ten minutes and two pop up at  atime fracturing the server's population; assuming anyone is paying attention in the first place. The requirements to complete these events is also irritatingly challenging. Assuming you can get a full crew in place, some challenges require top tier play while the arcade events in FH4 generally set  a lower bar and didn't foment tension between participants. Arcade mode being a mess wouldn't be a big deal if it wasn't the best  way to earn Forzathon Points (FP) which can be used in a special marketplace to buy exclusive and high value items. The rest of FH5's online robust offerings fall prey to the same headaches as they always have: cooperative modes as plagued by drivers who don't understand that they are on a team and will ram you, playground games are usually spoiled by half of one team dropping out as soon as they feel they won't win, etc. The Eliminator modes returns, it was a late addition to FH4 and is a car based battle royale which is interesting but I don't feel terribly compelled to endure the long match making times in order to continually play it.With over 500 cars (the team at Playground Games is continually adding more), a wide variety of races and challenges, custom livery design, custom tuning and plenty of online modes, Forza Horizon 5 is a very strong package that remixes the elements of previous games in a way that is largely a step forward and keeps the experience fresh. There is simply no substitute for Horizon. It's imperfect, a little cheesy at times and is not breaking new ground, but for a fan like me, it hasn't grown stale either... If you love cars and can't be bothered with the technical demands of sim racers, you can't do any better than Forza Horizon 5."

What kind of Concept is this?Also the vareity of Tracks is very limited, there is no ranked mode, you cant modify your car between races, the loading times are sometimes beyond 5 Minutes (even after the patch)The Seasonal Event Playlist was refreshing at first, but got boring aready because you will always do the same Challenges just to get a Wheelspin or a ""Hard to find"" Car which you just can buy from the Auction House with the Money the Game throws at you.I get that this Game might not be about havig the best Online Race experience and is fun for people who just want to do pointless offline races here and there. But thats not for me."

This is the most fun I've had in a Forza game ever. They improved so much over FH4, the Online services/netcode have improved greatly which isn't saying much but I'm glad to see they've done something. The UI is super clean and much easier to understand. The car selection isn't great but here's hoping they add even more great cars, but mainly more Lotus'. Sadly with most games these days you are buying a project and not a product but FH5 is by far the most polished multiplayer game this year."

No game is perfect and especially racing games too, but this one scratched an itch i had for a long time after obtaining every singe car including Horizon edition cars in FH3 and FH4, and i know that Playground Games are going to be perfecting and adding more to the game as it goes on!"

I'll say its a 9/10 and easily the best game in the franchise so far! I really hope that Forza Motorsport 8 can match it. I miss closed circuit racing q.qon a more specific note, there have been a number of pleasant changes to the formula this time around which I feel will give the game more of a shelf life for players that enjoy the sense of progression that was somewhat lacking in Forza Horizon 4.Personally for me, the new Car Collection view (and it's associated rewards system, sort of like getting five stickers and getting a free cup of coffee but for collecting cars) and the transition away from a fixed ""Do races, unlock more races, repeat"" progression system for the various towards the new Adventure system has certainly helped me stay glued to the game after 20 hours and counting! The new core progression system involves you being able to select which sorts of events you want to prioritise, and allows you to spend ""Accolade"" points that you accrue by completing events, beating challenges (sort of like the progression system from FH4's Lego DLC) and playing through the various storylines that the game has scattered throughout the world which unlock as you level up the festival sites. The festival sites are once again in the multiples this time around after the (imo disappointing) single festival site in FH4, and you unlock these sites by spending accolade points, and you can expand them and their associated events by activating ""Adventures"" which are mini-showcase events, and provide a pretty fun variety of gameplay.There have also been a number of quality of life improvements to the tuning and upgrading of cars, including the ability to rev the engine during the upgrade/customization process to sample the impact of components on the sound of the various parts. It was always frustrating to make changes to a car only to have no idea how it would sound anymore, so its very nice to be able to  sample these things before actually driving off with a glorified vacuum cleaner.Sound in general in the game is a very strong point with a very pleasing selection of tunes on the various radio stations (Pulse and Hospital are my favs this time around), and some very good engine recordings for the all new cars. I've also been extremely impressed with the foley work that went into all of the environmental noise, and i've found it weirdly enjoyable to just drive around a rocky, gravel strewn mountainside in a slow fashion just to listen closely to the sounds of dirt being kicked up and flicking the side of the car. Its certainly a joy to listen to on headphones like the HD 660S so I'm sure that if you're an audiophile like me, you will have a lot to be happy about with this game.Graphics are an undeniable strong suit of this game, and I think the screenshots and video on the steam page do it justice so I wont ramble on about it too much, other than to say the all new Volumetric Fog system is one of the best I've seen in a modern game, and the addition of adaptive resolution in the PC release will certainly be welcome for low-spec gamers who want to run as close to their native resolution as possible. On my personal rig, I've been running the game on a Ryzen 5800X with 32GB RAM, and an RTX 3080 which is connected to a G7 240hz 1440p monitor, and the lowest frame rate that I have seen at the suggested ""Extreme"" settings (Xbox Series X preset) has been around 90fps in the dense jungle environments, such as to say that the game is supremely well optimized. Right now there are a few visual bugs with things like super low resolution distant terrain being well within the visible range, as well as a GPU related crash when changing Tyre Rims too frequently in a single customization session, but I am absolutely certain that these issues will be cleared up following the official launch.Those of you with low end rigs or old laptops will be happy to know that the game plays nicely even on a Ryzen Athlon 3000G with Vega 3 graphics and Intel HD630 integrated graphics on the low preset at 1080p, and looks about as nice as GTAV looked on the Xbox 360 which is pretty high praise in my opinion.The game also has a 10/10 accessibility system, with many audio and visual tweaks to help those who need it. It also allowes you to slow game speed in offline play for those who need more time to react to thinksIf you aren't tired of the Horizon open world format just yet, I can wholeheartedly reccomend this as the best version of that experience so far, and thank you for taking the time to read my rambling thoughts! :D"
1199,N0xEterniS,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gumaboss1/,2,1,0,640.0,November,"14,",923,8,1,"I'm done with these developers, I just can't believe how incompetent they are. Played it for 521 hrs, bought the 99.99€ version, played its predecessor: FH4 for 600 hrs, made 37 videos showcasing different cars, rivals and online racing and today I'm uninstalling and will never buy a game from this company ever again.First and foremost, . It's been 4 months since the game came out, still hasn't been addressed. On the steam page under recommended specs, it says that you need 16GB RAM, not 32GB, not 64GB. Well if you have 'only' 16GB, you will have to restart the game every 1 to 2 hrs... it's not all tho.. WMI Provider Host will still run in the background and take up to 50-60% CPU.It .. a lot. I've had countless crashes, not joking! Sometimes the game crashed 3-4 times before I was even able to get out of the house and accelerate. especially in The Eliminator, but also after every loading screen and also sometimes in online racing.. You are going to randomly get disconnected while looking for an online adventure or when racing online, the message you get: ''you have been disconnected'', instead of ''Our servers are 2nd hand''. I think this bug was introduced in December, so it's been at least 2 months since we had to race in pitch dark and if you also add some very bad track designs, you get a very unenjoyable experience. Sometimes you get no vibration at all, which is very important while trying to drive a powerbuild or a RWD properly and also if you don't use ABS. To resolve this, sometimes all you have to do is press a key on your keyboard, sometimes that's not enough and you have to unplug ur controller and sometimes nothing works and you have to restart the game.All of the above are technical issues, what about the racing portion?Well you can check out my videos, I won't be uploading anymore tho, decide for yourself if I was good or not. since day 1. They haven't done anything to ban and delete the impossible leaderboard times. It's been 4 months guys.. 4. You do see them online too, but not that often. So let's say you want to do only road/street racing. Well the game will present to you a random lobby, if you get Cross Country - though luck, try again, if you get Dirt - though luck, try again. But the game has multiple classes so you could get B-Class Dirt/Cross Country or A-Class or S1 or S2 Dirt, if you really want to get a specific lobby, say A-Class Road/Street it can take up to 20 min, I've had this happen lots of times because I wanted to try out a car in A class. This whole issue would be resolved by telling the game to only give A-Class Road/Street lobbies.  I'm decent enough to beat 99% of the bone shaker users, but that doesn't negate the fact that the car is basically a cheat, like a god item in skyrim, it's too powerful for A-Class. Lots of players complained about this car, , yet it's still alive in FH5. . We don't have it in FH5 because apparently it hurts some feelings... I'm literally speachless about this one. We don't get a game mode because it hurts some noobs feelings. Some tracks, mainly the city ones are poorly designed and generally too short. You literally wait more in the lobby while the game is loading the new race/track and getting everybody there than actually racing.It's a bannable offence, lots of people do this, especially bone shaker users, yet the devs don't do anything about it. ''Going out of your way to intentionally cause wrecking in multiplayer races goes against the spirit of the game and can result in enforcement action''. are still too long. It's not unusual in an online adventure to wait for the next race to start for 5 to 10 mins.What are the devs actually doing to improve your experience and the state of the game?They banned and proably still ban 'offensive' liveries. What's offensive? Whatever they want, they'll ban you permanently, but not those who cheat and post impossible leaderboard times.They nerfed the wheelspins. I, personally don't care about this at all, BUT for the casual player this made the game so much more grindier for no reason. Why did they do this? Because people were doing AFK races to earn mastery points and then buy super wheelspins, it's a really dumb decision.They release 'patches' to fix things but add new bugs instead. Like the 'no headlights' bug which was introduced in december, now they're trying to stop people from adding liveries into the game, but make the game super laggy in the tuning menu and it now crashes while painting.They don't listen to the community at all to the point where sometimes you ask yourself if these devs actually test and play thier own game.We need to abandon ship, otherwise they'll never learn. The game sits at 86% positive on steam, which is a complete joke."

They even fixed the MUCH REQUESTED wheel support! It feels fantastic with my Fanatec wheel, all assists off and simulation steering. Graphically, it's jaw-dropping, the sound is bliss, the gameplay is phenomenal. Forza Horizon 5 is a masterpiece.But the voice acting is really ruining this game for me. I wish there were a way to turn off the obnoxious ♥♥♥♥ they have to say.I'm loving the game so far. Graphics are lovely at 4k, everything maxed out, with Ray-Tracing on the best quality and proper HDR. It runs very smoothly for me. Framerates are rock solid with no stutters or crashes (the game, not the cars, lol).The HDR is slightly more realistic in this game than in FH4. It's a pity that the cutscenes can't be skipped, though.Unfortunately, the game has always suffered from a lack of a proper career path. This makes it a shallower experience. Even so, I'm really enjoying the game so far. Well done, Playground Games, on yet another excellent driving game. My PC experience has been excellent.(For the badge.)"

Aside from the glacial servers that keep you hostage for 10+ minutes if someone disconnects during a race, giving you ample time to take a shower between each and every one of them, playground has removed beloved staples from the feature list of this game like matchmaking for team PvP and the entirety of ranked mode (and as an extension of those two, team ranked as well). Im not even sure why they are parading the word ""unranked"" in their reworked online adventure tab when it just serves as a means to confuse the player into thinking that, if there is an ""unranked"" mode, there must be a ranked mode somewhere as well, except there isnt.Their argument is that scrubs have the capacity to feel emotions which makes them angry when they get smoked by anyone with two intact hands and a turned on monitor, so ranked had to go. Why they removed team PvP though is kind of beyond me since it has always been a populated mode in FH4 so why get rid of it?Singleplayer is fun but ultimately nothing to keep your attention for too long once you did all the races.There is a slew of things to add that will definitely tick anyone off (gonna be updated as i remember things):-) The game textures are incredibly unoptimized, eventually memory leaking your GPU so hard youll be required to restart the game unless you want constant stuttering-) Not every car has access to the pickup truck offroad tires for whatever reason-) The walls in this game are well placed in order to discourage people from wallriding like they did in early FH4. Too bad the game still applies a slowdown for you when you hit them even though its practically impossible to get any advantage from hitting the walls in the first place except for very fringe situations that are really not worth the risk in most cases-) Quick rewinds are gone in online, making you waste a lot of additional seconds for rewinding from a crash-) You cannot really add stuff to your controls on a controller because every useless button on it (like ANNA or changing radio stations, or switching cameras) is treated as essential, giving you practically zero leeway in adding stuff like telemetry to your button layout.-) The offroad physics have been cleaned up by not making every patch of offroad a complete bumpfest despite seemingly being smooth. However, the jumping and landing physics in this game seem to be overall a big downgrade from FH4. Expect up to 2 frontflips out of nowhere on straight paths in cross country in this game just because the game decided its time for some pirouettes and there is nothing you can do to really prevent it.-) The game doesnt always ghost you from high speed crashes quickly enough, making you collide and then applying the ghosting effect to you (as if it would still be of any use at that point)-) The game has so little snow that it took me 50 hours to actually drive over my first patch of snow in a race. Did i even need the (now separate) snow tires for that fringe occasion? No.-) Street Scene races in general dont have neutral traffic. Its basically just road racing without corner walls and no circuits.-) Compared to FH4, the racing line indicator is much more inaccurate both in routing as well as actual braking zone recommendations. It was okay back then when only a couple cars had too strong/too weak brakes compared to what the game thought would be the case but in FH5 this issue is extremely common for many cars to the point where i'd honestly just tell you, the potential buyer/player to learn each cars braking zones individually rather than trusting whatever false information youre being fed by the game."

It's imo a great mix of more arcade chill driving while still having realistic aspects. It looks great and it's just fun to play, there's an open world where you gradually unlock more events and you're never pressured to do thing X asap, you can pretty much play it in any order you like (+ load times for events are pretty fast, you can just drive nonstop around the world map and unlock stuff as you go). The car painter is great and it's basically a weeb's wet dream. Unlocking more cars and stuff is fast, and you don't have to grind long to get the cars you like apart from the more monster class ones. There's a variety of different driving styles for offroad as well. It's also well optimized and my laptop can even handle it at 4K Extreme settings at 60 FPS. Creating your own driver is also pretty fun, especially when you get to call him/her whatever you want, plus the story events add a nice touch imo.I would recommend staying away from the Xbox game pass version though, because it didn't recognize my PS4 controller and it also had a permanently disappearing mouse cursor, Steam version has been working way better for me. And I would definitely recommend playing this on a controller either way, or even a wheel if you have one."

How long do we have to stare at cars with wrong proportions, broken reflections? Not to mention, a lot of these re-used cars are presented as ""new"" content.

As a result the game has huge amount of connection and sync issues. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ GTA Online has better netcode than this game. And this game only has ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cars.* Sometimes people in races just stay still and then win first place midrace.* Sometimes you will be racing around alone in the battle royale mode, get challenged by invisible players, and lose to them without ever seeing them. ????Some other very baffling decisions on developer's side:* You cannot preview community created liveries when installing them on already owned cars. You can when buying a car, but not when you already own the car. They also take too long to (down)load.* You cannot stop/abort the benchmark after it has been started* There's this very stupid behavior with reversing cars on keyboard where the car will completely stop when pressing S while already going backwards before starting to go backwards again* You cannot skip cutscenes in Horizon Stories* You cannot modify/recolor your car while not in a house. I.e. you can't just do it anywhere in free roam.Other issues/nitpicks I encountered:* Rewind system lacks any sort of granularity, making it frustrating to use* Horizon Arcade is unbeatable and therefore pointless, and suffers greatly from connectivity issues* Too many loading screens, one before and after each race. Want to change a car? loading screen* Coop races are also infuriating and pointless. One mistake and you are dead last with no chance of gaining ground. You also frequently get idiot teammates who push you out of the racetrack/away from checkpoints* There is no time popups (in seconds) about how far behind or ahead the closest to you driver is, or a lap time difference readout like in many other racing games* No radio wheel, only next/previous buttons, so you cannot see current track without switching radio stations 2 times* Breakable things are sometimes inconsistent. Things you might expect to not break fly away like paper (steel guardrails for example), other times you hit a small bump on the side of a bigger rock/tree and come to an instant stop. Sometimes you do get indestructible guardrails in races, sometimes you don't* Graphics look very bad in some cases, namely when its cloudy or when its wet and daytime* Photomode is very slow with its animations/loading. In general game has a lot of animations to sit through with is always frustrating. For example speed trap scores, you cannot score a speed trap while you have animations from previous attempt not finished.* Radar doesn't show the direction of a map pin at the radar's edge which would've been useful for off road cars to cut through the map* Excessive day one monetization in a full priced game - You can buy cars (packs) for real money, VIP status, a map for hidden collectives FOR REAL MONEY* It has loot boxes but you can't buy them (with real money OR in game money)* The world does feel quite dead, with barely any traffic or people around* Has weekly grind which is becoming very tiresome trend in new games* The ""Horizon Stories"" dialogue is cringe to the extreme* Airborne/collision physics feel very unnatural/unrealistic. I had a car just do flips on its hood for no reason after a crash. And yes, you will be expected to do jumps, which will break your car on landing if you have car damage simulation enabled.* There is no any sort of sharp corner call outs so if you turn off the race line helper you end up looking at the radar more than at the damn game just so you wont miss a sharp corner.Some good notes:* Plenty of ♥♥♥♥ to do, even if a lot of it is good for a single completion* The game has detailed car physics simulation with a bunch of overlays that display all the simulated values* Different weather conditions affects your driving. Fog, dust storms, rain, etc. Sometimes to a detriment when the road becomes slippery and you don't want that, but still.* Plenty of User Generated Content systems* Very detailed tuning system to the point of being intimidating, but has user generated presets* The grind is weekly, not daily. It has daily challenges, but they don't go away after 1 or 3 days, they open each day end 7 days after opening* A lot of difficulty options, albeit some of the settings do not give you monetary benefits"

Mexico had me skeptical for the next map but they did nearly everything perfect on this map, my only slight complaint is theres no true quarter mile drag strip, but the insanely long highway and other drag strips make up for it. The map is really diverse and introduced things we haven't seen in the previous games, like a soccer field, a truly big bridge overseas, a volcano with hill climb like roads that are on it that are great for drifting, I can go on. I want to touch on about the story because its pretty solid, I was hoping that your character would talk more considering they implemented voices for your characters, but the new characters, races, acolade system, and barn finds are insane, it reminds me about Horizon 3. Car customization is near perfect for Horizon, its not NFS or GTA level but the new body kits and aero parts are a massive step up from Horizon 4, I do however dislike that Rocket Bunny kits didn't return, but these new body kits from TJ Hunt, KRC Japan, etc. Are amazing. Engine sounds are on point, the 2JZ engine sounds realistic, and same applies for most cars, and the car drops are sick too.Now to the bad, because no game is perfect no matter how good it is, its been a week since this game came out, and Horizon Online and Horizon Life is horrendous, online is nearly unplayable which is a shame, me and my friends we're looking forward to do so much online and the servers just barely work, you only get in a convoy if your insanely lucky or have a stronger wifi connection than usual, this causes the festival playlist and forzathon shop to not work, oh also cosmetic damage still sucks, exhaust backfire and sounds suck, and can be buggy, racing wheel integration is rocky, and load times are choppy on Xbox One. Despite all the cons, the game is phenomenal and is a must play for Game Pass owners, I recommend paying full price for it, and I'm looking forward for all the memories I'm gonna make on this game in the future11 people found this helpful."

This game has no replay value anymore. When 1st launched it had many ways to get cars, credits and wheel spins. Now all of that came to a halt with a super slow progression rate. Seems like Turn 10 Studios hooked up with 343 on how to ruin a games progression system. The Event Lab is poorly designed, not just that but a lot of aspects of the game were poorly deigned to the point it seems the game was rushed out to market because it just looks good on high graphic settings. There are better racing games out that offer the player a game based on how they want to play, not like how Turn 10 Studios that wants to dictate how you play. Ill be highly upset if the new Forza Motor sports game is this bad and or how long it will take for them to ruin that game too."

Took some ideas from Lego addon (accolades - challenges you can do) and added them into the main game. Loving it overall, although it isn't free of issues. I found workarounds for my issues, so for me all is good. The game is stable (doesn't crash much, other than at startup), performance is good (1080ti, 2560, Ultra quality with extreme geometry and textures). Hopefully, issues will be fixed over time, meanwhile I'll enjoy my weekly racing.Update: after 358 hours I believe Ultimate edition was totally worth the full price, at least for me. Definitely get it on a discount. Because you can! :D"

But it's not appealing to me. The issue is not with the bugs or techincal dificulties or the poor optimisation, the whole game just isn't clicking with me. I loved driving the streets of Britain in FH4, I loved totally different seasons which were very distinctive in colours and overall feeling. I loved Britain.One can respect and admire the culture and nature of Mexico, but it's just not for me. I don't really like it.Leaving the location aside, we don't really have anything to point as a step forward from FH4. Basically we have the same game with another map, slightly different physics and awful sound. Sounds in FH4 were bad, but here I'd say it's another level of bad. Every car sounds plain and boring, Lexus LFA doesn't have the amazing scream anymore. The car sounds are pinned to front or back and there are times when you don't hear anything, like for example your friend's horn.AI in races... In short it's ridiculous. I can't get its level at all. It isn't consistent at all. Even during one race. Some races are just pure pain and frustration. And I wouldn't call myself not skilled enough.Visually not much has changed from previous version, but there's an increased load on the GPU and a resulting drop in FPS. And on top of that various glitches, like pixelated smoke. Maybe it's like this only on my system, but at this point I don't really care anymore.Much advertised accessibility... Well, okay, good, but can I turn it off? Completely? Without it screaming at me which key to press to start every time I launch the game?On the final note we have a lot of bugs, some of which were present in previous games. So... No improvement here as well.In conclusion: if you like cozy little villages of Britain like myself, this game is nor really for you. If you prefer frustration and sand with a touch of spanish word every second sentence, you're welcome in Mexico, I guess."

There'll be rant.Yeah, graphics is great, but Mexico is pretty meh. Landscapes itself are very mediocre, there's nothing you would want to see here. Pyramids? I saw them once during story expedition and that's really enough. Volcano? Most of the time it doesn't even have lava lake, just ordinary lake. And all of this different zones feels the same. I saw all 4 seasons and they all look pretty much the same (no, some wind and rain don't make any difference). Radio... Uh. Better think that there's no radio. My favourite XS rock-station sounds more like pop-station. There's only a couple of good tracks on all of the radio stations. The rest are simply bad and/or unremarkable.The higher AI difficulty, the more broken it is. Drivatards blatantly cheat, launch like a f*cking rocket and never bother to slow down at corners. If you let them to drive too far away, you'll never ever catch them up. Even when you're happily sit at first position with drivatards far behind you, do not relax, at least one of them will suddenly appear right before the finish line breathing heavily down your neck and waiting for a moment to pass you as swiftly as transcontinental missile.Expeditions are okay-ish, showcases are good, and story missions... well, they exist. V10 and Born fast was pretty neat, El Camino would be cooler if NPC would shut her mouth for a minute, and the rest are just annoying and irritating. Let's be clear, no one plays Forza for decent dialogs, but here they're plainly bad. And voice acting... Jaysus... I prefer to shut my ears and not to hear them (but not for you, Alex, you're great, I love your thick Scottish accent; and Jaimin, I just like the sound of his voice). Spanglish is infuriating, as well as their over-excited manner of speech.""Main story"" - I don't see why it exists. I've unlocked all final races without doing any races at all, I was too busy discovering roads, smashing boards, earning skill points and wondering where're all the POIs. And this nerve-racking festival upgrade screen appears all the time interrupting whatever you did at the moment (I drifted peacefully performing skill chains to later unlock wheelspins and xp boosts in car masteries, leave me alone godd*mned upgrade screen!). For almost your every action you'll get accolade points. At first they're used to progress through ""main quest"", but once it's completed, the accolades are became completely useless. Like seriously, accolades are only needed for a global leaderboard. That's all. Just a pissing contest. FH3 had quite similar progression system with fans, unlike you actually needed to do races, stunts and stuff and earn fans to upgrade existing and unlock new festival sites, which added new races and stunts on the map little by little, not all of them at once. And it took a fairly amount of time to fully upgrade Horizon Australia Festival, not a half an hour.And now to my favourite part. Online. ""You've been disconnected"" - ""Retry"" five times in a row. ""Alert! [x] OK"". Isn't it amazing? Other players in freeroam disappear right before your eyes just to reappear half a minute later somewhere down the road. Astonishing, isn't it? And on top of that PG broke Forzaton Live. Now it's called Horizon Arcade and there's actually two of them: one for drift and the other for everything else. For every Arcade you still have to do 3 rounds, but now you have to do them in 10 minutes. It happens too often and without any announcement, the only way to find out that there's Arcade somewhere is to open a map and intentionally search for it. Objectives are too high and don't scale to the amount of attended players. It takes at least 5 players to complete the Arcade. But at best there'll be only one or two players with you. And sometimes other players in Arcade disappear too while still contributing their score to the objective. 'Cause the new server layer feature is absolute sh*t. I personally never saw a lobby with more then 6-10 players.However FH5 has good sides too. Cars look and sound awesome. More than five hundred cars at a launch day and even more to come. Race tracks are fine, some better, some worse. Community is nice in general (except you, rammers, with your small d*ck energy, feic you). And despite all its flaws I still recommend FH5, 'cause it's still a vey good and solid simcade racing game. But the more I play FH5, the more I want to go back to FH4. That's sad.Oh, I almost forgot. Where's my racing suit, PGG? Lock helmet behind a full collection one of the most expensive cars - Pagani? Do you really think that was a great idea, PGG? You disappoint me."

Borderline unplayable. I can't, in good conscience, recommend this game in its current state. When everything is working fine, it is a masterpiece. Extremely well optimised graphics and miles of fun, but when I can't connect to a server, which can happen every other minute, it will freeze up for minutes at a time. This effects anything from browsing Auction House to multiplayer, to simply driving around. Playing offline works, but defeats the community aspect which is a large portion of this games content.

1350,Arremera,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adsklg/,6,,0,806.6,March,20,44,0,1,"TL;DR: The game has several problems that are more because of the developers' hypocrisy and ignorance than the game design. Just because I enjoy it doesn't mean you will.So, where do I start? Well, the leaderboards and multiplayer events alike are dominated by cheaters; in the former case, the devs have done very little to solve the problem, and in the latter, they have done practically nothing. There's also the absurd bans that are handed out seemingly at random, where people will find that their account has been banned for miniscule and sometimes even completely fraudulent causes (while people who actually DO violate TOS are still running free). While it is true that the game has been continuously been receiving content since launch, the majority of it has been lack-luster car additions that should have been in the game to begin with. Honestly, the only ""proper"" content drop we've gotten is the Hot Wheels DLC - here's hoping the Rally Adventure lives up to expectations."

There is no option to report unless you have video evidence, and so no penalties for these players since you will run into rammers EVERY race, so you will never escape them. This game direly needs a radar feature similar to Gran Turismo so that you can actually use driver/dash/hood cams without being handicapped by rammers, or at the very least some type of ranking system, or better yet, an option to race with collision turned off.Also, if you wanted to focus on rally or street races, then good luck: The online matchmaking does not let you pick, and simply rolls the dice on what type of race it matches you in.Steer clear of this game unless that sounds fun to you."

1387,Dusklite,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dusklite/,13,,0,69.0,November,"11,","1,055",0,1,"Wow, now this is a hard one to write.On the one hand, there's a great looking game with so much potential. Even more so than Forza Horizon 4. They really went all out with cars, environment, sounds and so on.Now what's on the other hand is just really sad in my opinion.First off, there's the things that were bad in its predecessor and haven't got improved at all. Take the online connectivity for example. The removal of any ranked game mode also hints at a hearty ""well, f- it"" in regard to make it work fair and stable.Then there's the odd technical issues of which there a quite a bit right now from crashes to collision issues. However, I expect them to get fixed, eventually so... yeah, let's be fair and let them slide for now.The not-so-soft nudge with the FOMO gun to have to play something like playground for rewards I could stomach with minor pain.The very strange ""A.I."" that sometimes defies all rules of physics and becomes unbeatable with tires glued onto the road and some strange bubbling atomic liquid in the fuel injection is even harder to stomach, but let's also put that into the category of bugs to be fixed for the sake of being nice here.However!Currently, this is ""repetitive tasks, the game"" to improve the fastest. Grinding skill points to buy the classical failure of a British offroad vehicle, expend these skillpoints to get a roll at the ""totally-not-a-lootbox"" wheel, just to hand the poor thing off to someone else as a ""gift""... just to profit massivly from the payout - that's completely destroying any sense of accomplishment. It's also not clear right now if that will be a bannable use of an exploit or just a major blunder what will be ignored. No official statement about the issue - all the while even granny's little gaming blog writes about it and advises people how to maximize your gains with this method.Also and not less infuriating: if you pretend to be a gamer with heavy disabilities and let the game drive itself which for some reason is something you can actually configure, it turns into an AFK XP and credit farm, completely making an XP system or buying anything with the earnable in-game currency a joke I don't seem to get and thus, cannot enjoy. There are highly rated versions of The Goliath, the longest circuit race, that go for 50 laps which lets you net stupendous amounts if you let the game just run overnight or while you do something like work from home or go out or on vacation or whatever...To add insult to injury, for a developer that does so much to make a game playable for people with disabilities (which I greatly respect by the by), the most optimal way to earn something is to act as if you are disabled and just go AFK with something taped on the accelerator or something... urgh.I know some people with disabilities and I will not even presume to talk for any person that has them, but those I know would feel very negative about this if they were into this game. They want to be able to play a game as normally as they can with what they are able to, not have it completely on autopilot and then call it ""assistance"". Having some things optional is alright, activating them in a combination to create a self-driving demo mode would only be fine with me if it is just that: a demo mode and not something to progress the game in.I might revise or remove the review in the future if things improve, since the game has so much potential that the current state of it almost physically sickens me with anger and sadness. I'm completely baffled that this went through any QA the way it is designed in some areas. It almost strikes me as if it was very well tested in parts, but never as a working whole.edit:The first patch for the game made the Willy farm exploit less prevalent - you can still get fast XP and thus, normal wheelspins from spending one skill point on it, so it's a meh fix if you ask me.AFK racing has been nerfed but not removed, making it not realyy viable at least compared to normal play - you can still AFK your way if you want to. Meh fix again.Then there are still cars out there that make the super wheelspin exploit still a thing. For example the Mazda RX-7 for 14 skill points. This makes the exploit harder, but given the normal rarity of super wheelspins some people will definitely go for it. Meh fix once more.Still on the fence if I should recommend the game after the ""fix"". Leaving it as not recommended for now since this was a really half-hearted attempt on fixing an issue. Bonus points for realizing this needed a fix in the first place, though."

Buddy, you better wait for a sale (christmas soon ?) , a friend gift, or check out all the popular issue reported (on forum or in review), buy the game, test all those thing in 2 hours to check if YOU have the same issue, and then decide to keep it or refund it. Not trying to be a troll or a ranting teenager hereJust trying to warn people about the ""impressive quality"" of a Triple A multi-billion company's game that cost 60$/€ in the current day and age.

Most of the gripes that I had with the previous game have been fixed here. Most of the core gameplay and tuning is the same as the last game, so I'll only talk about improvements from the last game and things that weren't improved:* Smoother steering inputs. The steering inputs have been smoothed are adjustable, so less jerky movements with a controller. * Haptic feedback.  Vibration is applied independently to the left and right motors in your controller. This means that when you hit the brakes, the vibration intensity ramps up as you increase brake pressure and will shake when you begin to lose grip. You can also feel vibrations in the drivetrain through the gas pedal (right side). This gives the player more important information that is important for improving times and for good immersion.* Progression rewards, You get to choose what kind of events you unlock through the Adventure tab, Any event can contribute to this progression system, so you are free to play around with dirt racing a bit, but still make progress to unlocking more street races if that's your preference.* Dialogue is still bad but better than before. * The menu has been really cleaned up so it doesn't take as much time to navigate. * Raytracing gives high quality reflection effects on cars and makes the lighting more immersive (anyone that has done photoshop knows that lighting is the best way to make your editing believable)* Cosmetics are no longer walled behind roulette rolls. You can outright buy most normal cosmetics if you want, but special cosmetics are locked behind events and roulette rolls. This is a more enjoyable system in my opinion.* Microphone is now off by default, so no more hearing creepy breathing during your multiplayer race unless it's intentional.The bad:* Aggressive monetization model- DLC is really expensive and most of it hasn't been released yet so there is no way of knowing if it is a good value or not.* The map is still messy* Too many cars, not enough variety. I felt that there isn't as much visual variety of car types in this game compared to the previous game.* You basically need to look up how to play multiplayer modes because the game never adequately explains how to join up with friends or even game rules for online multiplayer games."

This game has that, and lots of it. Probably mainly because of the map (the map is great in this game).Don't go into this game thinking its a game like TDU2 with an emphasis on progession. The progression in this game may as well not exist, its not the focus of the game. Cars  be handed to you, and you will unlock a lot of things very fast. Again, its not the point of the game. This game is more focussed on completion than progression - and in my opinion, the completion is fun.Graphically not much needs to be said, it looks insane. There's still some issues with the graphics and framerate, but I'm sure these will get fixed in the not-too-distant future. However, as of right now, expect some blurry textures and GPU-usage drops in online (leading to massive framelag).The biggest downside of the game right now is the amount of bugs. Connection issues, freezes in upgrade menus, etc. Its just annoying. Again, it probably will get fixed, but just keep it in mind.All in all most definitely worth it imo."

Tak třeba u výborného grafického zpracování a detailů jak vozidel atd. tak aj krajiny. Jako FH4, tak FH5 je opět výborně optimalizovanou hrou, což si troufnu říct, že za to může hlavně menší vzdálenost načítání textur (detaily a grafika plácnu za stým metrem nejsou tak dobré). Což není nic špatného. Já jsem jedině rád a sám si toho málokdy všimnu. Auta jsou zpracovaná opět skvěle, což jsem už zmiňoval. Samozřejmě že jich několik zase přibylo, ale mně šlo teď spíše o ty zvuky motorů. Motorů je opět na výběr více, ale hlavně mají konečně každý svůj ""originální"" zvuk. A abych nezapomněl, tak opět přibylo hodně možností pro customizace aut.. Spoilery, body kity a další.. Mapa je opravdu obří a má několik zajímavých lokací (ať už na blbnutí a nebo pořízení fotečky). Závody jsou více promyšlený, občas vám sama borka řekne či poradí, že si tu cestu máte zkrátit, jinak se nevejdete do časového limitu.Mapa Mexika mně celkově připadá zajímavější než Anglie. Je sice pravda, že v Anglii ty roční období byly dobrý, ale ještě jsem neviděl, jak to bude probíhat v Mexiku.Další velké plus FH5 je, že konečně udělali více ""Horizon festů"". Takže už nemusíte čekat, než si koupíte baráky (či fast travel barák) a budete cestovat přes ně. Teď si skoro hned na začátku odemknete další festivaly rozházený po mapě, kam se můžete přesunout za nějakou částku a máte vystaráno. Já to sice moc nepoužívám, spíš vůbec.. Ale chápu, že někoho to občas omrzí jezdit přes obří mapu tam a zpátky.Ovládání zůstalo stejné jako v FH4, akorát asistence nějak pozměnili.Dále máte místo procent v sezóně za úkol nasbírat body, ale úkoly jsou na stejném principu.Lepší orientace v menu (alespoň pro mě).Možná to může vypadat, že si spíše stěžuji. Ale spíše naopak. Hra mě velmi baví a nemůžu se od ní odtrhnout a to jsem ještě nezačal dělat něco online. Za mě velmi povedená hra (opět), 4. díl patří mezi mé nejoblíbenější, ale tento ho absolutně převálcoval. Hru pouze a jen doporučuji. ovšem jestli si to kupujete jen kvůli multiplayeru. Tak vás zatím musím zklamat. Lidi se zatím jenom stěžují (páč to teprve pár dní zažívá ten nával lidí) na časté vyhazování z online relace. Každopádně věřím, že s tím určitě něco udělaj a brzo to spravěj. 10/10Ještě taková rada na závěr ke hraní online. Jestli chcete hrát s přáteli a nefunguje vám to. Zkontrolujte si NAT (Typ překladu adres).Hodnoceno z pohledu fanouška aut.Edit: Online už funguje, občas něco zablbne, ale nic co by nevyřešilo opětovné založení konvoje"

It freezes when challenging an opponent, sometimes giving them a huge advantage. It also disconnects randomly. I got disconnected just when I reached the final point of the Eliminator (I was in the first place).Rubber banding for Drivatars; and it's terrible.I rarely get teammates in the Arcade (former Forzathon); 90% of these events, I play them solo. And even if I get teammates, it's mostly one other, two max.Most of the custom races are plain annoying, but they are forced onto us through seasonal events.Some races with car restrictions don't show what the restrictions are. You tune a car only to find out it's not eligible. This is especially bad when you're in a convoy and can not check the eligibility list yourself.Patches seem to break things rather than fix them. After the last patch, I have very long waiting times when starting the game. Even going into photo mode takes ridiculously long.The Boneshaker is still overpowered...These are just a few of the problems that this game has.

Brands Missing, cars being added after the initial release, a Unimog that if you turn slightly harder than it should on a cross crountry circuit incline, starts breakdancing... not to mention being yeeted into the void bellow the track if a car lands on top of me. but then there is the things that work: Photomode looks more realistic than ever. the decal editor has some much needed QOL improvements (but is not as superior as the GT Sport one), and the cars sound much better now... not to mention the tunning here is better than ever, with more options of number of gears and finer tunning (wich can make or break a car. but honestly, some cars that had more options on 4 should have them back on 5. i'm talking about the Class X BAC mono wich now cannot reach it).in a nutshell: The game state is in Pre-Alpha. or even earlier than that. for a game that costs BRL 400 for the full version, this is a disgracefull shame. it's borderline unplayable IF you try Player Generated Content. and i'll be taking 3 to 4 Points form the final score on the final review already."

FH4 grabbed me a little harder, but 5 is still a treat in all the ways you might expect from the series. There are some weird / unexpected bugs that weren't present in FH4 (all traffic disappearing when connected online), and I would have expected more cars (a lot of new releases aren't present, where typically in the past they've gotten a bunch of near future / newly released cars in). The awkward story parts of the game start to make a lot more sense if you set your name to ""Fellow Human"" . Highly recommended."

1429,Rusty,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RustyRetroGamer/,2,,0,1.4,December,"11,",744,0,1,"TLDR: Refunded - disappointing gameplay and performance on Steamdeck.In my search for finding the best racing game for Steamdeck, I was baited by the nice graphics to try FH5, but you won't really get that, instead you get to enjoy all these issues:- frequent drops in framerate, even on lowest settings- noticable input latency- long loading screens- the game crashed within the first hour of play, during an annoying cutscene which I then had to rewatch- bad navigation and mission system- cars have poor handling- cringe story, unskippable cutscenes and characters who will not shut up and let you drive in peaceThere are lots of ""diversity"" options in the character creation settings, but you are forced to play a character with an arrogant sounding British accent... in a game that's taking place in Mexico. Why is everyone so talkative? I couldn't care less what they are saying.During my 90 minutes of playtime, it felt like the game was deliberately wasting my time, overexplaining the relatively simple game mechanics (maybe to try and bridge the time possible to refund?). At least during my playtime, I couldn't fast travel to missions, always needed to drive around the map.The clunky handling of cars reminded me of Excite Truck on the Wii, but less fun.Race courses are mostly straight lines with few turns. But when a rare turn shows up that requires braking, it's surprisingly difficult to tell, where the track is and react in time, without playing with ""race lines"" turned on or staring at the minimap the whole time.Here's a list of better racing games that I'd rather play on Steamdeck:- Wreckfest- Dirt Rally 1 + 2- Trackmania- World Racing 2- Road Redemption- Sonic All-Stars Racing- F-Zero GX (on Dolphin Emulator)- NFS Most wanted or Carbon (original PC version)- Burnout- Racing in JC3, GTA IV/V, Sleeping DogsOn windows:- Assetto Corsa- Rfactor- iRacingConsole:- Forza 3 on Xbox 360- Gran Tourismo on PS- Mario Kart 8 on SwitchThe few good things:Maybe if you care mostly about nice graphics and have a top-tier gpu, this game is worth it, but otherwise it's not. The multiplayer features might be able to redeem FH5, it seems fun to drive around the map with other players, but I couldn't fully explore the multiplayer features without running out of time to refund the game.One feature that is certainly impressive is the wide selection of new cars."

With the publisher behind this and how many Forza games there are now, this is unacceptable performance. It's not just a crash either, it completely freeze up my Steam Deck.

The best way I can describe is it feels like your parents joined you and your friends and just keep yelling ""LOOK AT HOW FUN THIS IS"" the whole time.Driving is very arcade-y, but that's not necessarily bad. Even ""realistic"" is quite forgiving. The 160mph in the Bronco and Wrangler was doubtful, and a head-on only crinkled the hood and cracked the windshield. However, the scenery is stunning, and the cars are modeled well inside and out. The map is huge, I doubt I've seen 10% of it in ~90 minutes of play.

I will pretend it's not there and everything is working as expected.✔️➤ Stunning environnements, they improved alot from FH4 which was already splendid at the release.Draw distance have been improved, as well as foliages, very few texture pop-in noticeable. ➤ The game can be downgraded to make it looks like a xbox 360 game and run on Intel Integrated Graphic Card however there is alot of performances issues on PC for some configurations.✔️➤ Big improvement from FH4, there is alot of verticality, 11 biomes to explore and the disparity between asphalt road and dirt road is perfect.✔️➤ Same as previous FH games, this is a simu-arcade game and it's perfect like that. Peoples who says this is an arcade game are clueless, the physic have nothing to do with a Need for Speed or The Crew game, you have that simulation feeling from Motorsport but with much less exigency, keep in mind this is a Horizon game so yes they allowed many behaviors that are not possible from Motorsport, like going in the fields at fullspeed or jumping crazy distances however you can't do anything with a car and you will be punished for any mistake if you have removed the aids.➤ For casual players that don't really know what they should set in the Difficulty tab. I would suggest this.Drivatars Difficulty: AnyBraking: ABS ONSteering: SimulationTraction control: ONStability control: OFFShifting : Automatic or Shifting (Shifting will make you faster in the end)Driving Line : Brakes Line onlyDamage : CosmeticsRewind : OnThis will grant you a nice experience and you will feel the behavior of your cars, most important is Steering to not feel like you are stick on a track and Traction control if you have a high power car to avoid losing control when you accelerate without playing with the throttle.✔️➤ 534 at launch and more to come, I find this number staggering considering the modelization quality and sound improvements they got granted for this game❌➤ There is really nothing exciting about the campaign in all of the Forza Horizon games I played, the fact that you have the possibility to change the AI difficulty to ""Tourist"" and complete the races and earn all rewards / accolades is just pathetic, just to be clear, I'm not doing that at all, I played all the races at Expert difficulty.It can be seen as a fantastic feature because adusting the game at your own skill seems great for most casuals but I'm just from the oldschool side where you have to beat the content at a fixed difficulty to earn your rewards and continue your campaign progression.If only there were a system where completing every race at a fixed difficulty would give you different exclusive rewards that are not obtainable anywhere else in the game I would be totally ok with that system.Actually there is no point to go for the Unbeatable difficulty because you earn a few extra % of credits at the end of races which is totally useless because the majority of credits you earn are coming from Wheelspins and selling your duplicate cars.➤ The campaign (again) desperately need a structure to it, there is no ""driving line"", you unlock too many things at once, you barely do 2 races that you already have unlocked a new part of a festival, in the end you have so many things to do that you don't know what to do anymore. I mostly use filters but still ... Classic Forza Horizon experience unfortunately.I miss the times of Need for Speed games where you had to climb the rankings and at each stage you had to beat a boss.➤ The ""Stories"" are really a waste of development time in my opinion, I though the developpers understood that almost all of the playerbase didn't cared about them but instead they increased x3 times the numbers of them since FH4.You just complete them once and you are done with it forever, they are not even interesting like the ""Expeditions"" (which are not even that great too), they throw you some really bad tuned cars that have no power whatsoever, it feels like playing Forza Motorsport but we are in freacking Horizon, this is all about having fun at high speed and making fun things and they throw you these boring stories.❌➤ This is a PEGI 3 ultra casual game, so as expected the whole story line and vibes of the game is really cringe. Even if you crash multiples times into a race and finish last, the narrator will tell you that you are the ""Superstar"". I become tired of this trend, that was already the case in FH4 and especially in The Crew 2 where they had that facebook follower scenario which was already 10-years old outdated at the release.❌➤ The multiplayer in this game (even without any connectivity issues which is currently happening) is really lacking.I bought this game to mainly play multiplayer in the long term, unfortunately like FH4, I will leave the game as soon as I unlock every achievement and complete the whole campaign.Why ? I just want to races against other people, what a surprise for a racing game right ? but the only way to do that is to participate in their ""Horizon Open"" this is the only option to matchmake against other player and this is terrible.Firstly you can't choose what type of races and category of performance you are gonna play, so if you just tuned your nicely S1 900 Aston Martin specced for Road Races you will have 1/10 chance to have that kind of races in the multiplayer, instead the matchmaking will mostly throw you in a Cross Country C700 and you can go ♥♥♥ yourself for the next 5 races.Secondly, the WAITING TIMES, thanks to the greedy editor this game is still cross-gen between Xbox older gens and new gens, so if you have 1 player out of 12 in your game who have an old gen console, you will wait more in the loading screen than to actually play the game, it's even worse if there a PC user with a 5400 rpm HDD, they didn't even implemented a skip rule if the loading is longer than 1 minute or so, why should we all wait because one person don't even bother to upgrade his rig.Thirdly, outside of loading time which are already killing my enthusiasm to do any random races, I WANT TO PLAY THE GAME AND DO RACES WITH PEOPLE FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY PLAYTIME, I don't want to see unnecessary scoreboard at the beginning of the races which have no point and no ones cares about them, I don't want to see stupid fortnite emotes, just start the races as soon as everyone have loaded it for god sake !➤ They removed ranking ... So instead of reworking and improving the ranking of FH4, they decided to remove it from the game, it's much simpler to fix indeed, what a shame really. They literally trippled the numbers of stories but removed this gamemode that could be a really great element of retention in terms of players in the game. Now you have literally no reasons to bother playing multiplayer in this game. ➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣➣▼▼▼"

The post-launch content updates and DLC will be telling.It's better than 4, yes, but not by some overwhelming margin.

The online in this is so broken that I just don't even bother trying to play with friends anymore since they haven't fixed bugs that have been breaking the entire experience since day 1. The only thing this has going for it is that it has a lot of cars, but most of them are just not interesting. You're gonna find a lot of super cars and variations of the same thing, and not many real life attainable tuners or sleeper hits. That might not be a big deal for some, but the novelty wore off really quick and everything just started to feel the same to me. I like Porsche but I don't need 30+ of them, and especially not when the other manufacturer selections are so sparse that you end up in situations where you're looking for something new and fun, and your choices are picking between 3 Acuras or a single (1) Datsun.  I also distinctly remember them advertising this game as having a better street scene than 4 and having a focus on cars from actual Mexican car culture which is just a straight up lie. There's 1 story line mission where you can unlock a beetle and that is the extent of that gimmick they marketed this game on. The characters are so terrible that I turned off dialogue so I would not have to hear them, and the story its self is just completely unneeded in my opinion. If you like time trials this game has almost none. The event creator is super bare bones and unfun to use. You can't invite people to your convoy through the game its self anymore, you have to use the xbox app instead which is just completely worthless. As far as I'm aware the only new races they've added since launch are from the hotwheels expansion which costs 20 dollars on top of this already unfinished 60 dollar game. The performance is terrible even on lower settings and anything under high looks like a late 360 game. Everything about it just feels soulless. This games biggest crime is being the only choice of open world racing game at the moment. Really hope something replaces it soon."
1496,Ezure,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199094776260/,3,1,0,38.6,July,"23,",38,0,1,"As someone that’s been a fan of the Horizon Franchise since 2016, I can say that I am disappointed in this new Forza horizon title.First of all this game is Incredibly dry, with barely any content (except for Horizon hot wheels) there’s no story to the game at all, and the progression system is terrible.Unfortunately the progression system has been pretty bad since Horizon 4 although some argue horizon 3 was also the same which I have to disagree on.But enough battering the game for a moment, let me name the positives.1. Improved graphics, The graphics in this title are fantastic and running this game at high - ultra settings is smooth as butter (you still need a fairly good computer to run it)2. Car sounds, The car sounds are a step up from horizon 4 however some car sounds have been reused and thrown into Horizon 5That’s literally it. I cannot think of anything else that’s a positive about this game, the online system is incredibly buggy, players randomly disappear off the face of the earth, you randomly disconnect sometimes during events or even free roam, and it’s been a problem for a long time since game release and the developers haven’t done much to fix it, sure they did try to make some stability improvements and fix some of its performance issues for online but it’s still buggy and it’s far from fixed.Speaking of performance issues, Horizon 5 (Especially on steam) is an absolute nightmare to start up, if you have a antivirus or malware enabled on your pc, your game will likely crash and not start up, and the only way to counter this is to turn off your antivirus/malware but even then your still at risk.It’s really hard for me to recommend this game as it’s got so many issues that I can’t even say all of it in 1 review that’s how much there is.Overall, the game is fun for a little while but gets boring after you get fed ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ super cars at the beginning of the game and maybe some from wheel spins.Aside from all of that, this game has a lot of issues especially the steam version and it makes the game unenjoyable to play and ruins the experience.I wouldn’t say the game is a dumpster fire but it’s definitely not in a good state.If you have Xbox game pass you might as well play it seeing as its free on the Microsoft store.Save your money and DO NOT buy Forza horizon 5 on steam."

Sadly the worst part of the game is however its progression, like cool i had 200 cars after 20 hours of gameply but i wont ever drive most of them simply because there is no point. In the other titels i mentiond have you saving money for a car you want and when you can buy it youre happy and want to earn your next car with the one you just bought. This results in good gameplay-loop which is completly missing from forza.DLC's btw not really worth it, if you like hot-whells cars tha go for it its a bit of fun at least and for the upcomming rally expension i've sadly lost hope the it will be be any good simply because it has preatty much no actuall rally-cars ???All in All i do hope the next game will be a reboot, otherwise the series will probably fail."

This one looks like a amazing game too, looks fantastic and another country to discover. so i got it early acces for 100 euros in the hope to play early with friends. When i first launched the game i got a crash right at the playground games logo, and that is all i have seen from this game myself, im honestly impressed the game looked soo good! such a nice (still earrape) intro that has not changed exept for it to be the only thing i have seen... I was so hyped for the game but no i am no longer hyped for it and gonna ask a refund for this, i tried all the steps to get it to run without any succes no antivirus nothing running etc etc.. Even if without antivirus installed it would run i would still not play the game, since i will never run my pc for longer periods without a anti virus. As of for my friends who came further than the playground games intro they had their fair play of bugs and crashes too, 1 of them did not go further than the home screen before it crashing to desktop, the other could not play online and the last one said he had never ever seen the windows reboot screen that much as the days he was playing the game and trying to launch it after a crash, he had to reboot his pc before being able to launch it. So for now i will give a negative review and gonna refund the game. I will probably get the game again in the future but i am not paying this much money for a earrape and that is all i will get for the game. And as last here a friendly message to Xbox game studios and playground games:TEST YOUR GAME BEFORE RELEASING SOMETHING! This honestly looks like a game without it actually being tested."

1559,Ne𝕏usMa𝕏us,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nexusmaxus/,2,,0,946.1,November,"10,",103,0,1,"Long story short, it's Forza Horizon. If you've played Horizon 3 and 4, then you'll know exactly what to expect. That means a well-crafted open-world with a vast car roster (that will get bigger like in H4) and plenty of things to do. It's a typical Horizon recipe that has led to success with the last two games and it's not difficult to see that it will do the same for Horizon 5.So why the thumbs-down? It's because as potentially great the game is, it's marred by a fair number of significant issues that should be patched in the months to come. These include;- LODs not working as they should on settings below Extreme. Even on Ultra, even textures a few feet in front of you load an extremely low, almost-PS1-like texture.- MSAA seemingly not doing much even when set to 8x.- Constant disconnects from Horizon Life.- Some jarring effects like your car suddenly coming to a halt and traffic/player cars disappearing suddenly due to the constant reconnecting with Horizon Life.- Some significant bugs including some Accolades being unachievable.I've not experienced any crashing so far, but I've seen reports of some people being unfortunate to experience them.Overall, good game, but definitely not worth the money especially for the top-specced Premium version as of right now. Once many of these issues are sorted, then I can comfortably recommend it. Until then, it's best to get it on Game Pass first to see how it feels for you."

Overall it is a beautiful looking game with a few minor issues with wheels clipping through fenders or the occasional light pole floating two feet above the ground. Driving physics is not meant to be a simulation but does provide a learning curve. The auction house has never been a viable system since there appears to be little to no effort to deter cheaters.Which brings me to one of my complaints, any of the online racing is almost assuredly a waste of time. Just about every race I've been in seems to either have a level 25 999 player (which would take over a thousand years to achieve without cheating) or level 2 player racing some low end car that ends up magically going around hairpin turns at full speed and winning by 30 seconds or more. If you don't have any interest in winning the online races, the only other caveat is the Eliminator, which is just arbitrary chance. Skill is meaningless; you just need to have the right car drop randomly next to you. This could be one of the all-time great racing games if Microsoft would actually do something about the rampant cheating and also eliminate the Eliminator."

1586,Eimilian,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bakphoon/,2,,0,410.4,November,"28,",392,0,1,"Note: This is coming from a long time GT fan and his first ""Forza Horizon"" video game. The review isn't one sided; the reason why I don't recommend it in its current state is because the cons outweights the pros. I might change this in the future if the cons are fixed. I've got to say that the RWD, FWD and AWD in this game just feels right. Understeering and oversteering are factors for all type of drivetrains which in some games aren't entirely existant. The only downside to physics is that jumping for thousand of feet in the air doesn't kill the car's suspension or better yet, doesn't bring your driver to the hospital! Lots of customization for both liveries and tuning. I was very happy to see that parts for the car like engines and drivetrains can be completely changed. This also changes the sound the car makes which is a nice addition. As for livery, I am aware that players are getting banned for some really stupid reasons. So be very aware of what liveries you share! Super7, eventlabs, etc. Community made content is what makes both a game good and bad. In this case, I'd say it's average for this game. Some of the community content are garbage and have thousands of likes. I mean, as an example, Super7 probably have hundreds of cards which hold the same jumps, highway runs and let's not forget go down that one huge mountain WITHOUT CHEATING! But yes, I'll leave this as a pro for now because I still enjoy it overall. Probably one of the best thing out there when it works. Playing with friends is what makes a game better if not best. It's sad to see that the servers have been struggling a lot and sometimes if not most of the time one of your friends will drop out due to something stupid like the servers not responding. To save up some ressources, I've decided to play the game in High settings. The game looks gorgeous! With photo mode you can take pictures that looks very semi-realistic. You could show it to a co-worker or a friend and they would totally believe it's your car! The game servers are struggling a lot. I still don't understand why a high budget game can't learn from others and actually put a bit more money into the servers. Some people claims it's bad netcoding which I entirely would believe. But not being able to play online pretty much breaks most of the features of the game which also includes playing with friends. I've been mostly playing on Highly Skilled as I felt like it was the somewhat less BS difficulty. And I mean less because the rubber banding in this game is way too obvious. The rubber banding is also only one sided. You make a mistake and you will not be able to catch up the AI. This can be clearly seen in single lap races when you have the best lap but end up coming in second place with an AI that has 3 seconds of lap time behind you. I do admit racing can't do AI right, even Gran Turismo has AI flaws. This is also one of the worse things I've seen in a game. Playing with randoms. It wouldn't be bad if you didn't need to do any of those, but the game forces you to do those races in order to win prices in a weekly ""seasonal"" event. Even in team races, the Forza community will still fight for first place. Some will push you, others will ram you out of the checkpoints. It's a bit of a frustrating experience so to say. Rarely you will get players who race ""clean"" but this is probably most likely due to the AI of the game forcing you to constantly play aggressively. I'm sure there isn't entirely a solution to this problem, but at least if there was a better collision detector it would probably at least make this less of a con. This game feels like a beta of an alpha version of a game. Things are VERY, VERY game breaking. Horizon Super7 cards crashing your game. The game teleporting you to areas you are not even suppose to be in. The game constantly pausing itself to show you progress while you're in the middle of something. Some car have non-working spoilers which is funny. This is just to name a few things I've gotten through in the 60 hours of gameplay I have."

I'm spending way more time dealing with microsoft's garbage than actually playing the game. avoid this and all other xbox games co-released on steam, since it's a fake steam release and they will punish you for it."

This is not a review comparing it to Forza 4, because i haven't played that game, but from a new player's point of view, this is amazing. I still get shocked by the amazing graphics this game has to offer, and the unlimited content the creators added is shocking, I really recommend it if you're into car games. A lot of people said that is nothing without a steering wheel, but i play it on an xbox controller only and i gotta say it's still amazing, but i would love to try it with a wheel as well!

If you like finding secrets, you can do that. Want to race? Dozens of them! Story-driven mini series? Sure thing! Want to spend 2 days on a vinyl group? Good luck! Just riding around, doing crazy stuts? Hell yeah!- I actually like the progression - which is kinda non-existent. I don't mind being able to get all the cars quickly - this means I can just drive whatever I want and most of the cars are indeed usable with proper tuning, so it's not like you'll use nothing but supercars.- I like the weekly seasonal challenges. They make you use cars you wouldn't normally use and do races/tournaments you also wouldn't do. They are fun!What I don't like:- The game is in need of a nice beefy patch. My PC is decent and I'm not really experiencing crashes or performance issues, but many of the online features are just broken.- It's probably just me, but I would really like some attractive character models. Sure, not everyone needs to be beautiful, but some nice babes to choose from would be nice as an option, thought they were somewhat part of the street racing scene.- There are tens of thousands of people in game, yet Horizon Arcade is dead. Convoy barely works. People are disappearing. The leaderboard has many cheaters and so far they haven't really done anything about them.- They could also do some QoL improvements and I'm sure some will come in the future, but they really need to get this patch done ASAP.Besides the online stuff, I have no issue with the game, it's definitely one of my favorites this year, highly recomennded.9/10"

Cheaters are everywhere in the multiplayer parts. Wheel support is basically non existent as in my separate wheel and shifter combo I have to redo the controls every single time I turn on the game. Otherwise I lose the ability to shift my gears. Playing wheel VS Gamepad/keyboard is really unfair, because the gamepad and keyboard cannot oversteer and cause the front wheels to lose traction. Lets not even talk about automatic vs manual clutched shifting which is basically completely broken as the manual takes 10 times longer to go into gear than the same installed transmission except with automatic.  Force feedback on wheels is an absolute joke. The most that you can feel is the car constantly trying to self-center and the stupid unrealistic constant shaking of the wheel when driving offroad(anyone who has driven a car fast on a dirt road will know how inaccurate it feels). You cannot feel when you lose traction either.EDIT at 96 hours and a few months later. My opinion still stands. There has been barely anything new added to the game and unlike the previous titles this one is now extremely grindy. The game is pretty, but not adding any new content for so long is making the game stale quite early on."

Not because it gets worse or anything, but rather because this game could and should be so much more than it currently is.This is the Horizon 5 gameplay loop:Come back once a week, spend about 20 minutes on getting a new car, and then that's it for the week.Once a month, look at the ""new"" stuff they added, usually at best 4 cars that are often extremely uninteresting, be disappointed, play NFS Hot Pursuit or Burnout Paradise instead.If it wasn't for me having a biological requirement to own every car in every car game I own, I would've put this one away quite some time ago...There is just something so uninspiring about this game.Take for example the 10th anniversary celebration event that is currently going on. I got all hyped up because I thought ""Hey, they surely put a lot of effort into this right? They even recreated all the original title screens inside the new map.""NoAll we get is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, that involves going from A to B in a reasonable amount of time in order to get 3 stars. Just like literally every other story in the game, alongside a car that is already in the game, but as an ""anniversary edition"".Nothing in this game feels like a breath of fresh air for the series. The seasons are just tacked on in order to sell their weekly content and serve absolutely no other purpose, everything you see here you've already seen since Horizon 3, in fact, you could probably swap the Horizon 3 and 5 UI and fool people into believing they're the same game.It's sad, since this could be the ultimate open world racing experience, but the devs seem to have absolutely no interest in doing anything besides the bare minimum to keep the ball rolling. They do their bugfixes, try (and often fail) to keep competitive racing fair-ish, add some random cars into the game that no one's really interested in (yay, a new electric audi, truly what all my car fantasies have always been about) etc etc.But where's the new stuffWhy no tuner events?Why no drift events?In general, why is the only thing you guys every think of ""Win a race"" and ""Go from A to B""? And don't come at me with your dumb weekly ""just for fun"" modes that are multiplayer only and also completely deserted about halfway through a week, I want something that is fun when played solo, because that's where good ideas come from.Why is AWD still op?Why did you waste time on developing a global ranking system where the only thing determining your rank is how much time you spent doing chores to gain accolades with zero skill involved?Why do engines, despite sounding somewhat better than last game, still sound so weak with zero punch behind them?Why did I finish the game itself within like 3-5 hours?Why are showdown races so hideously easy, but at the same time ai difficulty hideously unbalanced?Why is the map, besides being on the surface level very beautiful, still lacking the things the community has been asking for for years (e.g. a proper racetrack, a proper airfield, a proper drag strip with lights LIKE WE HAD IN HORIZON 4)If you want to play a game for what it gives you, rather than what you have to scrape from the bottom of the barrel, there is literally nothing to do here after like 10 hours of playtime.That would be fine if this was Minecraft. But in Minecraft, you go into it expecting to build your own adventure. Unlike Minecraft, this game doesn't keep generating new places to explore and things to do, and it doesn't give you the freedom to do whatever you want either. It just keeps regurgitating the same stuff over and over again.We should expect more, and we should ask for more, as the past has shown us that, with much less, other games have been able to give us much more.It is 2022, there are literally no technical boundaries to what these games could be giving us, why are we fine with receiving the bare minimum for more money than we used to pay for even the most revolutionary of games?Edit: Completely failed to mention the abundance of (often gamebreaking) bugs, the absolute desertedness of online lobbies due to their stupid zoning system, and the characters, which have absolutely no personalities besides *insert one of three mexican stereotypes here*, and genuinely made me altf4 the game a few times because I hated them so much.With like 3 lines of dialogue, they manage to make the characters more hateable than most movie villains...Also visual tuning on cars sucksAlso the map, despite being beautiful, also feels dead and sterile because they didn't dare to put some grime into it to make it look more like the real Mexico"

1639,TheHottShott,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHottShott/,4,,0,19.4,May,"6,",89,0,1,"As a long time fan of Forza, this game just feels, well, boring and forced, like many action movies nowadays. It's fine if you prefer a casual guided experience, though. Here's my top 4 gripes about the game:1. Forced Action. Don't get me wrong, action can be fun, but in moderation. It influences just about everything in the game, from narrative elements to track design. Tracks are frustrating, predictable, and repetitive, particularly on off-road tracks, which will frequently have massive jumps where you can't see anything outside of 3P view with frequently unpredictable corners afterwards making you reliant on the rewind function in order to be facing the right direction half the time. The narrative elements I feel are too frequent, too extravagant, with cringe dialogue. It doesn't let you just do your thing without in-your-face notifications and mandatory decision menus that entirely disregard whatever you were doing. Can't seem to enjoy freeroam much because of it.2. Economy. It takes AGES to get any sort of money in this game, and that comes from an an Elite: Dangerous player. Unless you're placing podium, you're making peanuts, maybe a couple thousand credits per race. You can increase the difficulty to earn more, but that has its own issues which I'll get to next. Once you actually begin to get money, though, you'll realize just how little you're making. For instance, you are more likely to get a vehicle that costs >2,000,000 credits in a randomized wheelspin than affording it full price before you've reached at least 10 hours of playtime on a strict no-spending budget, and it makes absolutely no sense why some things cost so much. Things that are similar in price in real life can be millions of credits apart in the game. Half of the classics are over 1,500,000 credits, and other with arguably better performance and attraction are 40,000. Absolutely no sense whatsoever. You CAN try your hand at the auction house (which, by the way, is the only way to get money for getting rid of a vehicle), where it is possible to afford a vehicle for less than it's autoshow retail price. The main issue is that it's a massive bidding war in the last 1 minute of sale, and by 1 minute, it actually means 1 minute and ""ending soon,"" which will inevitably last just long enough to allow someone else to outbid you without allowing you the same courtesy. You can also earn credits from creating tracks, car designs or tunes, but they offer so little money unless you drop the hottest new design for the most popular car out there. It's just a constant grind to do anything.3. AI Drivatars are either cheaters or grandmas, no in between. As mentioned prior, unless you're placing podium, you're making peanuts. You can increase your final payout by increasing the difficulty, such as skill of the Drivatars, or turning off assists. Turning off assists is fine, unless you're a diehard sim racer, most are going to stay on, and thus the only way to increase your payout is the Drivatar skill. Problem is, pretty much anything after ""highly skilled"" results in X amount of opponents possessing privileged grid position and ridiculously overpowered upgraded vehicles. You can tell them because there is a significant gap between them and the rest of the pack. You always start near the rear, and have to fight your way through the Sunday drivers to even get to the actual challenge, and unless you manage to get right behind these cheating AI within the first 20ish seconds of the race to be able to draft them, they will almost always pull away from you and defy physics, like pulling 2 lateral Gs going 130mph in a 1930s skinny tire Bentley. They're just broken.4. Numerous bugs and visual issues that make the game quite meh. The biggest ones involve various things missing at night, such as head/tail lights. One that's been bugging me lately is any interior 1P view is significantly darker than 3P views, like you're wearing the darkest shade of sunglasses you can find, 24/7. It's particularly bad during rain or dawn/dusk, where you have to turn the brightness up on the game just to be able to see the road, and other racers (who again, don't have any sort of lights). It's annoying, but truth be told, asides from the graphical bugs, the game is very pretty.There you have it. Play it how you want, but it's definitely not for a more hardcore experience. Wait for Forza Motorsport 8 if it ever comes out."

Is it possibly the best arcade racing game on the PC right now? Probably yes. Hundreds of cars, a really fun map, tuning and a lot of challenges - what's not to love?Well, the technical aspect, that's what. Playing with others is either totally painless and fun or a nightmare. Some of the challenges are terribly designed. Sometimes the game crashes, sometimes it registers button presses while the controller sits on my lap. While some things have been patched, most haven't and that is, for such a big game studio, simply unacceptable, especially because Horizon 3 and 4 had some of the same issues so they should've fixed them a LONG time ago.I don't regret buying or playing the game but sometimes it feels like it's been created by a much smaller developer and that just sucks."
1648,HotLeafJuice,https://steamcommunity.com/id/afrodynamic/,1,,1,170.9,January,"5,",493,0,1,"I'm not sure who this review is really for. I don't play modern racing games yet I grew up with racing games like Need for Speed Underground 2, Midnight Club 3, Burnout 3, Burnout Paradise and even Mario Kart. Yet for some reason the Forza Horizon franchise (since Forza Horizon 2) has always called out to me and I have been playing it quite seriously since Forza Horizon 3; Unbeatable Drivatars, all assists off, manual w/ clutch, no rewind. The long and short of this review is that Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game and there's really no reason not to recommend it to anyone who doesn't already have an interest in Forza or racing games in general, but regardless, let's start off with the good points.The graphics and general detail have improved; one simple addition here is tyre smoke that adds a satisfying feel to drifting, and even racing in general. The UI has been cleaned up nicely and in general it feels like there is a lot less clutter on screen and in the menus. If you can't see it in front of you, it likely isn't important. Mexico is a wonderful setting for the franchise and hearing that Playground Games actually worked with a team in Mexico to avoid things like cultural appropriation really makes me feel that they did their best to make sure the game was treated with authenticity.All the features that were added into Forza Horizon 4 post release have been baked into 5 in a way that feels natural yet exciting. Features like the Festival Playlist and Eliminator return in 5 with renewed vigour and in general Forza Horizon 5 absolutely loads you with things to do while simultaneously showing you there is no rush to do them. Anything you do will likely result in XP or earning some sort of accolade, and this feels pretty good. This is also an improvement on the more linear aspect of previous entries. You're still required to attain X amount of accolade points to progress, but how you acquire those points (story missions, road racing, dirt, cross country, PR stunts, etc.) is entirely up to you, as is the reward you unlock for completing these. It gives a sense of freedom that the Forza Horizon series has always been about.The story missions are perhaps the best the franchise has ever seen, mixing Mexican culture, photography, racing, PR stunts. The story in Forza Horizon 5 won't blow you away but I appreciate that there is at least some continuity from previous entries with characters like Jaimin reappearing for the street scene (which has surprisingly engaging story missions tied to it). Having our avatars now fully voice acted is a nice touch too, and I especially enjoyed the quips about our protagonist being eerily silent back in the UK.Other significant improvements have been made to engine sounds, with most cars sounding a lot more unique than Forza Horizon 4 and general handling of cars. More than ever it now feels like you have to pick your car carefully for each track rather than using a ""one tune fits all"" approach.So why does something feel...off about this release? Despite my love for the franchise, why is this the least excited I have ever felt about Forza Horizon? Well, one might say the devil is in the details, and the lack of nuance and polish in some areas has left the game feeling less like Forza Horizon 5 and more like Forza Horizon 4.5. These points are aimed towards the more hardcore audience and I wouldn't actually expect the majority of people to feel affected by these.Let's start with the Drivatar AI, which frankly is the worst it's ever been. In the post game of Forza Horizon 3, I changed my difficulty settings to Unbeatable Drivatars, manual w/ clutch, assists off and never looked back. It was tough at first but eventually I got to a point where with the right car, clean driving, good downshifting and proper throttle control, I was able to beat Unbeatable Drivatars by a narrow margin. This continued in Forza Horizon 4, although I noticed instances where the Drivtars would ""cheat"". In Forza Horizon 5 I still beat Unbeatable Drivatars the majority of the time but it just isn't fun anymore. I understand the game will always have rubber banding to keep Drivatars competitive and I don't mind this, but some races are frankly unwinnable without ramming the Drivatar in front of you and playing dirty. More than ever Drivatars seem unaffected by weather conditions or even corners, which they'll often take without dropping speed or losing any grip.A common argument I hear from people is ""well they're called Unbeatable for a reason!"" Perhaps, then Playground Games should consider changing the name to something else, like ""Extreme"" or ""Insane"" because there are accolades and achievements for beating Unbeatable Drivatars and having them cheat to keep them Unbeatable just is not fun.Secondly, the music is disappointing. While this point is undoubtedly subjective, I've seen multiple reviews expressing the same sentiment. Forza Horizon 2, 3 and even 4 had outstanding soundtracks. I'll always keep coming back to Horizon XS but I found I could enjoy music from every station. 5 has slim pickings and I often find myself switching off the radio entirely.Unfortunately, the most significant point in all of this is the buggy state of the game. We've got it all here. Crashes to desktop, graphical glitches appearing as lines in the road, lack of detail in foliage, tearing on terrain, stuttering entering in and out of events, a horrible overexposed sky box which frequently takes away from the beauty of the game by overexposing brightness and blinding you. I know no game is perfect but visuals are a big part of Forza Horizon and all of these take away from what should be a mouthwateringly gorgeous game. Furthermore, if you care about being competitive there is literally no point trying to set any kind of time on any leaderboard because they're all been taken over by cheaters. It seems no matter how much this is reported to Playground Games, the issue still persists. This segues into my final point. The competitivity of Horizon feels like it's died with this franchise. In Forza Horizon 3 you could choose whatever kind or racing you liked, be that road, dirt, cross country, street. In Forza Horizon 4 this was inexplicably removed instead cycling between the 4 types at random with the dreaded ""freeroam rush"" mode which had you charging across the UK taking whichever route you liked to a destination. However, at least you still had a ranked system which allowed for more serious racing.This has now been removed.It seems that, instead of building upon the ranked system in place, or even implementing a system that prioritises clean racing above all, encouraging players not to shunt each other into walls, Playground Games sought it fit to just remove the system entirely. As a competitive player, there is now zero reason to play online, and even less of a reason to attempt to race properly when there are no consequences for driving badly. This, coupled with the fact that smaller features like launch control and gears grinding when you don't shift properly really makes me feel like they want this to be a purely casual game, whereas previous entries felt like there was something for everyone.Overall, I still love Forza Horizon 5 and this game is an easy recommendation, yet I can't shake the fact that this is the least exciting and least polished entry in the franchise and many decisions have been made that don't feel healthy for the franchise as a whole. Perhaps it's time I finally look toward a proper sim racer but I would still like Forza Horizon to flourish competitively."

I had to return it sadly, there is a steering issue, since 2021, they never fixed. 100 dollar game and they are Microsoft and cannot fix the issue. I am done with them, I will just play 4, I love it anyway, 5 may be better, but I like the price of the game, the location and it's ability to actually work and be fun. in 4 it is much better for me overall after this experience. This is just my experience, obviously some do not have the issue. Corporations spend all this money, to get to us through marketing and advertising and throw it away in just a very short time.

It's a game where you can be casual and take things at your own pace. The story does reference the earlier games, so if this is your first horizon game that may be a bit off putting. The difficulty of the AI is adjustable. You can also control the level of assists and type of transmission you drive with. Mexico is a great setting and the scenery is breathtaking. Photo mode allows you to take action shots or park for a glamour shoot. I do feel that the lack of Team Adventures from the last game is a bit of a miss opportunity.From what I aware of there is still an issue with memory leaks on the PC version of the game, so it needs to be restarted occasionally. DLC 1 is coming soon and from what we've seen looks to be Hot Wheels themed. So it's an exciting time to get in to the game.I personally have felt a little burned out with this game in the past, after doing almost everything that's available at this time. What brought me back to the game recently is painting and racing with my team. I do wish there were a bit more of the obscure vehicles in this game. Unlike FH4 this game is missing Abarth, Alpha Romeo, Fiat, Lancia, and a few other manufacturers. I assume this is due to licensing issues, hopefully those cars can be added later as things get hammered out.Overall I'm very pleased with this game and have even gifted a copy to a friend."

Like all they do is copy / paste the last game they copy / pasted, that was a copy / paste of the game before that but apparently everyone just ran out of f***s to give real quick.Beautiful new map in places, pretty bland and ""FH1"" feeling at times.The skys look neat with all their real sky photos with real sunrise and sunsets when you're not moving, but once you are it looks flat and fake so arguably a step backSounds are meaty, but everything just has rasp turned up to 11/10 once you modify it.Meaty shift sounds.Brainless banter over co-op races is about the only ""original"" thing to do.It runs well, even at 3440x1440 on high preset on a GTX 1060They got rid of the stupid championship races, that you had to do on every single event to fully complete them. Now you can do each one 1 time, get the win and completion. Rather than do it once for event completion, then do a championship off the same event and have to do 3 more races to get full completion.No one. Not a single soul so far in my ~100 hours, has ever gone into / competed in the Horizon Arcade stuff.It's quick to drop in / drop out if you want to play something for a little bit with no hassles.Lighting is real nice. The foliage looks a little PS2 at times, but when you crank the settings up for photos and such, it can look amazing.The playground games are good if you have friends to chat with at the same time. And IF the servers don't just freeze half the cars so invisible ghosts are going around.When I finally figured out the davinci code to make my T300 work. It was pretty fun to drive cars I like around with an H pattern. Even if they corner a bit too well at high speed. Ripping an E60 M5 or an SRT-10 Viper with a wheel and shifter was great.Your character talks in such a condescending way it makes the voice and cut scenes almost comical. Like they give as much of a f*** about what's going on as the devs did making it.It's actually hard to think of stuff now :|Felt like they had 1 month to make it with most the assets from the previous games.A number of cars just half-assedly done. Suspension at 0,0,0 under the cars, lights work on 1 side and not the other, gauges spin backwards, the Delorean was listed as a Citroen, brake calipers poking out through wheels, some wheels with borked vertices so it looks like you have vanta black boudica spiked wheels.Cars have no weight some times, so if you get hit you either get yeeted, or just slip past who ever hit you and they get yeeted. If you're real lucky the ghosting might kick in and save you.Somehow the usual clunky Forza driving dynamics feel even more clunky.You know how something like a popular FPS game is pretty fluid, CoD, CS GO, etc etc, but then you try Arma and it's so clunky like your character cant remember how to move. Thats the driving in this. At speed it's normal Forza, but mid speed their speed sensitive steering values take out what feels like 50% of your steering input so you can't make 90 degree turns without slowing way down, or cutting them. The cars are not close to understeering, they just don't turn. This might also be due to me being used to being able to steer in as much as I'd like from sims.Seemingly for most the cars, if you brake anywhere other than going straight you tend to go into a 4 wheel slide, which tend to have to slow down to stop. Once you break traction, it seems to want to keep sliding, and usually the rear end kicks out like some half implemented tap to drift mode. Being used to trail braking in sims, this to me feels real weird, so I'm trying to get used to that.Servers even after the ""Fixes"" are useless, constant disconnects, every minute or so everyone just disappears, traffic just disappears, some times you just get reset in place like you've hopped a server, losing speed and usually skill chainSame messy UI with unrelated pictures on the tiles, for what the tiles actually take you to.Pretty boring really, If you played FH1, it's the SAME game, which is the same as FH2, and FH3 and FH4. Copy Paste the base and give it a new map.The story seems to be following 1 family where every story mission is just helping them do some task while they usually just self doubt their decisions while you talk them up, like you're telling a child that even though they made a mess, it's easy to clean up to stop them from crying.Every time you unlock a new adventure thing, it stops you and takes you in to the damn menu so you either have to pick a new thing, or exit it.Everyone's always ghosted in free mode unless you're in a convoy, so you may as well just be in solo mode because there's virtually 0 interaction with 99% of people. Very, very rarely do you get people that hang around and drive with you, even drifters are like a 70/30 split to just ignore you and do their own thing now.I'd have refunded it just from the boring cliche intro if it hadn't been such a broken mess it put me over the 2hr refund limit and I had a couple friends to play it with once I got into online .. 2hrs of trash to even do the first 15 mins of the game ..Drivatars are cracked out more than the previously cracked out drivatars of previous games. FH4 it wasn't too difficult in my opinion to get wins on unbeatable so long as you didn't miss a braking point, or crash into a car. Now, expert difficulty is a 50/50 of either, you win by like 5+ seconds even if you crash, or 1 drivatar just hoons off 5+ seconds ahead of you for no reason while everyone else matches your speed.FFB with my T300 didn't work at all, except for the centering spring setting. I had to load the T300 preset, drive for a second, pull the power plug while ""parked"" in game, reconnect the power plug once the wheel finally disconnected, go in an re-load and re-bind my controls and then it worked.And shockingly, it's not too bad actually. Not great, but unlike whatever they set up for FH4 you can actually drive well with a wheel, and even on sim steering (Which iirc T10 said was completely broken in FH4) it's totally fine.Class racing is still broken. Don't build a logical ""real world"" A or B class, just build it to RWD or FWD, with the best speed, handling and acceleration stats you can. I built up and tuned probably 50 cars now for A and B, and my stock FD RX7 with a massive wing and basically no other mods is the one of the best cars I've come across. If you take a low class car and build it up with good mods, you seem to just end up with either a car with good speed but nothing else, or good handling and nothing else etc regardless of what it's stats say.Soften the rear to minimise everything rwd wanting to drift.If you're jaded with AAA games being dumpster fires, don't bother at full price, don't be sucked in by the same crappy ""buy now to get this exclusive trash you wont even use anyway"" cash grab sales. I downloaded the Witcher 3 while I played this and I'm way more keen to finally try that, than fire this up when everyone's offline."
1664,Lazy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LZRobin/,4,1,0,53.5,November,"9,",258,0,1,"I Basically 99%ed Forza Horizon 4 and played a lot in its first year. Great game enjoyed it a lot. Congratulations to the dev team for bringing out this Game to great reception, but...Starting offPros:- more Horizon 4- overhauled physics(FH4 fans rocks are not deadly to a lifted truck anymore!)- a lot of polished and quality racing content- a lot of collectables - !!!!!!!not the boring UK anymore!!!!!!!Ehh:- Drivatars changed to be more aggressive. In higher difficulties they also have more grip at launch and in corners as well as more power. It def feels harder than FH4.- Gameplay pacing during first 10 hours bad imo. When you collect enough ill call it XP/ progress you get pulled out of what you are doing and have to choose what to do next. Its abrupt and annoying. Turning off speech doesn’t stop them from talking to you. Takes you out of the flow state of mind when you’re just driving races and blushing around in the beginning. disliked it a lot.Cons:- Story-- The story it has is in the way of gameplay and just annoying. low quality (sorry devs) story that take you out of what you are doing and basically force you to do it. not very ""we want the players to have the freedom to do what they want in the game"" - Rough Launch-- Stutters on high end systems-- Servers being servers on any online service at launch nowadays(your skill score/combo will most likely end when disconnected from the server, bc there is a chance your car resets in some way and you lose all momentum)-- Game locking up in upgrade menu- Multiplayer overhauled-- Removed comp queue / combined all the basic racing into one queue--- Can’t queue for one race type.- Horizon Solo Drivatars(the AI bots that drive around) will annoy the hell out of you in solo sessions. They spawn in front of you and will most definitely ruin your skill chains.Probably going to add more to the review as I continue playing.Specs R5 5600x RX 6800XT 32GB 3200MHz Ram on Ultra now at a stable 144fpsEdit:Going to uninstall and wait for a month or two.

The main things I noticed in this game vs. FH4 is graphics, cars, and mechanics; ill dive more deeply into each of these three things below, but to keep it short if you liked FH4 or even older titles; you'll like FH5 and see it as a direct improvement.Graphics:Mexico is beautiful, with a mix of great environments to the beautiful weather system the game looks very pretty and believable.Cars:While majority of the cars are old models from previous games; a lot of them have seemingly been redesigned whether through sounds or higher fidelity models, they look great and sound amazing! Also the physics of driving seems to have been redone and is much better and more accurate; especially RWD vehicles.P.S. I'm a big Mustang fan and im really sad that the 2020 GT 500 STILL has some inaccuracies with its model; the biggest one to me is the fact it's using the 2015-2017 Mustang tail lights when in reality it uses the 2018 - present tail lights, I know it may seem small, but it always bothers me. Another thing is the gauge cluster is incorrect as it doesn't have the Shelby speedo, instead it once again has a Mustang GT speedo. Again SUPER minor, but really annoying if you are like me and appreciate these cars like art."

And now, some of those problems are worse since the last update. Again. Once again, this game is broken. *Again*. 15 months of the game being in my possession, and it's still broken. 15 months. At this point, an indie dev team of 10 people could do better than this. If I was Microsoft, I'd be sending an exec down to PGG to see what the heck is going on, and anyone who even slightly failed to impress would be sent home immediately. Forza is one of Microsoft's staple series, and PGG clearly doesn't respect that anymore. Idk if PGG has suddenly just fallen out of love with this series or if they simply don't care in general about game dev and their community anymore, but it's got to be one of those two. Something is clearly catastrophically wrong with how PGG operates at this point. Between PGG pretending like the issues don't exist (ignoring their community completely in the process), and their honestly kind of impressive ability to break things further while supposedly trying to fix things over and over again, I have been more than patient over the past 15 months. But at this point, I have to stop giving PGG a benefit of a doubt, and they have to earn all of our trust back. PGG doesn't deserve this series, this community, or anymore time to come up with BS excuses. FH4 has been totally unplayable for months, and now this game has had it's 15 MONTH OLD broken problems that are now somehow even worse. It's pathetic. I hate leaving reviews like this. I hate coming across like a whiner, and I hate bashing on dev companies. But most devs have a good reason. They're a small team, budget issues, deadlines, something, anything. But PGG is out of excuses, and I'm done believing their lies at this point. We're over a year past release, and things are still as bad as day one. Now worse, since the last update. If you're team is too small, hire more people, you can more than afford it. Budget issues? BS, there's almost 30,000,000 players on this game, do the math. You have the budget. Deadlines? It's been 15 months. I doubt any deadline that's held up dev and polishing of this game held it up so much that we still have day one issues over a year later. No more excuses. At this point, this review is the final one. I keep updating it, back and forth back and forth. But at this point, no. Just, no. Y'all earned the negative review permanently. I'm not updating this one again. And I hope other's get on board with this. PGG needs to be a heck of a lot better, because unless they start getting their heads out of their backsides, shape up and act like somebody, then I won't be purchasing anything else in the future. I've been more than patient. WE ALL have been more than patient. We're done."

Some people are complaining about how similar this game is to FH4 and how there are some issues.It is true that the launch was just slightly rocky with mostly connection problems -which still need to be ironed out- and that the experience is similar to what you get in FH4.There is no doubt that the issues will be ironed out in time. As for the experience, all I can say is that this is a refreshing reiteration of a proven formula. That's not something bad at all. I really don't get what people were looking for. This game gives you a large and entirely new landscape to roam to your heart's content with a lot of gameplay tweaks and eye candy. In my personal opinion, I got exactly what I was looking forward to. In fact, I would be immensely dissappointed if they had changed the formula more than necessary.In conclusion, it doesn't seem possible to me that someone who liked FH4 would dislike FH5. It's a product that delivered. My only complaint is about regional pricing, which could have used a bit of work. But that's in the past now. A whole lot of people are waiting for a huge sale, and I almost joined them. Just saying."

Well - For the actual gameplay side of parts. The GPU and CPU are slower than minimum recommended spec, so of course alot of loading time increase.

All in all, this game can run on such a setup pretty decently so for all you low spec people out there - you may aswell give it a try? Its definetly worth the money anyways due to its HEAVY RANGE OF CARS. If youre a car guy? Heck yes. Go for it.On the performance side of things, the game actually doesnt put my pc to freezes at all, only an occasional softlock because im exceeding VRAM. Aside from that however, the loading times can stretch themselves up to multiple minutes if youre loading a polygon-heavy setup like racing in trucks. Ofc im running the whole thing at only 48% of min spec recommendation, ram excluded, but if that much can already play the game at 30-40FPS, at a minimum of 25 and a very very tiny amount of stutter (maybe twice per hour) , its done quite well.

Probably wait 6 month or more... as we already know the dev's aint that fast in fixing issues.There were bugs in FH4 which wasn't fixed in 3 years - so give that game time.Except from that bugs it's a great game but FH4 had a bit more flair.No go's:Horizon Aracade or multiplayer in free roam - full bugged since start of the game.There are little challenges called accolades - do this, do that. 20% of them are bugged and when there will a fix for that... we don't know. FH4 flashbacks kicking in with ""The magnate"" which wasnt fixed over years.Competetive players have a hard time here. Leaderboards are full of hacked results.Also they removed the ranked online mode - which was optional in FH4... yea thanks for that.Btw dont you think they wanna purge those hacked leaderboard results - they didnt do that in FH4 so they won't do that here.04.12.2021 Update:- Today there was a big patch - fixed a ton of bugs and making Arcade finally playable but the free roam multiplayer is still bugged. You still see most of the players vanishing in front of you.- There are still bugged accolades - but at least they fixed/removed 90% of the faulty ones.- Convoy is still or even more bugged as before.- Removed goldstatus from Series 1 but 2 daylies wasnt possible to finish.Lets see what the future will show us. Right now i'd would recommend it neutral. If you are solo player and dont give a f* on others you can have your fun in it. If you wanna hang out with your friends in convoys and do some free roam cruising - nope.The fact that this patch was 2-3 weeks too late i don't wanna forget to mention.Edit 07.12.21The constant freezes/CTD getting more. so whatever they did in the background, they made it worse.Now I'm feeling back to FH4 Steam release where also the game was broken AF.Edit: 09.12.21Series 2 started. They messed up the points on Season1 so you can't achieve gold status.On of the Season Challenges to obtain an achievement is hard bugged again.Honestly i have never seen such a dev team like PG. They are not able to provide a solid game w/o bugs.Edit: 28.12.21Situation is better now, they fixed the online part but there are still major bugs. On that game you also focus on completing the Series/Seasons but there are still full bugged challenges which you cant finish. Still bugged  accolades and really bad/wrongly translations. Like the latest daily challenge ""Destroy 25 bikes"" was translated in german to ""destroy 25 motorbikes"" but the actuall challenge was destroy bycicles...Update 27.01.22What a surprice - no update/bug fixes till that current point. Still bugged accolades, still one of the worst enemy AI in a racing game. All they do is drip feeding useless cars which you can get via wheelspins.All the time you can see statements, PGG wanna change this and that and overhaul for the better but bla - maybe in 2-3 years you have a good game.Update 27.02.23Hackers are filled up on every single leaderboard which exists.They continue drip feeding the playerbase and forcing you to do unnecessary stuff on daily quests - like Eliminator, if you dont do that you are lacking points on the end of the Season and maybe dont get the reward.There are still no ranked matches... On FH4 its bugged and they couldnt fixed it and since that game is most likely a copy paste of code from FH4 we will probably never get the ranked matches.The new implemented stories are boring and Donut story is literally a joke - 2 quests out of 5 could be done in 30 seconds. Rest is around 1 1/2 min. Hotwheels DLC:The Storychapter is literally a blatant advertisement for Hotwheels, its just lacking a directlink to the Hotwheels shop so you can buy some.The world/track building is super boring - no skill requiredThe UI is a huge mess - you will get a y/x hud right in the middle of the screen and huge AF so you cant even see whats in front of you - sure you can turn it off but who came up with that design decission to have it active and right in your face?German translations are still a messy.. with wrong quests/challenges - well that DLC is out for a while and those aint fixed yet?Its just a sad - so much potential but devs have clearly no clue about that spaghetti code and how to fix stuff or improve it.Ive heard they had big menu lagging which took 2 month to fix.You can fool the press agency which only scatch on the surface but as soon as you dig a little deeper you will see the mess and wrong design decissions."

The is a day-night cycle plus dynamic weather effects, creating an incredible atmosphere - the stormy jungle simply looks insane! Music selection is (as always) top notch, earworms incoming. Of course there's tons of stuff to, like the many many races of different types (like road, dirt, cross country, ...), story missions, stunts, collectables, multiplayer, daily & weekly challenges - and the literally hundreds of cars to collect, tune, and paint. The progression system is heavily focused on what I would describe as ""fun and chill"", meaning you will earn lots of money, XP and cars early on and along the way - a different type of grind that, interestingly, works very well!Things I'd like to see improved is better anti aliasing options, and an improved / extended multiplayer experience. Rarely smaller bugs still occur (e.g. a glitched weekly challenge or a random crash), but overall both game stability and game quality have been improved a lot since release.Edit: In a move I did not expect, they have added TAA as an anti aliasing option, and ray-tracing that can be used across the whole game.

FH4 is probably one of my favorite games ever, so it really pains me to write this review. Sometimes I feel like I'm not playing the same game as others.  While I notice not everyone is dealing with issues, there is no excuse for the game to be released in its current form to others. Horrific textures, major pop-in, connection problems, the whole gambit.  The cars look incredible but everything that surrounds them just look like they could be found in an XB360 release. As someone who bought the premium edition of this game, I am and remain disappointed to say the least. Those who played Cyberpunk on release will get major PTSD.

No meaningful story, progression or difficulty.Multiplayer is still annoying with the load times, but can still provide some enjoyment.

I've put a lot of hours into this game because I love cars and the environment is gorgeous.  Aside from that, the game is truly garbage.

The monthly/weekly challenges are tiresome and repetitive and likely only exist to keep you addicted for FOMO on new cars, which aren't new anyway.

1766,Colonel Rob,https://steamcommunity.com/id/testofskill/,2,,0,75.0,January,"24,",123,0,1,"Unfortunately at this time I've got to say Forza Horizon 5 has absolutely god-awful steering wheel support and they haven't made any efforts to improve on it at all. The game is good on keyboard and mouse or on a controller, but if you plan to play on a steering wheel then know that the cars will under-steer and over-steer wildly in comparison to other inputs, the force feedback is overwhelming in almost every case, even when tuning it down, it's just grossly exaggerated and totally unrealistic, and will literally attempt to yank the steering wheel out of your hands and attempt to veer you off in a sideways direction even when driving in a straight line, to the point that most players that want an even semi-positive experience have completely turned off force feedback and vibration. And if you want to drift, absolutely forget about it. You cannot hold drift lines like you can in any other game with halfway decent wheel support, the car always oversteers and pulls itself out of the line you're driving no matter what you do, and will quite often spin out entirely on it's own. If you dramatically change every single setting to their extreme settings, you can almost get a passable (as in graded as a D-) drifting experience, but it's still horrible, and then doing any other kind of driving at all is completely undoable without reverting those settings entirely. Until they do a massive rework on their steering wheel input and fix the automatic oversteering that the game ai does on it's own when a wheel is being used, I'll have to advise people to hard pass on this, unless you only plan to play on a keyboard and mouse or a controller, at which point it'll just be an average game like any of the other dozens of racing games that are out at the moment that also do not have steering wheel support."

I think for me it did have the better graphics and scenery out of the two, but the driving physics were better with 4 (in my opinion), however the real reason 5 didn't make the top choice for me was the sheer number of cheaters in Eliminator. They are allowed to blatantly cheat, (cars appear out of nowhere, disappear as a level 1 bug, then reappear a second later as a level 9 to challenge you, hyperspeed to the point where they had to start turning the speed down because when they would go over a hill they would fly through the air for miles at a time and we all thought they had flying cars! LOL, ability to make a level 2 car go 200+ MPH beating all the level 10 cars you may have struggled to get legit, etc.) If any developer or mod ever played they would see what is happennig because it happens every single game.  The cheaters usually go down to a hidden area of the map and turn off challenge (you can't challenge them till they turn it back on) mode and just drive in cirles. (I've seen up to ten cars doing this at once). Oh, and don't get me started on the hall of fame records, where you might jump 1 or 2 thousand feet and think you did good, only to see you needed to jump across the map to place. LOLThat aside this game could easily have been in the running for one of the best games of all time, so sadly you will still enjoy other aspects of the game, you'll just have to live with it being an incomplete game due to cheaters/script kiddies using wemod, or tables to cheat. If  you are into cars (I am) this game (like the others) has an absolute stunning number of beautifully detailed cars, super cars, hyper cars, rally cars, muscle cars, and on, and on. The graphics on them is about as perfect as I've seen on any game and to be honest it's getting hard to determine if you're looking at a video game vehice, or one in real life.This game is in my top ten favorites of all time still, but it makes me mad because I know it could easily be top 3, or perhaps even #1I will most likely keep picking up future releases in the hopes that they start to ban cheaters (permanently losing your Steam account would make them think twice! LOLIt says I've played it 60+ hours the last two weeks, and over 628 hours total so I know what I'm talking about.See you on the track! Say hello, and keep an eye out for those barn gifts because I'm sure one of them will be from me. I try to gift out cars (even 20 million dollar epic ones) to new users, and have probably given away more cars than I own! :) Cheers and have fun!!!"
1776,OverlyRedundant,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OverlyRedundant/,1,,0,5.0,January,19,151,0,1,"tl;dr solo play is fine, playing with friends is terrible After sinking many hours into FH3 and FH4, I was excited for all the new things in FH5. I’ll say the core gameplay experience is great, much the same as the previous titles, but only if you’re playing solo.Trying to play the game with friends is a nightmare. There were similar issues  in FH4, and I was hoping the latest installment (especially a year after release) would have resolved them. Unfortunately that’s not the case. Here’s the short version:1. You go to invite someone to your convoy, this kicks off a pop up from the Xbox app to pick friends to invite2. Friend doesn’t receive any in-game notification of an invite. They must alt-tab and open the Xbox app to see/accept it3. You’re now in a convoy, but you’re not in the same online instance. I guess start a race to join up with your friend?4. You do a race together, race finishes, maybe you’re in the same instance,  maybe you’re still in a convoy, it’s a dice roll5. The Xbox app (installed via Microsoft store) also requires two separate apps to be installed in order to function6. At some arbitrary point, neither person receives invites from the other person. One person restarting the game seems to fix it.7. If at any point something goes wrong, you get to go through the entire convoluted process of trying to group up againAll of the above, coupled with the 3-5 minutes of staring at your car from 1 million different angles before you can even start racing with a friend.But I’m sure glad there’s all the Hot Wheels things in the game. Can’t wait for Lego to make a reappearance. Oh and I can’t forget the blessing that is the character creator. The third option in I get to choose prosthetics for my character. And the next page I can choose a hearing aid. Oh and I can choose my pronouns?! Amazing. I’m so glad a racing game has these options! I can stare at my Hot Wheels prosthetic-armed, hearing aid equipped, gender inclusive human for 5 minutes before every race and feel fuzzy inside.For such big developers and being backed by Microsoft, along with previous titles being largely the same thing, one would think that playing with friends would be a straightforward and functioning process. Alas, I guess I’ll be waiting for FH6. Refunded after 5 hours of “playtime”"
1777,Aerodil,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002170706/,1,,1,36.1,January,15,105,0,1,"Recommended only if you don't already have Forza Horizon 4.If you do or if you think about buying FH4, don't get this one.I don't know if it's the UK map that somehow feels more atmospheric and cosy, the missions and the crazy stunts that seemed more exciting or selection of cars that seemed to be more varied, but FH4 just feels better than this.I kinda liked the FH4's story as well. This one though, the characters are so annoying and never shut up that I kinda hate all of them, especially the technician guy. And yes, I know this isn't a narrative driven game but come on! This is one of the worst dialogues I've ever had the displeasure of sitting through in a game.The game is by no means bad. If this is going to be your first foray into the Forza Horizon series I say go for it. But just know that FH4 is outright better.And for those who think going back to an older game might mean sacrificing the new and improved graphics of this one; you don't need to worry. The game looks practically the same since FH3."
1778,Mall Ninja,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006738054/,No,,0,901.0,January,3,222,0,1,"Pros:Great selection of 600+ cars of all makes and shapes. Upgradeable, paintable, tunable.Driving feels really good, even offroad. Arcade well done.Large map, many biomes (city, desert, mountain, beach, jungle, hilly plain).HotWheels expansion - incredibly fun and packs a lot of content.Cons:Becomes completely pointless after a while. The game bombards you with prizes and free stuff in the beginning, to hook you - then you enter the normal game loop of mindless grinding and auction sniping to get expensive or hard to find cars. Out of my 100+ hours, about first 40% was OK, then grinding and gifting and auctioning and wheelspinning to complete my collection, Still didn't, but i don't really care anymore.Basically, after a while you end up with a large car collection and nothing to do with them.Not recommended."
1779,Kimiko,https://steamcommunity.com/id/HypocriticalDragon/,1,1,0,304.5,December,"24,",803,2,1,"Everything about this game is gorgeous. We've really perfected the art of realistic cars. Lighting and weather effects are majorly impressive.But the game is only just fun enough to keep you invested. The singleplayer story events range from boringly easy to annoying rather than properly difficult The returning British cast of Horizon 4 are all ear-grating - it has nothing to do with the accents, the way their dialogue is written is gag-worthy. There is no real progression. Most races are just too easy. The only real overarching story that isn't one of the self-contained episode event sets is over within two hours. The game throws cars at you endlessly that I can't find myself caring about any of them aside from the ones that I know are competitive in the multiplayer. There's so many cars and so many different versions of cars, but none of them have any real identity or customization, and so they all merge together into relentlessly given-out car vomit.The seasonal content updates that happen every four weeks are largely copy-pasted content from the older games that was for some reason missing from the game's launch. Most of the events in these updates are just versions of existing races in the game, with the majority of new maps and races being community-sourced (and seldom focused on).Forza Horizon 5 tries its best to be the most approachable racing game for regular people, and in doing so just ends up being boring. I enjoy and play some sim racers, but aside from the new Need for Speed, there aren't many purely arcade racers being made anymore. I am tired."

He played it for a while he convinced me to give it a try after learning that my real life daily drive was in the game (Fiesta ST). Since then, I've totally fallen in love with the game. We currently have 227 hours and I (dad) probably have more of those than he does. It's been a great father/son bonding activity. Part of what keeps it fun is that the developers are continually adding fresh new content to keep the game from getting dull. There's always something new to do. Possibly best of all, as an open world you can play the game any way you'd like. Like street races in supercars? Like off roading on ATVs? Like painting cars and designing custom looks? Just want to chill and go for a casual drive cross country? Like the challenge of PvP or prefer to keep it strictly offline with AI? It's totally up to you. The only critiques I have are minor and are likely the result of it being a console port. We live in an era where things are regularly released with game-breaking bugs in the knowledge that the public will pay the developer to do their beta testing for them. If interface annoyances are the worst thing to complain about in a title, that's probably a good thing!The FH5 user interface and keyboard shortcuts are all over the place and make zero sense. Some menus you have to randomly hit some special key to continue and no mouse click will do it. One time it might be ""push 7 to confirm"" then another time it's the enter key or the space bar. Sometimes you can mouse click the confirmation, other times not. There's no consistency. To start the game you have to tell it 3 separate times that you're really sure you want to play the game. First, run it in steam. Once that loads you get a splash screen where you tell it yeah I really want to start now. Then it does more loading until yet another splash where you have to hit continue for it to finish loading into the actual game. I've customized the buttons on our steering wheel. I have to go into settings and manually change it from default Logitech binding group to my ""custom 1"" binding group EVERY SINGLE GAME. All of these are minor annoyances that you get used to eventually. I'm 44 now and have enjoyed PC gaming since the Commodore 64. I have fond memories of Half-Life coming out as a new game. Now my sons are both in love with Black Mesa and reliving a game franchise I enjoyed long before they were born. Point is, I've been around a while and played a lot of PC games.That said, I'd put Forza Horizon 5 is the top 5 games I've ever played.  Highly recommended for any gamer from casual to hardcore."

My only complaints thus far are that you still cannot alter downforce/lift on a majority of cars without installing that super ugly Forza Aero, and that the game physics still won't you properly rock climb, even if your car has enormous knobby tires and 15 inches of lift. What I've enjoyed most about FH5 so far is that it seems like you can leave a car in RWD and not feel like you're making a major sacrifice in terms of grip/overall handling.

Developers seem to making the game worst and worst every update. I am not sure where there priorities are but it's becoming evident that they care less about making the game good. I may only play the game every once a while now because I enjoy driving in the country side , but the seasonal changes I couldn't be bothered. Especially PGG, that is unbearable. Rewards are not worth the effort and wheel spins were changed to have lesser credit options which is a spit in the face. Series challenges are basically the same every week, so new content is extremely thin and spread out. Game performance has been getting slightly worst, which makes no sense. Players still disappear online for no reason. And the trials are frustrating as ever. Sigh...I hope the game does get better in the future but at this rate, it really does seem like they don't care."

1868,the snuuy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LotusEnduroGT/,1,,1,357.8,November,"23,",117,0,1,"My most anticipated game of the year after being disappointed with FH4 and getting burned out and frustrated by The Crew 2 for the last couple of years and... it mostly lives up to the hype.I've got a lot to say about the game, so let's start with the positives. + The campaign is much more engaging than the previous game; the Accolade system lets you progress at your own pace but also incentivizes winning races and 3-starring PR stunts and Horizon Stories while the previous one was more ""just do the race and we'll mark it as complete no matter where you place"".+ Mexico is easily one of the best maps in the entire series, possibly on par with Colorado from FH1. Plenty of different map locations such as mountains, canyons, deserts, jungles, beachside towns and the colorful city of Guanajuato. Mexico also has a shocking amount of verticality, especially in La Gran Caldera volcano and the canyons.+ Car sounds easily blow FH4 out of the water. The previous game sounded like absolute trash, this one is a major step up and I'd argue it's honestly THE best sounding game on the market right now. Performance customization actually affects sounds too which is neat; mainly intake, exhaust, camshafts. forced induction and transmission upgrades.The game isn't without its flaws however, some particularly egregious and detracts from the experience though.- Playground removed significantly more cars than they added in-between FH4 and FH5. Over 200 cars from FH4 didn't make the cut, especially notable with brands such as Aston Martin, Lotus, Maserati and Vauxhall, whose lineup took a huge hit. It's likely they'll be re-added through the Festival Playlist over time, but that's another problem in and of itself since that system is reliant on one of my personal gaming pet-peeves, timegated content, especially if it's old content repackaged as DLC.- Playground seems to have doubled down on the criticism about Wheelspins ruining progression; while it's nice that they're less clogged up with cosmetics, cash payouts are much higher and cars are more frequent. This is more of a plus for casual or Game Pass players, but for hardcore racing game veterans, this could be seen as more of a negative for people who wanted more traditional progression.- Online is AWFUL. Players constantly disappearing from each other's instances in the map breaks Convoys with friends and makes Horizon Arcade almost impossible to complete. Eliminator is still buggy too, sometimes when I try to challenge other drivers on the map, it doesn't actually work.- Shaky optimization on PC. I'm running a GTX 1650 and Ryzen 7 4800H and while the game runs fine at 60FPS on High settings, the performance consistently begins to dip 90-120 minutes into a single play session. Definitely a memory leak, in a similar vein to FH3 and FM7's shoddy PC ports at launch.While this is easily the best arcade racer on the market right now, there's a lot of technical things that need to be fixed, such as the optimization and some online features. Hopefully these get addressed sooner or later, but either way, I'm going to be spending a lot more time with FH5. It's  too much fun for its own good."

I recommend the game, but keep in mind the drawing distance problem.Original Review:As of 10/11, the game on the rtx 2060 looks like cow ♥♥♥♥ and from what I've read, quite a few users are having this problem.I skipped the fact that for an hour I could not turn on the game because the game spontaneously shut down on the logo screen.

I loved 1-3, but playing 4 and especially 5, I feel like Horizon 5 is essentially an expansion DLC for Horizon 4. Essentially the same game at its core with a new coat of paint like the new map. Beautiful looking game, plays well and the mechanics are incredibly refined. What bothers me is how soulless the game feels. Has no sense of linear progression and because it's so non-linear, I feel like this is the game's ultimate detriment. There's quite literally nothing left to do after a week's worth of grinding. The seasons are repetitive with piss poor rewards and recycling content from prior titles and monetizing it as car pass DLC (which is pretty egregious). Addressing the elephant in the room, the glitches, crashes, and optimization issues I've encountered are so frequent that I simply refuse to launch it out of pure frustration. I still cannot launch the game properly without it crashing me on at least 7 or 8 times before it finally loads up. To add insult to injury, the online play has been atrocious with constant disconnects, and I've spent an unhealthy amount of time just trying to create a damn convoy. It's also quite incredible to me how we're 3 months into its life cycle and there still is no custom playlist feature for Horizon Open where we can filter through what class restricted races the player can match make into to. I'm tired of seeing basic feature sets like this being added as ""content"" to a live service game and this is sadly another title down the depressing pipeline of triple A ""live service"" gaming. I really wanted to like this game and after 130 or so hours, I simply cannot recommend it in its current state over derivative gameplay, a severe drought in meaningful content, the crashes, glitches, bugs, and poor multiplayer experience that still plague this game, and the fact that it just feels lifeless as a Forza Horizon 4.5 DLC. Despite all this, I'd consider getting the game a few months from now if it does get any meaningful DLC expansions, fixes, and feature sets that should've been in the game day 1 (can't believe I have to say that in 2022) down the line in future patches that make it worth your while, but for now, hard pass."

Restarting the game repeats the cycle. A solution which actually works for me and a lot of others according to the steam forum, is using Nvidia Studio drivers instead of the gaming drivers. You can find these in GeForce Experience under drivers -> 3 dots in the top right.Anyway, something is wrong, and I fear that a lot of ""Professional"" reviewers, who were all given the XBOX version, will only quickly gloss over the PC version without proper testing.As it is right now, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone since it's a AAA full price game that is full of bugs and gamebreaking performance related issues.Since it's overall still a great game underneith all that, I would recommend the XBOX version since it's supposed to run extremely well, or wait for the PC version to get patched, which hopefully will happen relatively quickly. Check out the discussion pages on steam to check about the current situation.EDIT: With the latest update there's even more crashes, still virtually no traffic and barely any other players.

The social system is beyond broken, its nearly impossible to make a stable convoy, most of the time you wont be able to see your friends in the convoy if you can even get into a convoy. As many other reviews say, cheaters are everywhere, the devs dont care. The grind in this game is horrible, and the devs instead of punishing exploiters prefer to drag down the entire playerbase by reducing wheelspin rewards, making race rewards tiny, and just generally throwing busywork content into the game to keep you occupied for a bit until youve gotten bored and realize you cant refund this unfinished game. Wait until 2024 to buy this. PGG sold an unfinished game and expected the buyers to do all the testing for them.Edit 1: Played an additional 70 hours. Very little has improved since release.

2015,Ash,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BODARK-86/,1,,0,6.6,March,18,718,0,1,"I really enjoyed forza horizon 4 the setting was perfect and the seasons made sense. The world was fun to explore and the graphics were stunning. Forza horizon 5 just didn't have the same appeal to me. The world is feels empty and I don't like the broken english spoken by the characters in the game. The weather is just kind of pointless also, dust storm, thunder storm and and another dust storm. It gets kind of boring and I think Mexico was a poor choice of locations for a Forza game.The cars are basically the same as Forza 4 its a quick copy and paste job so most of the effort should have been around the world building. I can't see myself completing this game as my way of playing the game isn't about car collecting but instead just exploring the world and doing the races and I have no interest in doing either of these in forza 5. I tend to find a car I like and just stick to that one unless I have to change based on race requirements.I hope for the next instalment they will choose a better country for the game to be set in where actual seasons can make a return with weather that is more realistic rather than dust storms every 10 minutes.Finland would be an interesting place to drive around or maybe even Sweden, Iceland or Norway.Also it would be great if you could have an avatar that doesn't look like a 9 year old boy.Anyway I don't recommend this game, if you don't own a forza game yet just get number 4 its a lot better."

After the divorce I found myself often lost, i was completely left alone with my thoughts. One day my 15 year old son: ""Brian"", approached me to show me a video on his phone. It left me completly flabberghasted by how ""scary"" it seemed. When my son left i couldn't think of anything else for the rest of the two weeks before i saw him again. When he came back he asked him again about it. He told me it was a funny little video""game"". When he left again i decided: ""heck it."" I will buy it. I booted up my pc and started playing.Wow... I found myself wondering around the island, i chopped downtrees, killed road signs , and enjoyed the beautiful sunsets. The story of finding sexy robot twins really connected with me. After the divorce I also had to find my son again. Every two weeks when Brian came over i told him about the funny little adventures. The closer i was to finding sexy robots, the closer i was to finding Brian...I will not spoil any of this amazing story, but wow, just wow... The ending left me in tears, i couldnt sleep for days... Still, whenever i am going to work or biking i am always just thinking about this beautiful masterpiece named ""Forza Horizon 5."" (A fitting name i might add since it has horizons)If it wasnt clear already, Yes! I advice anyone with a ""brain"" to buy this masterpiece.

I have a PC and have played a lot of racing games with my Logitech g29 and I cannot get the settings right. I have seen so many tutorials and changed my settings so often that I am losing my mind. Off road is almost uncontrollable. I get death wobbles pretty much every time I drive. I want to play but it's unplayable. Also the PC integration is horrible. Having to figure out what buttons are what... my god. Story is bad and the people are annoying it just feels like lazy writing. If they can fix the steering I can get past it. I was hoping to have fun in this game but I just end up quitting out of frustration. The worst racing game I've paid for.

2087,goge,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199111226502/,1,,1,28.0,January,24,8,0,1,"I bought this game just a few weeks ago because it was discounted. Someone might ask: being a Forza-Horizon fan why you didn't purchase the fifth series last year? I was playing Horizon 4 at that time and had no desire to buy the new game, Horizon 4 has spectacular views of Scotland, and all of these 4 seasons are presented differently, which made this game fun and playable; however, I quickly regretted it after playing the first round. Initially, I can feel the image quality improved greatly. In the previous series, there are some places blurred even though I changed the quality in the settings but there is a little flaw in 5. In addition, Forza-Horizon 5 is DLSS-available, which means gamers with RTX graphic card installed laptops or PCs can have a better gaming experience. Secondarily, there are more adventurous plots included in horizon 5. For beginners who lack driving skills, adventures can help them to practice different skills like driving in the jungle. Apart from that, you can choose the storyline on your own, for me who does not like street-chasing, I can finish the apex, wild, and Baja races first and then return to the street-chasing story, which makes this game more freedom. One more thing, this game's setting is an open world, which means sometimes if I just want to drive through Mexico rural, I can spend hours and hours passing through deserts and jungles without barriers.Overall, I strongly recommend this game. It has an open world, a free storyline, and a better image for your eyes. The map size also expanded, which makes this game worth to play, to enjoy."

Its a game that feels like its more about cars than it is about racing. NFS payback and heat are far superior quality racing games compared to forza because its focus is on racing and making money through actual competitions to advance through the game. Cities in forza also feel extremely liner and don't give a sensations that you're actually driving through a city something forza could learn a thing or two about from NFS.I could let my other complaints go if it wasn't for the constant prizes. Its not gratifying when you win a high end car from the none stop prize wheels. You are pretty much receiving a participation trophy, its a very lame handout that must be the reason its so appealing to younger generations."

But I can say that this game for me is much more relaxing with much less at stake. I get to just sit back, drive a few races, and collect cars.It's the ultimate Casual Racing game and I'm all for it.This game has set the bar for what Need For Speed can be and customers of both franchises should continue to hold both companies up to standard."

However, I'm still able to run high graphics at 60+ FPS most of the time. Anyways, I'm very excited to explore more on the map. The size and the wide scope of activities is overwhelming. The re-gifting feature is a really nice touch for those that don't care about money. I ended up getting over 13 cars gifted to me on the first day including a 918 Spider, Bugatti Divo, Lexus LFA, and a Pagani Zonda Cinque Roadster...

I loved FH4, the environment, the cars, the details, ran well, and the communal feeling.They set this game in a literal desert: it is desolate place with a handful of people in one place. The map is actually TOO big that you feel isolated, and the few people that are in the server are either in the main festival or all spread about. Then on top of that, Forzathon is just empty. It was so empty on launch, that they patched it so that less people contributed more points. Compare this to FH4 where almost 75% of server will show up and have a grand ol' time, and then scatters off back to what they were doing when they were done. You have none of that here, and the only interaction I have is with Horizon Adventure lobbies and the Trial as per season requirement for cars I wanted.The game also runs so much worse than FH4. I don't know any technicalities, but FH4 runs like smooth butter on my 2070 MAX-Q, but will dip below 30 FPS when it is not an average ~40 FPS all around. This despite the fact the games look mostly the same anyways. Again, not my area of expertise, but potato computers that could run FH4 can't run FH5 is what my experience entails. I mean Christ, they still have not addressed the optimization issues and I wonder if they just gave up on it. I quit mainly on the fact that the more updates the game got, the more unstable the game seemed to get, to the point that I was having awful desync issues and teleporting around. Not to mention the fact that convoys in this game are so hard to get working half the time. To say that there are a bunch of technical issues in this game is an understatement and the biggest turn off for me that led to me uninstalling it.The story is also just garbage. You are an instant superstar that everyone must know about every waking moment. The characters are hollow smiles that never, EVER not happy. Their dialogue is so bland and cringy. FH4 mostly left you alone to rise to stardom and never really smothers you in bland NPC interaction besides stories, which were fun if not challenging. FH4 just lets you race and leaves the story aspect as something optional. FH5 just smothers you in never-not-chipper NPCs that are so lifeless and hollow that it gets annoying real fast. This is personal opinion of course, but I feel racing games just don't fit story lines very well: just let me race and build my career without all the fluff thank you.Hot Wheels DLC was the only real fun I had so far, as it was much more interesting and fun than the entirety of Mexico. On that note, as of the time I am writing this review, there has been very little new content. Donut Media DLC dropped after I uninstalled the game, so I cannot form an opinion on that, but from the content I saw on it, it is more or less just copy paste of FH4 assets like they are somehow brand new and designed to keep me engaged in the game.That sums up this game pretty well: a hollow, un-optimized, version of FH4 that adds only a few new things and little else. You can call it Forza Horizon 4.5 for all I care.I will wait for FH6 to be in Japan, but I will never buy the Premium edition ever again unless it was worth it, like in FH4."

They capture the festival culture and car culture of each games location very very well.Horizon 5 however feels like it's treating you like a 7 year old and trying to lecture you about the culture instead of just implimenting culture into the game.Horizon 5 has lost touch with it's core audience (that being car fans), and has opted for a wide and broad audience, which is killing the longevity of the games life and playerbase.FH5 is insultingly childish and treats you so. I certainly won't be pre-ordering these games in the future, I probably won't even buy them until months into their life cycle.The horizon franchise is dead."

I think if you go into Forza thinking it's a NFS-competitor, you might actually be disappointed, yet I'm stumped these 2 games are compared closely by many online, and many seem to prefer Forza.. I really don't get it.Here's the thing... NFS is pure arcade, Forza is NOT, at least not if you play with all assists off, Simulation steering, and enable Manual Shifting with Clutch. Forza is a SIMCADE. Fight me all you want on it, it's the definition of a SIMCADE. I'll explain why.I haven't driven a real car on the road in 20 years. I remember nothing of my brief experience driving my dad's car. But I actually learnt how to drive on Forza Horizon 5 using a Logitech G29 wheel + Shifter. Now I can drive just fine on Automobilista 2, and if I could do THAT, I know the MECHANICS of how to drive a real car. Though following traffic rules n stuff might be a challenge to come in the future. My point being, this game strikes a great balance between arcade and sim - it allows driving with all assists on, using your handbrakes in every corner like a NFS player, but it also appeals to those who want to experience SIM racing at its basic form - hence it's SIMCADE. Also, in order to win in Forza, you need to follow racing lines, manage throttle pressure, actually brake in corners etc etc, which don't really apply for NFS. So I feel comparing these two together, only makes sense if you choose to play Forza with all assists on. Even then, if that's what you prefer doing, you lack cop chases in Forza, a story and progression that's meaningful, like you have in NFS. I feel NFS wins that battle.But if you're a person who just likes cars, and wants to experience driving 100s of cars, listening to how each one sounds, and experience how they all handle differently, Forza is AMAZING on that front. And especially if you own a wheel, this is a very chill experience, because driving between points is actually relaxing fun - on a controller I just want to skip to the next race.Conclusion: If you like cars and nice graphics, this is the game to get. If you simply want a more action packed game, get NFS."

This is the first racing game I ever purchased. I figured I have a controller, a Razer controller, mainstream company shouldn't be an issue. Get in game, I cant move left or right.I can't steer the car. I can accelerate and I can break....that's it. The controller works in every other way in the menu and other UIs but when in a race I cannot change my direction. So I start checking out Youtube tutorial and steam forums for a solution, and apparently this is an actual issue with others also. So I try everything, doesn't work, and give up and request Steam for a refund. DENIED. ""You have played more than 2-hr max limit."" Okay. So I tried to just get a wallet refund and use the $60 to buy another game, which actually works. DENIED. I was in game for 4-hrs. I bought the game less than 12 hrs ago, spent all of the 4-hrs trying to get the game to work on my controller, have zero achievements or anything, but I exceeded the 2-hr limit. This is such a scam. Had I actually played the game, I would accept my fate. I am just letting others know to be careful with Steam. They are scamming people out here. To not even give credit so a person can buy a game they can play is just not fair practice in my humble opinion. Gaming industry is becoming very toxic and scammy. Enjoy."

The 10th anniversary update is enough of a joke and you wouldn't think they can lower the bar any further, but oh boy they manage. The Donut Media update - the latest one, is absolutely awful. Recycled events, recycled character models instead of modelling them after actual people they're based from, and a bunch of recycled car from Horizon 4 treated as ""new"". All the while a lot of QoL changes that people have been asking since the 3rd game have been continuously ignored. Not to mention the absolute lack of support for single player content, if you don't plan to race in multiplayer expect to get bored quick (although my 400hr playtime might have lowered the credibility of that claim a bit).If you're going to buy a Horizon game at this time, buy 4. It's got smaller, less varied map, and much worse sound but they're basically the same game - and cheaper and more completed.I'll update the review once they actually improve the game.For now, I don't recommend it especially not at full price.EDIT 1 (2023/01/09): Horizon 4 is crashing like crazy now and I don't think anyone can actually play it with stable performance at the moment, so don't buy Horizon 4 either lol"

I will start by saying it was worth every single dollar.  This is the most gorgeous racing game I have ever played, and the car count is not only insane, but the sheer level detail into everything down to the engine sounds is staggering.It's not perfect, but my gripes are minor.  I wish there was underglow, just for sake of making your cars more personalized.  Also, the multiplayer aspect is utter trash (read the discussion section of the game page, as I don't feel like getting that in-depth about it).  You should also be able to sell cars straight-up instead of having to auction them, FFS.I would recommend the hell out of this game, more for single player ripping...  Bombing through Tropical Storms or Sandstorms in multi-million dollar rides is breathtaking. I will play this game for a LONG time.Oh yea...

There are some small problems with updating positions over the network men in general both players see approximately that same thing at the same time. (but it is not a competitive FPS experience)The things that I do not like.1. After the ""Donut"" update the game will not start at all. (I hope this will get fixed)2. You need a windows online login and you need to find your friends through xbox game bar and it is a bit of a hassle to start a convoy. I do not understand way this is not handled through steam.3. When you play a race and you would like to play the race again but with another car or another setup, you need to exit the race go back to the open world back up like 10 m and start the event/race again. This takes way too much time and there is way too much loading involved.4. The menu system is way to complicated, and you need to load in another menu if you would like to tune your car or just see the 0-60 time. Things that you only use one or two times doing a gaming session is impossible to remember the location of. Also a menu should be intuitive you should not need to remember anything.Update: 55 hours 22-11-22 (dd-mm-yy)After the Donot update I have to shot a python program that I am running on my pc, otherwise the game will not start. and as soon as I open the python program the game shuts down. I guess it is some anti cheat thing.But the only thing the python program do is logging and plotting my CPU temperature, water temperature, CPU power and frequency.After the Donot update there was a small 2GB update, and that update have made my game crash in the middle of the game.Now I also have much more trouble getting into a race with my convoy, and the load times before starting a race is even longer.It feels like you spend 50% of the time dealing with crashes and loading the game, 25% racing and 25% driving around in the open world."

Let me tell you you need to have at least 4gb vram the game eats VRAM like crazy if u have under 4 gb vram  u can't play it.  actually, u can but u get stutters, lags, and errors you can play stable  with  more  ram more than 8gb because optimization is  nice but  not great  and u cant  get  60 plus or 60  fps  because of the limitations of  vram anyway After Forza Horizon 4 Forza horizon is evolved with this game everything about it (well not everything..) it's better than Forza Horizon 4 the map is  huge  ı mean  its  huge  ı have never seen a bigger map  on  any  Forza game it has more activities on the map more story things, etc and u can play any race or mission coop and it is great  the only problem is fewer cars than  Forza horizon 4 but they gonna add more ı am sureand the car engine sounds are more realistic than FH4  u can feel the car u are driving not like the same engine in all cars if you love Forza horizon 3 and 4  u are  gonna enjoy this more than FH3 And Fh4 but u need a good pc -------------------------------------------------------------------------------And Let's compare the Forza Horizon 5 with previous games---------Good Things About the game :+Optimizaton is very nice+ map is bigger than any Forza game and lots of stuff to do + engine sounds are godlike every time you hear the sounds ohh god ...+ more realistic than Forza Horizon 4+ Better multiplayer + gameplay better than any racing game ---------------------------------------------------------------------------Bad Things About The game :- There are Still Lots of bugs's in the game an advice stay away from the rocks- server problems, crashes- seasons are a big disappointment after  Forza Horizon 4 there is no winter and seasons are just gone ı mean they're here in the game but you can't say there is a difference between seasons they are all the same- It is less fun than Forza Horizon 4 You need to grind more the get rewards, etc and wheelspins are nerfed you 7/10 u get money instead of a car. and fewer forza edition cars than Forza horizon 4 and that's a big lose- The Wheelspins aren't the only one is Nerfed The Car Speeds Are too you Can't do 500 kmph anymore even with Jesko and kinda ruins the game's fun. I don't know it is a - but the 2021 Cars are Dlc not All Of them but Nice ones are--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Forza Horizon 5 is more realistic game than fh4 and 3 you can't do broken engine swaps you won't get more wheelspins or cars or Cr You need to grind more to earn rewards etc  but. there is one thing that hasn't changed FUN YES it is Still an Fun And Enjoyable Game ı recommend without questioning  if you love racing games and cars it definitely worth a try"

Which is what I bought the game for. That said... many gripes:- the menus are a mess, there's so many random things to click to claim and unlock that it's just a pain - alt- tabbing out of the game won't let you get out of the menu, until you toggle the fullscreen option- GPS just breaks sometimes, had it chirping at me constantly throughout an entire 20 min race - loading times are long- when you play in a convoy, if one person misses the invite (because they're stuck in a loading menu or still stuck leaving the last race) you have to leave and remake the convoy and repeat the whole process to get the race set up- the story / voices are annoying, just let me drive !  - one time, I spawned on top of a highway tunnel on the side of the cliff- probably spend more time driving to a race and more time loading into the race, than racingBut all in all, the driving and racing part is great, so it does what it needs to. Just wish the rest could be tightened up a little."
2300,Naruto,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198848761527/,1,,0,66.8,October,"28,",29,1,1,"This game, hmm,,, In short : TAKE THE GAME IF U DON""T HAVE FH4. I took this this cause I bought FH4 relatively recently and had not done much grinding in it and didn't want to do it again for the FH5, so bought FH5 to do the grind in this instead. BTW I highly recommend the premium edition to save some of your time in the grinding part in case you don't have much free / playing time like me.what this youtube video to understand better: PROS:1) Great Open world with different zones ex. forest, desert, arid etc. to do a freeroam around.2) Great variety of cars3) Good driving experience 4) Great communitySo far it looks good RIGHT!!!! Well ironically the good points are somewhat bad. WHY?CONS:1 and 2 combined) As I said the Open world has different zones so that means that u only have a section of map if u want to play only a particular climate and even in that the SNOW is a very small area. Personally I am not a fan of snow but coming from FH4 the decrease in size of the play area hits me hard as I don't like the SAND and DESERT part much which greatly reduces the map size.If this was not all the second point of PROS will make it a bit WORSE that is Great Variety of CARS. People coming with the thoughtthat you will drive in 10 different hyper cars to chill out after working hard for hours. LOL!! WAKE UP FROM YOUR FAIRY TAIL!!until and unless you have spent hours farming for credits you can't buy those Hyper-Cars. Let's make a rough estimate of the grindingLONGEST RACE: GOLIATH (54 KM) which takes about 10-12 min. with a BUGATTI DIVO on average difficulty gives the followingrewards:a) 30-35K experience (basically 2 lvl ups) which in turn gives u 2 wheel spins which can give you an average credit of 100K.b) 150K direct credit.c) some other extra stuff such as car mastery points which don't have any credit value but let's say worth 10KThis takes the total to: 260K BUT a decent hyper car can cost you anywhere from 1MIL to 4MIL easy and hence you will spent at least your starting hours (may be around 30ish) just to get a couple of decent hyper-cars.What this essentially does is takes away the joyful experience of riding your vehicle across the enormous open world.I know you get some good cars with the premium edition but that's not even nearly good.SO although this is a huge open world and great variety of cars it doesn't allow you to completely leverage it.3) GOOD driving experience....... CORRECT. Good driving experience -- CORRECT again. BUT DRIVING != RACING. The racing element is complete ♥♥♥♥. Do I even need to explain it?-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------BOTTOM LINE: TAKE THE GAME IF U DON""T HAVE FH4. I took this this cause I bought FH4 relatively recently and had not grind done in it and didn't want to do it again for the FH5 so bought FH5 to do the grind in this instead.At this point I think that this series is better to be bought in rotation for even next to next title. like FH, FH3, FH5 and FH2, FH4, FH6 (when it comes).COMMUNITY is the only good part of this."

Everything you might want in a driving game is in Forza Horizon 5, with two negative exceptions:The soundtrack is not very good at all, especially compared to other titles like The Crew 2 (which has an amazing soundtrack, but is otherwise inferior to FH5 in just about every way). This includes low track variety and quality.The game doesn't have much, if any, of a progression arc. You get access to basically all different kinds of races and car classes almost immediately, from minivans straight to supercars. While I feel like this was definitely a significant missed opportunity, you should still play FH5 if you're looking for a really solid driving experience with a diverse set of tracks, race types, and cars.The game has great in-depth tuning options that you can take advantage of, or not if you prefer to simply get a car, upgrade it to a standard racing preset, and get to racing."

The scenery and graphics are outstanding. This isn't just a game for the average gamer, as a car enthusiast, this game contains many iconic cars from all around history. Cars such as the AC Shelby Cobra to the early iconic C1 corvettes, name a car and this game will probably have it. The stories and missions this game features are amazing.

This game has a problem with performance, I'm running pretty decent hardware yet since launch I am still having problems to this date with crashing on start up. If I do some how manage to get pass the first loading screen after about 30 minutes the game starts having massive lag spikes and environment textures start flickering! For example, roads flicker to a all black colour and trees, grass and etc flickers to tiny CYMK coloured squares. Honestly, ray traced Cyberpunk 2077 runs 100x better than Horizon 5 at the moment!19th of January 2023 update:So turns out that my computer was the problem, had to use a DDU program to uninstall old driver updates from an old graphics card I had. Turns out this fixed all crashing issues, and the texture issue was fixed sometime August last year.  So now that I have had time to enjoy the game properly, I can say this is probably one of my favourite Forza's to date. Its addictive!"

But for what I paid I was expecting more. Long loading times, unskipable cut scenes, frequent bugs and crashes, is just the start. Along with cars that are locked behind special event walls you will never get,  The only way to sell cars you don't want is through a live action house, no used car dealer. Which means most of the time you will be left giving your duplicate cars away for free when they don;t sell at the action. When it comes to visual customization of the cars, 90% of them will only have the same bland body kit option. The list goes on."

A lot of time in the game is spent advertising to you and trying to get you to buy DLC or car packs. Outside of that, it's basically an off-road simulator. Got yourself a hot Ferrari? LOL you're never going to race it. Every race is off-road, or has off-road components. Stick with a rally car for literally every race and ignore all other cars, and you'll win more. This is super boring, obviously. Forza 4 sucked. This sucks worse."

When starting the game it crashes, while it's loading it crashes, and sometimes while driving it just freezes.For unknown reasons the crashing problem only seems to occur on AMD graphics cards. Although the 2 PC's on which this problem occurs are quite high-end as well as being well above the recommended specs and have absolutely no problem running the game on max settings,but even when lowering the graphics settings to the lowest the game still manages to crash. The game has had many updates but to no avail. Everything we have tried to resolve this issue hasn't seemed to work. I have notified Playground Games but i've had no response and nothing has changed for now.So to sum it all up the game is great the graphics are beautiful and it's fun, but the only bad thing is that it crashes :)"

The ultra settings for textures and world geometry are bugged, after playing for about 30 minutes you'll get rainbow textures or foliage will have a missingno-esque texture. The game runs fine, it looks fantastic when everything works properly. The racing feels like a forza game, if you played 4, it's basically the same game new area. The reason for not recommending the game is because of the issues that haven't been fixed since the game came out. Looking for solutions or other people experiencing these bugs and you'll see it all the way back to when it launched. It breaks the immersion and sometimes ruins the game. If you have ray tracing on there's a chance the game will crash while in the garage because of a bad texture. The courses that they release for the timed events are cool enough, however, they have a lot of issues, they tend to be these long and winding tracks that go up into the air and do tight turns and what not, it's cool in concept, but it feels like it was put together by an amateur because there are huge seems in the tracks where you'll hit it and you'll lose all speed and can't make the turn requiring you to rewind and hope you don't lose too much speed. That's not the only issue though, it seems there are a lot of graphical issues with these tracks too, causing huge pieces of geometry to disappear, for example, I did one that was really cool, but the mountain was disappearing at certain angles and it looked really bad. The base game races are quite fun though. If they can get better seasonal track design and fix the graphical issues, I think that it would be worth the $60, but as of right now, get it one sale for cheaper, or just wait until you see an update to the bugs.I should mention my specs before people call them out for the game being poorly optimized.RTX 3070 OCI9-10850K32gb 3200Mhz raminstalled on an SSD, 1tb, only about 200gb of storage used. windows 11 installed on NVmeand most importantly, have a nice day :)"

There is lots of customization for tuning and paint jobs etc.  Its even better with friends.  Except for when the game crashes.  Online racing is fun except for when people who have an extra chromosome decide to do nothing but ram.  Brainlets like them ruin the online racing.  If that is not for you there is Rivals which is posting time trials on a leader board for a sprint race route  or circuit.  Monthly and weekly challenges fell a bit grindy considering that's the only real way to earn most of the new cars that get added into the game.  It would be nice if they added more new cars even if they were just regular cars that aren't sporty, and give them  crazy engine swaps.  Who wouldn't want to put a 1700HP Twin Turbo V8 in a toyota corolla  with  offroad suspension and fly through the baja portion of the map or put drag slicks on it and shame every trust fund kid in a lambo ont the road.  Anyways now that im done with this probably useless review the TLDR is Game Gud but people who can't drive at all will ruin it regardless.  Anyways back to my regular scheduled existential crisis."

The game needs heavy optimizing because (in my case) when I play for 3 hrs. + the game starts to have lots of lag and I get heavy frame-drops (even tho I don't have a potato pc) and when I play online after some time the textures go crazy (the road is rainbow, the mountains change color and so on). Update : Recently I saw Forza has optimized their game like there are no more frame-drops and personally I didn't experience the rainbow glitch. And for people that have Rtx graphics card (including me) the only place that the game has ray-tracing is in the garage. Overall its a great game, stunning map and beautiful sights."
2568,gillg06,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034283826/,No,,0,29.4,June,"28,",34,0,1,"EDIT: I just logged into this game for the first time in a month or so, and the experience I had changed my mind on recommending this game. Everything said below still applies, but...well, hear me out.Today I was so excited when I logged in to see that there's a new expansion! Upon opening the game, I was brought to a loading page that showed the cool new Hotwheels tracks. I loved Hotwheels as a kid, and these cool, mid-air tracks looked really impressive and fun. I immediately set my GPS for the location. It looks really cool and I got really excited. I drove basically all the way across the map over about 5 minutes, got to the event, and watched the really exciting video describing the Hotwheels expansion, which really got me amped for the experience. I was ready to purchase the new Formula 1 style car and give it a go. I hadn't seen F1 style cars in the game before, and was really excited to try them on the new tracks.After the hype video, I was brought to a landing page that described all of the perks I could get if I buy the expansion. Since it brought me right into the event when I loaded the game, I had assumed it was just part of the game, and felt a bit led on, but was kind of relieved to see I would get a bunch of other perks for buying the expansion....until I saw that the expansion pack I had been sold on was FIFTY DOLLARS?! The Hotwheels on its own is only $20 - about double what I had expected to pay - but I was a bit relieved seeing I would get extra perks with my purchase...until I saw how much the extra perks cost!I just feel like I've been duped. I thought I bought the full game. I thought maybe I'd need to pay to get certain cars early etc, but I didn't realize I'd get hyped up about cool new content and perks, only to learn I'd need to pay almost the full cost of the game *again* to get them.You lost me. I will get my money's worth out of the game, but I'll probably never buy another Forza game unless they really change the way they do business.------Original Review------I have really mixed feelings about this game. I have enjoyed it quite a bit, but nonetheless I am left feeling disappointed with my purchase.This was my first major racing game in a long time. I've played loads of Need for Speed and Gran Tourismo games, but never Forza. On one hand, it's definitely a very complete racing game that has the ""real feel,"" ie it's not insanely unrealistic in terms of driving physics, like, say, Need for Speed games. That said, it's also not incredibly punishing; my car doesn't get wrecked when I drive through the desert, so it's still a fun, casual play. The car customization is deep and thorough, with rather realistic performance upgrades and just tons of visual options. The car selection is second to none -  all of the classics are here, plus tons of awesome new stuff, and a bunch of obscure cars I'd never even heard of before. The graphics are great. The true open world approach is really cool as well - I love just roaming the map and enjoying the beautiful scenery, while also racing in the open world (albeit on confined tracks).Despite all this, I've gotten bored really quickly. I maxed out my car in under 20 hours of gameplay, and I've already gotten enough credits to buy insane high end vehicles. There's no real story content. Despite offering loads of customization and a huge selection of cars, the game feels incredibly shallow. I don't feel very invested in the game world, or my car. With maybe a few dozen races under my belt, I feel like I'm already just kind of polishing off content to 100% the game.  I don't think I've ever thought of any game this way before, but somehow this game isn't linear enough - you just earn credits, upgrade your car, and do whatever you want. It sounds nice, but it got boring way too fast for a game at this price.If you want a fairly realistic racing sim that isn't *too* realistic, with lots of car choice, an open world feel, and deep customization, this is it. If you just want to do some casual racing with relatively quick access to all of your favorite cars, that's what you'll get here.But if you want a game you can sink hundreds of hours into that will give some sense of accomplishment or investment when you are finally able to fully upgrade your favorite ride, or unlock that crazy high end car you've been dreaming about it...as much as I hate to say it, and as much as I hate EA...I think the Need for Speed games still have it beat.Overall I love this game, and I still recommend it, but I can't say it's as enjoyable as some of my other favorite NFS or GT favorites."

For my money, this spin-off series has built its reputation and quality around different foundations. It’s a series about culture. It’s about the mood, the tone, the feel.Part of all that is how each vehicle literally feels as it cruises around its open world map, but a bigger part of it is that nebulous, difficult-to-describe thing the game activates within you. Many things activate this bit of the brain, like over-the-top set-pieces and silly motoring stunts - but an enormous chunk of it is about one thing: the game’s world. I love this game!"

2585,xJSerpent,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theamazngamer/,1,,1,820.2,June,"24,",51,0,1,"My updated review for Forza Horizon 5. It is a long one so be prepared to read.PROS:-FH5 offers a wide variety of cars to choose from. There's almost always a car you are bound to enjoy driving and building. -Driving physics has improved since the previous game. RWD and FWD cars now feel much more usable in races, rather than always having to AWD swap a car. I sincerely enjoy racing in online lobbies in my RWD car, even if it requires more skill to drive. But that feeling of winning or gaining a podium finish felt more satisfying than a 'cheesed' win.Now for CONS, and this is a big one:For one, the difficulty balance is horribly designed. In most races, the AI in first place will almost always be too far to catch up to that getting a first place finish is impossible. The way that the AI are structured in races is this: hard to catch up to but once you overtake first place, then the AI backs off. There's no level of consistency in races. The wins just don't feel satisfactory at all if the competition backs off when you take first position. Worst of all, the AI can be really cruel in cross-country or dirt races, where they will harness an unworldly amounts of grip on dirt. It makes lower class races impossible to win because your car is too underpowered and lacking that grip, or S2 races feel like chaos. Second, the Horizon story and characters. The story missions feel lackluster and the dialogue is just unappealing. Everything just feels 'safe' so it's not pushing any sort of creativity. Showcase events are too scripted where the AI will always stay ahead and drastically slow down so you'd win to get that 'photo finish' win. Also, some of the story missions that requires you to get to a destination on time to get the 3 star rating just feels awfully written. The game pretty much wants you to cheat and not stick to the route suggested, otherwise you won't make the 3 star time. Third, the balance of performance for cars. This game does emphasize on being able to use any car in races, but NOT in online racing though. Because of ""meta"" cars existing in this game, almost everyone will just stick to what's the best to win races without ever venturing in using whatever car they want to drive. 9/10 times someone just uses a meta car and outright wins the race with no sweat. How's that fun? Also with online racing, the ghosting system NEEDS to be improved. Ghosting only works if they detect your car about to slam into the other driver from behind, NOT from the side. Because of this, everyone will just stick to the 'Fast and Furious' tactic of driving: shunt your opponent from the side and ram them off course so they crash or miss a checkpoint. Other than the flawed ghosting system, there really is no punishment for unethical behavior. Fourth, the atmosphere of Horizon 5 feels empty. Everyone crowds around the main festival site whereas the other sites feel small or bleak. The large, open world of Mexico is not great, but not terrible. I love the variety of desert, rain forest, the coast; but something just feels off about it, mostly the lack of depth or population that fills these areas. Fifth, and this one is more of a nitpicky one. The customization is bad. Livery editing feels off and the amount of official sponsored liveries is not enough to satisfy my scope of creativity. It's not Need For Speed Heat I can tell you that. The game also feels like it lacks customization options: from the spoiler options to the wheels. Plus the lack of widebody kits also hurts this game's scope of creativeness. Hopefully they'll add more customization options soon. Sixth is another small nitpick. Why did they get rid of Alfa Romeo and Lancia? Plus a few other cars missing from the roster that were in FH4 really makes this game feel like a downgrade rather than an upgrade from the previous game. Again, I can only hope they bring the missing cars back in future updates and add new cars that people are aching to see in the game. Seventh, the wheelspin rewards are uninspiring and outright an insult. There's no easy way to make money since everything is almost made by wheelspin rewards: credits, cars, etc. Getting socks and cringy emotes are certainly the worst. Lastly, the game doesn't have a great progression system. In previous titles, you had to work for the cars. But now everything is handed to you on a silver platter. You don't start with one car, you start with three cars, plus you get free gifted cars at the start, including two supercars. Where's the sense of progression and knowing you worked hard to grind races if everything is given to you? It feels more satisfying to save up those credits or maybe win a ton of credits from wheelspins to buy the car you want. Despite these criticisms, I still do enjoy Forza Horizon 5. I would ultimately give this game a 7/10. Even though I had a lot of cons to point out, it's not to say this game is bad. I just wanted this game to be better than what it is."

After i saw the trailer for the new expansion(Hotswheels) i couldn't resist myself to get the game here. So from my experience I say, Go for standard edition if you want to have FUN and CHILL, but if you're BORED and TIRED of the same cars and map, then go for the premium edition as it includes both the expansion as well as exclusive cars."

Right out of the box you get hit with the pronouns at the avatar creation screen which is very off-putting. Next, because this is MEXICO you instantly get hit with a BLACK British woman which again is very telling that this game is woke. Why is there not a Mexican woman/man to greet me? This is a disgrace. The forced diversity is awful. Thank goodness the player can turn off her voice and not see her too often. Aside from the vomit inducing, woke nonsense, the title runs excellent on my laptop using a 1660ti, i7 w/ 32 gb of ram on High settings. My cars from previous games are transferred over which is nice. All the world icons started to litter the world screen with all the familiar activities. The game is not as fun as Forza Horizon 3 which is a perfect arcade racing game. I encourage anyone to check out that game before buying this one. The graphics are identical and the gameplay is better on FH3.Don't buy this boring wokefest. Buy Forza Horizon 3 instead."

From the stunning world, to the engaging gameplay, and the incredible sound design, this game has it all.The setting of Mexico is breathtaking and truly captures the essence of the country. From the lush tropical forests to the sprawling deserts, each location is meticulously crafted and feels truly alive. The attention to detail is impressive, and the graphics are some of the best in any racing game to date.The gameplay is smooth, fast-paced and offers a wide range of activities to keep players entertained. From high-speed races to intense off-road events, the action is non-stop and always thrilling. The driving mechanics are tight and responsive, and the cars are diverse and offer a great mix of speed, handling and power.One of the standout features of Forza Horizon 5 is the incredible sound design. From the roar of the engines to the crunch of gravel under the tires, the sound effects are spot-on and truly bring the game to life. The soundtrack is also fantastic, with a wide range of music that perfectly sets the mood for each event.However, despite all the fantastic aspects of Forza Horizon 5, there are a few issues that need to be addressed. The AI can be incredibly difficult and almost unbeatable, especially when playing using a wheel controller. The AI doesn't appear to respect the laws of physics and this can cause a lot of frustration for players. This issue can detract from the overall enjoyment of the game and needs to be addressed in future updates.In conclusion, Forza Horizon 5 is a true masterpiece of a racing game that offers players an immersive and thrilling experience. From the breathtaking world, to the engaging gameplay and incredible sound design, this game has it all. While the AI can be a bit of a challenge, it does not detract from the overall fantastic experience that this game provides. Whether you're a fan of racing games or just looking for a great gaming experience, Forza Horizon 5 is a must-play."

This is going to be a weird one.I am in love with this game and was in love with Forza Horizon 4 as well. This is one of my favourites and I can spend 10 hours a day easily just enjoying the music and driving around, drifting, racing, doing showcases, etc.The good:- Music. This is the ONLY game that I enjoy while listening to the in game radio. It is beautiful, the radio feels live, changes according to your progress and the song collection is one of the best. I even ended up saving the Spotify playlist. The audio transitioning is amazing, one of the best I have seen.- It knows how to create the perfect environment, the perfect vibe for you to enjoy it. This is one of those games in which you will spend hours just roaming around, vibing with the music. The game feels like a party all the time.- Unlike all the other games where you ""start from the bottom"" and achieve something, here you don't. You already are a superstar, the main attraction of the event and the one everybody cheers for.- It doesn't need any grind for you to unlock stuff, you get plenty very easily, even for multiplayer. Oh and the multiplayer, there is so much to do there. You can go co-op or play PvP and I have tried both, if you got friends it is hella fun.Now the bad part. The game is HORRIBLE for PC users. As good of a game Forza Horizon 4 was in this department, this doesn't even come close. - Random FPS drops to single digit are pretty common.- Any time the podium shows up, there will be stutters during the car showcase, every single time.- The game always freezes after a couple of hours of playtime and has to be force closed.- If you are able to play for a long duration or just stay in the menu AFK for a few hours and come back, the game will start to run terribly. The FPS will keep fluctuating between 25-60 every few seconds until you restart the game.I have a decent build and able to run most of the games maxed out on 1080p and still reach 80+ FPS. Even Battlefield 2042 gave me less issues regarding FPS and I was able to enjoy that, but this just seems such a bad one. I never buy games for the full price, especially AAA titles that aren't solely multiplayer and wait for a couple of years.I still highly recommend it though, so much worth the full price. I can easily see myself putting in a few hundred hours before the next one comes out."

2708,ASS SNIFFA,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jesssak/,1,,0,453.2,April,"28,",167,0,1,"I want to start with if this is your first horizon game, this is a great game and i would give it a good review, however I will be writing this review based on returning players.I have always been a big fan of the horizon games, pouring over several hundred hours on fh3 fh4 and fh5. The game is a great arcade racer, nothing can compare to this franchise. However the transition from fh4 to fh5 has become stale very quickly. Most cars are just copied and pasted over and it feels like there is a genuine lack of content. I preordered this game with the dlc's and now I have very little hope that something good will come out of it. If you are a seasoned horizon player looking to buy the latest installment to the franchise, i would highly recommend waiting for a sale or until they provide more content. Overall i would give this game a 6 or 7 out of 10.Update: A lot of people seem to like the hotwheels dlc while i do also hear that a lot of people dont, I personally had played several hours into the new dlc and have quickly gotten bored of it. Already have experienced in FH3 and reusing the dlc seems very lazy. Was really hoping for a new map that would add more ""race track"" areas instead of the lackluster one we get at the horizon festival back in mexico, or some more mountain passes or larger cities that have more enjoyable routes rather than the long open stretches of road that get repetitive quickly. Still also awaiting current generation cars to come like the gr86, yaris, g80 m3, i20/i30/elantra n, and the nissan z. Even if they brought back more older gen cars like they did with the celica that would be great."

If online races were non-collision with other players by default and you didn't get a slow-down for understeering and running into a wall (every car understeers btw) the game might be playable. Horizon 3 got it right but PG has since forgotten everything.

Its too casual :/To be fair, the sole driving and racing experience is done very well for what this game is trying to do. FH5 really nails the arcade racer experience while being grounded with simulation racing elements sprinkled here and there. That balance is what makes this a real joy to play, not to mention the further expansion of the off-road /  rally gameplay. Its like the game tries to tap into a bunch of good elements from other racing titles, but doesn't ever dive too far into any one thing to please a hardcore fan. For a casual racing experience its worth the money. I'd imagine my 14 year-old self would play the crap out of this.However, if you look past the flashy stylized triple-A package that this game brings forth, there's not a lot of depth. Like I mentioned before, this game is not for a hardcore racing fan. When playing, I get the sense the developers were like, ""How can we get the most people to play this game, even if its just for 20 hours"". Which sucks, because if it did double down and flesh out the various mechanics instead of the surface level ""appeal to the casual player"", then this would be one of the greatest racing games ever really.Then again, I can't really be mad at the game for doing this because that is exactly what the Horizon franchise sets out to be. Getting the casual gamer to come out and enjoy a racing game.I guess I'll just what for the upcoming Forza Motorsport title to be truly satisfied.P.S. - The fact there's not a ranked competitive multiplayer is a damn shame. That's ultimately why I stopped playing. I get why they would get rid of it from the previous entry, but seriously? Like that's such a good way to get replay-ability out of a game but they tossed it. Coulda squeezed a few more hours out of me but I guess not."

2789,Geronimo Crushwasher,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198841955939/,1,,0,159.2,April,"2,",36,0,1,"Being a long time fan of the Horizon series as a whole it's truly sad to see what this game has come to. I'm not necessarily saying that this game is worse than its predecessors, however there are many key elements that they had (ranked online racing) that are no longer present in this game. I think the biggest underlying problem with Forza Horizon 5 is that it is not at all a new title. Apart from a new map there is little to nothing to differentiate this game from the one that came before it; pretty much everything in it has been done some way before in a previous title. There's nothing wrong with sticking to a similar formula, that formula has created an incredibly successful franchise, however there is a problem with releasing a brand new Forza Horizon title with no new innovations or intent to innovate.I noticed this pretty early on when the game launched a few months ago, however ultimately ignored this giving playground the benefit of the doubt and to let the game get settled for a bit before major content updates. About a week ago I chose to return to the game to see what has changed, and to my surprise little to nothing was different. Many of the bugs that were present at launch still exist, not so much of the game breaking ones, but little errors in the textures of embarrassingly outdated car models are still plentiful. A couple story missions have been added which both myself and I believe the vast majority of the player base do not care for; there is nothing interesting in the re-hashing of boring and cheesy story missions like the last game with a cast of characters I cant even try to care about. Ultimately I could over look the previously mentioned things on top of the lack of new content, they weren't what compelled me to write this review. It was the ""new content"" that was being added that really gave me a feeling of Playground just phoning in the launch of their most recent title.Even when there was little to nothing to do in Horizon 4 I would still come back for the new and exiting cars added weekly in the festival playlist. This is also what I was planning on doing for this game, until realizing that at least 95% of the ""new"" cars being added for the entire month are recycled from Horizon 4's previous car list. For me, that alone just made one of the only reasons to actually get on and play this game pointless. If Playground wanted these cars in the game, then why weren't they present in the roster at launch? This re-releasing of old cars is just a way to artificially inflate the lifespan of this game without adding any actual new content. The same thing is true for the non-car addition in this update, the drift club, which is again a re-hashing of what already has been done in Horizon 4. It's things like this that really make me question why I should even bother to play this game, there are no worthwhile rewards to chase and everything skill based has been numbed to the point of nonexistence in the pursuit of broad appeal. Its sad to see a franchise that once pushed to boundaries of what we thought was possible for a Forza title to go down this road of mediocrity and lack of effort. If you don't give me a reason to invest time into a game then why should I? At many points in the lifespan of Horizon 4 I found myself getting bored with the state of the game and going back to play horizon 2 and Motorsport 4, which are two games I always have fun with despite having played over time and time again. With the release of this new game I hoped that the flaws of the previous game would have been dealt with, and we would have the best horizon title to date. Instead it looks like all we got was what should have been a dlc for horizon 4 with what little new it brought to the table. Unfortunately I think this is due to the fact that this game has little to no competition for its place in the market between NFS and The Crew 2; Playground have just gotten lazy with their cash cow. At this point all I hope for is that Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown is amazing, so that Playground will have to get off its ass and innovate again so stay relevant, as well as to have an actual worthwhile modern racing game in this segment to play."

However I was pleasantly surprised by the enjoyment this game brought me. Despite having to sign in with xbox account this game has truly given me a worthwhile experience.I have dislike all racing games I've played in the past but this game is special. It allows you to chill out and play and immerse yourself in the vast open world.While at first I was reluctant to purchase the game, my friends peer pressured me to buy it. After some months I did and wow, this game has been great from the start. I have developed a keen interest in cars as a whole from this game and it's many customisation possibilities has taught me a little engineering.I cannot wait to see what the game has to further offer me beyond my current time playing.In terms of system requirements. I have a pc with a 3090 and 5950X as well as a laptop with a 1650 and i5-9300H. The game runs at a solid 60fps at 1080p on my laptop with medium settings and 120+ maxed out on my pc. It is well optimised for sure, however the menu lags by an eighth of a second on my laptop.Playing online requires Microsoft Xbox app which sucks and I often cannot even join convoys, which sucks.Overall, I recommend this game for those who want to cruise around without worrying about not being good at driving games."

The maps have clunky UI elements (page down to filter, backspace to filter, what the...?), the game has a habit of crashing so much that you come to expect it at some point. Especially frustrating during a 3-race competition and you're in the last race. Tuning cars makes absolutely no sense.

What i mean by this is the game play and map are amazing, the visuals are Great and the overall fun factor and amount of content for the game is outstanding. With this being said the Musical choices, Understanding of Car Culture and certain aspects of the open world miss the mark entirely. The positives outweigh the negatives here by a large margin however the negatives are annoying enough to be spoken about first and foremostCON; #1 the soundtrack;though music is subjective i feel that the entire soundtrack in this game is literally the worst licensed soundtrack in a game possibly ever. its full of generic bass, screatcing, ""Goingingingnging"" and other obnoxious music made up entirely of compilations of sounds that should not be used to make the music of a car game. Gone are the days of the GOD teir soundtracks of old midnight clubs and Need For Speeds. and even worse it has no way to turn off all in game music :( CON; #2 Car People;I cant talk for the games accuracy with the Mexican Culture but i can for the car culture.... WRONG.... I would count myself as an intermediate car enthusiast, i work on my own car a bit, ive been to lots of car meets and one or two track days and this game does not at all in the slightest get any of the street racing or legal racing or enthusiast culture or lingo even close to correct. THIS IS FINE how ever in their attempts to reflect real car culture it comes across cringe. CON; #3 - The big oneFORZATHON LIVE NEEDS TO BE DELETED. it pops up infront of you out of nowhere and takes you out of gameplay and you cant opt out. it pops up literally on the most popular roads on the map and you cannot avoid it so you have to do different events. it pops up everywhere and if your car so much as skimms the bubble of it the game forces you to participate in the event and it is the worst aspect of this game by far. there is also other issues with the monthly events such as championships not allowing you to compete in single races that month if those are championship racesIf you can deal with the above issues i would highly recommend this game as it is one of the best arcade driving experiences youll have; Even at 99.95NZD this is an absolute must have even though itll make you deaf, cringe and pull your hair out."

Constant pop ups about stuff I don't care about. A broken A.I system and Online infrastructure that can't keep up with Halo 2 from 2004. Also why the hell is there digital rarity?? AE86's ARE GOING FOR 10,000,000 CREDITS in the auction house, and the absolute fact that I have to wait x amount of days just to unlock a certain car I really want to use is completely unfair for someone who can't play 24/7. Don't hate the game, just expect better after 10 years and 5 iterations of the same game."

This game is my first triple A on PC and it has been amazing. The graphics are stunning if you have a capable PC, even on medium and high. And Mexico is a beautiful location for the game. The physics are decent for an arcade racer and realistic enough for sim racers to have some fun as well. I use a PS4 controller to play the game. Luckily Steam supports this, however do note that the game itself will only recognize Xbox controller inputs, so you many see some differences. Luckily, the location of the buttons is the only thing that matters and you can memorize it in less than a hour. There seems to be enough replayability and the end game seems to be immense. I am only a few hours in and there are so many races to complete, i can keep driving for ages. TDU Solar Crown may have a harsh come up end of year of FH5 keeps active and the developers show up consistenly with decent car packs and potential DLC content. Good luck drivers and enjoy!"

Progression in this game is essentially non-existent... I've only played 7 hours and I have a 999X car and have placed first in every single race I've done. I know I can turn up the difficulty, but that just seems artificial... There's zero excitement associated with winning (Maybe because of the rewind component? I'm a fan of the concept, but it just makes the game too easy). Also agree on the ""Notification Overload"" point. There are like 75 different menus with 1000 different sub-menus, and it's not really clear what any of them do and/or if any of them are important. I'm not sure what I expected, but I used to love racing games. The whole open-world concept is cool, but it feels like they just dropped the ball on the progression component. Maybe I'm too old for these sorts of games."

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."
2989,Mister Snizz,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972258172/,1,,1,85.1,January,"28,",778,0,1,"Forza Horizon 4 and 5 are two of the most addicting, entertaining, and 'easy to pick up and play' games I've ever experienced. Apart from staggering through Gran Turismo and the like when I was 12 (because they were the only non-linear games that you could easily return to, even if you sucked at playing them and could never advance) I had barely ever played a racing game, and wasn't a racing fan before I came across Forza Horizon 4. It's gorgeous combination of 'easy to learn-hard to master' racing, beautiful visuals, well-realised fictional UK, entertaining activities, week-long 'seasons' in which the entire game world changes climate, and outstanding roster of fully-customisable cars kept me going for 100 straight hours over a period of about 2 weeks (a good effort for someone with ADHD). Forza Horizon 5 bit me the same way, and some small but impactful quality of life improvements to the online matchmaking and Forzathon group events meant that the entire game from beginning to end is incredible fun that is as difficult or accessible as you want it to be. FH5, however, does also feel like a meaningful step back in certain ways. Mexico is beautiful, but unlike the UK's starkly unique seasons of weather, 'hot', 'wet', 'storm', and 'dry' season have little meaningful differences. Entire races would change in their requirements of the driver in the UK's rainy spring and snowy winter, but in FH5 the differences amount to little more than 'there's occasionally some water where there wasn't before'. I spent the entire storm season chasing storms that would disappear before I could reach them just trying to see what they were like. In short, the gameworld barely changes. There's a distinct roughness in the visuals that FH4 lacks - pixelation, particularly of the foliage that is everywhere - is noticeable in a way that it wasn't in the older game. Bugs are pretty rife, from the game-breaking to the annoying lack of attention to detail, and while I didn't encounter anything that closed my progress down for good, it does leave the game feeling unpolished in a way its predecessor isn't. It's 4 months since release and no update is in sight. Lastly, and most importantly for me - the soundtrack is just...not good when compared to FH4. This is entirely subjective of course, but there are some bangers on the FH4 soundtrack that have made my permanent playlist: excellent songs whose pulsing rhythms and great, catchy melodies complimented the momentum of the game's systems and kept you feeling like your heart was pumping to the beat. I can point to maybe 1 or 2 songs out of the dozens in FH5 that spark any emotion in me, and so many are tedious, repetitive, annoying, lack a hook that makes them memorable, or simply just don't *drive* like so many in the previous games' soundtrack did. Egregiously, many of the tracks are simply less-interesting deep cuts from the same artists who contributed to the previous game. It feels like a soundtrack full of cheap b-sides. So I spend most of my time driving with the soundtrack off and a podcast on my phone. It's not the same. I find the game surprisingly hampered by the lack of quality in the music. All in all, yeah, it's a good game. The cars drive better, sound better, and the activities have been tweaked in functionality to be more fun and less time-wasting. But I don't prefer it to FH4, as it feels like it's a mildly inferior copy of its predecessor. It's not a generational step-forward - it's a replication of what worked with some minor positive tweaks, but its soul is missing. FH4 is more expensive than FH5 now though, despite being 3 years older, because the game is technically a 'live service', so the company is likely trying to incentivise people to move towards the new one because that's the way this sh*t works. You'll get your money's worth either way, but I'd recommend getting either of them on sale if you can."

I failed to fully enjoy this game to its potential.Yes its beautiful. The cars handle unique and believable and there is so much to do.So why the downvote?The presentation... maybe I'm just a boring adult who does not go with the new generation, but damn, it frustrates me so much that everything has to be so overhyped. Tucked away in TikTok dances, confetti, Fortnite style color coded cars you get by spinning reels wtf the whole game is designed for obvious maximum dopamine overdose. And it does not work for me. even after turning off all the constant messaging the likes of; AWESOME YOU AVOIDED CRASHING +100 into AWESOME YOU CRASHED +100 into AWESOME your back end slid into a cactus SMACKTUS! +100. Even with that turned off it just feels so wasted driving a gorgeous looking and sounding car with very believable handling only to finish with a plethora of fireworks in the end, DJ's playing the most mainstream soundtrack in front of the full LGBT crowd (no hate) and race drivers dancing in TikTok fashion and afterwards being phonecalled by some over caffeinated mexicanguy challenging me for some cliffjumping. Another example I get a japanese iconic oldtimer, but the game decided for me its a green common car. Cant you just leave the color coding alone, just get the specs out there and make people decide what its worth. With that common car I win some race which makes me spin 3 WHEELS AT THE SAME TIME congratulating me with a golden legendary or epic car which i just dont give a SH** about.If you've read this far and are willing to tolerate this kind of presentation here's some more in depth analysis.The map is gorgeous south american styled with amazonian humid jungle biome, dry desert biome, mountain biome with plenty of shortcutting (offroad) roads besides the main roads. There are some small villages you drive through within seconds and one place that has the size of a small town. The cars sound great and the sound scales with the amount of tuning you do. They all handle unique based on their power to weight ratio and drivetrain placement and overall build. Very believable the reason this game is not considered a sim is not because the cars aren't believable but more because road surfaces give you a very predictive feedback. Surfaces are predictable and generally feel the same. Normally missing a turn slightly with one wheel in the grass should drag you into the green hell but here it's very forgivable. Matter of fact grass grip feels like a 2nd rated tar-gravel surface rather than true wet slippery grass but thats okay I believe because it would otherwise be a bit too hardcore. Remembering every nook and cranny of the nurburgring is hard enough already for professional racedrivers so a complete multi biome region with hundreds of miles of roads would be a bit too hardcore (I wouldnt mind though).A great driving game should at its core have believable handling, many car options and a varied track selection. In this case an open world. It ticks off all these boxes but some form of progression should definitely be included as well. Progression here is basically a gotta catch em all mentality with the aforementioned presentation. I would have been fine with a linear start from the bottom now we Ferrari mentality. Coupled with some money grinding but now it's basically here's 2 Lambos a Corvette and a pair of pink socks when you haven't even properly introduced yourself yet.Cheers.GameBos"

THE ONLY GAME out of 250 games I have that forced me to redesign my rig to run a dual boot os just in order to play.  The game itself is just OK.  The unique old rare cars are nice, what you can do with them is nice, racing your friends ghost is nice, the rest not good.  The Auction would be nice if you bids were actually reliable, I get bid not accepted over and over again, then lose the auction because the bid wasn't accepted.  The racing, difficulty settings vs AI is terrible.  If you win too often, game asked you if you want to increase the difficulty, so I do.  All the difficulty for the AI seems too do is make the AI cars faster, and makes them slam into you, pushing you out of bounds of the checkpoints.  If you look behind you after you pass all the AI cars, they just line up single file behind you about a second back, and if you make a mistake, they fly by like a train in a row.  If you miss a checkpoint and the game resets you in 5 seconds, 1/2 the train of AI cars pass you while the other half slam into you when your ghost time expires.  I can live with all that, and I have for 93 hrs so far only because some of the game is rather enjoyable.  THE WORST part about the game is when you are trying to push a car to its limits racing a friends ghost time is the game has Festivals with blaring loud music that never shut up.  The festival music over powers everything else, its stupid annoying, distracting, you can't hear your car, you can't hear tires being stressed, its just horrid.  There is races that pass by what seems like 10-15+ different festivals blaring...  that pretty much ruins the very little good about this game that there is."

CARS.Graphics are way better, driving physics feel much better, the game is a little more HDD friendly than fh4 from what I saw from my friends (since I have the game on nvme)I do also have my complaints about the game, and oh boy there we go.- Night is way too shortMost of the car community would appreciate a way longer night or simply a slider for the convoy leader to change it for all convoy members. Who thought that was a good idea for the night to be 4 minutes? cmon you can do better.- Rain lasts shorter than my depressionRain is super satisfying to drift in. We all would appreciate having a slider for that or simply maybe a new game mode for only the convoy members when we can change the environment.- Photo mode lacks options:~ Option to change time~ Weather ~ Disable driver while driving- Game treats stock engines underpowered as heck.- There's a huge bias between carsEdit:nerfing wheelspins is going to cause new players to lose interest and since most of the player base is kids this will result in the game slowly losing players since kids have a short attention span.Maybe try focusing on the cheaters. Plus the recent update brings a lot of cheaters to the game again.. Online racing is useless at this point.And let's be honest, car pass is a joke and it just shows how greedy the devs areThis is going to be EA 2.0"

3062,InMind02,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198189226483/,1,,1,114.5,January,"13,",101,0,1,"--PROLOGUE--I Started the franchise with Horizon 3 back in 2017. I had to choose 3 since I didn't (and still don't) actually own a Xbox. I saw it as an amazing sandbox racer unfortunately plagued by major instability and same-y type event customization. And to be honest, going into this installment I had expected to find more of the same.I couldn't have been more wrong.--PROS--The representation of Mexico for this game is, to put simply, fantastic. Lush jungles and beautiful coastlines in the south, with rugged forests and mountains up north, Filled in with deserts and plains in the middle, not to mention one of the best urban areas in any Horizon game to date.The base lineup of cars this time around is excellent in terms of both variety and performance, comprising of everyday sedans and classic muscle cars to racing trucks and Warthogs, even full-on Formula Drift cars, with the best hypercars reserved for the wealthiest and best of drivers. Each vehicle you choose can be customized extensively for performance and looks.I'm also glad to see character customization continues to expand in new and unique ways. Do wish more hairstyles and racesuits would be added though (Stig suit when).Online multiplayer no longer requires Xbox Live on the Steam version, meaning all the best Horizon races are available to play free from day one, as well as custom gamemodes such as Survivor, Flag Rush, Eliminator, and more. Online also allows access to thousands of custom blueprints and races, which in some cases completely transform the enviroment into a different place entirely. You can also build your own blueprints and race events as well.There also seems to be very few bugs and no crashes, a vast improvement compared to FH3.--CONS--It is EXPENSIVE to even get into the game, getting to $45 - $50 on sale at BEST, even during the giant Winter Sale, which is when I purchased it.The AI does seem unstable at times, with difficulty increases suddenly finding your majorly upgraded vehicle left behind by miles. I personally recommend starting at Highly Skilled to counter this, only moving up to Expert if you feel comfortable or when prompted.Personally, my only big complaint is that having certain cars locked to online events and challenges does create problems when trying for a complete collection, especially when these events are time limited.I also have concerns that lower end computers may struggle to run this at a decent framerate, but can be remedied by lowering graphics settings appropriately.--SUMMARY--There's simply no other arcade racer out there that competes with the level of detail and control that Forza Horizon 5 provides. With it's extensive personalization and vehicle lineup, not to mention a massive open world rivaling those of the best RPGs, this game definitely wins top trumps for pure size and ambition. It's a wonderful achievement that will surely go down as one the best racing games ever created.It might even be there already."

The issue with FH5's solo play is that in the end of the day it is still a Horizon game where once you have done every race and own every car there isn't a great deal of content left. Sure there is the weekly festival events where you will do races and PR stunts to get wheelspins and cars, but in the end it starts to feel repetitive. The real fun in FH5 in my opinion is when it is played with friends, preferably in a voice call, where as a group you can just ignore any 'challenges' set by Playground Games and begin to set your own challenges. In one instance me and a group of 3 others set out to ourselves to use certain car types within a certain performance index while leaving the cars stock and then perform challenges such as a sound test to see who's car sounds the best followed by events such as a hill climb sprint, drag race, top speed test and then finished with a breaking test to see whose car would score highest. There was no prize, only entertainment value for having fun in different cars as a group. In the end I would recommend this game, as for the first 50-100 hours the game can be played solo with a plentiful amount of content to entertain yourself quite fruitfully. However if you wish to play this game for the long term, I would only recommend it to those who have a friendship group that also play."

Compared to Forza Horizon 4 it does have great additions to the game, the sound improved massively, but some features I'd wish are still missing. (f.ex. duplicated vehicles filter). The map is big, and very well made, but in terms of cars it feels like it's just a copy & paste of the the FH4 car park. New cars are still missing in this game, there are no new BMW models. Alfa Romeo got removed completely! Forza Horizon 5 doesn't feel like it deserves the 5. It feels like a Forza Horizon 4.5 Although I'm quite happy with the game in overall, I can't recommend it right now.There are still so many bugs, even after two months of the release.

Very good attention to detail. The different regions of the map feel distinct and fun to drive through-Beautiful near-photorealistic visuals-The driving feels excellent on an Xbox controller-The sound design of the cars is very authentic and punchy-Generally all-around fun gameplay-An insane amount of cars (over 500)-Tons of ways to fine tune the difficultyCons:-Customisation of cars (mechanical, not cosmetic) feels almost pointless. All the upgrades are ridiculously cheap and have minimal effect on your cars performance. It would be cool if you could mod your cars more than just adding an interior roll cage that you can't see, or wider tires that you can't notice-The AI doesn't play by the same rules as you, and ""cheats"" in certain ways. For example, if you turn on ""tire wear and damage"" simulation, during some of the longer races your tires will wear out and you'll be slowed down as you barely keep control of your worn-out tires. The AI, however, will not be slowed at all, and will leave you in their dust with nothing you can do about it. It's hardly a difficulty option if it guarantees that you cannot win any of the longer races. As a result, I'm forced to turn off that option for any of the longer races.-The weekly and seasonal events, their points system, and their challenges are absolutely horribly explained. It took a lot of looking around and figuring out before I learned how any of the weekly or special events worked. That whole interface needs a significant tweak, and generally a bunch of the UI is a bit shoddy due to this being a console game.Overall, however, I do recommend this game. It's a lot of mindless fun to race around the Mexican countryside and streets, and I've been enjoying it so far."

They said they updated a few car models but they are the same, even the ones that weren't good (Nissan Skyline R32, Silvia etc..), the handling has been updated, but still doesn't handle great, even for an arcade. They said they improved wheel support but the game is still not that enjoyable on a wheel as it isn't much better. Everything else about this game is just the same as FH4 but on a new map, with a new story. And don't even get me started with online! Most people buy this game to play online with friends in a convoy and race together and cruise together. However, it simply does not work, you invite friends to a convoy and it says they are in your convoy but they never connect to your session. You can do a race together sometimes as it loads you both into a race but then afterwards you won't be able to join each others online session again. This has been going on for over 2 months now and through several updates, nothing has been fixed. The online in this game is an absolute joke and it takes away a huge aspect of what makes this game fun, playing with friends. Overall, very disappointing game and I hope they fix at least the online issues and bugs soon."

I’d say the game’s best quality is: it just works. After it’s set up properly.I would have returned the game for a refund if the wheel or pedals did not work. My Logitech Momo wheel (May 2007) has been in a closet for over a decade (was there a super sale in 2007?) and this is easily the most (only?) fun I’ve had with it. I don’t recall the exact hold-up back in 2007, except that I got all worried while running a madly vibrating force feedback wheel on a desk with several spinning hard-drives. I meant to get my computer onto a cabinet beside my desk, but never did. I have to do all the following to get my wheel and Horizon 5 to work:Spend about 10 minutes physically clearing stuff away and setting up the wheelClean boot into my Microsoft account associated with my XBox account that is now associated with my Steam accountStart my Logitech profiler software (set to a persistent profile)Plug in a PC (XBox-style)  game controller (controller might be needed for the game to boot at all)Start XBox (MS XBox for PC) automatically signs me into my XBox account (or the game will not boot)Start SteamStart Forza Horizon 5Set aside 10 minutes to remove the wheel and restore my deskApparently, the original release of Horizon 5 was slightly different from the MS Game Store than on Steam’s store, and the MOMO wheel is still listed online as being incompatible with the Steam version of the game. It’s worked fine for me. If you want more assurance of continuing compatibility, buy directly from MS? (I am not that worried because I recently learned there now exist 3rd party utilities to allow most common racing wheels to mimic game controllers…but I’m hoping I never need to find and figure them out.)I haven’t re-checked earlier versions, but in Forza 5 there are many sliders to fine-tune the driving settings; I suspect I could get the wheel to exactly mimic the wheel shown for the internal driver’s view, but I never got around to fine tuning the adjustments that closely, because I rarely use the driver’s view.I just like driving down the roads in Forza. Using the wheel, I can drive quite fast without going off the roadway, although the game is kind of boring if I drive so slowly that I’m able to confidently stay in my lane. I can slow a bit, drive one-handed, and take a sip from a drink. Can’t do that with a controller. If I set the difficulty to the lowest setting, I can win every race too (unless I wipe out on in the last quarter mile…and there’s always the rewind function if one really needs to win all the time.) Mostly I just like to drive around.Horizon 5 is better than Horizon 4 in that there’s no recurrent winter season that one has to deal with. As well, Horizon 5’s graphics are probably better than version 3 or 4…but not there’s not enough improvement to stand out against my year-old memories of the earlier games.I’m still nowhere near as good with a wheel as I was with a joystick playing back in 1998-99 with games like Need for Speed III: Hot Pursuit and Need For Speed: High Stakes. But I think that eventually I’ll get there.Last year, I got pissed off while trying to play Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands. Driving the  Wildlands vehicles or controlling the drones with the WASD keys was very frustrating so I decided to learn how to use a controller by practicing Forza Horizon 3 and 4. I put in about 40 hours and never learned to use the controller very well. I could sort of get there…win some races. But the controller never felt relaxed and natural. This year, when I tried the controller again, I was always very tense. I don’t think I’ll ever put in the hours to become comfortable with controllers.New racing wheels are over-priced right now. And any wheel’s setup, at least temporarily, takes over a desk. This driving game is fun, but it’s a pain to set up."

Once that is fixed I plan to update this review.Update: a lot of the game play bugs have been fixed and convoys.. function. We have to use different methods to join each other (I have to use Xbox game bar and he has to cycle horizon live and wait for it to suggest joining my convoy) We can play together and the game is fun but neither of us can simply use the in game join a convoy option still."

Loading screen to race also can take up to 4 minutes. Are you patient enough to wait 30 minutes for race ? Well that's what you can expect. Game offline is really good there is many things to do.

This game appeals to the mainstream and to car fanatics. I claim to be neither.The day it came out, I bought it because I said I'd buy a Forza game when the next one comes out. I played the intro, and the game looks great. Stunning. Took a couple screenshots, albeit in the definite obvious screenshot sections of the intro level. Then I put the game down and didn't touch it for a month.Normally for these good-looking-but-I-don't-see-the-point games, I use them as a benchmark. That's the reason I picked it up again; I was testing steam's remote streaming by driving around in free roam. The game controls very well, but the missions that the game forces you into aren't fun. Horizon arcade is terrible, that multiplayer crab game esque minigames are an interesting concept, but are a chore to do in actuality, and the story missions range from fun races to terrible objective checklists. I only found the value the game held by doing boring standard races.My friends always said that need for speed was the terrible game because it had arcadey driving mechanics. That implies that this game has the more realistic driving. So instead of playing it like an arcadey racer (Need for speed's bonus missions were probably the best missions in the whole game. They made taking down cars fun, and that's something this game doesn't have) I just started playing it as a racing simulator. Boring standard races are boring, but there's nothing like the spice of challenge to make a boring game fun. Turing up the difficulty makes you stay competitive (against bots, yeah, but need for speed is mostly against bots too) and turns on that speed running part of my brain.This game does have realistic driving, even more than asseto corsa. The cars will drift realistically, even at the speeds they would do in real life. Rear wheel drive cars will spin out easier. Drifting isn't always the best option because you lose force through traction, but you can do the crazy strats that asseto corsa lets you do, like turning your car completely sideways to slow down on a big turn. You can also drift to make the back of your car stick out so it hits a checkpoint. With street racing cars, they can't accelerate on the ground as fast, so you start to make strats like staying on the road for longer to build up speed. If one side of your car is on road and the other is on dirt, it'll make your car turn due to the difference in traction. It's basically like dirt rally but if it was an open world game and had less restrictive maps, and less of a rally sim.To play this game, you have to fundamentally change how you think. In need for speed, if you had a good enough car, you can take wicked turns at just about any speed you wanted, provided you were skilled enough to take them. In garfield kart, if you hit a wall with a boost, it could even be beneficial. In this game, they put penalties on these things. If you hit a wall, it'll slow you down, or even stop you dead. If you hit obstacles like poles and trees, you can break them, but they will slow you down. There are some turns that you just can't take at 100mph, or even 60, and that is what required me to change my thinking. What let me win in garfield kart was my primative ""press gas go fast"" thinking, which worked a lot better than other strategies people had. I never understood why people would brake when they could just drift. In this game, there is certain turns where it's just plain better to to a standard boring brake before a turn. Tough you can avoid going too fast for the turn by putting your car into a sideways drift like I mentioned before, it doesn't slow you down as fast as the breaks, and when you come out of it you need to regain traction for a second before you can accelerate again.Forza isn't a battle royale Dominic Toretto one direction fan fic simulator, it's a standard racing game with racing sim controls and real life cars. It's just fun, and by trying to do more than that, it distracts from the solid core gameplay it has.7/10 Free roam multiplayer is broken"
3150,Brick n Wall,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009936860/,1,,1,887.3,January,"1,",355,0,1,"Just a gorgeous game. The overall experience is a great one with significant graphical and sound improvements over the previous installment. I'm frankly not sure if those that can't see the differences between FH4 and FH5 are just on older hardware and can't crank up the settings, or if there are some emotional blinders at work, but the textures, lighting and shadows are all significantly improved.The cars handle more toward the arcade than sim, but there are still some decent physics at work..... for players that is. More on the AI under cons.Tuning options are comprehensive for an arcade racer, with engine tunes changing the pitch and tones coming from your engine, You can even preview the engine notes from your garage. You'll have to keep an eye on your performance index as you tune for pvp and for certain challenges, but otherwise the AI will scale to your performance index.... sort of. More on this under cons.The livery customization is very fun. I have spent over a hundred hours playing with shapes to create my own liveries and share them with other racers and this is one of the best features of the game in my opinion. It's a great change of pace to go from competitive race mode to chill creative mode within the same game. It really makes this a game that can suit any mood for me.Now that I have showered this thing with praise, let me touch upon the warts that blemish an otherwise very good experience.1. The AI. It's completely immune to track physics to an immersion breaking degree. You can be racing in an off road event in an 1800 lb. vehicle designed for it and get blown past by an AI driver seemingly moving on rails through a hairpin in a 4000 lb. touring car while you slide like you are driving on actual dirt. This makes for some highly unpredictable difficulty levels in races dependent upon how much the in game physics model is going to effect YOU. It will NEVER affect the AI, so the greater the impact on your car, the higher the difficulty. This has NOTHING to do with selected difficulty level. That becomes almost irrelevant at expert difficulty and beyond. The AI also drives in ways that would get any player banned from any racing sim server. This is very bad because it teaches new players to drive in ways that are not acceptable in multiplayer matches, and in fact in ways that would be ban-able. This should be fixed.2. The match making in single player is laughable, with similar Performance Index scores producing wildly different results, and matches freely formed between different drive-trains and weight classes. Matchmaking would result in a much more consistent challenge level if FWD always raced against FWD and cars were matched to within 100 lbs. Aside from ""open"" class events I feel this is an area that could stand to be improved.  3. The Arcade blimp.... for the love of all that is pure and good, please, please, PLEASE allow me to turn it off. There are few things more annoying that getting auto enlisted in an event I don't want to take part in just because my last event dumped me parked under that infernal blimp.4. Hackers are killing the fun of the global records boards. Don't take me the wrong way. I am no Mario Andretti. I have no illusions as to being some elite sweaty sim racer. I don't own a wheel or foot pedals. Just a standard Xbox controller and the patience to compete in an event until I nail it at least once. But I still wonder when i complete a jump I am particularly happy with, how that might compare to the best out there. When I see my jump of 1200 ft and think ""yeah that went well"" and then look at the leader board and see distances of 30,000 ft.... yeah that kills the experience. I would love to see Playground Games find a way to curb this sort of thing as it is rampant.So aside from those blemishes, this game completely rocks. It's a blast, and you should come join the fun if you haven't already."

If you are not great at driving simulators, but just want to tinker with cars, discover a massive and beautiful map and race against AI's that are around your level (Although the AI's can be really weird at times in their race craft), this is the game for you. I originally bought this game to do races with my friend, but quickly realized, the fun thing about Forza Horizon 5 is just to drive around the map with whatever car you want and just switch off, which makes the replay ability of this game pretty high and is definitely worth the full price. Just keep in mind, this is an arcade game, and the racing should be considered serious by any means (even if you are extremely good and need Unbeatable AI's to race against)."

I switched to PC a bit ago but just never got a controller for racing game's, that is until now.For some reason the release of Forza Horizon 5 sparked my interest so I got a controller and bought the game. Since buying it I have not gone a full day without playing it at least once. While games like this aren't played for their story, Forza 5 in my opinion did a good job of trying to make the player feel a bit more involved by having your in game character actually talk and interact with others. While its not a focal point of any racing orientated game, I think it should be recognized and appreciated.Now, down to the game itself.... IT IS SO DAMN GOOD!!!First of all, the amount of effort that went into making the game look and sound as good as it does it just remarkable. I am so happy that it was not only nominated for multiple categories in the Game Awards but indeed won best audio design, innovation in accessibility, AND best sports/racing game. In general I feel like at these big award shows racing and sports game's kind of get swept under by bigger releases and story driven games but I am so happy to see them succeed this year! The game runs so smoothly on my PC and while there have been issues with online connectivity and online racing, I have seen nothing but progress since it was addressed to the developers. The wide range of cars, trucks, buggies, SUVs, hatchbacks, and many other models to choose from and customize is endless. Making money also is not a hair pulling ordeal so you are always able to make new cars and get creative. The customization is quite in depth, but I do think there are some things that would be nice if added, and I honestly think that slowly stuff will be added. While it may be added via DLC I do not know but nonetheless it will be cool to see what they do.And finally, the feeling of driving in this game tops any I have experienced before. The added tire smoke, the sounds of the different engines that you can swap, the turbo spools and whistles, they are all done just so well. Normally when I would play Forza game's I would always just max out the power in any car, but with this release I find myself building different cars for different purposes. Some cars I max out and just try to make it as fast as possible, but others I lessen the power and make a fun little cruising car for the beautiful cities located throughout this GIANT map. And of course I cant forget to mention drifting and how amazing that feels on controller. I can only imagine how great it must be with a wheel setup, and like I mentioned before, the added tire smoke is so satisfying when drifting. The possibilities are literally endless and I cant help but always make a new car every time I open the game up.I highly recommend this game to anyone that is either debating it or looking for a open world racing/driving game because Forza Horizon 5 knocks it right out of the park!!"

""How did they not think that people would just want to make their own custom tracks?"" ""Why are there so few options and objects given to the player?""Clearly the developers didn't make this feature for this purpose, They meant for the player to sprinkle objects within the open world and be creative that way. But damn, they really missed a huge opportunity here. And it's so dumb because this issue could be mostly fixed if they just had more objects to choose from that supported the idea of creating a race track from scratch: more types of ramps, actual flat pieces of tarmac / dirt road / wet tarmac, and more ways of manipulating and morphing the objects, and added the ability to set the starting point and decide if you wanted to make a point-to-point or a multi-lap circuit race. But what's here just isn't cutting it. Frankly, in it's current state, it's pretty freaking lame.What they should have done is made a separate mode that focused on creating tracks, and having custom games where you can invite your friends and race them on your custom track, then race other people on other custom tracks that other people made, basically the forza version of Halo's forge mode, And yes, that is technically possible in some small capacity in this game, And I'm amazed at the stuff people have made in this game already from what I've seen on youtube, and at the fact that anyone even bothers with this feature at all considering how much effort and time and BS it takes just to make a simple track inside the coliseum. The lack of features and overall jankiness in the blueprint builder mode really highlights the developer's lack of understanding of what people would want out of a creative mode like this. To me, thinking that people want a more dedicated mode to just track-building like what I described earlier seems so obvious, and yet, we didn't really get that.We basically got the creative mode from Trials, that motorcycle game, inside of forza. But that level of depth in a creative mode isn't sufficient here because forza's gameplay is in 3D, and the tools we got only allow us to effectively work in 2 dimensions, while leaving the 3rd dimension basically impossible to make good use of. They didn't give the player enough tools to allow for effectively and efficiently creating an interesting play space for cars with any subtle characteristics of verticality from scratch, disconnected from the game's open world, when it relates to creating a track with banked corners, uphill and downhill sections, elevation changes, and subtle bumps in the track, which are key components to creating an interesting race track. Overall, I think the devs seriously missed out on creating an absolutely killer feature that would have blown everything else out of the water, because while yes, beamNG, trackmania and asseto corsa exist, and you can make your own tracks in those games, In my opinion they lack the foundation of a good driving game with a lot of licensed cars that has the best of both worlds: that being fun and refined driving gameplay with your favorite licensed cars, combined with a mode to create your own tracks from scratch, which could provide hours upon hours of fun. Asseto has much less of a problem making this possible in theory, but creating tracks for asseto and beamNG isn't exactly a go-to-creative-mode-and-make-a-new-track-all-without-putting-the-controller-down-type of experience that forza could have possibly nailed with the advantage of having a big list of licensed cars, unlike beamNG and trackmania.Aside from this majorly disappointing feature, there is actually a good bit to like here.Cars seem to have had their audio overhauled, and it's great.Cars shifting gears sounds better in this game than previous entries. Cars shift more like how a real person would shift a car; this subtle audio update makes a bigger difference than you might expect when it comes to moment-to-moment gameplay.Engine sounds are also good.Cars have very detailed interior views as always.Driving physics are good, it's what you would expect from the forza horizon games. Nothing crazy here.World design is also good, apart from the sandstorms which I absolutely hated and wondered why these are in the game at all. They do absolutely nothing to make the game more enjoyable, they just made me think of Need for Speed Most Wanted '05's yellow piss filter x1000. The game has a really good selection of settings to fine tune the game including advanced settings for controllers (Deadzone calibration, custom mappings, etc.), detailed graphics settings, good selection of audio volumes, Field of view sliders, among other things.Performance was pretty good on my PC equipped with a Ryzen 5 3600 and a GTX 1660 super. Over 100 fps almost all of the time on the high preset at 1080p. I did notice stuttering occasionally, but nothing to get upset about though.Now for what was NOT good.1. This game takes WAY too long to get all the way opened up to the point where you can go into the event lab mode where everyone seems to be at in this game. I legit took me about 2 hours just to bee-line it to unlocking the casa bella so I could get into the event lab mode, the whole time being utterly bored because this tutorial section feels so samey to previous entries.2. In typical forza fashion in recent entries, this game has no restraint on just rewarding you cars and throwing large amounts of money at you left and right with no effort put in to get these rewards.I'm not necessarily against this, but it's off-putting to be getting mixed signals where I'm restricted on what modes I can play because I need to progress the 'story', but the game is just giving me super fast cars and lots of money right from the beginning and all the whole way through that 2-hour process of completing the tutorial section.3. I encountered some audio-related issues, one being that even when muting all the audio channels related to voices / talking, I would still hear people talking (and ANNA specifically, which I have always hated in every entry so I wanted to make sure I didn't have hear her annoying ass). This really got on my nerves because I knew from the get-go that this game has obnoxiously G-rated dialogue and I just wanted to avoid as much of that as possible.Another more concerning audio issue I ran into was crackling audio and engine sounds having this up-and-down whooshing effect laid on top of them. The fix is to set your speaker's sample rate to 24 bit, 96,000hz.4. Custom bindings for gamepads seems to be broken. If I try to make a custom mapping profile, the game expects you to bind a button to the ""Map"" function, but there isn't actually a way to map this function to button that makes sense, or at all, considering that the default mappings don't even map this Map function to the controller in the first place. This is a really dumb thing and needs to be fixed asap.5. This game really doesn't seem any different than the last 3 games, I feel like I'm playing the same game over and over again. The most this game's got going for it is the graphics and sound, and the event lab mode, which, metaphorically, are all tiddies that will inevitably sag in due time. I feel like this game is better at being a tech demo than being a genuine fun game to play.Is this game fun to play? Yes. Was every other forza horizon game fun to play? Yes. Is this game any more fun to play than the previous entries? Yes, but only by a bit. Is this game worth paying sixty dollars to play? I say, not quite."

With a massive open world map and no need to complete quest objectives to unlock cars, I've found myself just driving around and tuning cars to make them EXACTLY what I want.  Was on the fence if I'd enjoy it and I'm happy to say I find myself coming back and playing it daily because I get to drive around and do silly things like jump cliffs at 200 MPH and not get penalized for it.  This game scratches the itch of going on a long drive without having to spend money on gas to go on one.  Don't want to drive fast because you'd rather do some off-roading or drifting? You can.Don't want to stay on the roads to get to the destination you set on the map? You don't have to."

You wanna collect cars? Go for it! Over time (not that long) the server will send you a notification to go on a treasure hunt for Old Barn Finds, where you have a mechanic thatll repair the old find in to like new.Sure, theres other ways to get vehicles, but who cares about NPC races when you have a huge open world to practice on?OH! You DO care about NPC races and vehicles you unlock from them? Thats perfect then! Every town offers tons of races with new ones popping up daily, from Pre-loaded courses, to player created. The possibilities are near endless. The tuning of vehicles in this game is extraordinary, to say the least. You want your jeep to float like a boat when hitting tight corners? Go for it! You want your VW Bug to have a v10 Diesel, because **** you and your supercar? Go for it! You can fine tune every aspect of your ride to make it feel and react just as you want. You want to make a Shelby drift like a Dom Torreto? Go for it! Oh wait, you dont know how... right.. WELL YOURE IN LUCK! THERES TONS OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS! NOW!!!!... For the bad.... If you wanna drive insanely fast with amazing graphics.. you better hope you have a beefy system and harddrive. Otherwise, just chill, enjoy the tight corners this game has to offer, and just forget about life for awhile. Would i return this game even though i accidentally put 32hours in to it in the last 12 hours? Na... its too good of a game.

On Day 1 of this early play, I could not get into Convoys with my friends to race around the map, nor did Multiplayer want to work properly. When a major part of the game is driving with your friends, this is unacceptable and should not be advertised as a finished product.Microsoft did not state that this was a Beta when it was quite clear that the game was not finished.

Random disconnects and having trouble connecting are far more common than uncommon. We aren't even in different countries so it makes no sense. The custom race builder is a good idea but it was executed very poorly. At least add an option to use pre-existing courses and switch the start and finish lines. I haven't even mentioned the worst part which for me was random crashes. I can't even play this game for more than 1 hour at a time because the game randomly crashes.

I wish I had that experience, racing with friends, exploring the map and collecting hidden cars sounds fun. Problem 1:Staying in a ""convoy"" or party for more than a single race is near impossible and if you want to mess around with your fiends while waiting for your other friend to accept the convoy invite, then good luck. 50% of the time your convoy is phased and wont be able to see you. Want to see your friends new car? Nope. Want to stay in a party for longer than five minutes? Nope. Want to explore the world by driving as fast as you can in a straight line? Nope.This game has a harder time loading the map than GTA Vice City did in 2002.While the game strives itself on ""realism"" the playful version of Horizon should be more playful. I get the impression that I'm being punished for wanting to drive unrealistically in this game that started off with dropping million dollar cars out of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ plane. ""Want to make this sharp turn by drifting around the corner? Don't you dare touch that e-brake. Don't you even get that finger near that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ button. In fact, you were holding down the brake long enough that I think I'll pretend you hit that e-brake and toss your ass into the bushes."" And good luck getting back onto the road. As punishment you are going to be doing involuntary donuts of defeat for the next 30 seconds. This seems like the type of game for someone that only owns a steering wheel controller or people that have completely played all of the Xbox gamepass already."

I know many people is able to play it online, but after months of trying , nothing working, but mostly, Microsoft support not being able to help telling me ""this issue is being worked on"" and closing the support ticket has weared me out. I played in the last two years at least half a dozen co op games with friends with no problems, Forza is the only one that is not working for some specific reason which i can not decipher (and i shouldn't) .For many games this wouldn't be that much of an issue, but since Forza has a strong online component which is constantly updating, with several seasons and series across all year, it is very noticeable (even if i'm able to play all offline content)The main game is still good, but after that all that remains is the constant online update which are a constant and periodic reminder of what i can not play.I'm writing this on ocassion on the release of the first expansion which comes 10 months after the game release (and there's still one more to go, who knows when) which in all honestly, at this point since i stopped playing the base game like half a year ago is half new content and half a reminder of all the frustration i had not being able to play any multiplayer co op content.At this point i'm more inclined to go back to Rider's Republic another sports game (on bikes, skying and flying) which, regardless of all the cheap comercial horrific tactics i was STILL able to ALWAYS play online with other players and ENJOY IT and have fun. And this is saying something coming from an ubisoft game...  This is the original review:I've just finished moments ago one of the big final races in the game, and this is as good moment as it will ever be to make a note about it.The race is called ""The Colossus""and it's a road racing type of race (classic race, classic roads, inside and outside towns). This was the final road racing track which runs across the entirity of the map, spans 55 kilometers long, goes through most of the game landmarks and it took me, with a super fast car, the mercedes amg one (the cover car) 17 minutes  to finish, without pauses or loading screens, just 17 minutes of non stop racing. This game is probably one of the best racing game experiences i had in recent years. It looks great, it does have many controls and adjustments you can do to your car, but  at the same time it can be just as simple as you want (or something in between) it plays as an arcade racing game, and more importantly it does have several difficulty adjustment settings to make it accesible or as complex as other more serious games. But this game is just fun. It reminds me everytime i play it about going as a kid (many years ago) to the arcades and doing a race or two with friends or alone. You can play this game just like that, doing a 5 minute race and be gone or spend many hours. The game has road racing, closed circuit, dirt racing (off road rally style) cross country racing, and street racing too.  It has even rally cars, 4x4 jeeps, some trucks, lots of old cars. So far 500 cars of many kinds.The multiplayer on the other hand actually doesn't work, at least for me, which sucks, like it's been a month and im still not able to connect to the x box network at all, nor do any online content, but you can play offline and do all single player content."

Despite other peoples problems in the review section, I haven't had any sort of game ruining moments. Yes, the multiplayer is spotty, but I can live with that. The amount of fun I've had in this game is what makes it the best. Details on the cars, the sense of speed, flying off a cliff with a rally car, building the fastest car in the game is what this game was created for. Yes, there are more realistic simulators out there, but this game doesn't focus too much on making it like that. I think the Mexico map is perfect, with lots of diverse landscapes and picturesque moments. 10/10. Price was a bit high at first, but when you think about it, this game is a steal.

Do you like racing people, whether they be friend or stranger? Do you like to win? Do you like the feeling of being the fastest in the land?If your answer was yes to any of these questions I can highly recommend this game to you.The game has insane visuals, I'd personally say a solid 9/10/. The detail put into the cars and map are extraordinary. The map is incredible, ranging from soft white beaches to a literal volcano. The voice acting is very good, not amazing, but then again this is a racing game. My only real complaint is in cut scenes the body and mouth movement is awkward to say the least. But as I've said before, this is a racing game, you're not hear to be immersed in an amazing story and acting, you're hear to drive like there is no tomorrow.The other complaints I have are minor, pausing the game and stopping your car each time you are able to unlock a new festival site, a strange visual glitch on one side of the volcano (might be just me but the terrain flashes from black and white to full colour again), the bugs you'll encounter along the way (though most of them are rather hilarious and have laughed me through some tough races) and the strange difficulty scaling (on higher difficulties the top 2 or 3 cars rubber band away from you making it next to impossible for you to catch up).I implore you to purchase this game if you have the money, and I hope to see you in my next race! Happy racing (or drifting, whatever your style is ;) )"

Convoy I think is probably the worst feature in this game which sucks because that's what I use the most to play the game. I know the issues are known it's just so sad that a triple A game studio would release a product that is not polished. Especially when past tittles didn't have these problems. That is my big gripe with the game. There are so many big bugs that are game breaking (falling through map, crashes, etc) that should not be in the game at launch. The amount of small bugs is killer too. These should not be issues for a game series like this.  Its a super good game. A little worse than 4 not looking at the bugs and glitches. But am more than happy to play it. Maybe after a year when more content drops and less glitches."

The controls are responsive and can be punishingly realistic. The delicate balance of accelerating, traction, top speed, your ability to turn or slide mixed with the difference in your two brakes intertwine to create a very responsive and skilled driving experience. The responsive controls become even more pronounced by realistic tuning. Too much Torque, on a car with too little weight and too low traction? It will actually start sliding on straight-a-ways. Like to power slide vs tight turning? Ive tuned and raced cars on and off for 20 years and this game manages to really simulate the experience of driving sports cars, rally, offroad, and street racing better than any title I played before while still incorporating an arcade like feel complete with scoring systems, seasonal games, arcade versions of play and 'wheelspin' giveaways.The games DLCs seem like pay to win. You can read plenty of comments on the DLCs about whether or not customers felt they got their perceived value. The game also has several bugs. Its an Xbox game that constantly wants to talk to its other server and as a result may disconnect you briefly. Its also difficult to find ""Clubs"" or friends because its all done through an Xbox companion app that launches in a second window."

If you've played any horizon game, especially 3 or 4 - you kind of know what you're in for on this one.However this rec comes with the following warning: The multiplayer is broken as hell and straight up does not work at the moment. They are working on it but the game has been out for almost a month and it's still a problem. I've played 95% of my time in singleplayer, 4% of it trying to play multiplayer with a friend, and 1% of it actually playing multiplayer.That being said these are great singleplayer games. They're really casual - can get quite difficult if you crank the settings up - good accessibility settings - and an absolute BOATLOAD of things to do in the world. Amazing amounts of cars, races, events, stunts, weekly challenges etc.One of my favourite things about this game too is, during regular singleplayer, you almost never are limited on what kind of car you want to drive. You want to take your Lamborghini on a rally race? Go ahead! So much room for experimentation.Great game. I've never really played multiplayer and I love this series. Looking forward to the DLC!"

The map really is huge and amazing. Some of the features brought in the FH4 DLCs were brought into the main game here -  namely the lego stud challenges are renamed here. The game has you pick which types of races you want to unlock first as you progress. When you first unlock a new type you have to do a little scripted exploration mission which honestly so far has been fun. The main character is voiced now if you're into that.If you haven't played Forza Horizon 4 first of I'd say get that one if you can get it for cheap. This game isn't superior enough to warrant spending full price over. Forza Horizon 4 is an excellent game and having been out for some time now it will likely go on sale, before eventually they have to pull it from digital shelves due to licenses expiring similar to previous Forza games. The DLC of FH4 is also worth it - two new maps and all the challenges that come with it, plus you obtain way more cars and credits than you know what to do with. Forza Horizon 5 is all of that plus more, but its not more enough to justify purchasing if the pricing is different (future sales)."

Want to farm CR by having your car auto-drive for you? If you answered 'yes' to any of the above, then this is a racing game for you. Quite simply it's fun, want a more arcade experience you can do that. Want more of a simulation? You can do that too. Whether you're on controller or steering wheel the game feels great, I can't speak to KB and mouse because that sounds awful. If you're on the fence about it but you know you enjoy racing style games, get it.If you have friends that actively play, definitely get it. As close to a modern NFS Underground 2 as we currently have."

Its version of Mexico brings so much variety to your, ahem, need for speed. Car controls strike a magnificent balance of arcade and sim (plus you can do impressive degrees of tuning and design), and the car sounds are SUPERB. Terrains ranging from sandy deserts to heavy forests and swamps to volcanic regions. You thought hypercars and classic racers cannot be used for dirt tracks? WRONG. You are allowed to do (almost) anything, while being rewarded for doing (almost) everything. Might be overwhelming for new players who had no experience with its predecessor(s) though. With a game of this scale, do expect troubles with online play. And try not to use offensive liveries. All in all, a massive joy of a game and a definite improvement from Horizon 4. HELL YEAH"

But as of 11/29/2021 you're better off buying Forza Horizon 4 on sale for 65% off.EDIT: a week later and the game has been updated with major bugfixes. Dozens of accolades fixed and many issues with online functionality (especially convoys) has been fixed. Still a lot of small issues on their bug list, but have not come across anything game breaking. Devs are putting out major patches every couple weeks, so the amount of bugs will almost certainly decrease over time (maybe probably).The servers for online racing are still very slow, but I have not had any recent problems with disconnecting.Servers are about the same as Forza Horizon 4, except Horizon Life still appears fairly empty.And best of all, Horizon Arcade now scales the point requirement with number of participants, so it is actually possible to win. More variety of minigames compared to Forzathon Live, so it is actually superior now."

Forza Horizon 5 is the perfect balance of simulation and arcade that is needed for a racing game to be fun. On one hand you can alter and tune your car all and adjust sliders all day, or you can use your game currency to acquire tune setups created by other users. This allows a casual gamer with no extensive car knowledge to get out and play, and allows the car buffs to do their thing and build their perfect setup. Being able to just pick up and play and not spend all day in the menus is a bonus. Racing simulator games that are heavily focused on track rules and off track duties can be too slow and tedious to be fun.Huge car list, user created liveries and a variety of race modes and events all add to the excitement. Not to mention how beautiful the fictitious rendition of Mexico is. There are a few minor visual bugs, but I have not experienced anything game-breaking at the 60+ hour mark. Get out there and drive!"

It is very relaxing to drive in the world exploring while being intense when having a race.That being said, I'm taking a more neutral stance at the moment (despite the recommendation) because of all the bugs I'm experiencing. Missions sometimes are not registering, controls are being messy from time to time, all these are small things but add up to an annoying level. So buy the game if you are into racing games but be aware that bugs exist, a lot at that."

Biggest complaint outside of the AI is the sheer volume of pushing online content in the weekly playlists when i know that it isn't everyone's cup of tea (specifically mine). This is especially true when the matchmaking still feels just bad. Overall I'd recommend the game even for 10% off but wont remove the dislike until my complaints are fixed."

The map is bigger and more diverse than Britain, the cars are grippier (sucks if you like drifting), and FWD and RWD cars are actually driveable on S2 and above.Unfortunately, AWD is still head and shoulders above the rest, which will probably result in the same meta has the last game, where AWDs are king for anything not involving straight line speed.There is a fair amount of bugs, frequent disconnects and batsh!t insane rubberbanding for AI cars. Hopefully, most of these are fixed sooner rather than later."

3643,Yen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrusisacooldudenojokeok/,No,,0,284.2,November,"28,",129,0,1,"TL;DR - Don't buy it on Steam full price, buy it from Microsoft, or Xbox, or PS5 instead as it has better error support.The game had a rough start with many bugs and huge connectivity issues, which as time goes it seems that those issues dwindle.  Here and there the road won't render, people will disconnect (like in past games), and the game will fail to boot from access violation errors and conflicting software issues (like Discord and Wallpaper Engine!).  All of this with a 10th-gen i9 CPU and a RTX 3070, among other parts to my rather high spec build that should have little problem with render mismatching at all.This game does not seem very optimized when you play it with higher hardware installed, or as it would seem.  Many RAM dumps and memory leakage, many frame stutters, many times does the ground not render.  It happens a lot one day, and then none another.  It's hard to explain, but it happens.  It makes racing actually infuriating when it does happen, especially at harder difficulties.In terms of gameplay, all of the sounds are 110% better for every car, every engine, and every tire squeal in particular.  The weekly PR stunt challenges are car-restricted like the weekly race championships were in the last game, and that frankly sucks.  All of the cars feel they have a ""specific purpose"", like for example most retro sports cars feel like they aren't supposed to be tuned for S1 and higher when they clearly can be anyways.  It's hard to explain, but the cars' handling makes it feel like they aren't supposed to surpass some kind of specific driving use.A lot of my friends don't seem to have the same issues that I have with actually running the game, so I think it might just not pair well with high-spec PCs even if that shouldn't be a problem.  Even more friends who play the game all come to the same consensus that I have, being that despite all issues it has it's worth buying and playing.  It has a lot of errors that need permanent fixes, especially with the display drivers and Nvidia tech such as ray tracing.  A couple of times it thought I wasn't signed in and needed to be, preventing me from playing outright for a couple minutes.  Countless times it crashes to desktop because of a Windows 0xc0000005 error that no one on the internet knows the answer to but I recognize it to be a bad install that Steam can't really reverse, so the answer is to reinstall a 100 GB game.  The crashes from in-game render issues that are the result of the game and not one's own hardware wouldn't be so bad if the game didn't take 5 minutes to boot from main menu to actually playing the game.Over all, I'd say get it on sale just in case, but this certainly isn't worth more than $50 with how partially-functional the Steam version is.  Solid 70-75 out of 100 of a game because I still want to play it, but sometimes when playing and when any time there is an update the game just won't let me enjoy it the way I did Forza Horizon 4."

3650,JxTechy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198432611848/,1,,1,14.7,November,"28,",46,0,1,"Okay so this is going to be a fairly long review. I've been a forza player since motorsport 3 and have played every game since then. I played on xbox 360 to xbox one and then made the switch to PC for Forza Horizon 4. Forza Horizon 4 also had its issues at launch but still performed really well and had no graphical issues from what I can remember. However for Forza Horizon 5 that is a different story.Firstly the game and story are great. You can tell the creators know what they are doing with these games now as every time they release they are perfect, story and gameplay wise. But with this forza this PC version as some serious issues. The launch release would crash frequently and would never load the forzathon shop. Another issue was that you will disconnect from the online servers every time you went into a race. But thankfully these issues have been fixed, but this has meant I have been able to find the other issues with the game.FH4 at High settings looked like the Xbox one version of the game near enough, so I expected that high settings for FH5 would be how the game looks on series S at least. However the game looks like a late xbox 360 to early xbox one game at the best at this preset. Customising the high preset by turning features from medium to high and putting up MSAA to x4 does make the game an xbox one to xbox one X game which I'm happy with. But there are massive frame timing issues where the game drops frames for no reason whatsoever, and the game is running between 55-70FPS most of the time, but these drops make the game annoying to play. Even capping the frame rate and/or turning on long motion blur don't help. So I hope this is something the devs can fix.Apart from that its a great game, its just a shame that PC version is not looked at in the same way the xbox version is.Also for anyone wondering I've got a Ryzen 7 3700X and a GTX 1060 6GB with 16GB of RAM, and yes I am running the game off an NVMe"

And yes, You can drive on the volcano while its, ""Volcano-Ing"" to use his words.The graphics are TOP TIER in 2021. Played with a 6800xt, i can lock to 120fps@1440p with every graphic setting set as high as they go. At best the Consoles can pull 60 fps at reduced quality settings. The Game is Fun as hell, the driving is addictive and i find myself just driving the roats with my Logitech G920 wheel and pedals while sight seeing. This is the FIRST driving game to actually hold my attention this long. Im about 60 hours in, I've bought all the player houses, unlocked all the events and have collected 166 cars. If you love cars, Driving, or just FUN GAMES This game will not dissapoint. That being said, If you have a high end PC, you should get this game ANYWAY JUST to enjoy the graphics. The sound track is awesome as well and i find myself humming the songs in the game when driving in real life now."
3659,N-V US,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NVUSAttitude/,1,,1,313.5,November,"28,",334,0,1,"(Need to preface by saying I'm in no way a car expert, so take this as a casual review. I also haven't played any other Forza game, so this is my first) (Scroll all the way down for the TL;DR)Bought this all the way back in the pre-order stage and anxiously waited for November 9th to roll around. I only really bought Forza Horizon 5 to play with friends, have a virtual garage of my dream cars (as well as collect 1 of every car in the game), and understand cars a little better seeing the dev's strives of reaching a peak equilibrium between realism and illogical fun. This game absolutely slammed it out of the park.--OVERWORLD--The landscape is really pretty objectively speaking. Of course the graphics are nice, but for me personally, I find the overwhelming orange tone really drab. That's of course a personal preference, but even with my disdain of warm color schemes, it still manages to look really nice because there are quite a few grassy/roady areas that make the landscape not feel so warm and sandy. The balance is definitely there. The mountains are also a pretty fun climb, but after a few days of playing, the mountains start to feel underwhelming with what they have to offer. Score: 8/10--EXPLORATION--Gotta say- after exploring all 100% of the map (yes, even the little roads that get overlooked leaving you at 99.7% for a week which drives you nuts trying to find it and then accidentally stumbling into the last .3% and feeling relieved you can unpin that stupid challenge) getting all XP/Fast Travel boards, Houses, Barns and 3-starring all speedzones, speedtraps, trailblazers, drift zones, danger zones, and all festival drivatar races, (haven't completed the story missions yet), I have to say the grind was pretty enjoyable. Score: 9/10--CHALLENGES(FESTIVAL SITES)--The personal drive for overworld festival sites may factor in for you and you wanting to do them, (because there are quite a few and some require patience), seeing as how my personal drive for doing the overworld challenges involved wanting to have the best score that'll have my friends reaching for weeks, I'd imagine most people wouldn't put the time in for something like that. Which I'm not surprised by, but some of the challenges do require some SERIOUS dedication which is why I'm mentioning this.  Some challenges really confuse me on how they can be taken and improve further, which for some people is a challenge, but the way some of them operate, it's impossible without breaking the game a bit with glitches. Score: 8/10--TUNING--I can't say much for the tuning side of things, but I have to say, from what I've seen it's VERY expansive and very in-depth. It requires some pre-exisitng knowledge (obviously), but they do a pretty good job of explaining what each feature does, I'm just not a very good gauge for where things should be. I'll be working on doing my own custom tunes and trying to understand the terms themselves as best as possible in the future. I did, however, enjoy researching what cars would be best suitable for each race or festival site and finding suitable tunes other people have made. Score: (N/A) (Not enough experience)--STORY/STORY MISSIONS--This is actually kind've the main reason I haven't done much with the story. From what I've heard, Forza games aren't based on story modes so they're minimal which is fine, but it's the dialogue that makes me want to say something. It's a very ""perfect-world nothing is wrong"" goodie-two shoes back-and-forth. I don't have an outright problem with it but it just makes it feel soulless at times with the characters transactions to one another. The most interesting it got was with the Tristan Storyline. I won't elaborate but it's closest it comes to any form of verbal realism. Score: 5/10For the missions themselves, they tend to be fun little introductions to different types of vehicles you can drive on different types of terrains, street races that promote 1 on 1 challenges, deliberate challenges you have to complete or exploration-based expositions that give a little rough insight on car histories. They're nice and fun but some of the challenges are difficult to 3-star for me personally. It lies within the car it provides to you. Your personal cars don't get used for these missions so you're usually held back by the car you're given, and it can get a little frustrating. Score: 6/10--FESTIVAL PLAYLISTS--Festival Playlists are exclusive challenges you can complete to fill up a meter bar that'll grant you a free car based on what season you're playing in, the harder the challenge tends to be, the more points it seems to give. A lot of the challenges are based around using certain cars for festival sites (danger zones, speedtraps, etc) or race types. I have to say though, one of the most frustrating things involving the playlist I've done, have been the online matchmaking races. It forces you to play with other players, and thats where online interactions make or break things. You can't choose to play it with bots, however you almost always have to go against bots.  The car restrictions are usually insane and will have you pulling your hair out. To give deliberate context, the challenge ""Going Down a Storm"" was just unrealistic and terrible. Relying on other players will always be an issue. Its also for that reason I haven't done really any online matchmaking outside of playlist requirements. Score: 7/10--REGULAR RACES--These are the bulk of what you'll be doing which is why I've saved this part for last. There are different types of races that all have their own Festival zones based around them, Rally, Dirt, Cross-Country, Street, and Road. All race types are really fun to play and they push for experimentation of different cars (if you're willing, because you can also just keep going with an ""old reliable"" if you so choose). They provide drivatar bots based around your cars score and type range. Based on the difficulty it really is really good for a ncie casual racing experience. I won't go too in-depth on the race types, but I will say, they're all seriously enjoyable. Even the ones I thought I wouldn't like became something I was excited to complete. Score: 10/10Overall this game is a seriously good 9/10 imo.--TL;DR--From a casual perspective, this game does the realism and illogical fun in a really nice/realistic balance, the races and challenges are really fun to complete if you're willing to put in the time and effort. Story is a bit lacking, but the game isn't known for story, so I wouldn't sweat it. Overworld is nice to look at and fun to drive in. This game gets my ""Game of the Year"" vote for 2021 if that's any indicator on how I feel.UPDATE: Pretty much a year later and my opinion hasn't changed, but once you complete all of the regular races, the ""bulk"" of what you are going to be doing is weekly challenges (Festival Playlists). Some of the challenges are EXTREMELY challenging depending on the restrictions put in place, which is I guess the point, but it doesn't leave much room for error. Honestly, in a strange way, the game feels more like a virtual pet you need to take care of week by week if you want to keep being entertained by the game. If you aren't interested in doing weekly challenges to get exclusive cars you can't get on the wheelspins, good luck finding something to truly do to pass the time once you've completed the main races. After doing so many Festival playlists to general completion, it becomes droning and another chore. It's always fun, but there comes a point where getting the exclusive cars each week eats away at your soul. That being said, every now and again they introduce new Danger Signs or Speedtraps, (etc etc etc), and/or Races, but besides that, its mainly Festival Playlists, and again, they're not bad, but it becomes droning."

3699,Pixel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0stp1x3l/,1,,0,84.2,November,"27,",578,0,1,"The game itself is insane, probably the one arcade racing game to play if you are into racing games. I do say arcade racer but its not like NFS or The Crew which are hardcore arcade racers. This is somewhat in between arcade and sim but can be more arcadey if you want.There's a wide variety of cars to choose from so no one is left out (although could use more SUVs). Very in-depth tuning and a lot of performance upgrades for most cars. This time some performance upgrades affect the sound of the car as well.Visually, the game is insane...if it works on maxed out settings. I have a 3070 and still cannot get it to work at 60FPS maxed out at 1440P (even 40FPS is not very stable) but it looks so much better on Xbox sadly which is a weaker system. Hopefully they optimize it.I usually don't care about the single player of games like this where multiplayer is an option and in FH5 as well, I don't care about the single player. They tried for a story or dialogue but its just cringey and would be better off with just one person telling everything to us rather than having multiple characters repeating the same dialogues over and over again. But hey its a racing game with multiplayer so for me that's not a downside.The online is well, its great when it works. The leaderboards are filled with hackers so have fun trying to get a legit score on there. But playground games cannot let people use most of the custom designs because its a kids game and ban the creators indefinitely. Mind you that on kid accounts for Xbox, most of the online content is disabled unless parents enable it. Considering how big tunes, liveries and tracks are in this game its really detrimental for the community. The devs are just on a power trip on banning people.Even after the patch the performance is horrible for the game (I've reset my PC so that is not at fault here). FH4 ran much much better and looked better too (since I cannot play above the high preset very well). The roads randomly turn into rainbow and black boxes. The foliage is just TV static and tons of bugs like suddenly stopping the car and falling out of the map.TL;DR: One of the best if not the best open-world racing games but can go downhill real fast if the devs don't patch the major issues like hacking, online disconnects and performance. All they do right now is ban people randomly for sharing a spongebob like livery. I wish I could give a neutral rating on Steam but for now a negative will have to do."

You will always be beaten off the line, and even on dirt tracks the AI has perfect grip. If you're miles ahead the game will teleport all the AI behind you, and if you're a bit behind the lead car will basically rocket off into Forza Horizon 6. The difficulty between races is wildly inconsistent, some races you can smash the AI even with them teleporting around, and others you'll be in last place as the entire pack of AI will finish and be done having lunch right as you cross the finish line.I wish there was a half recommend, if the AI doesn't sound like a big deal then its a good game. If you cant stand obviously cheating AI, don't bother until they fix it...if they fix it."

I believe that the game is purely driven by cinematics as it makes up half the game so far3. I have yet to experience an open world4. The mouse is useless, and yes I know its made by xbox, but it shouldn't remain on the screen no matter what I do5. Not realistic in the slightest.  I was expecting a realistic game but cars and motorcycles dropping from the sky ruined it6. The only cool part I experienced was the 10 seconds where I raced the place down the runstrip7. Player customization sucks ass8.  Its 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gigs and I expected more in general9. The map isn't even that big when you can go 300 mph10. Having like 15 gears ruins the immersion11.  The game was literally pixelated until I turned my graphics to EXTREME 8x DLSS12. ""Literally pixelated"" was not an exaggeration, the graphics were ass13. Wreckfest has better car physics and noises14. The audio is ♥♥♥♥♥♥; really loud during ""normal driving"" and extremely quiet during cutscenes (excluding the announcers voice which is was too loud)15. More on the cinematic thing: The announcer is annoying and talks too much16. Opening cutscene wasn't good17. I can drive the Hoonigan car (I hate Hoonigan) 18. Drifting sucks: I tap the E-brake and I spin out19. The planes being flown above our cars while we drove to the festival was not realistic in the slightest, literally pulling 20 g's going back and forth on both sides of the road20.  The festival setting sucks too, doing one race then going straight back there, another small race then a race back to the festival: too repetitive21. Xbox studios amirite 22. No incentive to drive if I get a 2020 Chevy Corvette as my first vehicle23. Ford Bronco's really aren't even that cool24. Vehicles don't get dirty when driving over gravel or dirt25. Minimalist hud ew yuck gross26. I cant find a way to turn down my sensitivity and its way too high27. Stick figure ass hands turning the wheel Minecraft style when I am in first person28. When racing the bikes and wingsuit guy, the entire race it said position 4/4 but when I crossed the finish line it said first place29. Black border around license plates make it hard to read"
3740,un,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilymario/,1,,1,188.2,November,"27,",39,0,1,"As of right now this game is a bit half and half with me leaning more towards it being great. They've really fixed the sounds in this game and have made the driving a lot more realistic in terms of arcade style racing. The tire smoke is also much better but I know it can be a hassle for some so they should make an option to alter it in some way shape or form. The map being a bigger is a plus and I've already been playing longer than I expected I would without getting bored. Also, you just can't beat downhill or uphill drifting on la gran caldera. If you've been a long time Forza Horizon 5 fan this game will be great, considering it's ditched Forza Horizon 4's lack of diversity and feels like a Forza game again. I won't get too in depth on the game's strong points and I'll do the same for the bad points/cons, the cons being small bugs, server issues, and others. My main tick right now is how unstable the servers are. Don't get me wrong they've been slowly improving them but it's been going a lot slower than promised. Players around you including players in your convoy will still occasionally disappear, you'll experience some game crashing when you least expect it, for some the fps on the game gets progressively worse depending on how long your session is, and playing online can sometimes be dreadful (in terms of load speeds etc). After saying all of this I'd still recommend this game to anybody. If you were somebody who's new to the franchise, or just racing games in general then I'd recommend trying it out with the Xbox game pass first. This is mainly because, if you don't like the game after a month then you really won't have a reason to play it afterwards, so save yourself the 50-59 dollars and just use 10 for the game pass to try it out, and you also get all those other games if you're interested. If you've never had the game pass before you can subscribe for 1 dollar the first time which is pretty nice, so you'd get Forza Horizon 5 for a dollar for 1-3 months depending on whatever deal they have going on."

There is so much wrong with this game that i don't even know where to start.The Map is probably one of the worst Maps in any Video Game i have ever played, only The Crew 2 had a worse map than this. It just feels lifeless, created without love, a massive area filled with emptiness, disappointments & rocks to ♥♥♥♥ you over at any given moment. It can be used as an analogy for Turn 10/Playground Games & Tripple A Games in general. To keep it short it has some nice spots, but the rest of the map is just shallow at best.This is your typical Tripple A Game, great graphics, i may even consider them stunning when you play it for the first couple of times.It's surprisingly well optimized considering it's looks.On mostly Ultra, 2560x1080p on a Ryzen 7 3700X & Vega 64 i was hovering around 60FPS in Guanajuato . That's all i can say about this department, it's your average Tripple A Game graphics that get boring after some time and will be considered obsolete the second the successor game is announcedCompared to the previous installment there had been some major upgrades in that department, many of the cars sound a lot better than they used to do.There are the occasional cars that sound a bit off, but it might as well just be me who never saw/heard those irl.It's quite a pleasure to listen to the game with the help of my 5.1 Surround Sound System or my Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro, but only as long as i played with friends/played singleplayer as the second you enter race with other people they start spamming their horns & their Forza Link garbage.The music selection is utter garbage, but that has to do with my own taste, so i'm not gonna go into that anymore than necessaryMost of the content has been copy paste from Froza Horizon 4, which would be ok if they would have also paired it with new vehicles/new content.The stories that came with the updates are bad at best, they're even worse than the actual main story of this godforsaken game, i actually have no clue how they managed to do that.Every week is just a grind consisting of relatively easy but time consuming AI Races, either super easy or absolutely disgusting Stunt Events & a Multiplayer Team Race against the ""UnBeAtAbLe"" AI, but more on that topic further down below...Those recent months of updates stopped my friends and me from even playing this games, i mean apart from constant bugs that are introduced with every update, they also manage to bring our such boring content that we have stopped completley.Lmao, it's baaaaaaaaaaaaaad even for Racing Game & Tripple A Game standards.You basically pick up after the Story of Forza Horizon 4 as a ""superstar"".Now you're just racing for fun and to show that you're the star of the Horizon Festival.But that's as far as this story goes...You do some driving for different people, do some races and all that racing game stuff.At some point you even have a rival, you might expect that he hates you or smth like that, but no!He is exactly like the rest of the festival, a watered down and shallow character with a PG Rating of G.Everyone is extremely nice, you cannot fail as you're the SuPeRsTaR, even your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rival likes you.So much for Music Festival with motor racing...The music part of the Festival isn't even prevalent anymore...The Multiplayer Races are torture, imagine bumpercars but on crack.FH5 doesn't punich you for ramming other people, so you can probably guess what a lof of people do...Even in gamemodes where you have to ""work"" ""together"" as a ""team"" to beat either the AI or other Players.And don't you even dare to pick a non meta car, you will get absolutely wrecked. Sure you can compete if the Players are incompetent, but the second it's a somewhat competent driver you can just dream of catching them.While i'm on the topic of races, only the first place is considered winning. It doesn't even matter if you score 2nd or 3rd place, the game dismisses it as a loss for you, because the ""sUpErStAr"" always scores 1st place.Honestly who ever at T10/PGG came up with this idea should be fired.♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ this franchise. This is my last Forza Horizon Game ever!I will do everything possible to prevent that my friends buy this piece of ♥♥♥♥ and even if they want it, i will help them pirate it, as this company doesn't deserve see another cent from our pocket.I hope PGG/T10 as companies crash, burn and die"

Not surprising since it just came out but it's frustrating.If they could fix the seasonal speed zones issue which pretty much incorrectly receives the wrong information/shoots out the wrong information to the player I'd be happier. For example, the limitation might be 140mph (s1 class). I get in a perfectly tuned C8 and I go above the speed limit and I hit 150mph. The game tells me I should go 1 more mph over to complete the speed trap. Customizations in this game are meh, something they can honestly improve. If only FH5 had Need For Speed Heat like customization. One last thing is I would like to see my refreshed cars like maybe a M3 G80. or a recent F82/F80 or something like a M2 CS. I just want more refreshed cars. Something like a 2020 Honda Civic Coupe SI would be awesome."

The graphics are just stunning, the car design is amazing and the sounds just blow you away. But there are some cons at the moment. - Memory leak. When you play the game for like 1 to 2 hours your FPS just drops for more then 20 to 30 FPS. - Ambient Occlusion ( SSAO )  Bug. When this is on, weird lines are visible on the road, especially when the road surface is wet. If you turn this option off, it will also be gone.- 5.1 audio bug. If you use a 5.1 audio setup, You barely hear the sound of the car. Don't get me wrong the game is really great. If they would fix the memory leak the game would be a solid 9/10.And it's not like I'm running this game on a potato PC. I have an i9 10900K , an RTX 3090 and 32 GB Ram.So I will recommend this game for sure. But keep in mind that there are some bugs, of which 1 can be experienced as Game breaking."

(performance wise)livery editor is intuitive and easy to use, yet hard to master.anyone can pick up and enjoy even for a bit, including non car nerds.every week there's little challenges and if you do them all you get cars or other stuff.after the intro you can play at your own pace and choose paths to play as well.friendly community when it comes to helping and teaching, bumpers car in online.cross platform with xbox.lots of assists that'll help you learn the game if you need it, including a time slow (doesn't work in online). all of which i'd recommend disabling once you learn. don't know how to tune? plenty tutorials or willing players. don't want to learn? download a tune and forget about all that work.credits are easy to come by so you don't really gotta worry about not being able to afford stuff.can make your own routes, maps and modes. creator is only starting, lots more features said to be planned.plenty more content to come as a whole.cons to me:every vehicle seems to understeer unless tuned.tuning can be scary for new players.awd seems to be still king.a lot of vehicles got nerfed p.i. wise (point index, forza's class measurement), and in turn, that makes them not be able to reach top of some classes unless you engine swap or do drivetrain swaps.clothes in wheelspins still... but if you buy them all, they'll be gone (if you have over two million to spare on clothes. . .).your car can randomly decide it no longer wants to be a car, and instead be a spaceship. even on an entirely flat road.voice lines are hit or miss.new feature called chat link/forza link- before you could put 4 quick chats on your 4 buttons of your choice, now you can still do that but two are reactive to other player's chat or what's happening in game. i'm mute irl so i used to run yes/no, sorry and a salt inducing comment of my choice; mostly ""another ones bites the dust"". now i have to choose two of those.most cars are suvs/trucks, super or hyper cars it seems.i have 32 gb of ram, after 2 or 3 hours of play i have ram memory leaks and restarting fixes it. only game that does it.ai in coop is a pushover, even in unbeatable imo.can't place decals on windows.can't paint front rims different than rear, or use different rims altogether.can't change material of decals... say, a matte car and a metal flake vinyl.adjustable wings are still mostly awful looking... why can't we adjust aero on any wing, even if it's more or less than others?visual customization isn't the best, but the game doesn't advertise itself as visual customization heaven... so it's a non-issue issue.differential choice seems meaningless (to me, as i do my own tunes). all i've noticed that changes is the starting setting of them- say, race differential starting at 20 30, rally differential starts at 40 20. (not actual numbers, just giving an example).i'm sure i'm forgetting pros and cons, but i have over a thousand hours into horizon 4 which was worse than this in a lot of ways.tl:dr: if you liked previous ones, you'll like this one. if you like racing games, you'll like this i think. if you don't but you're curious, i'd wait for a sale. IN MY OPINION best SIM-CADE racing game of past 3-4 years hope this can help anyone decide, have a good day/night (:"

Spending time in the autoshow customizing your car's visuals and performance is great. On the asphalt, gravel, beachsand or mud, the same familiar car tuning options from Horizon 4 make a return and adjusting the dials just right will give your machine an edge on the competition. The games colour palette, npc voice-overs and soundtrack are about par for the course, not all original but not annoying either. Performance wise, this game runs like a gem and looks the part too. With all the trash tier AAA PC games we've seen in 2021, this one separates itself from the chaff and looks & performs great. If this studio had internal struggles and last minute design changes due to the pandemic, it does not show in this game whatsoever. Kudos to them. If you're a racing fan, this game deserves some of your time."

Daily challenges that just do not work.  Performance degradation (game starts at 90 fps for me, after 2 hours of playtime its down to 30 fps).  Online open world lobbies seem to be limited to 10-12 players, where in Horizon 4 you saw up to 70 at once per session, which leads into the next point, Horizon Arcade events which are required for seasonal challenges being IMPOSSIBLE to finish, since they need quite a few players to reach the goals.  But 99 times out of 100, you're doing it alone.I'm willing to have a little faith in the developers being able to fix these issues since Horizon 4 too was troubled at launch, but today it runs flawlessly.  And despite the problems listed above, at its core, Horizon 5 is an incredibly fun playground for all things racing!"

3998,Chocomonster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IWantChocolate/,1,,0,842.4,November,"25,",654,0,1,"Be prepared for crashes, hangups and network problems. If you want to use a steering wheel, be prepared for it to either not work at all or have periodical issues, even if you have one of the most commonly used models on the market. The settings menu is also a total mess some settings conflict with each other and others disable each other with no apparent logic behind it. If you for instance want to rebind buttons on the controller, then you have to work around the fact that there are 4-8 keys that are REQUIRED despite anyone sane never using them, such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ANNA helper-companion.It is clear that this is no passion project, because for all the content being made and released on a constant drip, nothing is being done about the core problems this game has and none of the updates do anything about simple player convenience changes. One example would be that if you collect one of every car in the game, then you cannot choose the colour, vinyl and tune for each of them, because the game is severely limited in how many 'layouts' you can store.I got my money's worth, as my hours make clear, but I would never recommend this to anyone, because it is such a gamble if it will even let you play the way you want or at all and none of the issues that have persisted since launch are ever getting fixed, because the developers have put this game on life support while they work on DLC and a sequel.I suggest you instead give your money to a developer that listens to player feedback and fixes technical issues."

The only downside is that I've noticed a few small bugs, but nothing too big. Barn finds are actually good and useful cars, Forza Edition cars have custom upgrades that are only available on the Forza Edition cars. It is easy to get Accolades at first and gets slightly harder as you progress, which is a good thing. I love the graphics.No doubt in my mind that this is the best racing game at the moment. Drifting mechanics are way better, and I find drifting way more fun than FH4. I absolutely love this game and there is almost nothing wrong with it."

4068,Old Man Withers,https://steamcommunity.com/id/OldManWithers1/,1,,1,31.7,November,"24,",459,0,1,"You can follow these steps to become a professional race car driver:1. Develop your driving skillsTo compete against professional race car drivers, you must have excellent driving skills. There are a few ways you can work on the skills needed to drive at high speeds. One way is to take up karting. Karts have a similar construction to open-wheel vehicles, and they travel at high speeds relative to their size and the structure of the courses and the competition is almost identical. Once you feel your skills have improved enough, you can compete in karting races to see how you measure against others.Another option is to enroll in a racing school. There are various types of schools throughout the country, some specializing in a specific form of racing. Through formalized learning, you can gain knowledge from experienced drivers and practice your racing skills on real courses. Consider searching for a reputable racing school near you and asking about requirements.2. Join a racing clubMembership in a well-established racing club can help you stay informed about racing events you can compete in and even provide you with resources to get you started in your career. One of the most well-known clubs you can consider is the Sports Car Club of America, or SCCA, which hosts races of various types around the country. The SCCA offers online applications and variable rates depending on factors such as age and military service.3. Obtain a vehicle and equipmentHaving a reliable, race-capable vehicle is required of all successful drivers. If you can afford to purchase your own vehicle, consider an unmodified model to which you can make your own customizations. You may also be able to rent a vehicle for racing, which can be a more feasible choice as you build up your funds to purchase your own vehicle. In either case, the members and officials of your racing club can provide guidance so that you choose a vehicle that's appropriate for your needs.Racing gear and safety equipment are also required to compete in races. This includes clothing and accessories such as a fireproof racing suit, helmet and gloves. Once you've obtained the necessary gear, have it examined by a club official to make sure it's up to standard.4. Obtain a competition licenseWhen you start out in your racing club, you're a novice. You need a competition license to compete in events. The racing club you belong to is the sanctioning body that issues the license, and it generally qualifies you for events in all racing clubs. Consult with your club to determine the specific requirements for licensure, as they're likely to differ. For example, the SCCA's requirements include racing three times within two years.5. Practice and trainPractice is necessary to become good enough to compete at the professional level. If possible, aim to work on your skills on a track or a simulator at least five times a week, and also compete regularly. It can also be helpful to develop a training regimen that includes cardiovascular and resistance workouts. Conditioning your body can improve your ability to withstand the physical challenges of the sport. In addition, consider studying professional races and analyzing the techniques of the best drivers. You can incorporate their maneuvers into your skill set.6. Look for a team or a sponsorIf you've performed well in your races, you may attract the attention of teams and sponsors. Alternatively, you can proactively get in touch with them to discuss terms. Teams and sponsors provide funding for your career in exchange for different returns—a portion of your winnings and permission to advertise on your vehicle, respectively. With their support, you can enter large races as a professional driver."

The graphics look amazing and the game-play is super fun. Would recommend to anyone who likes cars regardless if you haven't played racing games before. It can be as competitive as you want it to be. If you want to just drive around and explore a beautiful map you can do that. If you want to race agents different levels of AI that become increasingly more challenging then you can do that. And if you want to race real players you can also do that. I have enjoyed my time with is game and I will be spending many more hundreds of hours exploring and having fun. Hope to see you there!

The connection issues have made me more frustrated with technology than I have been in the last few years. After countless upgrades, and a decent internet bill it is extremely demoralizing to try and join up with your friends and end up with constant connection issues. Friends will disappear while other players are still visible and active, ""Not in leaders session"" will be a common occurrence reminding you of the game's failure. This is only coupled with strange hitboxes on the terrain, and poor optimization which leads to textures crashing and frames tanking. Broken game on release, and it doesn't seem to have gotten any better."

Everything they touch turns into 💩. It's always been that way, and every developer studio who has allowed it (or didn't have a choice) has experienced the same effects. Unfinished garbage which is released and later fixed more or less. No innovation, just recycle old assets as to improve profitability. No attention for quality whatsoever.Since the last patch many users are experiencing even more crashes than before, game will run at 5fps after 10 minutes of playing or while looking at menus. Horizon online is broken, no other players are visible. This is one month after release, kind of akward. It's now completely unplayable for me.PROs: -it's basically FH4 with a different map and theme, some features were added, others removed-good work on the map, there is more than one fun paved road now.-Nice atmosphere (as long as traffic works which it does only in singleplayer) and graphics-I can now paint brake calipersCONs:-Buggy mess, low performance, feels glitchy, they didn't even get basic stuff right like hiding your cursor when in fullscreen lol-No innovation, it's still the same game-Traffic doesn't work in horizon online and other players will disappear-Still no acknowledgment for basic tuning features who many were asking for since a decade (window decals, exhausts, new horizon parts)-Many good cars missing (bye alfa and lancia) and the best widebodies were removed-Developer seems more focused on banning players for stuff that offends only them rather than doing the hard stuff which is fixing this sorry excuse for a sequel-No acknowledgment for players who don't care for races and events and just want to enjoy their cars in online freeroaming. Now you can't even look for a new horizon life session, you have to go back to singleplayer, then enter horizon life and it will most likely still put you in the same session. This was important to find new players to hang out with.-Sounds are broken, turbo sounds like 100% pressure even when you just press the throttle by 10% or less.-Game won't do basic stuff like in fh3 and 4, won't remember your radio (need to turn it off manually each time), won't remember the amount of layers when looking for decals, other similar things.In short, if you have fh4 and the map didn't get completely boring yet wait for a sale. The only advantage from fh5 to fh4 are the map and paintable brake calipers, no other improvements. And these things are hardly worth over 80$."

They put so much effort into the car sounds yet the actual audio with the camera behind the car is too quiet!!! Lets be honest, the car sounds are what makes this game so why can i barely my car! Fortunately the work around i use for this is have the car sounds turned right up and lower everything else, then turn my physical speakers right up to listen to my RB symphony. 2.) In online mode there is virtually NO ai traffic! This makes the world feel very dull and empty, Switching to offline mode helps with this but it would be sick to play online and with traffic.3.) Load times, crashes, and bugs. When my games running, its beautiful, everything maxed out on 1440p with 100+ fps on my rig but these load times are horrendous even on my SSD! Lag/crashes in the menus is quite painful. Hopefully these issues are addressed and once they are i'll happily be giving this a thumbs up!"

Well duh, they're just racing games, right? Yes, but the car selection, from what I can tell, is mostly identical to that of Horizon 4, but without any of the paywalls for certain FH4 cars.Horizon 5 is a nice change of scenery, and the intro to the game is definitely the most off-the-wall, memorable one I've seen yet. There is much more of an off-road element present for people like myself compared to Horizon 4, and even some Baja races that I haven't unlocked yet that I'm definitely excited for.Is it worth $60? Well, maybe, but, that doesn't include the cars that will hopefully still be added, not locked behind paywalls, like Horizon 4.To date, I would say I like the game, but I can't give a number rating like I usually would. I like the game, but some of the bugs present at launch are pretty frustrating, so, I would advise towards waiting a couple months, or a handful of updates to buy just to avoid any frustrations, like suddenly losing a 1M+ skill chain.

Built a moderate level PC and after playing it, have to say it meets all my expectations, really enjoying my time with it. Gonna split this review up into the good and bad.-> Beautiful map, extremely varying environment from region to region and there's something for everyone. From off-road racing, to grip racing, to drifting on side roads.-> Great optimization, runs at 1080p high@60fps, with a GTX 1650 GDDR6 LP so thumbs up for that.-> Even at high, the game looks gorgeous, and the weather effects look, and sound great.-> Great selection of cars, got around 200 in-game, and they all feel relatively unique from one another.-> Progression is light, you're given loads of cars through wheelspins and accolades (in-game achievements), so you can save up your credits to buy something you really like. The game doesn't force you to do anything, you can play it at your own pace and do what you like doing.-> The handling model is arcade, but fun to play with on keyboard & mouse (keeping only ABS on).-> Servers still do cause issues, but they have improved massively since launch so I wouldn't worry about it.-> Multiplayer is a mess, I've only played it casually and there are clean racers but most people cannot drive without ramming you into oblivion or using your car to slow down for a corner (wondering if the changes to Horizon 4's multiplayer made it into Horizon 5)-> There are a few texture glitches, especially when the road is wet, but I'm not sure if it's only because the game is running at high.-> If you're looking to no life this game to get high scores for various activities (not my thing, but just wanted to mention), like setting fastest times, highest speeds, longest jumps, there are a few exploits currently ruining the leaderboards. -> Clothing, emotes and horns in wheelspins, I feel like the lifestyle aspect of the game should be separate from the racing/car aspect of the game.Overall, an all rounded game, that is enjoyable to play solo, and would be for multiplayer if they tweaked it so that people don't wall ride or ram into you. It's great to unwind and explore the map with your favourite cars and take in the sights. There's quite a bit a content, and there's going to be more on the way of course.Also wanted to mention that I got the premium edition, can't really say if it's worth it or not yet as the expansions aren't out yet, and won't be for a while I guess. But they haven't disappointed in the past, so if you're think about getting the premium edition, I'd give it a soft recommendation. But, if it's on sale definitely get the premium edition."

After having the game pause for a while, lag spikes start to happen a lot more frequent. Another thing with graphics and performance is that the render distance for trees in this game needs to be raised. It was better in forza horizon 4 with the same settings. Theres a bug where when you swap exhausts, it takes a while for all the components of the engine sound to load too. The special effects like the turbo sound loads before the roar of the engine. Also just a suggestion, sometimes i feel like there isnt as much of a set campaign mode as I would have hoped. It kind of feels like you can get bored from being lost and not knowing what to grind for. Other than that it is a beautiful game. Extremely fun and well polished"

I had no interest in cars or racing in general, however this game has made that enjoyable for me. The freedom and choice Forza Horizon 5 grants you allows any kind of audience to enjoy the game, whether it is racing, tuning cars, collecting cars, etc. Furthermore the game can run on any kind of PC with very good or very bad specs. Graphics are gorgeous supporting RTX as well. Even though there were a whole bunch of bugs when the game first came out, it is currently at a very good state, except for the online multiplayer aspect. I spend more time trying to join my friends party rather than playing the game. Even though there were updates and improvements to the online features throughout the games lifespan, the online experience is still sometimes unbearable. Other than that the game has almost has no flaws.I started being more interested in cars in general having no prior knowledge. Now I began watching F1 races more, took more interest in cars like my father. We discuss old Porsche cars which is very enjoyable. I can say that this game played a huge role in that.Definitely recommend it, 9.5/10. It will be 10/10 if the online multiplayer aspect is fixed."

4257,AemJoues,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AemJoues/,1,,1,117.1,November,"18,",208,0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 is an XL version of FH4. Everything that was good about FH4 has been used in FH5. You can now tune the cars to whether it should be a drift car (drift-mode) etc. Unlike FH4 the cars are less arcade-like and more realistic. But at the same time, they still have the Forza Horizon way of handeling. From someone who comes from league racing in F1 2021, rFactor 2, ACC etc., I think FH5 is a fantastic game. The game is relaxing to play. It has both elements of relaxation and races where you need to concentrate.Some have had problems with the game. The only problem I've had is that online does not work very well. When you are in a convoy you cannot see the HindanOthers have had problems with not being able to open the game. These things will be resolved soon with an update.Would I recommend the game - yes. Usually I do not think that a game is worth the costs and therefore i buy them on offer, but here the game are one of the only ones where I can say that it is 100% worth it. I bought the premium edition for 100€ and think it's worth it. I've been playing 30 hours and I'm not done with the storry mode yet. So in short, yes that is worth it. You would have lots of fun with your friends online, and with the story-mode offline."

As of now, there are many many cheaters, so the leader boards are totally messed up, so that is one thing that is needed to fix. Overall it is an awesome Horizon game just like the others I have played, all you need to do is wait for the updates to come out slowly and surely it will be better when most updates have come out."

If you have an interest in cars or motorsport, there's plenty to love in this game. If you are a sim-racing enthusiast, there's not much for you here in terms of competitive racing or simulation driving. As someone who loved Horizon 4, is passionate about cars and motorsports (F1, MotoGP, WRC, WEC) and loves sim-racing: I wholeheartedly recommend this game for like-minded individuals. For everyone else: as of this moment, (november 17th 2021) there are about a hundred technical issues impacting game performance, online connectivity and user experience - the worst of them being memory leak in the Steam version ultimately serving as a countdown to a crash to desktop. Mileage varies heavily from user to user when it comes to these issues so if you haven't bought this game yet because you're worried about technical issues I'd advise you to check the Forza Support Twitter account until issues are resolved."

4305,acrylog,https://steamcommunity.com/id/acrylog/,1,,1,470.4,November,"17,",224,0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 is by far the best game in the series. Aside from the bugs that we've come to expect from a new game launch and the cheaters posting unrealistic times on the leaderboards, there aren't many flaws I can think of. The map has a wide variety of terrains and sights, giving you the opportunity to do many of the things that you want. The premade races aren't even that bad either. You can even watch 12 hypercars tumble down the side of a mountain in one of them, if you desire. The accolade system rewards you for doing certain tasks, some of which you may not have even thought to do. Car tuning has been made better by the inclusion of fully adjustable 7, 8, 9, and 10 speed transmissions, giving you the ability to make the car drive how you want, as opposed to the previous games only giving you a 6 speed or however many came in the car originally.This game is missing cars and manufacturers from the previous entries, most notably Citroen, Lancia, and Alfa Romeo, as well as a few cars such as the 2002 Lotus Esprit V8, 2005 Hot Wheels Mustang, and a fan favorite, the 1962 Peel P50. The game does, however, give us new electric cars like the 2020 Porsche Taycan Turbo S and 2020 Lotus Evija. Overall, it's a really fun simcade that has the potential to be really good if it just gets fixed.Edit: V10 Scene 95 has to be the worst story mission that has ever existed in a Forza Horizon game. It's basically impossible if your difficulty is higher than above average and your traction control is off.Edit 2: This was written before the P50 was added to the game."

I tried :-running the game as an admin-running the game without steam overlay-unpluging my : Webcams, controller, simpad, microphone, headphone, graphic tablet-closing : discord, wallpaper engine, (everything that was open or running in background too )-trying to fix the game and searching for corrupted or missing files-reinstalling the game-disconnecting my internet connection-running the game on low graphic and solution-running the game in windowed mode-running the game in a different language-updating widows-updating my graphic card driver-reinstalling Microsoft Visual C++-checking if my PC time/date is correct-excluding the files from the anti-virus software protectionAlso my Hadware is overkill for the recommended requirements. But it was impossible and was always crashing in the 1. loading screen.Now after they were holding my money for a week they managed to release a hotfix for the game. I guess it is to hard to just test a game by yourself to see that the game is crashing for 40% of the users. ( Let´s ignore all the other problems the game is doing when it´s not crashing  in first place)Now after I downloaded the 5GB hotfix and started the game, all that changed was that now the cutseen movies have music instead of beeing fully silence. Still the same crashes, still the same problems.Overall a very bad work of the company"

This is a traditional meatloaf made with ground beef, breadcrumbs, onions, and perfectly balanced seasonings.  A ketchup-based topping adds incredible flavor.WHAT MAKES A REALLY GOOD MEATLOAF RECIPEI think the trick to good meatloaf is using lean ground beef.  The problem with a lot of meatloaf recipes is that they call for ground beef with a high fat content.  As the meatloaf cooks, the fat cooks out and makes a greasy mess.  Not this recipe!HOW TO KEEP IT MOISTYou may be thinking, but won’t lean ground beef make the meatloaf dry?  Not at all!  The milk, egg, ketchup, and diced onion in the meat mixture are all working to keep the meatloaf moist and delicious.WHY PUT MILK IN ITMilk soaks into the breadcrumbs and helps keep the meatloaf moist.  I typically use whole milk in recipes, but any type of milk including non-dairy milk alternatives could be used.  IS IT BETTER TO COOK COVERED OR UNCOVEREDSome recipes call for covering the loaf pan with aluminum foil before baking to keep the moisture in.  This is not necessary in this recipe.  Bake uncovered for the entire 55 minutes.  It will stay moist.SHOULD I SAUTÉ THE ONIONS FIRSTSome recipes call for sautéing the onions before adding them to the raw meatloaf mixture.  This ensures that the onions are completely cooked and soft.  I’ve found that if the onions are cut small enough, they will cook through during the baking process and do not need to be sautéed.This recipe calls for finely diced onion, so there is no need to sauté it first.  Skipping the sauté step makes the meatloaf preparation faster and easier.This classic meatloaf is perfect for a busy weeknight meal because it can be prepared in minutes.HOW LONG SHOULD IT COOKThis meatloaf is cooked in a 350° oven, uncovered, for 55 minutes. The internal temperature should reach 160° F.  Be sure to let the meatloaf rest for 10 minutes before attempting to slice it, so it holds its shape.LOAF PAN VERSUS BAKING SHEETI prefer to use a loaf pan because it keeps all the glaze in place perfectly and the meat is juicier.  But, you could line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.  Shape the meatloaf into a loaf shape.  Top with the glaze.  And, bake as normal.HOW TO MAKE THE BEST MEATLOAF*Note:  The full printable recipe is at the bottom of this post.Add 90% lean ground beef to a large bowl.Add dried bread crumbs  and some diced onion.Add milk, an egg, ketchup, and worcestershire sauce.Add dried parsley, garlic powder, salt and pepper.Mix it together REALLY well.Pour the meat mixture into a loaf pan.Spread it into a flat even layer.MAKE THE MEATLOAF SAUCEAdd ketchup, brown sugar, and red wine vinegar to a bowl.Whisk until combined.Pour the glaze over the meatloaf.Bake it!Let it cool before slicing.CAN THIS BE MADE AHEAD OF TIMEAbsolutely!  Just cover the loaf pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate it until you’re ready for it.  Then, uncover it and let it come to room temperature as you’re preheating the oven.CAN THIS BE FROZENYes!  Prepare the meatloaf, put it in a loaf pan, and top with glaze according to the recipe directions.  Cover the pan and freeze.Place the frozen meatloaf in the refrigerator to thaw about 24 hours before you want to bake it.  Then, uncover it and let it come to room temperature as you’re preheating the oven.WHY DOES MEATLOAF FALL APARTYou may not have used enough binding ingredients.  This recipe calls for plenty of breadcrumbs.It may be over baked.  Fifty five minutes is all it takes.Or, you may have sliced into it while it was still too hot.  I always let my meatloaf cool for 10 minutes before slicing into it.I’ve been playing around with this recipe for the past few months, making it many times.  And, I didn’t mind the repetition at all because I do believe I ended up with the best classic meatloaf recipe ever. 🙂Ingredients1 lb. 90% lean ground beef1 cup dried bread crumbs1/2 cup diced yellow onion1/2 cup milk1 large egg beaten2 tbsp. ketchup1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce1 tsp. dried parsley leaves3/4 tsp. salt1/2 tsp. garlic powder1/4 tsp. ground black pepperFor the Topping:1/4 cup ketchup2 tbsp. packed light brown sugar1 tbsp. red wine vinegarInstructionsPreheat oven to 350° Fahrenheit.In a large bowl, add the beef, bread crumbs, onion, milk, egg, 2 tablespoons ketchup, worcestershire sauce, parsley, salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Use your hands to mush and mix these ingredients together until well combined.*Add the meat mixture to a loaf pan. Pat the meat down into an even layer.In a small bowl, add 1/4 cup ketchup, the brown sugar, and vinegar. Stir to combine. Pour the sauce on top of the meatloaf and spread it into an even layer.Bake uncovered for 55 minutes.Let the meatloaf rest for 8-10 minutes before serving (or it may fall apart).**Notes*Be sure to mix the meat really well.  This is a very moist meatloaf recipe so under mixing can cause the meatloaf to be too soft/mushy. **I use two thin spatulas to remove the meatloaf from the pan and transfer it to a cutting board. You could also slice and serve the meatloaf directly from the loaf pan, or use parchment paper to line the pan for easy removal.NutritionServing: 1/10th of the meatloaf | Calories: 164kcal | Carbohydrates: 14.8g | Protein: 11.7g | Fat: 5.7g | Saturated Fat: 2.2g | Cholesterol: 49.9mg | Sodium: 399.3mg | Fiber: 0.6g | Sugar: 6.7goh and I think the game is ok too."

Vehicle upgrades can change the sound of the cars entirely which I really enjoy. Replay-ability is off the charts no matter what you decide to do. Whether you are cruising across the MASSIVE map looking for XP boards or doing as many races as possible you will NOT get bored of this game.Cons:    Online play is somewhat buggy. When trying to play with friends one of the players usually disconnects after every race and will have to rejoin the convoy. Sometimes it can work flawlessly other times it just simply will not function correctly. Game crashes when the intro cutscene starts that showcases you and your friend's cars which is very annoying. Another thing to note is when you do convoy up with a friend and want to go explore the open world one of two things can happen. 1. Friend can drive up to you and then will completely vanish (or disconnect)2. You and friend can be cruising on a road perfectly normal but one may disconnect and will be sent either into offline mode or into another world itself where other friend is not present.Final Conclusion:     Pros outweigh the cons drastically. If you are searching for a fun racing game look no further! Very addicting will be hard to stop playing. If you like to play alone this game will exceed your expectations. When the online features do work you and a friend will have tons of fun racing with or against one another. If the constant disconnects get fixed in a future update this game easily will be a 10/10, but for the reasons stated above, STRONG 9/10.If you ain't first, you're last!"

Even tho FH4 already had stunning Graphics, FH5 took another huge step towards realism. Thx to raytracing you have even sharper, even cleaner and even more realistic looking reflections and shadows. Next to graphics, they also made the engines sound absolutely amazing + the sound changes slightly, when you install certain parts. When it comes to the map: its way bigger then the one in FH4 and features a lot more long straights, fun offroad tracks, small towns, a stadium, a bunch of festivals instead of only having one, a few dragstrips and some amazing, diverse landscaping.There are a few things tho, that still need to be patched and those are: the game sometimes crashes, when installing certain body-modifications to a car, the textures often bug out (mainly the roads), there often are connection issues, especially when playing with friends and lastly your car sometimes just randomly stops.Besides those few issues, that by no means make this game unplayable, i think this is one of the best games ive ever played. it never gets boring and they didnt even publish the DLCs yet. I'm sure, that they will soon release a major patch, that fixes most of these minor problems and makes the game even better!"

4349,True Neutral,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_True_Neutral/,1,,1,145.2,November,"16,",511,0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 is another excellent addition to the Forza Horizon series, one of the best racing franchises if not the best at the moment. Forza Horizon 5 is a great game to both car enthusiasts and people who don't know a whole lot about them alike, with lots of car variety and customization, it's one of the most diverse car games I've ever played. You can race any car on any track, with any ruleset, alone or with friends, and it helps that it has quite a lot of tracks too, with a track creating tool for the community to make even more, which brings me to another thing this game does nicely: Community interaction. Players have the option to create tracks, tunes, game modes, liveries, snap photographs and share it all with other players online, being rewarded in game if your creation is popular with others. You have the option to interact with random people you find driving about in FH5's open world, give and receive cars to and from random players, and there are a few official online modes which you can play to compete or cooperate directly with people online in a series of races, challenges and minigames. So if you like games that are heavily based around their communities, this one does that really well.The driving itself is Forza Horizon standard, it's arcade, but not Need For Speed levels of insanity. Physics kind of works like it should, real racing knowledge will help you in this game, but don't expect Assetto Corsa or Project Cars levels of simulation. It's not a simulator, and it's for the best.Graphically the game is beautiful. Cars look amazing and the scenery helps too. Some talented people take amazing photos using the game's photo mode and share them online, and I can kind of lose myself for a moment seeing what each player has to share in the photo gallery.The AI is a bit disappointing to be honest, with the harder difficulties seemingly not abiding by the same rules that player cars do, and they usually ram you or suddenly brake, resulting in collisions that may or may not affect your race.The soundtrack is good, it's a nice selection of songs, although I haven't heard too many as I find myself focusing more on the sounds of the cars and listen mostly to one radio station (Horizon Pulse).It's not without its problems though. Technically it could be better, and seems it had a bit of a rough launch. It crashed randomly a few times for me, and some friends had to look for a few workarounds to get the game to launch properly. The FPS seems to heavily drop after some gameplay time too for what seems to be no reason, since it runs pretty smoothly otherwise. At launch at least the servers are a bit problematic. You'll get disconnected often, friends and other players will suddenly vanish in free-roam sessions, and I've been actually disconnected from a race once. But there were a few messages in-game telling us a hotfix addressing these issues is coming, so here's hoping it gets better.But in general, the game's a lot of fun. It reignited my passion for cars a bit, and playing together with friends, experimenting different races with different cars, making ridiculous upgrades on otherwise non-viable cars, having fun odd run-ins with players in free-roam, and all around just having fun in Horizon Mexico really makes this game worth it in my opinion. And it will probably get better with updates or so I hope. I really think this is the game to play if you're looking for racing games right now.Forza Horizon 5 does what it wants to do really well, and a few technical hiccups aside, it's really some of the best car action the gaming industry has to offer. If I had to rate it, I'd give it a 9/10.I hope those who bought it are having as much fun as I am, cruising around Mexico with my friends in all kinds of cars. Here's to another successful Horizon festival."
4350,Aromalliv,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198870831393/,1,,1,189.0,November,"16,",32,0,1,"This is my first Forza game, like FIRST FIRST. I must say that I expected a lot due to the hype that surrounds it. I even bought Premium because I was so excited to see what this game has to offer. But...it was okay, not really that great but it's still a good game. I enjoy it, I'm having fun driving my dream cars, and just going crazy in this game.But there are some stuffs that I also hate, such as tuning cars (It's on me, I didn't do a thorough research about this and like I said this is my FIRST Forza game). Tuning cars takes me more than 15mins to properly tune a car which is a waste of time. Like I just want to race, not play a Mechanic Simulator. But I guess that's the reason why Forza is different than the other racing games. So yeah, this tuning part is still good, just hate it a little.This Premium stuffs, does not feel like Premium. The cars that comes with the Premium are garbage. Like literally. I feel like I can get those cars even if I just buy the Standard edition.Another thing I hate is the lack of customization, I am talking about the spoilers, skirts, bumpers, and stuffs. Like why can't I customize my exhaust? My hood? And why are so little options? Maybe I just have to download Need for Speed if I want customizations. Maybe it's just me? This is my first Forza game so I expected a lot and didn't really know much about this game. Also, add more cars. Why is there only 1 car in Infiniti? Why just add a Q60? What about the G35, G37, and Q50? You guys added a Veloster soooo where is the Genesis? Tiburon? Also, where is the widebody Charger? Where is the Camaro Iroc, I know that there's a Pontiac that looks like one. I know there are more than 500 cars in the game, half of it are old and ugly...so who want to drive those old and raggedy looking cars?Maybe it's because it's only been the 2nd week since its release? So I guess I just gotta wait. But yeah, all in all. This a good game, still gonna keep playing it to get better at tuning lol. Just please, add more options when customizing the looks of the vehicle. Still want to say great job to the people who made this game tho, thank you for all your hardwork. I give this game an 8/10. Still love the game tho and because of this game, I have learned that I should do an in-depth research about a game before buying it."

It’s also an extremely accessible buffet of racing spectacle open to everyone, from Deluxe Edition diehards to Game Pass nomads – no matter their driving skill or mechanical knowledge. It’s an occasionally goofy but always earnest Valentine to Mexico’s world-famous culture, and a romantic ode to the magic of road-tripping through postcard-perfect vacation vistas. It’s a long haul, MMO-inspired racer that’s exploding with more races, activities, and event types than can comfortably fit on some parts of the map – and yet it still always feels relaxed rather than daunting. It never locks you into something you don’t want to do and steadily rewards you for however you choose to play it. It looks beautiful, it sounds magnificent, and it is glorious to play. Yes, Forza Horizon 5 is a lot of things. Above all, however, it is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game I’ve ever played.MASTERPIECE 10/10Forza Horizon 5 is the result of a racing studio at the peak of its craft and the best open-world racing game available."

It is a great game with a beautiful landscape and amazing graphics. Except mountains and stuff in the distance look bad even if you are on a High-End system like me playing on 1440p/4K at High/Ultra/Extreme.There is lots to do and many cars. I mostly drive around.The game had it's issues at launch; bugs, glitches/exploits and online issues, however many have been resolved. No problems as of rewriting this review.Plays well with steering wheel, although 1st person view the steering wheel barely moves, it just doesn't add up to how much you are actually steering. It should turn as far as your steering wheel does. Is it the best Forza Horizon game to date?Depends. This is personal preference of course, but in many ways Forza Horizon 3 is better than Forza Horizon 5, and vice versa. One thing that is better in FH3 is the map. FH3's map is beautiful and has many different areas to explore, including; jungles, deserts, and a big city, and a few smaller towns, FH5 on the other hand has a beautiful big map, which is good, the size is better than every other Forza Horizon game, but I don't like the city, it's boring and kinda sucks. I also feel like I'm driving the same places most of the time, which I didn't really feel like I was in FH3.FH5 has a good long and straight highway (unlike FH4, that one really sucked). Customization still SUCKS, hire some people from the NFS team or something, even the Crew 2 is better at customizing, and the Crew 2 sucks as a car game, arcade or not, and is okay at anything else. NFS also sucks lately with weird unrealistic handling and so on, but at least they got customization and not Forza Aero, even the new FM8 struggles with this... ""lots of customization"" (continues to show Forza Aero).Both expansion packs have come out. Personally I'm once again disappointed. Forza Horizon DLCs almost always sucks. We got Hot Wheels (again) and I didn't even touch it since I don't care about it, but I do however care about spending 100$ on this game knowing the game will be good, but merely hoping for the DLCs to be good, and what do I get? Hot Wheels again... To be fair I sort of liked the FH3 Hot Wheels DLC, I played it a bit, but I was also a kid back then, so I can see why they chose what they chose, but just like with most cars that get added in to the game they just do the same all over again. There are minus points for adding in cars as ""new content"" that were in the previous game... they ALWAYS do, but the new RS6, M3, Koenigsegg CCX and CC850S, Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport, and perhaps some more normal cars like Audi A4, A6 and BMW 3-series? No. There isn't Alfa Romeo in the game either, huge disappointment.Latest DLC is the rally DLC... if I want rally I'd go play Dirt 5... this doesn't even interest kids like Hot Wheels and Lego does. It's just a boring low effort DLC for a game that isn't a rally game, yes you can offroad, but it still isn't a rally game in any way. Do better Forza Devs.I literally could of bought Dirt 5 on sale if I just bought the Standard or Deluxe Edition of FH5 at launch anyways.It was worth full price at launch, now only buy on sale, and unless you want the DLCs because they seem good to you or if you only want that Hennesey Venom F5 you get from owning Hot Wheels DLC then get Ultimate Edition, if not buy Deluxe Edition for car pass and some other stuff. Recommended buy on sale (50% or better).I'd expect Forza Horizon 6 in autumn 2024.Awards: - Most anticipated game award at E3- Steam Awards 2021 | Outstanding Visual StyleMetacritic: 92"

Everything is littered with western stuff and copies thereof.However, theres still alot of issues I personally find to be really annoying.- bots are still stupid op- memory leak is still a pretty glaring issue- not enough older JDM cars- cant remove barn find vehicles- the map gets boring real quick- graphical issues where artifacts keep popping in and out of existence are still happening from time to time, even with updated drivers.+ going up and down the mountain pass road doesnt get old.I've alot more issues I could list but i'll stop at this. It is ultimately a better game than what it was on release, but I cannot from the bottom of my heart reccomend this if youre looking for random social interactions, unless you find a group online, on discord, or if your friends could join you for a drive and races, your fun is not gonna last long.FH4 still has better map design imo, much more verticality, variation, and the dirt roads there are incredibly superior."

4479,Silento,https://steamcommunity.com/id/icegod48/,1,,1,109.1,November,"14,",41,0,1,"The game's graphics are fantastic, in my opinion the best graphics in any racing game, performance and handling is great, they sounds of the vehicles have also improved drastically. Campaign is decent, the variety of cars is good and the challenges are fun. However every new game comes with it's bugs, and on this game the bugs are quite annoying.Multiplayer connectivity is terrible, people randomly disappear and reappear, you get randomly disconnected from online serversThe eliminator  - finding servers sometimes takes a bit of time, most of the time the players disappear out of the map and if you get lucky to see them in the game without the help of the map you can't even challenge them. There's this bug where you race a player and you get to the finish line, but the actual finish line is nowhere to be found, so you just wait for the time to be over and you get kicked out immediately along with your rivalGAME CRASHES - the most annoying part of this game are the random crashes, it also doesn't tell you the reason for the crash. DO NOT put wide tires and a wide kit on the car because your game will crash (not on every car), don't try to remove your body kit because it will also crash your game, sometimes even when you're trying to change the grip of your tires crashes your game. There are a lot of unpleasant crashes that ruin the experienceStarting up game - When i'm starting my game (big picture) in the menu I have to alt + tab in order for my game to load.Some retro super cars have an outdated look, as far as I know the supra has a manual gearbox, so is the r33, the guy just holds his steering wheel while changing gears, but that's just a tiny problem and it's nowhere near as problematic as the other problems I've have addressed. The good thing is that i'm expecting the devs to fix all of these issues. I'm not gonna bother crying about the goliath or the taycan glitch, because they're just fun and some people don't have the time to grind the game all day and just wanna get the cars they desire. Although these bugs could be annoying at some points, if you try to avoid them, the game is really fun and enjoyable."

I played a bit of Forza Horizon 4, but this one really nails the formula. There is so much customization, so many events, and it has some amazing cars. Progression is great and makes you feel rewarded no matter what you do. It is a game I can recommend easily simply because it gives you dopamine no matter what you choose to do. Forza Horizon 5 is a game that just wants you to have fun, no matter what you do, and I can easily say it nails that mission. From the Horizon Events that have you racing literal airplanes, just down to the XP signs and exploration, Horizon 5 just gives you happy juice no matter what. And its community has made some absolutely jaw-dropping car designs and vinyls that you can download and enjoy on your favorite cars. The amount of cars is staggering also, and the game is extremely generous when handing them out. By the first hour, you will have amassed some beautiful cars and that is just the beginning. There is much to unlock.The design editor is also extremely robust and friendly. There are many tools to get your car looking the way you want. Even if you aren't good at creating vinyl groups, you can download pre-made ones from the community and put them on any car you want. It is truly amazing just how much content there is in just customizing your cars appearance, and that doesn't even cover the absolute maddeningly detailed tuning system. Plus, if you do want to customize your car, it is extremely easy to understand and use, but an extraordinarily powerful tool if you master it.Finally the graphics. There is not much to say other than this game is the definition of paradise on earth. So many beautiful locations to explore. From mystic waterfalls, down to arid desert regions, to beautiful beaches, and deep into lush, rainy jungles. Forza Horizon 5 is a game that will make you step on the brakes and just marvel at its beauty, which is only enhanced by some impressive rain and dust storms.As for performance, for me performance has been buttery smooth. However, your mileage may vary based on reviews I have read, but to me this game is extremely well optimized and can maintain a smooth 60FPS easily without issues on the absolute highest graphics settings, RTX enabled. Never once have I encountered frame drops or chugging, nor have I crashed once. For a game as large as this, with this many cars and detailed environments, it is almost magical how this game can run so smooth. The developers at Playground Games are absolute wizard when it comes to optimization. My only gripe with this game comes down to monitization. As you can see on the Steam page, there is a VIP pass, a season pass, and a car pass. The Forza series is known for having some pretty bad monitization, but this isn't really an issue here in my opinion. I bought just the regular edition of Forza Horizon 5, and so far, there has been no reason to buy the car pass or VIP pass. All of the cars you get with the Car Pass can be obtained in the game pretty easily without hours of grinding. Leveling up is also extremely fair and you will be getting a new car probably every 40 minutes to an hour. There's also no way to purchase Wheelspins with real money, which is always a plus. This game may have monitization, but considering how much content is there, and the fact they don't let you purchase Wheelspins with real money is a massive win to me. Even if you aren't a racing game fan, I still recommend you check it out. You may be surprised just how approachable this game is and how addictive it can be. There is so much accessibility for everyone, and it is nice to have a game that just rewards you for doing stuff you want to do.  You will never struggle with what to do because everything you do in this game is rewarding, satisfying and fun. It is a game I am glad I paid $60 for and have no buyer's remorse, unlike with a lot of other games that came out this mouth.Give Forza Horizon 5 a go, and enjoy the absolute happiness this game will give you. And just remember, if you are not sure what to do, just hit the accelerator. You'll find your way to something truly satisfying on the horizon."

This is crazy. I have never seen a game launch this broken and the developer delay the hotfix for this long. Me and my friends cant even drive together because of the dissapearing bug that is affecting EVERYONE.Falls short of what I excepted as a next step in the franchise. Especially considering the time gap from FH4.I love the horizon series, but with every new release it seems as if the game is progressing at a shockingly low pace for things that fans have been asking for since FH2... We are getting the bare minimum solely for marketing material to get us to come back and buy the game.-  (suprisingly poor collection considering they added them last series. Alot of us were expecting much more selection this year, but no)- (definitely an awesome feature, but in its current state no one that plays my blueprints gets to see any objects I place allowing them to bypass ramps, etc... broken)-  (This map has a few incredible mountain roads)-  (really cool, but why cant we just change it to whatever width we like for every car. not certain widths only on certain cars? This is something need for speed has had for YEARS)- -  for things like stance cars. Allow full range track width adjustment and more camber options for a start. - . We already have player owned houses. How about being able to walk through your own garage/house to see your car collection / current car? We could upgrade the garage by buying a more expensive house, lots of possibilites here. I really really hope this is something that is integrated within this series eventually. Game changer. - - . Even just changing the color of the main stiching or leather would be enough. As someone who plays first person most of the time this really bothers me.-  Why is it that we have a general wing that fits on every car yet its literally the exact same wing design? Why not add a few variations that we can choose from? This cant be that difficult. Being a car guy and knowing car people that love this game we all absolutely despite the look of the ebay style forza wing. Please give us more general wing options for each car.- . I cant be the only one that finds it super ironic that the picture for the livery editor features a car with a livery you cant actually replicate in the game? (Windshield stickers all over it)- . Ability to change things like burble and backfire amount in the tuning section. - . I myself know how to tune cars but the fact that the tuning menu has looked identical for the past 5 games bothers me. It desperately needs a tutorial or easier interaction for new players that are terrified by it and don't know how to properly do anything that could be necessary when creating something like a drift car.- . But I feel as though this games map does a good job-  not my cup of tea but should be an incredibly easy feature to add.- . The cities in all games have felt extrodinarily lifeless and need some sort of crowds (that obviously jump out of the way if you try to hit them like in past racing games to keep it rated E). - . We have so many options to customize our character yet we cant even go anywhere? We already have drone and photo mode which means that walking around in first person is extremely possible. This would be great for things like online car meets. Not a must but would be a great feature. - . For a game that constantly shoves us offroad and presents us with these cool new offroad vehicles and trucks. The rock and object climbing physics are laughably bad. Its almost like the suspension model or hit box model itself is just completely broken. And there are definitely things i'm missing on both sides. The games current network connectivity problems make it unplayable with friends unless you are strictly doing races. I hope the day one patch fixes all issues and brings it back to the okay game it should be. - Great graphics- Decent races- Great mountain roads- Beautiful Map- Lifeless Cities- Badly rubber banding drivatars. Worse than any other previous Forza. Dont set difficulty to expert otherwise they will magically gain 500 hp in a straight line even though you're in the exact same car.- Loads of network problems"

What's also interesting, there will be 2 more additional maps to this game that will release on a later date or so i have heard. My first reaction was: How? that's insane!!The car sounds in general (meaning i'm saying this with caution) are so much better if not perfection compared to Horizon 4.The environment sounds are also beefed up and on top of that, all the little details like blow off valves turbo whistling ect. are spot on!Honestly i can't put this game down!!---- However, like with previous Horizon games (i think), Horizon 5 also comes with its little bug's like the Connection lost errorand a new one which can happen randomly is; your car while driving can suddenly reset? meaning, if you are doing a skill combo or driving at insane speeds, your car will re-spawn in roughly the same location and your skill combo will be gone.Frustrating? i know. Hopefully the developers are working on either of these bugs so we can enjoy a smoother game-play in the future. ----The above described issues have been fixed with the newest update AND MOREthis update rolled out on November the 18th.you can read all about it on their official twitter page or do a google search.** i can confirm the game is running butter smooth for me now **when someone reads this short review and hasn't bought the game yet..if anything, buy the ultimate edition and you won't be disappointed.cheers*EDIT*: Ofcourse once the bug(s) are dealt with -as in fixed, i will automatically update my small review. But for now i think people should know this information before they buy the game.there might be other bug(s) or error(s) that i haven't experienced yet or never will experience (hopefully) *so please keep that in mind*!!For now though, lets enjoy this wonderful game together shall we?"

4597,kilésengati,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kilesengati/,2,,0,330.9,November,"12,",560,0,1,"Overall, it's a good game - more of ! The map is larger, more detailed and delivers more variety. I've never been to Mexico, but this is what I expect to be an idealised version of smalltown Mexico to be. There are less cars than in FH4, but I assume more will be added back in again as the game progresses over time. When it comes to game modes, some things got changed-up a bit, but it's a slight step-down as it currently lacks ranked modes.The game suffers from many technical issues a game of that price shouldn't upon release. I mainly noticed connectivity issues mostly in freeroam as well as sudden weather changes during races and lighting issues in caves and tunnels. The latter two are of cosmetic nature, but the former is seriously hampering freeroam playability. Again, it's a great game, but for its price it's only fair to expect a flawless and feature-complete experience, which FH5 in its current state doesn't achieve. No matter how prevelent the practice of releasing unpolished titles is within the industry, it's always a reason for a thumbs down - especially when the game comes from big developers and publishers.Speaking about achieving things: Some achievements within the creative section are locked behind ridiculously high download and upvote numbers, which means they are quite possibly unachievable unless you are an influencer or doing elaborate and possibly legally questionable anime and replica liveries. But hey, life is just a big algorithmic lottery⸮This must be the brainchild of some alien lizardmen only knowing office culture and social media. Thinking more about it, the thing with forced online interaction got worse since FH4. Humans like forced interaction, don't they‽ 👽🖖"

The dialog is pretty cheesy and annoying, not quite to the levels of need for speed but damn close. The driving mechanics are great, and Forza set the bar pretty high with Horizon 4, but for some reason the feel is just better in this game, like I have so much more control of the car and more grip. The Graphics (if your card can keep up) are pretty impressive as well. Overall a decent game that I have enjoyed so far."

But they need to fix some pretty glaring bugs, such as the game randomly crashing the moment that I load into a race. Doesn't happen all the time, but happens way too often.Update: most bugs have been fixed and the game is way better for it. I now really only wish that they would add more one-off versions of cars like the Senna and P1. We really should get the GTR versions of those as well as the super rare versions of other cars that are already in the game. I also hope they work on some of the engine sounds, some of them are clearly computer generated and definitely not recorded from a real car. Although most stock exhaust systems do appear to be real recordings of the real car. One last thing, and I know it may not apply to a large portion of the player-base, but it does effect me, PLEASE for the love of god make it so that the game works with the RPM lights on my Logitech G923 wheel! I'm really just nit-picking at this point, but it really is a great game and if these things got fixed, it would be that much closer to perfection! I really do stand behind this game and think that anyone considering it should try it!"

The biggest and most detailed map they've created to date with some of the most breathtaking visuals you could have in a game period. The cars look and sound fantastic and are an absolute joy to drive. The game's library of cars is extremely large with over 500 to choose from! I'm sure your dream/favourite cars are there. The story is also really fun and the most interactive one they've made so far with separate Festivals each unlocking their own types of races.The only thing that I'm even remotely unsatisfied with would be the technical side of the game. There are a handful of bugs (Which I'm sure will be flattened out in the near future) but the one thing I think they've messed up with, would be the way they've handled the online free roam. Your friends/convoy will disappear quite frequently so if you drive around with friends or like to drift with friends and other people this tends to break the flow.That being said, this game is an visual masterpiece with a humongous map to explore, has plenty of activities for you to take on and will have you driving around in Mexico smiling all the way. I highly recommend this game to everyone!!"
4662,Meihem,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theyhavefood/,1,,1,168.2,November,"11,",142,0,1,"There is no progression in this game. There are hundreds of cars, and the only way to make that manageable for the average player is to make it plenty easy to collect cars. It is no challenge to collect cars, and because of the wheelspins and stuff there is no point in racing for money.That being said, most of the fun that I have had in this game isn't about getting the best and fastest cars, but about trying many of the cars in the game and customizing them and racing with them. It's definitely a sort of make your own fun type of experience. Racing in a 2002 Honda Civic isn't everyone's idea of cool, but to me it's pretty cool to be able to mod and paint cars how I want and be able to get them up to snuff with higher classes.Especially if you love retro or classic cars, there's a ton of them in this game and you can customize races to be just cars from a certain decade or whatever. This game has a lot of customization, for cars and race events, and the Unbeatable AI isn't too bad, but you will be beating it if you use meta cars.Which there are meta cars, its no secret. I think using the same car every race defeats the purpose of having almost 500 cars in the game, but it's a reason to avoid online Horizon Open S2 races especially.Not to mention the game looks and plays wonderfully"

No more weird cutscenes of mute person staring at speaker.Improved character customisation: Not only there's more but now you can actually buy common stuff and more rare pieces are achievement rewards or wheelspin rewards.Gigantic and nicely detailed map.If you liked FH3 or FH4 you are going to love this game.

I had some initial trouble with crashing repeatedly in the intro, but I eventually figured out it was a piece of recording software running in the background that I had forgotten about. After that I lost my progress because I was not linked to my Xbox account during a session. Its alright, but not as good as it could be. I had set my expectations to fh3 levels, but this is closer to the previous game in terms of play time and story. I disliked the lack of classic cars, especially European classics. after playing a bit and having saved some credits, I took a look in the shop to be greeted by no Alfa Romeos, Fiats, Lancias, and very few older porches or British roadsters. They supplemented this largely with new models alongside truly enormous amounts of american muscle cars to bump up the total, and I'm not a huge fan. they also removed the handy ""upgrade heroes"" tab, which I found rather pointless. Now its harder to tell which cars have or do not have body kits and major visual upgrades, despite this being featured prominently in forza's promotional content. There isn't enough room on this review for the bugs, but the official bug report page is hundreds of items long. One in particular has been rather annoying, a visual bug that makes the game look like its rendered in much lower res textures than in reality. trees look like brown sticks with some green spikes on top, grass disappears entirely, and hills are shaped of play-dough. overall, this game could be a lot better if they iron out the bugs and cater to a larger audience of enthusiasts."
4699,diegofkda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/diegofkda/,1,,1,152.3,November,"11,",27,0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 has been so far all I can honestly ask from an open-world racing game. A fully featured, diverse and gorgeous map, top-tier sound system, incredible graphics... And the list goes on. Playground Games decided to take an extra year developing a Horizon game, and it really shows. The physics improvement is no joke, I've been driving with a steering wheel and the experience has been incredible. The story is actually compelling (within Forza parameters, it is no Last of Us). It is also far from perfect; some bugs took over the release, and some details from FH4 went missing, like the glowing red brake discs when you brake, or the paddle-shift animation. But the physics, the improvement in force-feedback and the overhaul of the Horizon story all make up for it.As a fellow simracer and a gamer, I can confidently say that Forza Horizon 5 is a decent simcade, a great game and simply, the best car open-world title to date. If you're broke, maybe wait for a sale. If you have 60 bucks laying around that you would otherwise spend on gifting Nitro subscriptions to e-girls, use the money to seek therapy. If you are already too broken inside and you have no fix, this game would at least allow you to cruise around thinking about what went wrong with your life decisions with incredible graphics. Solid recommend."

I'm able to play it on Extreme setting with Raytracing on High (highest) settings with above 75 FPS average on 1080p (usually sitting in between 70-99 FPS) on my RTX 3060. I've taken some screenshots of the game.I believe the performance of the game can still be improved as there are still random crashes and frequent FPS drops, and I hope that online connectivity gets fixed too.While the soundtrack ain't for everybody, I really liked it, as surprisingly I had some favorite artists and bands present in there (Foo Fighters, DIIV, deadmau5, Porter Robinson to name a few) and Hospital Records... man that drum and bass just fits well.I would've given this game a perfect 10, if not for the bugs present.

Something about how they present the content and the blend of sim/arcade racing makes it significantly more ""fun"" than most other racing games are.  I appreciate the somewhat light-hearted approach and silly, over-the-top set-piece story missions and everything, as well as the fact that it's always a tent-pole game as far as graphics are concerned.FH5 is no exception -- it takes the already lush and gorgeous visuals from FH4 and amps them up even higher, adding RTX support and a significant expansion in draw distance and landscape design.  Running on a current gen GPU, you should be able to get 4k/HDR@>60fps with ultra quality settings with no issues -- I'm on an i9-10900k with a 3080Ti and the game absolutely _smokes_ in 4K on the hardware -- even at 2x MSAA with RTX on high I'm averaging above 70fps.  A lot of work has been done to ensure  consistent frame-pacing as well.Oh, plus it has the Warthog from Halo and the Delorean DMC-12, so it gets an additional gold star.A lot of people have had issues with the online, but outside of a couple disconnects here or there throughout the 10 hours or so I've been playing, I haven't had any real issues."

4741,bot.døc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/doctorasu/,1,,1,160.8,November,"10,",72,0,1,"[REVIEW UPDATED]After discovering Forza Horizon 4 last year (shame on me I was so late to the party) and loved it, I told myself that as soon as FH5 will be available, I will buy it. And I did it. I even preordered it so I can download it early to play ASAP. Full price on Steam, 60 Euros. Told myself that if it will be at least as good as FH4, it will worth every cent. Long story short, it's not...yet!So I entered in a beautiful game with nice graphics and great music just to find a sh*t load of bugs. 2 weeks passing (meanwhile players abusing all kinds of bugs to jump the leaderboard) and the first big bugfix arrives. It made the game a little more ""playable"". At least now the Online part of the game works. After this, small bugfixes arrived with some bugs fixed, but most of them ignored. Now, after 3 months of existence, you would think it addressed most of the game-breaking bugs, right? NO! Here is what is wrong with this game now: 1. Game crashes when you exit the garage. Still no fix after 3 months!2. Stuttering after a time ingame. It appears the game doesn't know how to clear old cache and it burdens the graphics card. Still no fix. 3. The house you buy with 5 million credits to get 1 free daily spin doesn't give you a free spin daily! It gives you a free daily spin when the game wants, if the game wants. 4. THIS IS, FOR ME, THE WORST PART! The Support Team is understaffed/overburdened/ignorant. Hear me out: Last week, after 100+ hours of gameplay, I enter FH5 just to see the intro screen letting me choose a name and with all my progress lost. No cars, no level, no credits, no forza points, nothing. I contacted the Forza Support Team via ticket system, Twitter and Facebook and after 1 week I don't have any answer. Not a single word. And I'm stuck now with 100+ hours of progession lost and I can't just jump into the game and redo all the races, all the achievements, buy all the cars. I just can't. [UPDATE] After 1 week of tickets & messages on social media I've recieved a reply from Support Team. After that, I've deleted the save files, reinstalled the game and waited another 3 days until I've got this message:After that I've recieved 500+ messages on Forza with each car, clothing, horn, forza link and credit I've ever owned. In conclusion, I've lost the level, progression, accolades, car tunes and Forza Points. But I've recovered the cars and the credits. [/b]Note to everybody: BACKUP LOCALLY YOUR SAVEFILES![/b]This game is still full of bugs that MAYBE in the near future will be fixed. Sadly, it is 4 months after the release and they haven't resolved the main bugs.Now, after a year, the game still have issues. But it's ok."

Wait 1 year, maybe it will have solved most of the issues. The game, in it's current state, is about a 7/8 out of 10. It's basically Horizon 4 with improvements to the graphical engine and physics engine. The new location is great, the biomes are outstanding and you have much more freedom than you had in Horizon 4. You don't have to go through a 4-6h tutorial that doesn't allow you to play with friends. After a few introductory races, you can start playing with friends, which brings us to the bad.. connectivity issues. The game right now is plagued by connectivity issues, random disconnects from the servers, alert error messages that don't display anything, friends not being able to play races due to those disconnects.. it's pretty bad, but solvable. There are also issues with memory leaks (which lead to poor performance or crahes), random and not so random crashes (like when changing parts on your car or bodykits multiple times) and texture quality issues when playing the game a bit longer. The other problem in the game is AI, which is infuriating sometimes. If you played Horizon 4 on Unbeatable or Pro difficulty, expect a shock. AI is just cheating, right in front of your eyes, with cars being on rails on higher difficulties, which cheapens your experience. Get ready to play on Highly Skilled difficulty for a time, if you want to win races :).With all being said, i still recommend the game, i enjoy it and i expect that these problems are solved in maybe.. 3 months tops?"

To make clear I am trying to play with a friend which is what causes a lot of the issues so if you plan to play by yourself you will be hit with a lot less issues. Main Issues:Difficult to connect to a convoy (server issues)Once eventually in a convoy it takes ages for friends to join the session (server issues)Once in the session friends cars disappear every 5-15 seconds for between 10 seconds and 5 minutes (server issues)The textures are bugged when on the highest settingsThere are frequent frame rate drops in online sessions (fine in horizon solo)The car will just randomly slam to a holt at times The game has been crashing but not as bad for me as it has been for othersDraw distance is terribleMany LOD issuesAntialiasing doesn't workVIP status is removed quite often but is fixed by tabbing out and tabbing back inThose are the issues I have had however I have read of many more. Sounds like the game doesn't stay open for more than 2 minutes if you have an AMD graphics card or have bought on windows store. I have the Premium Edition edition and haven't been able to make use of many of the advantages to this edition and so therefore I am refunding the game. It feels to me like this game has had very little testing and I feel like I have paid for a Beta. I will more than likely get the game again in the future when it has been fixed but for now I want the money back.

For some people there will be a lot of crashes and to fix them you will have to troubleshoot a lot by yourself. Devs have put a lot of in this game but unfortunately very little to PC port (doesn't matter if its steam or MS)

We now also have a story again,  at least,  much more of one than in the 4th installment.   That said,  it's the intangibles that does it for me.   The game gives an insane sense of accomplishment after you spend the time working out a build, fine tuning the settings therein,  and finally unleash it on to the Rivals leaderboard -  landing yourself a top 1% spot globally out of over 90,000 others just feels great because you know you earned that.   You have to work for it, putting in a flawless lap without any collisions or the like, and this is far easier said than done when you're wrangling 1000+ hp through chicanes, twists and various elevation changes.   The Horizon series leans more into the arcade side of things,  but the simulation roots of the Motorsport series are undeniable - this makes it one of those racers that are easy to pick up, but hard to master."

First ever of its kind. And you paid extra and get to try it before anyone else.. It looks delicious. And your friends came along to enjoy it with you. But it comes out and is half cooked, and the meat on it is still raw and there is some glass in it. You complain. Awhile later, they tell you as long as you remove the meat and glass and dough and sift the rest of it through a strainer, it might still be edible, and they will ""work on"" making you a better one that has a little less glass in it. You do what they suggest, and still inadvertently eat some glass and the raw meat gets bacteria in the wounds, so you get horribly sick as you slowly bleed out from your insides. You die. When did the gaming industry get to a point where releasing something that doesnt work become so normal? In no other industry would something like this fly, who decided it was acceptable?

With it also being the largest map out of all the Horizon games, there's more than enough to explore. Plenty of dirt, asphalt and open land for all the types of races too. It's just very fun to drive around in this game, as there aren't random patches of 1 inch piles of rocks that'll dead stop you.I'm not really too much of a car nerd, but the fact we have 500+ cars means there's definitely a car or few that'll appeal to your tastes, and still has that ridiculous Forza customization where you can slap a V12 into a El Camino. If you're a car collector you'll definitely be busy in this game.Along with performance upgrades with the car, we still have the sort of great vinyl editor, and being able to slap liveries of replica real life cars or probably what half of you reading this are gonna do which is anime girl liveries. We still have 3000 layers to mess with in the vinyl and design editor, which is more than plenty to make amazing things provided you can spare the time to do so. I was hoping there to be more shapes or some kind of improvements to it, but it still works fine as is.Horizon Adventure is the ""story"" of this game. It's how you'll be unlocking the various festival sites, the showcase events, and the extremely long races such as cross country's The Titan or road racing's The Goliath. The initial expeditions are kinda cool, such as the one to unlock road racing events, but good lord the rest of it is a pain in the ass. You have to unlock accolades to progress which is easy enough, but every time you unlock a new thing, the game forcefully stops whatever you're doing in free roam (including breaking skill chains, drift zones, etc.). Not to mention the dialogue, my god. It's not terrible but it's very annoying. It's that usual corporate friendly stuff where they play it safe, and everyone is super friendly and make very poor jokes, with there being barely any effort put into the voice dialogue. What doesn't help is that now YOUR player character talks, with either being british or a woman, those are your ONLY two choices. Not like it matters anyways, once you're done with the Horizon Stories and Adventure, you'll barely hear lick of any dialogue from your character or others, so it almost seems pointless to give your character a voice. Speaking of british, not to meme or anything but if we're in Mexico, why is more than half the cast British?Character customization is also back and it's kind of just whatever? You barely see your character and they barely stand out anyways, the only time where the customization is meaningful is the ported over and EXTREMELY DATED showboating and victory emotes. You know the ones. Hotline Bling dance, dabbing, the WHIP AND NAE NAE. I only found two new ones, and  one that they haven't brought back (like it even matters but it's pretty funny) because of the whole Alfonso Ribeiro dance scare (Carlton Banks from Fresh Prince of Bel Air. Basically he was getting all pissy about Fortnite a few years back having ""his"" dance as a emote so he was saying he was gonna sue and blah blah, but that obviously failed, but it made Microsoft/Playground Games piss their pants and they immediately took the dance out of Horizon 4 for everyone.)The online in this game is how it should've been day 1 in Horizon 4. Free for all, no team racing. It's fun for what it is, as it's pretty much A, S1 and S2 open class racing which are the popular classes (B class if you're doing dirt and cross country). However it's saddening once again the D, C, and B classes are ignored because of this, which will make a good portion of the cars useless as even upgraded to at least A class they won't perform well in that category. Though in the Playground Games online events, it could go as low as C class. It's odd with the choices they made, but then again they also took out map voting and vetoing in Halo so it seems every developer under Microsoft makes dumb decisions. Personally the car class and race type voting from Horizon 2 and 3 is still the best in my eyes.Going back to the online racing for a moment, they have brought all the improvements from 4 into this game which is for the better such as ghosting a player if a high-speed collision is detected because of a person trying to ram another player, or wall-collision slow down if a player drives too poorly or attempts to use the walls to their advantage.They also have the Eliminator, a battle royale with a car racing twist, which I haven't touched at all since 4 or even now in 5 yet, but it's another free mode and will be fun for a majority of people.Finally there's Horizon Tour which is a team of human players against mediocre drivatars. It's essentially The Trials from Horizon 4, but there's a 2 minute rotation for different kinds of events which I personally find to be a lot of fun since it makes use of the variety of vehicles in this game.Horizon Super 7 returns, a series of 7 player created challenges that you have to go through to get the reward listed in the menu. This mode is hit or miss as it doesn't really give much XP and I'm not sure the rewards reroll daily after you unlock the initial Super Wheelspin or if they refresh each time you fully complete the 7 challenges.The music in this game is pretty good on all fronts except maybe Horizon XS. Pulse and Bass Arena still have some pretty damn good bangers if you're into the music those radio stations offer, and Hospital Records SLAPS. Again I'm bringing up Horizon 4, but Hospital Records in that game was the WEAKEST out of all the games it was featured in. Hospital Records in this game only has one song that I don't really hate but it's kinda eh. (Bandicoot is the one)The last thing which I want to praise highly of is the blueprint and race editor, also known as Eventlabs in this game. If you're familiar with the Grand Theft Auto Online Race Creator, then it's practically this. You can create your own custom routes in the map, such as making your own version of the Goliath. Along with routes, they have various props to get very creative with, such as half pipes, jump pads, and platforms, so you can make really fun and unique courses if your creativity is good enough and you can spare the time! Just be wary that there is some kind of weird thing in the game currently that perhaps if your route is TOO complex with props, like have a lot of them in it, then upon loading the route the game might softlock, but I assume they'll release a patch for this soon.So what's the too long and didn't read final verdict of this game? If you like racing games, this is OBVIOUSLY a must buy. It's the best one since Horizon 3 in my opinion, the map is beautiful, has plenty of variety and the largest one so far. Plenty of cars to choose from with each of them being pleasant to drive. Amazing ways to show your creativity with tuning, designs and eventlab events. Great music and just overall a very good time. If you unsure about your purchase, it is on game pass for at most 10$ for a month. Just be wary that currently if you had previously created vinyls or designs from previous Motorsport or Horizon games and you buy the steam version, they currently can't be ported even if you use the same Microsoft/Xbox account to login."

The game is great, but at the same time there are bugs and false advertisement for support of wheels. I have to give a recommended No for now because I really wanted to play this with a wheel. Don't advertise support for something that isn't supported and working. At least announce that you are working on the inclusion / support of it. The bugs feel minor to my experience once you get over the initial crashing due to antivirus or other things particular to your PC setup.EDIT:Wheel is now working because the disconnect issue is fixed. My Logitech 923PS is working with stock settings and its easy to just change the steering range to how you feel fit. I'm really enjoying the game now. I've changed my review to positive due to the fixes. This was one of the main issues why I got the game and I'm happy I can finally enjoy it.EDIT:Game is still fun, but I'm experiencing either hackers or bugs. I'm not seeing anyone in eliminator, but I'm getting challenged and always lose when near the finish line. I'm getting challenged with no one near me. I'm also having issues where Horizon Arcade isn't counting for season achievements. Both of these are really annoying when trying to do the season activities to get points for season cars."

4869,Wet Noodle,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057990010/,1,,0,126.4,November,"10,",284,0,1,"It's Forza Horizon. If you liked 4, you'll like this one. The graphics are amazing but there are a lot of issues, both technically and with the core gameplay.New tire smoke physics are pretty good, especially if you're drifting. You can tell they put a lot more effort into drifting in this vs FH4. They also added some other cool customization like more tires (slicks vs semi-slicks) and transmissions (can now choose between 6 speed, 7 speed, all the way to 10). Nothing groundbreaking but a welcome improvement so your 1,500 hp Geo Metro or whatever is actually driveable. One glaring issue is the Driviatars, which need a serious adjustment. They've always been kinda screwy: difficulty level doesn't change the AI behaviors, it just allows them to cheat more and break the in game physics. That's always been the case but, for the most part, it still worked. In FH5, however, it's the worst I've ever seen it. On some races, the Unbeatable drivatars are literally unbeatable while other races, Unbeatable drivatars drive like children. Rubber banding is also more of an issue. Go ahead and set the difficulty to anything Expert or above and get in 3rd and about 1-3 seconds behind P2; you'll notice that P1 and P2 will start breaking physics and just fly ahead until they're literally 5-10 seconds ahead of you in a 3 minute race. It's pretty ridiculous when I have to tune the difficulty on a race-to-race basis because the devs screwed it up that much.I also don't really like the music in this one. There's a couple of good tracks but Pulse is just bad. I hear the same 3 songs the majority of the time and they're songs that literally repeat the same stanza 20 times over their 2 1/2 minute duration. It's not a huge problem, just kinda disappointing. It will occasionally repeat a song that it just had on as well. The music should pump me up, not annoy me.The ""tuning"" for a lot of other things seems a bit off as well. PR stunts like drift zones and speed zones have gotten a lot easier than FH4, on average. A lot of the challenges (the story ones that show up as yellow on your map) have gotten pretty easy too. With a few outliers, I've managed to get three stars on my first try for most of the PR stunts and story challenges I've done without even trying that hard (and I'm alright, but not THAT good). Online racing is also terrible. The ghosting mechanics are outright broken and make it so that clean racing is basically impossible. The only viable strat to actually win is to pump as much HP and an AWD drivetrain into a car and just rubber band your throttle trigger/pedal down for the whole race. Basically no punishment for taking people out so someone can ram you off course, make you miss a checkpoint and lose like 5-7 seconds while they just go on their merry way with no punishment whatsoever. It's a joke. Between the AI and online experience, they may as well classify this game as a demolition derby. They also removed any kind of ability to choose what kind of race you want to do unless you're already in a Convoy which, again, don't work. So if you really liked A class street racing in FH4, get ready to wait up to an hour to get into a session with 3 races and half the time, you join and it's already half done. Load times are also insanely long a lot of the time, minimum 3-5 minute wait before your next race and I've had a couple where it was literally loading for around 12 minutes before we got to the next race. I really can't see why any dev would remove the choice of what kind of race you'd like to matchmake for and the networking is truly awful for a AAA game. Also, as per usual in FH games, the fact that you can't set parameters for races, 90% of events in the game come down to whether you've downloaded the tune that most abuses the physics. Very little skill is required to win races in this game, just copy the meta and hold down the gas.Steering wheel settings are atrocious. Not only do you have to remap all the buttons EVERY time you start the game, but it just feels... terrible. And it's not just my opinion, lots of people that I've talked to agree that the steering just feels bad. I can make it through DR2.0 stages with a wheel with relatively little issue, but taking so much as one small turn in a dirt race in FH5 is like pulling teeth. It's like the wheel isn't actually tied to the in game car's wheels, you just turn it to the right and the wheels just kinda go to that position-ish in their own damn time. I've played some relatively realistic sims like project cars 2, DR2.0, and BeamNG.drive. This is by far the worst experience in terms of actually controlling your car.And on top of all of that, they're pretentious enough to make the opening logos of the game unskippable. That's the ultimate pretense, right there. I don't need to see your logo every time your game crashes...So as a person that usually plays single player (since the online is so awful), I can't recommend this game. Really sad cause it's so pretty but I'm only 30 hours in and already getting bored of the game. They took a thing that was a problem in previous Forza games and made it so bad that the game is nigh on unplayable at times and I don't use that word lightly. Barely into the game and I find myself logging in to do 3 races, get frustrated at the terrible AI, wheel mechanics, bugs, and other issues, then log off. I'm kind of astounded that they managed to make almost every part of the game worse (or null improvement) except for the graphics, the map, and some customization options. The most fun I have is in freeroam, driving around the empty world because traffic and other players won't spawn around you if you're online. It's like there was literally zero play testing performed on this game before launch. As a driving game, this can be pretty fun. Lots of different cars, open roads, and it looks great. But as a racing game, this is one of the worst you'll find. Hot wheels and Mario Kart are better racing games than this."

Over the previous game, the major difference is the sounds of the cars and the environment. I cannot quite tell you how good everything sounds, it is something that only you can experience for yourself :)The location for the game is perfect and looks incredibly realistic and detailed. Lots of different areas with character and a majestic aura to them. Its both fun to cruise around and race, whether you race on tarmac, mixed terrain or go offroad. On top of its looks, the game is also very well optimized with tons of settings you can fine tune (including difficulty) to best suit your needs and hardware.Overall, Forza Horizon 5 is a must play for car lovers and racing fans. Simply glorious!"

On the second console of my life, the xbox 360, one of my most played games was Forza Motorsport 4. This was probably due to the fact that I have been a very big car enthusiast since the age of 5 and loved to drive the cars, race and listen to their engines in the virtual world. I have played every single forza game ever since and quickly found myself more interested and immersed in the horizon series, probably because of the open world freedom and the more versatile gameplay. Some would argue the realism of these games, but I believe they always keep a good balance between enjoyable gameplay and realism for hardcore carguys. The weakest entry in the series is probably Horizon 4, but the great gameplay has more or less compensated for the poor sound quality, the extremely forgettable story and the bugs so I wouldn't say Horizon 4 was a bad game. It was just the most forgetabble one. Fortunately I can say that this game is an improvement over previous games and I recommend it."

When I originally saw how paired down the cars list was I thought it wasn't going to be a big deal. Boy how wrong I was. This game feels empty. It feels like a step in the wrong direction. Literally the only difference between this game and FH4 is the increased foliage and new location. It is the exact same friggin game as FH4, just now with unskippable horrible dialogue and cut scenes. I couldn't care any less about this story. Everytime i'm locked in an unskippable cut scene it makes me want to quit the game immediately. This game's  story feels like a fast and furious movie in all the wrong ways. I'll check back in once i've put at least 100 hours into this but this is whole hearted a step in the wrong direction for this franchise. The only upsides to this game is that it seems to be well optimized out of the gate, looks gorgeous and the driving is fun as always. But if you've put a ton of hours in FH4 dont expect anything new except to be more annoyed and bored quicker.Edit: After 140+ hours I still cant recommend this game. It feels like a shell of it's former self with some really questionable stereotyping going on. The driving dynamics are the exact same, yet something feels like its missing. They really missed the mark with this one, I cringe every time I hear the opening menu music."

(Way less rain too). - Great lighting and particle effects graphics. Only graphical complaint I have is there's pop-in and low res textures that can happen rarely, especially when going fast. - Driving feels good, maybe a bit heavy/restrictive considering I have all the assists off, but you can play around with drift cars if you want to fix that. - Payout seems pretty fast.

The opening of the game gives me goosebumps as I drive through forests, sandstorms, jump from a volcano and tear up the highway. Its over the top. The number of cars in the game is a lot. The Horizon games gives you so many cars for free that your collection expands so quickly that you will have a hard time choosing what car to take into a race. New players would like this mechanic. The cars feel very nice to control no complains there. Halo sounds for your car horn, anyone?CONS: The subtitles had an issue when the player speaks (yes, there's dialogue in the game). Whenever the player speaks, the player would be named as the last NPC that interacted with the player. I was like why was Ramiro replying Ramiro in the cutscene turns out it was the player that replied Ramiro. Hope I have explained this clearly. Horizon rewards us with cars so easily that it defeats the purpose of having an Autoshow in the first.Overall, the game is very good for both new players and long time fans of the Forza Horizon series.Last review: As much as I love the franchise, this is rather unexpected and unfortunate. The game keeps crashing during launch and I have no idea how to fix it. Disabling my anti-virus software did not help. I am sorry but its a thumbs down from me for now. Please patch ASAP, cannot wait to tear up Mexico."

4947,你是人间惊鸿客,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sunny25803/,1,,1,60.7,November,"9,",138,0,1,"Forza Horizon5 is the best picture quality game I have ever played. Exquisite texture maps, complex terrain changes, and more details than the previous one.The game's playability is exceedingly high, but it will be a bit boring at the beginning of the game. The map is much larger than Forza Horizon4; the weather system is a point that shocked me. The feel of the vehicle is as good as ever. Through its free adjustment, you can achieve the effect you want to deal with various races.Horizon Pulse’s music is consistent with my music aesthetic as always, and the cover songs are still very local and very pleasing. However, I still found some problems when I was playing, and the frequency of these problems was remarkably high (the latest graphics card driver has been updated):1: The online system is unstable. I still often disconnected under various attempts by me and my friends. Sometimes when looking at other people's cars from my perspective, there will be abnormal movement.2: In single-player mode or online mode, sometimes the speed suddenly drops to zero. The specific conditions for triggering the bug still need more exploration.3: After the HDR mode is turned on, abnormal light and shadow displays will be displayed on the road.4: The Xbox Game Bar cannot be opened normally in the game (it may be my problem), GeForce Experience cannot read the fps value normally.5: When the menu is paused, the handle will sometimes keep vibrating and will not stop.Overall, I still think Forza Horizon5 is an incredibly good game. This game allows me to see the unremitting efforts and challenging work of the R&D team. I am extremely fortunate to be able to play such a beautiful game in my youth."
4948,LiekMudkipz-,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198200904503/,1,,1,59.1,November,"9,",199,0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 is a welcome return to the series! Even after playing every Horizon title I still find myself aimlessly wondering the map for hours on end in my favorite off-road car. You know exactly what to expect as a returning player, and you will be in shock and awe of the amount of content if you're new to the series. The semi-simulation/Arcade like gameplay is a perfect formula that doesn't seem to get old. I can spend hours tuning vehicles to my liking, or I can just pick a pre-set tune made by the community and jump right into whatever it is I want to do. This makes it both fun and interactive for players who want to get the most out of their cars while also providing a simplistic option for more casual players. You are free to progress through the game by following whatever interests you best (be that drifting, street racing, offroading, exploring, etc.). The game can be a little overbearing with how much content it throws at you at once, but if you pick and choose your own personal goals, Horizon 5 can be an absolute playground for you.The graphics alone are drop dead gorgeous! Horizon 5 takes place in a fake Mexico by mashing together different biomes/environments that make for really good eye candy. On the plus side of that, the game is optimized really well to perform a stable and graphically sound experience.Next let's talk cons. The pros definitely outweigh the cons here but they need to be mentioned.1. The game throws an insane amount of cars at your face all at once. While rewards are very much welcome, throwing a new free car at your face every second depreciates the value. While this may be a personal opinion I'd still like to mention it.2. On the PC version I will get random crashes. Out of the 39 hrs playtime I've had about 5 CTDs. Thankfully these were mostly in the menus and not on the road.3. Game UI can be confusing. From scrolling Horizon 5s map to selecting cars in the menu, it can sometimes be difficult to navigate. There's always alot of clutter on screen and while the game does have filters, it can sometimes be a pain to find what you're looking for.And that's my personal review. Overall I give Forza Horizon 5 a solid:9/10"

It may be more of the same in some aspects, but it's definitely a fresh taste on car customisation, feel, and all round experience. Mexico is a great environment for controller play. If you have a steering wheel, it is still a struggle to play anything but street / road racing (Which there is a lack of) without bonkers skill and even then it feels wrong in my opinion, but as a controller or keyboard player it's still better than the previous iterations of Horizon.Overall I recommend it highly but if you are looking for a steering wheel game I'd personally recommend something else."

Before I wrote this I completed a race that took 23 minutes and was balls to the wall through farmlands, jungles and then up a mountain and then down the rocky dirt road side of it. It was so intense that it reminded me of skiing in real life. The controls for each vehicle in this game are out of this world and makes arcade racing enjoyable even for those of us who aren't car freaks or racing gamers. On top of that there are multiplayer races, aracade, battle royale, player created content and so much more. There's so much to do that it can be difficult to decide what to do.

Game starts with a much shorter prologue this time letting you take a few rides for a spin, after which you will create a Playstation 2 generation looking character. Selection assembled from the ugliest goblin like humanoids I have ever seen. Then you can feel direct influence of Kenshi, because you can play as a torso quadputee or you can be ableist and pick to have all limbs. Select your gender/pronouns, as in, male, female or welfare check communist. Unfortunately you will always play as a woman because the game has no selection of facial hair. Tragic, but that is not the worst part, you are forced to be British so not only you play as an annoying hipster, you also sound like an atheist/critic youtuber. This game obviously is an arcade racer, hence not very realistic, game does not involvetrafficking illegal immigrants, smuggling drugs and at no point you get kidnapped by a cartel and get your car stolen. The drone is still kinda useless, it flies so low at that altitude tour balls are still touching theground, wheel spin gatcha is 90% clothes which seem to be lifted directly from a wardrobe ofsomeone who can't start xir day without avocado toast, as well as season objectives nowrequire certain car class and category which is unbelievably annoying. Now, if you manage to get past all that, the game is really fun, map is huge and gorgeous, roster of over 500 cars that you can deck out with weeb garbage, but most importantly it has a winding mountain road on the main map where you can pretend you know how to drift just because you watched Initial D once.Other than that it’s just a Forza Horizon game, if you enjoyed previous games, you’ll enjoy this as well, and if you never played one before, now is as good a time as any, just steel yourself for some high grade cringe."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you"

Forza Horizon 5 provides players more choice and freedom by giving you the option to first focus on whatever subcategory of racing you prefer (for example, I chose to start off by opening the cross-country racing festival, giving me access to all of the cross-country races across Mexico. Similarly, I could've chosen to start off with street racing, track racing, dirt racing, etc). As you progress throughout the game you will continue to unlock and branch out to the other available festival locations/racing subcategories in any order you want until you eventually unlock them all (you are not permanently locked out of content forever, it is simply there so you can focus on what you prefer in the earlier stages of the game). The progression system is balanced extremely well (experience points which progress you to unlocking new festival locations and showcase events/credits to buy new cars and upgrades). It never felt grindy or like I was being overwhelmed with too much content at once. The handling for each of the cars is also excellent (similar to the previous Forza Horizon games) and strikes the perfect balance between not feeling too light like an arcade racer or punishing like a sim racer. Difficulty and assists can be fine tuned to your liking to make your experience easier or more challenging - the less assists/harder AI difficulty you have, the higher your bonus credits % is per race.As you've probably seen from the promotional material, this is an astonishingly beautiful game that looks the same in-game as it does in the trailers. Mexico is jaw-droppingly vast, featuring numerous biomes and variations in altitude from mountainous volcanoes to thick swamps, coastal beaches, woodland forests, dense cities, small towns, rolling sand dunes and agricultural lands - it's a gift that never stops giving. With this graphical fidelity, I was expecting performance to be less than satisfactory, however, I have been pleasantly surprised at how well this game was optimised as I am able to maintain a steady framerate even in the dense city areas. With every single setting pushed to the maximum, I was able to hit a constant 70-90fps at 1080p on an AMD Radeon RX 6800/Ryzen 5 3600XT.Like all other aspects of the game, the audio design is also excellent. I would, however, recommend putting the audio preset to 'car focused' as I personally found the music and GPS voice a bit too loud on the default setting. In saying this, music selection on the different radio stations is also solid for each of their respective genres and the hosts didn't feel too obnoxious or as if they were interrupting the music too much.This is a simply excellent game that I do not see myself putting down anytime soon and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone, even those who tend to stay away from racing games."
4989,sparky_buzzsaw (Cam),https://steamcommunity.com/id/sparky_buzzsaw/,3,1,1,47.0,October,"10,","1,579",0,1,"I feel like something of a broken record when it comes to Forza Horizon. It's a great game, undoubtedly one of the best racers on the market, but for every smart decision, especially in regards to accessibility, one of its biggest draws, there tend to be lots of little moments where things can still be improved.For one, and this has been a problem since the original Forza Horizon, not all the cars are technically feasible in an open world setting. Most of the 4WD and AWD vehicles make sense. But even when the game puts you on a mostly solid surface for a race, the other cars don't feel nearly as manageable, often leading to squirrely driving and fiddly turning that never feels quite as right as proper Forza.As mentioned, accessibility options in Forza Horizon astound me, and they do a great job of continuing that here. You can turn on an option to continue the plot even if you lose a race, meaning the old annoying showcase and new-to-this-series story missions aren't going to frustrate you quite so much with the rubber banding and other FH eye-rollers. But that doesn't change the fact that those problems are still there. Turning assists on during showcase events, for example, ends up being even more difficult somehow than without, because with guided braking and turning, you're not building up the speed to win at the predetermined point near the end of the race. This is the third or fourth game where this is a problem and it's astonishing that it hasn't been addressed. Rubber banding stinks!Then there's the other new event - Trailblazers. I need to screenshot one of these because the checkered flag is impossible for me to see. For one, the icon clutter on the map means the finish line is lost in a sea of other events. The sunny skies and sands of Mexico (which are beautifully rendered in this game, by the way - it's flipping gorgeous) often obscure checkpoints, leaving me wandering or relying on GPS which can't get me to the finish line in time to finish some of the events. When I'm doing an event like this, the clutter needs to go. Some option to turn on color-changing, big splashy checkpoints would be awesome too.One last complaint - that's it, I swear. The music. There's one or two decent songs in the mix, but for the most part, the music is singularly toothless. I can always play other stuff in the background so it's not a serious problem with the game, but this soundtrack makes me feel like I'm driving ten miles an hour (or whatever the British equivalent would be) in bumper-to-bumper traffic in London, not racing through the Mexican desert. My heart should pound, not feel like it's marinating in Nyquil.But apart from that, this is more Forza Horison and that's a very good thing! I like that the protagonist now has a voice, and there's a cheerful exuberance to it all. I hope they lean harder into the history of the cars you're racing and the cultural impact of them, as that's probably the best new addition to the game."

Turns out there is almost no new content; it is 99% the same experience as FH4.  No new cars worth the cost of the game.  The car pass has been a joke; the first car I was looking forward to was just released 1/27 and then the content was bugged, not downloading past the release date and I have yet to drive it.  No groundbreaking or enticing game modes.  PC start menu has bugged out since day one, you can click on an option and nothing happens until you minimize the game and then click back in.  As far as I am concerned this game is a flop, sadly these are only a handful of the issues I've encountered."

The cars a little too easy to get and the game basically dumps every resource at you early on so its not even a challenge to get up the ranks in cars.  The upgrade system is horrible.  Swap an engine into a 1970s Camaro and its automatically S rank.  Do that in reality and the thing would get smoked by a GTR on pump gas.  The driving mechanics are dull.

The prerelease reviews were glowing, so I decided to get the $100 Premium Edition to play the game five days early.Me and thousands, maybe tens of thousands of others haven't been able to get past the Playground Games logo 10-15 seconds after starting the game up. It constantly crashes to desktop. For the first few days, this problem was barely acknowledged at all on the ""problems list"" sent out by the developer. They sent a list of recommendations to do that included disabling Discord, your antivirus, and more. I tried everything except disabling my antivirus (but I did add a folder and .exe exclusion to it) to no avail.For the people who do get in, there's a whole load of problems being reported as well like crashes, constant disconnections, memory leak issues and more.For now I will try to refund this, which is a shame as I was looking forward to this release for months. I'm sure the game, when working for everyone, will be amazing. But I can't recommend it at its current state."

5019,MAD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mad623/,No,,1,166.7,November,"10,",694,0,1,"tl;dr - It's alright. If FH4 has a discount, get that instead.||| Connectivity & Multiplayer |||- Very rare connectivity issues and desyncs.+ Can play with friends faster.||| Car Customization |||- Same stupid visual customization system- You cannot move and stretch a shape, you need to move through menus. Need For Speed has the best customization system and whatever Forza has is the absolute worst. It takes forever to do something with it. - Liveries? It's better to keep them for yourself as you might get banned.||| Player Customization |||- Mostly the same characters for your player as before+ A few new characters- Clothes clip (like pants with boots, for example)- No beards!! Beards do not exist.* * Beards do exist in the form of a white beard and a santa hat. ||| Creating races |||- Good ****** luck creating your own races! Your friends won't see the props, sometimes you won't see the props. If you see the props today that doesn't mean you'll see them tomorrow. - So many issues with the checkpoints, at many times you will miss a checkpoint, all of a sudden! You can, of course, rewind. Wait no, you can't. That also gets bugged! But you can go back and edit the race and the checkpoints. HA. NO. YOU CANNOT DO THAT. Perhaps leaving and going back to some menu to load up the track you just created, that will put you back in the editor. NO, THAT FUNCTION  DOES NOT EXIST!- Want to create a circuit without any waypoints? Guess what happens. You start the race and then after the car runs for 30 meters the race ends! OF COURSE YOU CANNOT GO BACK AND EDIT THE COURSE TO ADD WAYPOINTS.- An absolute terrible mess but in some rare cases, if you just want to race from one point to the other, creating races works. - AI will get confused. Most probably. - Random resets due to checkpoints (even though you didn't miss any)- Time of day and seasons from a custom race can't be changed. It will default to whatever time of day is currently on. - You can't edit any details (not that they would save) without retesting the race. Weather? Test race. Car type? Test race. Clearly they didn't test their game so you must.  ||| Map |||- Stupid filtering of the map and events. The map is always a cluttered mess. - It won't hide things you completed / won. They'll FOREVER be there unless you hide them each time you enter the game.- Scrolling through the item list gets bugged- Sandstorms are random, barely happen and they don't do much. If you play on lower graphics it just looks like it's about to rain. I guess the same for the other seasons? No idea, I never feel any difference. ||| Steering wheel, pedals, clutch |||- Same small FoV from inside the car. And I play on 3440x1440.- The steering wheel animations are super basic, 90 degrees- And as it turns out, now that I was made aware of it, even manual w/ clutch is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now vs 4.- No noise when missing the gear.||| UI |||- The menus when navigating towards your car are full of useless interactions where it showcases your car for no reason and so on. Same when purchasing. It's been stupid like this for long, including in FH4.+ Better than FH4 as you can see some extra details in the Festival Playlist. ||| AI |||- On custom races, the AI is really bad. - The difficulty curve a bit wonky. The game is really hard but it's not a turn-off.||| NPCs ||| - Not enough NPC traffic. ||| Graphics |||- Ray tracing? No, not in gameplay, that's for sure, try Photo Mode.- It gave me a ""Low Video Memory"" with an RTX 3080.- Textures of the road get corrupted, looking shiny, very dark or as if they have placeholder textures. - A lot of scanlines when dropping the resolution.||| Multiplayer |||- Fairly OK when you don't find people who stop playing mid tournament and you lose because of them. Happens more often than not.||| Conclusion |||- It's basically FH4 with a new map, tweaked cars and a few improvements. That's it.- If you do something that's creative, you're going to get in trouble or it won't work. + Fun with friends and if you don't already have FH4.(I'll keep updating this with more)"

Horizon 5 makes a huge leap with its graphics and content to deliver something so well. Yeah ill be honest, there are some annoying bugs (such as the disconnection one from your online session).

Yet another big, entirely empty map with nothing but dirt and rocks to look at. is it an improvement over FH4? yes. However I'd still prefer the FH4 map over Mexico. Car catalog is fresh, plenty of new additions with returning favorites. Turn 10 took a page from Need for Speed and added some crazy body kit options and some new rims that weren't in FH4. that being said, why on Earth, after 5 installments in the Horizon series, can I not adjust the wheel depth? When it comes to wheels, I believe they are the defining feature on a vehicle. An RWB Porsche looks better with a deep dish rim however I am unable to get the desired look due to these restrictions. I find it inexcusable at this point and I'm honestly tired of the direction the series is headed. In my opinion, the Horizon series is the racing game equivalent of a participation award."

Driving is a pleasure and the races & challenges are a blast. The community is pretty nice too. The radio stations are fun but get repetitive after a while. The hotwheels map is a friggin blast and if my game still worked like it should, I'd still be spending most of my time in-game there.Cons: Devs seem like they don't care very much about quality control. Every update breaks something for me; the donut media update in particular straight up made the game unplayable with a controller for me, which is a must have if you don't have one of those elaborate racing sim setups for your pc. Playing racing games with a mouse+keyboard sucks. There is also a particularly tiresome grind to get through if you want to unlock everything. There are also a lot of hackers; if you want to get anywhere near the top 10% of players on any of the leaderboards, you need to cheat. It's pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ up that they haven't addressed this yet.Don't even bother buying this game if you intend to play it offline. It writes home to microsoft constantly and if it can't connect to their servers, well then you're out of luck. When I first tried to play this game, back when I had disabled the windows store, it would just ctd on launch. Before the donut media update, I didn't update windows for a while and the game would also crash because the windows store was out of date. DRM like this should be illegal tbh.Here's to hoping Playground gets around to fixing things and actually adding in content that players want instead of occasionally releasing a few new cars & dropping this like a hot rock when FH6 comes out."

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing."

It felt sluggish and laggy and I was super weirded out by it taking my friend's names and tossing them in a race with me. I was also incredibly annoyed by the lack of skipping cutscenes for half-assed voice acting with people I don't give a damn about. I was hoping for more of a pick your car, upgrade it, drive it to different events to earn more to upgrade it and so on. I don't get why I was dropped out of a helicopter 3 times, in 3 random locations with 3 random vehicles, driving insanely fast through a jungle and off cliffs that felt straight outta Just Cause. The mouse camera control is also complete junk. The mouse isn't restricted to the window and when you hit the edge of the window, the camera stops. Maybe I didn't give it enough time. I felt an hour should have been more than enough time to make it through whatever the hell that prologue was. They're trying waaay too hard to pack action into this."

Oh it's big but also if you have premium edition the map icons will just start to pop up everywhere questioning what to do first so just take your time here.Is this game hard? No it's not hard but if you think and feel that you are too good in them races you can adjust that setting higher and also the higher you adjust the difficulty the more winning % bonuses you get but AI gets harder as well. Championship races are LOCKED in very hard difficulty so you can't change that and it may take a lot of tries to win it as it took me over 10 tries or more just to pick the right car so AI is quite hard in championship but it takes time. Also championship races are timed so i take it this is more of a radiant activity if you love doing side stuff.The rewards in seasons are great and my personal fav is spin the wheel so getting credits within my time over 20h i got like over 2million and it's still stacking so fear not if you think you can go broke.Are there any bugs? Some minor bugs but fixes and patches are here and there so make sure to follow up on that so nothing serious.So if you love to drive, explore, taking photos and race around in an open world, then FH5 is for you and belive me you will not be disappointed. The only con i have is that there is no police chases but as an owner of premium edition i can tell you that this con didn't bother me at all as there are so many collectables (treasure maps) that they will pop up instantly for you go and collect them.I don't know how standard edition is compared to the others but belive me premium is worth and i'm sure the developers will give us more in the future untill FH6 is out.Rating 9/10"

5149,Capitan Miao,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLen/,2,,0,443.5,November,"19,","1,161",0,1,"Forza Horizon 5 is a clear example of why having a huge map doesn't always mean it's a good thing. I have a lot of criticisms for the game, but for now, I will focus on the three main ones: map content, roads and handling model. I will also compare the game with FH4 and GTA 5 because I expected it to be better than its predecessor and older open world games. The map is huge, but boring and empty. The desert biome is just sand and cacti. The jungle biome is just trees. The farmland biome is just crops. There is only one major city - Guanojuato - but even it is small. There are a few towns scattered along the coasts on both ends but they are uninteresting. There are hardly any landmarks worth visiting, apart from Copper Canyon and... well, I can't think of any. There is a giant volcano but it serves no purpose. There's also a stadium in the middle of the map, and it also serves no purpose other than Playground Games event. Even FH4 is more urbanized than this. Street races actually felt like street races, not some country road cruising. Details are severely lacking compared to GTA V. Now, you might say GTA is an open-world game, but so is FH5. You might say, Rockstar games has decades of experience in making open-world games, but GTA V was released in 2013, and FH5 was released a year short of FH's 10-year anniversary, and 9 years is plenty of time. Instead, what we got is an empty map.Now, the roads. Boring as always. Virtually all of the roads are two-way single-laned, apart from the massive highway stretching from East to West, but even the highway looks like it was placed to satisfy players' requests as FH4 didn't really have one. Sharp corners are gone, and are replaced by long and excruciating bends. A typical road segment starts with a short straight, slight bend to the right, short straight, slight bend to the left, short straight and so on. Racing on roads like these felt extremely boring. It also looks like the roads were placed there before orogeny happened. Instead of roads that follow the contour of the terrain, sometimes you'll find them going over hills. The only road up the mountain feels like it was made for drifting.Finally, the handling model. It drastically changed from FH4's. Cars are more drift-friendly now. You can drift with almost any car now, even with FWD cars. Responsiveness is very low. I cannot recommend this game because of the lack of enough content to justify its price tag. If you value your money more, play FH4 instead."

I generally play different genres entirely, but occasionally I want to play some racing games and in the past ProStreet was my fix, it was everything I wanted a racing game to be. Just so you have an idea of where I'm coming from.I wrote a major essay and realized I need to be more concise, so here:The game starts with lots of long, annoying unskippable cutscenes.Character creation: you have to choose a name from a list. Either a list of mostly anglosaxon names or a list of nauseatingly edgy nicknames. When I went on to choose a Literally Me appearance, every time I tried to select a hairstyle, for some reason my chosen character was replaced with an EtHniCaLlY dIvErSe woman that I felt no connection whatsoever with.I was immediately showered with plentiful praise by the game despite not even having done anything yet. I pretty much kept my headphones off after it started so I can't comment on how much of that there really was.When I finally got to the actual racing part of the game, it was mostly just holding down RT. Brakes were optional, crashing into other cars and barriers had no consequences and was more effective.In terms of handling, cars didn't feel distinct. The Mitsubishi Lancer Evo that I bought as soon as I could was just a slower version of the starter Corvette Stingray despite the fact that the Lancer is 4WD and the Corvette is RWD.In order to get from one race to another, I had to drive around in freeroam. Normally I might really like that, but even with the Corvette the most efficient method was to point the nose at the destination and hold down RT until I was there. Didn't matter what was in between. A giant hill with like 60 degree slopes was irrelevant. Also gave me loads of XP for smashing everything on the path.Speaking of XP, like 90% of the time there were some kind of rewards on the screen. I was constantly being showered with XP or god knows what else for every little thing I ever did.There's more I could write but I'll leave it at that. Maybe if I played much more, my opinion would change. Maybe I'm too much judging a book by its cover. But by Lord Gaben's decision a game has two hours to impress me before I have to make a decision - and this one didn't."

You get drip fed one car at a time well sometimes its more but rarely, After 20 minutes you will be bored from testing the new car out..

Forza is pretty accessible to people who nothing about racing or cars and there's never stressful high stakes, you can only get better. The npcs are just pleasant too, and the map is big enough to not get repetitive. It's just a positive game that anyone can enjoy."
5199,SINEWAVE,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sigma_1/,1,,1,133.3,July,"20,",127,0,1,"Starting off with the positives, FH5 is overall a reasonably enjoyable experience for fans of open world racing games, with good car variety, a particular highlight being the inclusion of older and more ""normal"" cars rather than just modern supercars, unlike for example the recent Need for Speeds.The livery editor is also by far the best in the genre, with an enormous layer count available, only real issue being that a few cars have slight texture mapping issues. I do wish importing liveries as SVG files was possible, however I fully understand why in a multiplayer game it isn't.Driving physics are also generally polished and enjoyable, and strike a good balance of sim to arcade, leaning a bit towards a more arcade-y feel.And as a final particular highlight, the drivatars have a decent variety of customisation, and for the first time in my racing game history of over 10 years, I actually felt truly welcome in the game as a transgender person thanks to FH5 allowing you to choose pronouns, voice, and character model independently, huge respect to the developers for that from me.Moving onto the negative parts, to me personally by far the biggest flaw is that while the map has some variety in scenery, driving on it feels largely the same no matter where you go, and there's a huge lack of track style variety at least in road/street racing due to this, only exceptions being a couple of races in the unfortunately very tiny city area, which feels more like a small town than a city to me. This causes the map to quickly get boring to race or just cruise on. It also feels kind of lacking in a feeling of life, as so much is just desert/jungle/fields with barely any infrastructure, car meets, or anything of the sorts.Another issue, mainly if you're coming from Need for Speed games like I did, is that the availability of customisation parts is very limited, however I do understand the reasons for this as modeling parts for the large car quantity would be an enormous undertaking. Still, I would appreciate at least some more of various racing-style body kits for example, such as GT3 or DTM-style ones for more cars.As for multiplayer, I personally find it annoying that meta builds keep being so effective, and the multiplayer experience in general could use some balancing and polish. I would also greatly appreciate no-contact racing in Horizon Open, as Forza Horizon feels more like a contact sport than racing, even in road races. Only exception being at certain times of the night when I've been able to get matched with others interested in clean, proper racing instead of bumper cars.Oh and also the Mazda RX-7's 4-rotor sounds great in hood camera (which I mainly use), but really could use a better sound when heard from the follow camera.TL;DR:Pros:+ Good car variety+ Exceptional livery editor+ Solid driving model+ Great and remarkably inclusive character customisationCons:- Map feels bland and gets boring fast- Aftermarket body parts for cars quite limited- Meta builds- Ramfest multiplayer except at specific times at nightVerdict: 76/100, probably should've personally gone with FH3 or 4 for the more fun map"

Long story short it's a decent game that you don't feel like playing again.  Me personally I enjoyed most of the curated content. Most of that stuff is rather enjoyable. Unfortunately the weekly challenge stuff can leave a bad taste in your mouth. On the other hand I wouldn't recommend the weekly grind system they got set up. It just gets too tiresome. Some of the weekly multi-player races and game modes can really struggle with game balance. If you happen to not have a car that fulfills the criteria of a certain race, you'll end up with a selection of eligible cars. The car selection itself is not the issue. The issue is that some players can bring their own cars which are fully upgraded for said event. The issue is that there's a big difference between let's say a lv 860 car vs a lv 899 car. No matter how good your driving skills are you can't catch up because they got better grip, acceleration and top speed. Casual online races for weekly challenges should have a fixed selection of rental cars. There's also the issue of team imbalance when it comes to other game modes like capture the flag and ""zombie"" mode. If you're on the losing side there's no mechanism to rebalance teams. If players on the losing team quit then tough luck turning things around. I've ended up on a team with only three players. When the outcome is already decided then why even try? Even winning under such circumstances feels dirty.Of course the game must encourage players to engage with the battle royale mode with its weekly challenge. While technically you can opt out you will be deprived of a weekly reward that should've been paired to another race or challenge. It's so annoying to have a gimmicky battle royale force-fed like this.The most annoying thing is that money rewards got nerfed hard. If you've played a previous Forza Horizon game you'll probably be a little peeved to say the least. Maybe some expansion or major weekly challenge overhaul could improve the experience down the line. The last time I played this game it still has the same issues."

Way more. And primarily I have to complain about the size of the map at this opportunity.  Yes, there is lots of variety with jungle, desert, snowy volcano etc.  But these are all pretty limited in their dimension. There literally isn't much to explore besides driving every single road that takes a different turn or finding some hidden cardboard.There are plenty of cars and they are great. But recent cars are rare, some car categories feel pretty barebone. Similarly, I'd judge the music library. Racing itself is fun but the difficulty balancing isn't satisfying. Either it's mostly too easy against the AI or too unrealistic.One of the greatest disappointments though is how little Playground Games seems to know about game design, despite all the experience they should obviously have. On the one hand, you gather hundreds of cars easily, on the other their constant wheelspin changes show that their agenda is more about reacting to developments than following a proper and established plan.Oh well, it's still a great raceing game -  if you keep your expectations in check and play in small healthy doses."

I can count on one hand the number of online races I've had that didn't have someone ramming people around corners or pinning them against walls in order to pass. The races and courses also seem very short, so when someone runs you off the course early, you're basically out of the race. Also even in the team races people will be ramming teammates around to the point that the whole team winds up losing. All of that is online gripes, but playing solo it just seems like there's not all that much to do, after you go through most the races a couple times there's really not much reason to keep playing unless you just simply want to collect cars. I do like the game a lot, just other players made it really not fun to play."

I find my self joining and existing most Horizon Open events just to search for a Racing event. Also you cant choose the performance class...- I really dont like the UI. While it may look nice with all these tiles it does not work for me. I find myself searching for certain menu entries or going back few levels just to access certain view (eg. tuning and styling). Also some loading times are quite annoying. The UI doesnt remember certain settings (like show favourite cars only - a necessity when the game is throwing all these garbage cars at you). Also WHY cant I start an event in the Festival Playlist or look at the map while I am at home? And many many more issues regarding the user experience...- Horizon Link: You may have only two static and two dynamic chat options. How am i supposed to communicate with other players in freeroam? Just some basic small talk would be nice without changing the forza link settings, which are burried deep within in the menu.- Can we have awesome music while driving? Nah- The whole festival thing feels a bit cringe (a huge cargo plane doing low passes and turning on a dime? Sure).- AI cars rubber band and lag all over the places. They drive like on rails. They crash in any Civi Car when traffic is turned on- Low streaming band width: While the game may be optimised for graphics It surely isnt for online play. What a pity... the whole game is online only."

This addition to the Horizon series is just disappointing, I loved Forza Horizon 4 along with all of the new and incredible features it brought with it. Do not get me wrong, I love that Playground has brought over almost all of the features from Horizon 4 to this new game. However, I have two main problems with Horizon 5. Firstly, the overall performance has been terrible, and I have a relatively high end PC. Even after tweaking settings, I still have constant stuttering, lengthy load times, and terrible frame rates, I've never had any issues like this on Horizon 4. Secondly, I feel like so much of the ""story/progression"" is one big history lesson... A few facts or myths here and there is no issue, but so far it's definitely a lot more than just a few, and it feels like the game so heavily revolves around it... Like I just want to race and have fun..."

Difficulty is just a scale of how fast you want the AI to complete the track it seems. For the online aspect numerous players including friends of mine have received perma bans for creating decals, these bans came without warning and mean I may never be able to race them again.

Highly recommended for anyone who loves cars.Edit: The issues I mentioned above other than the AI have all since been fixed. More minor ones have popped up since that will probably never be fixed (an annoying echo in Forzavista for example) but none are major annoyances like there were when I left the review. Good stuff, and still playing hundreds of hours later like I said!Edit 2: The Forzavista echo has actually been fixed! Never been happier to be made to look like a fool.

The ridiculous moments don't feel as forced as the other games, and the map is the best I've ever seen, it's gorgeous and the cars feel so real. In fact, course design is one of the best things about this title. Never been this addicted to a Horizon title in my life, usually I'm more of a track racer. So why the negative review? Game devs NEED to stop releasing games before they are thoroughly tested and the bugs / crashes are fixed. The amount of bugs and crashes, especially while playing multiplayer, is staggering. My buddy can't even launch the game and he paid for all the dlc. I definitely recommend getting this game eventually, but maybe wait for some of the bugs to get fixed, especially if you plan to play online with people because that's where most of the bugs are. If you play mostly solo and are willing to risk it, it might be worth the purchase but be aware of bugs and issues you may experience.Update: one month later and my friend still can't play the game. He's tried everything short of reinstalling Windows.... inexcusable. He has tried every single recommended solution, submitted a ticket to Forza, and there still is no solution."

5447,Xierra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xierra/,1,,1,65.1,November,"18,",146,0,1,"As a new player of the Forza series, I am reviewing this as a game of its own. Wheel player. Physics definitely simcade. You can treat it like a racing sim if you want to.The game is fun as a collect-a-thon, race what you want, along with some preset cars for certain events. Cars can be bought with in-game credits, some only obtained from wheelspins that you get in-game pretty regularly. The game can be played very casually by freeroaming and collecting stuff, or competitively through Open Racing (Online races) and Rivals (Time Trial Leaderboards). The game gives you enough things to do through objectives and quests in the Horizon Festival, collecting new cars and Forzathon points. However, it's not without its flaws. At the moment, a convoy is needed to PvP. Since I don't have friends to play with, it's quite a lonely game. Open Racing, the equivalent of race matchmaking, is fun, however, we cannot choose car class nor tracks to suit our desires. Also, there's no way to reach out to people you raced with to add friends, send kudos, or something of the sort for good racing, so the social interactivity aspect is... very lacking. Perhaps this is something the Xbox takes advantage of but not well implemented in Steam? Eliminator is not fun for me... just because while you try to eliminate someone, solid trees and very uneven terrain tend to get in the way. The cars in Eliminator tend to handle really bad even with TC and ABS on.As for issues with Mexico itself? There is no modern cityscape. Which means there's no big city with skyscrapers at the end of a highway, no parking lot environments to have a car meet, no familiar roads of any sort. There's a lack of ""a popular place to gather"" other than the old town. Mexico feels too far from home for me.Keep in mind I'm only pointing out the big flaws that is going to keep me from actively playing FH5 in the near future. The game as a whole is amazing; just that it's not exactly what I hoped it'd be. it's best to wait for a discount, you won't miss out on ""exclusive"" vehicles, since you can still get them in wheelspins. My thoughts may change once Ranked comes out, if it exists. The co-op team race in Horizon Open has good potential for a clan battle."

The physics and FFB are pretty good for an arcade title. I would prefer a stronger road sensation though, but we can't judge this as a sim anyway.As to what to avoid if you wan't to have a nice driving experience and save some time:1. Don't play online if you wan't to avoid stuttering, probably netcode is super bad - let's hope for a fix but I personally don't care much about it.2. If you have a DD wheel (or any wheel), with pedals, shifter etc. that can't make them work at all in game, download Emuwheel and vJoy and you will be able to use them.3. As for the force feedback, I recommend maxing out road feel because it's not very noticeable even with strong wheelbases and reducing off-road feel because it's a bit too strong.4. Regarding the texture popping your only solution to make it better is to increase world detail in the graphics settings.5. Avoid bots at very high difficulties for obvious reasons."

There are a lot of areas that the game improves on compared to the last one however they make some weird choices that makes it feel, at least at the minute, like one step forward and one step back. Things like the fact that you cannot see the last survivor on the zombie playground game make the game mode unplayable at times meaning you have to wait the timer out and the decision to make it much more unclear as to how much money you earn at the end of a race. It will likely be fixed and become better than it's predecessor soon but at the minute I would advice people not to waste their money.Bugs I've experienced:- Memory leaks- Audio disappears- Players disappearing at random- Civilian vehicles disappearing at random- VIP disappearing at random along with benefits- Resetting what car you were last in (defaulting you to a different car)- VIP house no longer being owned sometimes- 5+ wait times in playground games- Cannot play seasonal events (races or playground games) with a convoy- Home not being set spawn- Semi-frequent crashes to desktop- Connection issues- Complete lock upsOther issues:- No audio option for turning other players mics off- No push to talk- Cannot see the last survivor in infected- Some barn finds take ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ages to repair"

For reference, I'm in my first year of law school (time flies).Whats fantastic about this sub series of Forza is it feels like each game is better than the last. Aspects that we take for granted in this game-- was implemented and perfected in previous games.That being said, for those of y'all that have played other Horizon games-- there is plenty of new content in this title.As it stands this is the ""most complete"" Horizon game and quite frankly it puts ALL OTHER open-world racing games to shame.

5508,{ RichCarThief },https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198370810319/,1,,1,241.2,November,"12,",212,0,1,"Honestly, it's kind of hard to rate this game highly. I'm going to set aside all of the bugs that they are having on PC right now because I am confident that it will all get sorted fairly quickly. In terms of the actual game, my biggest problem is the speed of the progression. You don't really feel like you have accomplished anything after you do something in this game. There is no satisfaction when you get your first supercar, because you have probably gotten one on accident from a wheelspin, or you have already made enough money to buy one yourself. This is ignoring the fact that two of the choices for your first car are the C8 and the Mk5 Supra. You are also able to play the ""finale"" races within an hour or so of gameplay if you choose to. This is very broken when you look at it in terms of the story line. You are supposed to have worked your way up, becoming the best of the best in Mexico until you get to the ""mega races"" toward the end. Nope, you can finish three or four races and head straight to the finale ones. Even if you are like me, wanting to save those finale races until the end, it is still difficult because you can unlock the next chapter in the gameplay after only a couple races and a few PR stunts. Eventually these unlocks will stack up and you feel like you're being rushed. Also the map... yes it's pretty, yes it's big, but that's about it. There is nothing really interesting about it. Majority of this map consists of open fields and desert. It's not a bad map, but I think Playground Games could have done better. For example, setting the game in Japan like people have been asking for the past couple of games.Overall, the only real reason I'm giving it a thumbs up is because I don't think it's a bad game that deserves a thumbs down. I'm still going to play it all the time, and I'm still going to tell people it's a fun game. If I had to rate it out of ten, it would probably only get a 6.5 or 7/10. For reference, I give FH3 and FH4 an 9/10 and FH2 a 9.5/10 (I don't think any game is perfect so it's hard to give a game 10/10 imo.)"

I'm happy now.______________________________________________OldAfter the disastrous release of Cyberpunk I honestly hoped that major AAA releases would start testing their products before release date.  Forza Horizon 5 didn't seem to have learned that lesson.  The game is one big pile of garbage in its current state.  Crash after crash after crash.You can't even AFK in the menu to get a cup of coffee without coming back to a crash.  Now here's the actual big problem.  When the game isn't crashing, it's just not fun to play.  The cars feel like lifeless bricks, and the AI for solo races, on the same difficulty setting, doesn't work right between the car classes.  For example, I can come in first place and destroy the competition in a class B.  Same race, same settings, Class C, almost fail, Class A, dead last every time, class S and I almost lap the competition.  It just doesn't feel right.  It doesn't matter how good or bad I race, I win every time in a B class and lose every time in an A.The AI cars don't behave even remotely close to what we've come to expect from modern racing games.  Collisions are broken.  No other word for it.  I've tapped cars in races and send them flying off track.  I've tapped cars in races and seen them maintain speed and race completely sideways following the track for a couple of seconds before floating back up facing the right way and continuing the race like nothing happened.  I've tapped cars and both of us came to dead halt.  I've run full speed in other cars and seen one fly off and one not move.  Physics?  Who needs that in Forza 5?As a fanboy, it's really hard to say this, but I just can't recommend this game.  If you own every Forza game like me, you're going to take your chances anyhow and this review doesn't matter but if you're actually concerned about spending 60 bucks right now, don't.  You will regret that purchase.  I just wish I would have realized all this before I played over 2 hours or I would have refunded it."

The engine sound, while better, still does not hold a candle to Forza Motorsport 4. I don't understand why some engine sounds aren't ripped straight from any of the older Forza Motorsports to be honest. The servers are still a bit iffy, but that's to be expected for this game. I did have a few game crashes as well. P.S. The game is quite demanding as I can only run it at around 60 fps on maxed out settings (2560x1600) on my 5900HX, 3080 165W so just beware of that. Also, at 2560x1600, the windows taskbar still shows up at the very bottom when running the game in full screen mode. Hopefully, that issue is fixed soon"

Horizon is a great game, the series has been... Fun... I can't leave this review positive. You start with nothing but super cars, aside from the 2020 Ford Bronco. I get it, its cool to get into a Mclaren or a Ferrari, but the cars available are nothing new, used again, and again. The newest slew of cars available are older than 2018. Very few cars are an option as a 2020 or newer car. The cars of 2021 have been released, and 2022 cars have been showcased. A lot of them from the popular manufacturers  that the Playground Games love to use, Ford, Honda, BMW, Audi, etc. For some reason they're not in the game. Maybe DLC?One little side note on the game world. While it may have a ""Mexico"" feel to it. I can't help but to notice a town or two and some roadways, specifically the highways are just a ctrl + c and ctrl + v from other Horizon games.The game runs fairly smooth, aside from the random crash to desktops I've experienced. One, putting a tail fin on the Jeep Trailhawk. Crashes every time. You'll thank me knowing this. And I've had several in the general world as well as racing.Multiplayer wise, obviously a good time. One thing that bums me out, is that the people in your convoy disappear all the time. You could be racing neck and neck in the open world and they'll disappear like a Delorean reaching 88mph. My favorite version of this (of course needs to be fixed) is when you're next to your convoy not moving, and they disappear. Where do they go? Nobody knows, lol. It's one thing if random players phase in and out of existence. You know, for the server. If you're in a convoy they should be in the world so long as the game and group is running.Is this a good time? Yeah. Will it give you a good racing arcade fix? Sure. Worth the $60? Eh, maybe if you never played a Horizon game."

Hmm well its not bad either but I'm not necessarily play the FH series for it's story. Multiplayer oh man.. I know it's early access but yeah coop races are a bit laggy and you will get disconnected from freeroam a lot of times. Apart from these it's fun! So is it worth it? Absolutely!

Do you like leaderboards filled with 5 mile races finished in under 1 second? Do you like racing against cheaters who blatantly cheat? How about AI that blatantly cheats? When you sit down to play a game, are you all like ""Gee, I wish this game would cheat more?"" Then I have the game for you: Forza Horizon 5. From the comfort of your own home, you can feel the true joy of seeing cheaters always prosper. You can feel the warmth of knowing no matter how much your skills improve, the game will definitely cheat to put you in your place. Feed that inner masochist and give Horizon 5 all your money. Don't worry that the game isn't finished, they will finish it eventually. Don't worry about the bugs, those are actually hidden features. And the cheating, oh you will come to love the cheating.This is, without a doubt, the worst racing game I have ever played. Why? Start with the AI. There is NO AI. It is a simple pathfinder with no physics. No matter what the surface is, the AI is not affected by it. You can slam an AI car as hard and as fast as possible, and it will only barely move it off of the drive path, and it will immediately return, with very little loss of speed. The physics for your vehicle change drastically, depending on the event. I have not seen built-in cheating this bad outside of an EA sports game. The multiplayer is a complete joke, and is not worth wasting your time. Really, for some nice looking graphics, and the ability to collect cars like Pork-o-mon, this game is ridiculously overpriced. Don't bother with force feedback wheels, they are likewise a waste of time. Keyboard has advantage over you on your fancy wheel, controller makes you look like a clown. Tuning cars is completely unrealistic and really does nothing for the vehicle. This is not a simulator by any stretch of the imagination, but it takes one heck of a stretch of the imagination to accept this as even an arcade racer. Don't bother unless this is on the biggest sale you have ever seen, it isn't worth the hair loss or the amount of time you will spend screaming at your screen."

Controller will work for a good length of time and then all of sudden stop working (keyboard will stop working as well so you have to hard quit). The recent Hot Wheels update seems to be the worst offender in regards to bugs and issues. These sorts of issues are unacceptable nine months after a game release. Ironically, I would rather have a stable game that I can at least launch and play instead of content updates. The lesson here is to just wait until the devs move on to the next game and stop updating this one if you want a reliable experience.EDIT: after doing a fresh reinstall, it looks like the game runs fine. It seems like when the updates build up, issues start happening."

Be prepared to go through a bit with your virus/file protection to get the game running though after the first time playing. The only support you will get is in the community, so be prepared to do some searching for what you need to do if you are not savvy with your virus/file protection. This is edited from my previous review as I could not get the game running until I got some direction from another person that had similar issues. Really shouldn't be having these issues with these games.... Steam seems to be the only version that has this issue."

Bought the Ultimate version partly to be able to play it early. And yet, they screw up things so badly that for a LOT of people the anti-virus make the game crash at the playground logo when you launch the game, with quite a few anti-viruses.For some, adding the game to exception worked, for some others, uninstalling the anti-virus was the only solution, I'm on AVG free, and I have to go passive with it to be able to run the game.A game launched on PC SHOUD NOT be a hassle like that to be played, and even more, not putting you, THE CONSUMER who PAY for the game, vulnerable to issues on PC.Until they resolve that issue, I'll leave the review negative.]Solved the issue a while ago, and yet didn't play much more until recently.Now that I have played more, I have to say that I like it. I like the gameplay, I'm finally happy to be back on an Horizon game.Will need to play more to maybe add to all that, but as of today, I'm finally happy with the game"

Yeah, to address the elephant in the room - Forza 5 is (currently) buggy. It's absolutely playable and I haven't encountered anything deal-braking, but there quite a lot of minor to medium issues. But they are working on it.The most ""broken"" part is online, of course. While I'm perfectly able to ride cooperatively with my friend and participate in online PVP races from time to time, there are significant disconnection issues, sync issues and some random stuff like all other cars disappearing for you in Eliminator. If you're targeting the online play with this game - it's better to wait for a month or two. If you're more a single-player racer and explorer - go right at it, as it is excitingly fun."

Not a single new Audi, BMW, Bugatti, Ferrari, Lamborghini, koenigsegg, and many more cars the could have been added but no lets scam the fanboys one more time.. Other issues with the game Are GPU performance modes are broken,  Car performance modes are a joke, 4K sucks performance is worse. In FH4 RTX3080 was ok on Ultra now it is laggy. I feel like this is disappointment of the year. The game is not finished you can argue that they will add more stuff with each update but then it should have been an early access and this is an full blown 100€ game sorry but it is the truth.."

This game is about doing what you want, when you want, and I adore it for that. It starts you off with cars of varying classes so you can choose if you want to go hog-wild with a hypercar, or have a fun race in an old beater (I am a big fan o the Datsun they still have in here from the days of Forza 3!). It is an extremely chill experience (Outside of the pretty bombastic campaign, which is great in its own right!).You won't see any iconic raceways like you do in the mainline Forza games, but you will definitely see some sights! The map in this game is pretty great both in terms of size, and variance. I had a ton of fun simply exploring the map!Definitely a great time if you're looking for something chill and pretty to play!"

It's not a racing game its a car game designed mostly for children imo.  The wheel to wheel racing is horrible with a defunct penalty system. If you hit a wall you get a time penalty however you can ram others off track without penalty. Worse yet you can ram an opponent into a wall and they will get a time penalty while you drive away mostly unscathed. Then there are all the game issues. Its the most I've ever paid for a video game yet it runs worse than games i play that are in beta testing. Its been 4 months since release, and i doubt it will ever run properly. You could say its my pc but it's the only game i have that's giving me issues. The other major problem is the OP cars and the performance rating system which sucks. Of the 500 plus cars available your better off checking you tube to see which cars are OP. Really you need only about 20 cars  out of the large list, because most cars just wont be competitive. So the whole rating or points system that is designed to give some balance to the racing is defunct. Expect to have your nice truck totally annihalated in a cross country race by Hot Wheels boneshaker which looks more like something built for cruising or possibly drag racing. So if your looking for a beautiful game that is poorly thought out, maybe this game is for you."

If you're lucky, you might not get any bugs or crashes, but I wouldn't wanna gamble over £60 and 100GB of storage space on that, just for a game that I personally haven't enjoyed as much as 4.If the game is on sale, it's definitely worth buying, but you could also just get 4 while it's on sale (and I've seen it on sale a few times, as of me editing this review it's 67% off).(If I manage to play the game without bugs I'll still give this a positive review, since the game looks great and it's still at the least enjoyable to collect cars, but it leaves a lot to be desired)"

From lackluster updates to missing entire season because of incompetent devs, I struggle to want to play this game anymore. The difficulty for seasonal stuff can be utterly absurd making some series absolutely impossible for those who don't own certain cars or get enough credits to upgrade suitably. Clothing that looks good on you always turns out to be vaulted to previous shops as well as emotes, horns, and other things that should be obtainable through normal means. Wheel spins are a whole other mess in their own right as it can make getting vehicles the most grueling thing. Another majorly upsetting feature has been gifting where I've wanted to send gifts to specific friends to lend them a hand in playing but sure enough that's not possible at all. A bitter taste has been left in my mouth by this installment with some seasons being unplayable due to graphical issues or updates (such as the most recent one) making the game unplayable and crashing on launch. I was admittedly excited for the Donut Media series but sure enough that's not gonna be happening anytime soon and knowing the team, they probably won't be extending the window to participate in this series either. Where this game has it's charm, the amount of cons outweighs the pros unfortunately and it's been wearing me down overall. Hopefully the dev team can pull themselves together but until then, I can't say anything good about this game anymore.Edit: In addition to everything said here, they've also banned me for zero good reason so that's fun."

The difficulty can be tuned to however you want to enjoy racing games. Personally I have a couple assists turned on but then increase the AI difficulty. There's tons of tracks, driving in the giant map of Mexico is fun, and the music is great.Not to mention the accessibility options are plentiful and useful. The game also runs very well on a wide range of hardware. It's great on my Steam Deck, but also flexes my RTX 3080 when I'm playing at home.I just got the base version with no addons, and had a blast."

Verified Files, Updated Drivers, turned off all other apps, gave it priority permissions, adjusted in game video settings. No solutions so far, in fact it's gotten worse from only crashing at cut scenes to just about whenever.

Let me tell you.Yes, of course, it's very similar to Forza Horizon 4 blah blah blah.... BUT! This game patches up all the previous flaws, making it the best flawless open-world racing game that has ever come. The scale of the map is HUMONGOUS! Not only you can drive everywhere, but the surroundings and the whole environment also is beautiful, very well colourised, and realistic. All the details will consume you into one big nerdgasm. So, what's new?The first thing you'll encounter while you play is huge weather conditions. We're not talking rain or snow, but a straight-up massive sand storm, tornados, blizzards, and deep jungle rains. You can freely drive into those and take some unique pictures! Another thing you encounter very early in the game is the Volcano Exploration as a part of a Festival. Explore a volcano in 4k? HECK YEAH! (btw it looks super realistic modelled after a real-life volcano, Nuff said, right?)We got a new creation tool called EventLab. It allows you to make custom maps and events to have fun with your friends. Only creativity is the limit here!Much deeper car and character customisations. New interactive system with players. Very easy to use, simple, and fast. What's recurring?Almost everything else that's in Forza Horizon 4.Drivatars feel a little harder, but they won't be seen as a challenge once you get the grip. Barn finds now have dedicated locations, so you don't have to drive around to find them.What's the best about all of it? It doesn't push you to do anything. You can do anything you want. Don't you like the current Festival? Drive to another one! There's like 4-5 Festivals happening all around Mexico. You can explore mountains, cities, islands, jungles, and temples to see what you can find.Or you can have fun with your friends just messing around. That all in amazing 4K. Because it runs smoothly even on the mid-tier build."
5710,SirAyron,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989650799/,1,,0,119.6,December,"24,",137,0,1,"Fun game, good selection of cars. Simply amazing graphics. I've owned every Forza title, like any horizon game it's aimed towards arcade racers. Which is fine, it's fun. However the fine tuning of cars can bare very little results when compared to Forza motorsport.My biggest gripe with Horizon is the spoon feeding of credits, chance wheel spins etc takes you to end game simply too quickly with very little left to achieve after about 40-50 hours. Which means you're repeating the same online races again and again until you get bored and inevitably like every other Forza Horizon, cease to play. Two things that need to be fixed imo.1 : Bigger performance penalty for AWD swap. A class or above you NEED an awd car to win online, as length of races are simply too short and it is damn near impossible to beat an AWD swapped car in a fast lobby as you spend the entire race catching up after they launch from the start line while you're stuck there wheel spinning.I have had to AWD swap all my RWD A class and above cars in order to be competitive. The swap simply does not add enough PP and is an OP conversion. 2 :I think a game like this needs to put some restraint on the gifting of dozens of cars and 100,000's of credits every time you play.Maybe just maybe, it will give you a bit more sense of achievement and appreciation for your garage. As after 100 hours, I have 180 cars, 90% are just given to me in wheel spins. I don't want to be gifted all these cars, I want to race, to earn credits to buy them. For the sense of accomplishment, I want to know that other players have done the same so when I see someone rocking a 300SL or a Shelby, I know that they worked hard to get that car which creates a mutual respect. Not just everyone driving lambos and side swiping you."

This is my first Forza Game. To me, it's the perfect mix of silly fun and serious driving. My joy mostly comes from the single player content. I want to win every race on the map. I want to finish everything that gives accolades. In the future I'm probably gonna be working on the achievements. This has been a lot of fun so far and that's why I've spent all this time in the game.While I had fun with the game. I still decided it's important to write this review. Currently the game is rated ""very positive"" on Steam. This does not reflect how broken is. Around a month after release, practically all online content and some single player content is in a nearly unplayable state.- Loading times for online races are ridiculous (longer than the actual race sometimes)- Grouping doesn't work (people phase out of groups)- People are invisible in the Eliminator but can sometimes still challenge you to a race which you then lose for some reason- Some achievements and also seasonal content are bugged and can't be completed (in case of seasonal content, this can never be fixed)- Random disconnects in freeroam...Believe me, the list goes on.I don't understand how this game can be so terrible from a technical standpoint when it's the 5th edition of a series of which all the iterations before were much better (from what I've read. As I said, I haven't played them myself). This title is definitely not worth spending your money on right now.Maybe everything will be fixed in a couple of months. But that will be a couple of months too late. An experienced video game company (Development, Publishing, etc.) shouldn't get away with releasing such an unfinished prototype of a game. It doesn't even matter that it's a AAA title. I think every indie development team would be ashamed to release something as broken as this. That's why the negative review."

The most fun comes from exploration, tuning and driving different cars, and racing online.I recommend this if you need a nice relaxing driving/racing game that isn't overly arcade.However, currently there are a few downsides:- performance issues after 2hrs of playing (memory/cpu leak of some sort)- buggy foliage textures on Ultra setting- JPEGified road textures occasionally- the highest difficulty AI (""Unbeatable"") just cheats. Insane acceleration and cornering. Stick to ""Pro"" or lower.Otherwise it's chill."

It has a ton of cars, tuning, custom livery creation for you to have your car exactly how you want. Story and progression is fun though not required to enjoy the game. Any car can be made to handle well, so the steering is more on the arcade side but not full arcade like NFS Heat.It's still a bit rough around the edges as it just launched. One thing I wish is that they had more in depth car customization like in NFS Heat, but the tuning part definitely helps make up for it."

It suffers from some growing pains, such as odd unspeicifed requirements for seasonal events which makes them seemingly impossible and very annoying, disconnections from social events at the worst times you could imagine, random crashes, work/reward lack of balance ( not as good as Horizon 4 ), some popping textures... But I ( want to ) believe that all, or most of these issues will be ironed out in the upcoming months, and we'll be left with another smooth, serene racing utopia. The map is immense, with a wide range of sceneries from jungles to towns and beaches, the weather is diverse and beautiful. The cars are, as usual, fun to drive, look great, and with a starting roster of over 500 vehicles, there's plenty to choose from, with more coming every week, if you're willing to pay. The stories and missions are not as diverse as the last time around, some of them are underwhelming, the others are fun. The characters are a bit cheesy, like they came straight from a comedy show. You land into the show as a ""superstar"", and no one, especially the radio presenters, won't let you forget that. The silent protagonist is also not silent anymore.The rewards overall are pretty underwhelming, for any accolade or objective you accomplish, you're most likely to get a chat line, which you can use 2 of at any given time. And with my constant connection issues despite having an okay internet connection, on top of a ghost-town feel to all spontaneous social events, I can barely even justify them existing. The potential is there and mostly fulfilled, but the game could use a little balancing and polish. Which I believe we will get."

Always.6) You can't queue for desired car class and race type in PVP, so be ready to dodge other lobbies - basically spending 5-7mins for 3 races.7) Multiple visual bugs just check the Youtube.8) Regular game crashes.9) The game will look satisfactorily only on the Extreme preset.10) Poor performance on top-level PC (70-90fps on 3440x1440 using 3080TI, 5120x2160 is unplayable).11) Poor HUD setting considering 21:9 gaming.12) Personally, offroad driving makes me sick.13) No ranked PVP.Refund submitted. -> Rejected, because I spent more than 2 hours in-game, well true, but to get to PVP you need to spend 5 hours, plus the time for initial graphics and gaming set up, ridiculous.In my case, I bought the Premium Edition version and got a time-consuming(PVP-wise) and buggy game. Quite a good run for its money, I guess.Should've read the negative reviews.Just to summarize:- Be ready to spend extra 40mins for 1 hour of pure traditional PVP.- Maybe this game makes sense you are a casual gamer who won't be playing PVP,  but what's the point then? Collecting cars? But you can't even discuss your own car with strangers because of no text/voice chat.- PVP-wise, it feels like a downgrade even from the original The Crew game from 2014 with proper lobbies and race track settings, and text chat(LOL).So Playground Games, keep us in touch with future updates and I'm not interested in new cars."

The forza developers always step up there game when it comes to forza games.There's multiple issues with this game, You have a good chance of crashing, getting glitched of the map and its almost unplayable And its been a couple of days and nothing got fixed. Current Muscle car's don't sound good at all, they sound like they have a v12 in them. The engine upgrading menu is probably the worst part of this game. like 10 speed race transmission? makes no sense and its not realistic at all for cars. I expected to have 4 speeds and 6 speeds but no. we get this unrealistic pile of garbage transmissions that make no sense. I personally think this game should be redone. Seeing that half of the stuff isn't realistic then the other stuff is realistic is really annoying. I may have 2 hours but i know forza games well enough to give a proper review. Do not buy this game I recommend buying Forza Horizon 4 Save your money for something more valuable."

Honestly I found the game boring and silly. I say that because i felt I was just running randomly in the wild off road?Races don't feel like real races to me and I understand maybe I should have opted for something more realistic? I bought it at release and it was quite buggy, with crashes and weird ""GPU Memory limit"" messages even playing at full-hd with a rtx 3070?? Also, in some roads when it rained the textures/water on the floor was completely messed up. Overall not a bad game, but I find it boring I am sure if you are into cars you may like it more?Refunded"

After playing a while, I can`t recomment this game, because of:1. I have a feeling like I am a beta tester right now. Game crashes, random fps drops, stutters, even when I have +/- 100 fps on ultra.2.  constant disconnects. There were few hours that I`ve played online without disconnects, but it`s an exception. 3. Graphics is not much better than fh4, it`s ok.4. Online is broken. They made only one entry point to it, so you are not able to choose which type of races you want to play.5. No ranked - RIP competition. In online 95% of players are too slow, inexpierienced. it`s boring to play solo with random guys.6. Meta is on (hello to boneshaker etc.)7. It`s in 60% same FH4. What is really good:1. Map and tracks. They are longer and more interesting.2. Slightly rebalanced tuning."

AAA games have a high standard to which FH5 did not meet right out of the gate. Immensely frequent crashes being the biggest catalyst to my disliking of the game. (I run a 3070ti and a R7 5600X for reference)THEN, just then, when they released some hot fixes and I was finally able to play for more than 20 minutes at a time, they reset all of my progress. Right back to the intro. I am completely unable to get out of this loop despite having made my way to rank 25 with a few decent super cars. (X rated)This game has many great things about it. Truly, I love it. But I'd wait at least 6 months before purchasing so that they can get all the kinks and bugs out of the game first."

ROAD WORKERS NEED TO BE PAID MORE! ROAD WORKERS NEED TO BE PAID MORE! Like wtf is wrong with highway? Maybe I don't get it, but is it common routine in mexico to steal asphalt from the 6 lane highway??? Why does my bugatti is driving on a green grass instead of the road??? Okay okay... Have you ever heard about fields? Do you know what colour are they? I personally started to questioning my knowledge, in fh there are 3 types of them. First one: ""La field covered in gas"". Second one: ""La extreme exotic field covered in every texture in game"". And finally, third one: ""Abyss"" ...At least they have some really good cars *BUT* the interiors of those are from toyota corolla 1997 with 400k miles on it.Anyways, the game is really really raw, too many bugs and glitches (exactly the same ones we had in fh4). They made the game feel more arcade, little to no new features. And mostly important, 50£ for the standard version of the game. At this point, microsoft is making fun of us.

Car handling is okay, most cars lose grip too easily - but when you tune one to your taste, it feels great, I must add.But generally speaking, the game is not _fun_. The skill score system rewards destruction/off-road drifting too much, or regular driving around too little.Loading screen.Coming from the NFS games, not simulator titles, I'm missing some of the casual/arcade-y/messing with the police aspects. 500+ cars, yes, but...... from the first minute you get A and S-tier cars. I don't feel progression. Loading screen. Speaking of arcade-y elements, I tried zombie/king/flag event and it's okay at best.Despite the loading screens and general wait time between opportunities to drive a car, simple online races were absolutely fine, most of matchmaking/wait times were much shorter than other loading screens. I would like more options of which online races am I signing up for. I got into an S2.998 race without owning a car that came even close. The rental car had so much acceleration in 1st-2nd gear, up until 130kph that even half-pressing throttle (gamepad user here btw) without burnouts was impossible - and I couldn't customize it as it was rental.Totally subjective opinion, but I am not a fan of the ""guy waving at stupid crowd melting at the sight of his/her car"" concept (of loading screens ;) ) and the general idea of Horizon festival. This was my first Horizon title ever bought, and it probably will be the last.I hate that a game bought on Steam has to be linked to a Microsoft account. I hate that every time the game starts, an in-game Steam overlay shows up with ""Do you want to link Steam and xbox accounts?"". No, I just want to play this 100GB $60 game, thank you.To end it on a positive note, acessibility features and prosthetic limbs are nice touch Microsoft added.edit: after moving the game files to the steam library on my nvme drive, loading screens became totally acceptable."

It maintains alot of quirks that are rather unreasonable this far in the series. One that always kinda made this game boring fast is everything is smash-able outside of a building, telephone poles, guard rails. trees basically the world is made of paper so not a go to game for any sort of realism or challenge to improve your driving or car setups. It still has the nearly identical cheesy story that it drags you thru as the last 4 horizons. Next on controller why is it mandatory that I assign RADIO STATION CHANGE, FORZA LINK (whatever the F* that is), and PHOTO MODE as MANDATORY controller bindings? Shifting isn't even a mandatory key binding. As the rant continues I find the game to gift way too much, there is no real goal or even the slightest hint of a grind. You just start the game and its already given you 5 million dollars in super cars and a half full bank account. Like give me a civic and a 1,000cr and let me struggle to get a lambo in a few days atleast. On a smaller note the flashing from the speed cameras is insanely annoying, it is slightly less aggressive then fh4 but id rather just turn it off. As for the positives, it does have very nice graphics and is running smoothly at all maxed settings on a 3080. The car selection is pretty good and its always had better customization options then regular forza."

While forza horizon 5 is not a bad game by any means, it is disappointing as a sequel. FH5 is effectively the same game as FH4. Some new cars were added, but some interesting cars from 4 are missing. This map is much less interesting and diverse than that in FH4, especially because there is no changing seasons. One positive thing i can say is that force feedback on steering wheels is better than in 4. Aside from that there is no improvements, still no story, still no style or direction, soundtrack still sucks. Also partying up with friends is still difficult, if not even worse than in 4. If you haven't played FH4, I reccomend you get that one for the lower price."

It also claims to have all these cars in it but the truth is you can only use a handful cause only some cars actually perform well enough to race with, and the online aspect is trash cause its nothing but people using modded tunes for their car that makes there car ridiculous fast and impossible to beat. All in all this game was completely underwhelming in every aspect and was a huge waste of time and regret it took a bit more than two hours to find out because the game had a lot of different content which failed in multiple aspects to appease."
5939,Myrvold,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zumbu/,1,,0,301.1,November,"27,",446,0,1,"Written when I reached 69 hours of gametime. ""For the giggles"".The game is basically a bugged map-DLC for Forza Horizon 4. It looks much the same, drives much the same. When loading in blueprints at other seasons (dry, wet, storm, hot), they always mention ""spring, summer, autumn and winter"", which is also used in the festival playlists. Though, elsewhere in the game, the Horizon 5 style season-names are used. It's like they didn't bother changing it all, so mashed it together instead.This goes for radio stations as well. My favorite is Radio Eterna, nothing beats some classical tunes when you rip out the countryside. It was called Timeless FM in Horizon 4. If you have a skill song, and change away from Radio Eterna, you get a message on your screen telling you to change back to the skill song. So it tells me to change back to Timeless FM (what the station was called in the last game).You got the random skillchain-stops, glitching out of the map bugs. The devs/publisher banning livery creators for rather safe liveries, but not doing anything towards modders, hackers, cheaters.You got the persistent performance drop of the game. Which means that you need to to re-start the game every 90-120 min to get the framerates back up. It's not that it runs out of memory, or anything in the PC gets to hot. It just... happens. With 5 out of 6 in my gaming-group.The online part of the game basically don't work. Cars load in and out at random, making driving together in freeroam pointless and impossible. It happens in the Eliminator games, it also means that while there may be 30 guys on a session together, you only see 5. Which then again makes it look like no-one is bothering with Horizon Arcade, which is an important part of the Festival Playslist, rendering that pointless.There are accolades that just don't work, or is written wrong (e.g 3 stars with a certain car on a certain jump. Which in reality is that car, 3 stars, but a different jump than what's written...). Festival Playlist dailies which are bugged and not possible to do etc. etc.When the game works like it should. It's a fun experience. Too bad it doesn't work as it should at all. Even with 69 hours *giggles again* at the time of writing, I cannot recommend this game to anyone without feeling dirty.On a 50% sale in the future, maybe.EDIT, 28th November 2021: New quite big bug. Props in EventLab events (former blueprint, custom races) may not load (more often not loading, than loading) on the newer events. ""Old"" events (1 week +) seems to work at bit more often. This makes many of the custom made races pointless... Again. I cannot recommend this game in it's current state.EDIT2: 30th November ""You've played an additional 8 hours, would you like to update your review?"". Yes Steam, I would. EventLab creations are more bugged that I knew. More often than not you get the checkpoint missed bug, and as you cannot change what you've made, you have to start over again... that's 4 hours wasted... Amazing."

This was my first Forza game, and I can say I'm very happy with my purchase. I only bought the $60 version at the time of this review, I can say the game exceeded my expectations and offers an insane amount of content.The driving is fun, and drastically changes depending the road type and car you're using. The graphics are some of the best, and surely the top of its class for this genre. There's so many random things to do and work towards so you can really do what you feel like, and I love that aspect in any game. The game offers freedom and player choice with its content and flexible customizability.I'd say the game fits much more under a casual and enthusiast setting than a competitive. The option for competitive play is definitely there, but high leaderboards are full of bug abuse and cheaters.Which leads me onto the main issue of the game, it is very buggy. Physics will break, your online connection will break, combos will break. It's annoying but the game is good enough where it's generally excusable, but paying this much for a game I expect these things to be fixed with time. I even had a friend who purchased the game only to have to refund due to it crashing on startup.The game is good and I highly recommend it if you're a racing fan, car fan, or just want a new gaming experience like myself. Just don't expect a completely bug-free game, and remember Steam offers refunds under a certain playtime if you don't like it or can't play it."

For a modern big budget AAA title, it sure is finicky. You really have to pray to the Microsoft Gods every time you start the game hoping the game will let you play past the Start Menu.

I don't know why it's not connecting). Here you can find a left-wing hidden agenda... lots of in the very beginning.Yeah, the game is still may be fun, if you're a fun of semi-arcade racing.

Some of these exploits were released with the game, no external hacks required and they banned people for using the exploits that were ALREADY IN THE GAME! But actual hackers dont get any repercussions at all. I have been banned for no reason, the message I received does not even state why I have received a ban and better yet the support team refuse to help even though I have screenshots of everything, the Forza website even states I have no bans and no ban history at all.

This game would genuinely be a great improvement from forza horizon 4 had the game actually work as intended. The world is bigger and the graphics look a lot nicer however it appears that playground games have focused to much on visual details of the game and has neglected to make sure it even works properly. Been stuck on the intro for about 3 hours on extreme settings. The game would run super smooth throughout but once i crossed the finish line of the intro the game would crash to desktop trying to load a cut scene forcing me to re launch the game and re do the entire into all over again. after completing the intro at least 5 times and trying on lower graphic settings i found out that the fix for me was to close discord and run the game as an administrator. In a perfect world the issues would end here but no. no they don't. after actually playing the real game for 10 min i decided to restart as i have heard people complaining about the game crashing on startup after the intro. Unfortunately what i didn't know was that me restarting the game would mean that i would not be able to play again as no matter what i do: running as administrator, playing on the lowest graphics, uninstalls and re installs, killing random apps in the background, and reading other peoples fixes on the internet, Would just lead to another disappointing crash as soon as you load into the festival. I will say this tho, if you can find away to make this game work i would recommend it however we are probably gonna have to wait for some patch or update. so i don't recommend the game or at least not in its currant state. in the meantime i will recommend forza horizon 4 if u wanna scratch the racing itch. Hopefully playground games fixes this game soon.... s a d"

If you played Horizon 4 when it came out, and did not played recently, basically the  whole experience was overhauled, specially the multiplayer aspect of it.  They add it a bunch of new activities to do online.The gameplay itself is the same as previous title, events play almost excatly the same way. What they did differently is basically the setting and made some improvements to the story missions in the game. Maybe graphically the game seems better but I am not so sure. What this game does extremely well is how fluent it is, the experience is almost seamless, you can basically go through the whole game without actually racing. By driving around and doing Accolades or tasks if you want to call them, is enough to go through the game and feels rewarding. The game never forces you to do any activities that you dont want to do, and there always different ways to progress."

Classic Forza graphics, awesome list of cars, better engine tuning than previous games, amazing and massive map (like honestly fantastic), mechanics are, as we know, very good, runs well, and just an easily enjoyable game. (Some users have reported consistent crashes - in the 30 hours I currently have played since early launch, I have had just one)HOWEVER, what makes this a tough one for me, is simply a lack of external car modification. That may, to some, not matter and sound stupid. And that's fine. BUT, to players like me who enjoy cars for widebody kits, customizing cars, JDM, drifting, stance, fenders, bumpers, etc. etc. - this is not it. They launched with the claim of EVEN MORE CUSTOMIZATION. They simply did not deliver on this promise in my opinion. Yes, there are a few more cars that have some nice mods, but they don't have Rocket Bunny kits. That alone destroys the potential for the JDM classics that we have loved for years and something like over 20 cars that used them in previous Horizon games. Just gone. It honestly puts a sour taste in my mouth. If you are like me and enjoy building out something like a BRZ, 240sx, 350z (insert car here) with an amazing kit, go play a previous game. Until they add more bodykits in, or, at the very least, get back that beloved Rocket Bunny license, I honestly can't recommend this for drift/JDM enthusiasts like myself."

Another reason to stay away).The BAD:- Glitches are everywhere and are breaking the economy. You can literally sit AFK and grind levels while you sleep . ­You can literally print money with Super spins from the Willy jeep mastery. That means you can have 400 cars in two days and around 60 mil credits. Also you can buy cars that aren't even out yet (no need to get them from the festival).- Visual bugs and low stability. You can be in a race or just discovering the map and see your frames drop for no reason. A lot of people still encounter major performance hits and CPU usage spikes, often staying at 100%, and result to restarting the game to try to regain performance. Sometimes there's multiples horizontal black lines that is ruining the image.- The multiplayer is for casual player and it forces you to play a type of race. They removed the ranked system to have it MMR based which is okay but you can't even look for Road races (S1) or just Dirt (A). When you queue you need to be lucky to find the races you want or you will be forced to play CC or Mixed road surfaces. Also when they removed the ranked system they removed the lap/gap/split time. So you have no idea how far you are ahead or if the person behind you is gaining on you on certain part of the race.- No mute option. You are force to listen to the people with open mics in your race. You can mute yourself but not the others. The only fix is to mute the game in the volume mixer.-Nothing is new from Horizon 4. It's the same game but with better graphics (if it's not lagging).The GOOD:- Visual update on the cars and the sounds of the vehicles are really well made.- Improved story line.- Great graphics when you boot the game (sometimes).PC info: Intel Core i7-8700KAsus ROG MAXIMUS X HEROCorsair Vengeance LPX 16 GB (2 x 8 GB) DDR4-3000Samsung 960 EVO 500 GB M.2-2280 NVME Solid State DriveAsus GeForce RTX 3080 Ti 12 GB TUF GAMING OC Video CardAsus TUF Gaming VG27AQ 27.0"" 2560x1440 165 Hz MonitorEdits : Correcting some errors and adding pc specs."

Though my feelings remain all the same: I'd take my $80 back and buy back on a bigger sale had I not left it open by accident over the refund period, because it just feels like an extension of FH4 rather than an entirely new game worthy of a new AAA price.  I used to think that the new sound alone was worth the price of admission, but the longer I play, the less that matters, and the more the flaws seep in. Once you get past the novelty of the new map, sounds, and graphics – this is FH4 all over again and while 4 has its fair share of flaws, seasons were a major feature. Horizon 5 didn’t contribute a lot we haven’t seen. It takes the formula and makes it bigger. Unfortunately, bigger doesn’t always mean better.If I have to point out  major issue: It’s progression. There isn’t any, nor are there any goal to the game. Making a game this open-ended is a double-edged sword. Put it this way: I set my goal to collect cars. All I’m missing are playlist exclusive cars, and I can’t do jack **** about it but wait. No one’s selling a Civic RX on the AH, and it’ll be free on the playlist. So that, for one, takes away the incentive of racing to grind money to buy cars. Because you can’t buy it. At all.That puts us to my biggest gripe: Seasonal playlists. It’s the true progression. The “story mode” presents little value – you can probably finish every race in the game in a day; another for the story if you can stand the dialogue. After which the content that remains is either drip-fed weekly or community made. I never liked it. It time-gates core contents and pulls on your FOMO. If you miss a season, you’ll miss rare cars. Your other options are to buy them at extortionate rates from the auction house or wait to see a rerun. What is this, a gacha? At some point I stopped having fun and just apathetically did things to get the rewards I want in a season. Or even not at all with Extreme E. There’s been a lot of improvements like featuring required cars as a reward in another challenge/shop, however the plethora of atrocious Trackmania-esque Eventlabs and Extreme E season that requires the use of  for 8 championships a month and rewards you with an exciting array of palette-swapped cars, palette-swapped race suits, or palette-swapped helmets highlights the fundamental issue of the playlist.IMO playlist feels like it goes against the whole appeal of Forza. What I loved about Motorsport 3-4 when I switched from GT4 was the liberty. There was a lot to do, but it never felt like a chore because you always have multiple options. It takes time and effort to get your first supercar, but not egregiously so (ahem mandatory license tests), and you can do things at your pace because that shiny Lamborghini isn’t going away in a week. So if you're going to make a game with 500+ cars and zero direction and progression–Why wall people from getting the cars they want by making them only attainable whenever the devs say so in a playlist? I felt the same way about FH4’s, but it at least has a  online mode. Even at my most burnt, I can still play FH4 longer. Roam online, chill, pull up to a Forzathon, see if anyone else's a weeb. Its lobbies fits 60-70 players and you can see them all over the map. FH5 online feels dead as you can only see people in your immediate area and no one plays Arcade. I’ve never seen more than 10 people on the map at once, and solo’d most Arcades. If this was a limitation from the bigger map, it proves my earlier point.The racing is not entirely pleasant. PvE, I think we’re all fluent enough in English to know what unbeatable means, so let's not play genius – it should be more figurative than literal. You're not fighting the AI for their driving prowess, but their ability to ignore laws of physics. Unbeatable placing you dead last to waste your time with traffic may require you to channel your inner Senna—specifically Suzuka 1990 Senna, T-boning your opponent into the first corner. A trick the machine learning AI certainly learned. I enjoy my fair share of challenges, but when said challenge is obnoxiously artificial, it’s not fun. It's cheap, difficult for the sake of being so. Some may argue this is even more satisfying, but truly, I'm not enough of a masochist to see that. I have a 6 paragraph rant about the AI of this game, but in short, just look up FH5 Unbeatable drag race and tell me how ""Git Gud"" can mitigate that.As for PvP - I thank the return of custom open, however the fact that it wasn't available from launch paints an unflattering picture of PGG's decision making. We still have ridiculously inefficient matchmaking, long load times, nonexistent balancing/woefully inaccurate PI/stats, wallriding penalty that can’t tell honest crashes instead of making wallriding less effective, and the removal of ranked that meant to, quote: ""create a safe online environment"" giving the exact opposite effect—placing the rammers, tryhard meta drivers refusing to get off their Boneshakers/Mosler GT3s, poor sod in a stock car, and everyone else who just wanna drive their favourite cars, all in the same pool.If you think I’m just a bitter old man–you’re not completely wrong. I can grovel on for days, but I'm petty because I've been a fan since Motorsport 3. I'm not obliged to blindly like a game I paid $80 when it has issues from its predecessor a decade ago—like having to manually scroll through hundreds of your own decals just to find Pirelli. It's not to say that FH5 is a bad game. It's technically apt, but creatively stagnant–having another HW DLC is proof. At its very core, the driving model is IMO still the best of its kind, Mexico while not visually all that exciting has tons of fun roads, and when stars align and rammers are gone, even an online race can be fun. However, in addition to the wall of text above, it feels like it has shifted its attention to a demographic with the attention span of a goldfish. They wrote this game for an age group that I’m confident does not give a single **** about the dialogue, while the rest of us have to suffer.Prior to FH4, the last Forza I played was FM4 and FH1 (we don't talk about FH2 X360), and I felt an overwhelming familiarity, good and bad. And this is FH4.5. It's been 10 years since Horizon 1, and beyond the graphics, I don't think we've evolved enough. Horizon's too comfortable without competitors. What else is there? A 4 year old Ubisoft game and a game axed not one year post release because EA? I'm not under the impression that interior animations have improved much if at all since FM3, and their answer to unique shift animations is still to completely ignore it–but we can now do the Macarena. With Rocket Bunny gone, the 240SX, S13, S14, and S15 Silvia have the exact same body mods they had in FM3. The 86/BRZ had less than in FH2. Gran Turismo had an insanely detailed photo mode since GT4 on the PS2. 10 years ago they sold paint as a paid DLC. Now they have a livery editor with SVG import feature and window decals. It took T10/PGG 13 years to reimplement caliper paint, a feature in FM2. I guess they also turned the livery editor UI vertical. Which IMO is worse. Matter of fact tons of UI elements in this game felt amateurish, but I can yap all the way to November on that topic. On the topic of liveries, I refuse to believe that I can’t transfer hundreds of my liveries from FH4 (MS Store) to FH5 (Steam) because of “technical limitations”. That’s my first experience with this game, and maybe why I’m so ticked off, and a big part of why I amassed 300+ hours.To sum? IDK. Driving fast good; janky Saturday-morning cartoon Spanglish dialogue bad. No progress make man paint car for 300 hours. Goodbye."

I'm glad I finally bit the bullet and decided to give Forza a try.I think there are around 700 vehicles in this game, and the 'custom liveries' feature is one of the coolest things I've seen in a game in a while. Basically, people make their designs, or download designs from others. Some of these livery makers are very talented. You get nearly unlimited aesthetic customization via this feature.Stay away from the Hot Wheels DLC. It is awful. I DO however believe the base prices for the single DLC cars is fair. I like how you don't necessarily need to 'buy' the DLC cars. You can snag them from the game's auction house from other players, often at reasonable in-game prices.There is a lot of emergent gameplay in this video game. I can't even count how many impromptu unofficial drag races I've had w/ other players in my freeroam worlds. Players usually count to three, by honking a horn, and then everybody takes off! A lot of fun, even if your stats aren't recorded. Racing, and showing off to other players in-game is very enjoyable as well.Game is pretty expensive at 79.99 CAD. Damn, I remember when main title AAA games were 59.99 CAD!Game is pretty bug free, I haven't really encountered anything egregious or amateur looking. Only issues I've had is an occasional CtD, but I've never lost any data.I can't recommend this game enough to people who love customization / tuning. The game's cars can be minutely tweaked, or as crazy as a '76 Jeep Renegade drag racer that hits 350 kph+ in less than 10 seconds. The choice is yours, and different cars have different uses. I don't really care for the story, or any of the characters in the game except my own. The story hasn't really given me any reason to get attached to them, and I couldn't tell you a single first name of their's without having to look it up. The setting in this game is great, being open-world, you get a huge area to explore, and seemingly unlimited track variations, as there are over 500+ roads present in this game. Mexico and its countryside are treated beautifully by this game's artists. The game really has a unique look to it.I feel that I've only just touched the surface of this game. I've yet to make a custom design for my car myself, and I haven't even collected 1/8th of the cars yet. I've barely progressed past level 55 in my save. That's another feature I like, the levelling up system, and the constant gaining of points while driving. The more advanced you drive, the more EXP, the more CR. Quite a sophisticated system, really. Game also has a spinning wheel device that grants you amazing prizes at random between races. You can win anything from a new car to 150,000CR. Not going to lie this is quite addicting, and I get excited every time I use it. Not sure what that says about me, as I don't gamble IRL.Oh yeah, don't think this game is restricted to just conventional asphalt races - there's everything from hill descents to offroad racing, to trailblazing, to speed zones, to drift zones, to gymkhana, etc etc. This game has a bit of everything.I run this game on an RTX 3080 + an i9, 16GB RAM, on extreme settings, (or ultra, whatever they called it). This game is super optimized. It runs super low on my card - despite the graphics being exquisite. Draw distance and reflections in this game are especially great. I also on a side note love the near unlimited variations you can do w/ your character's appearance. Like said previously, customization is the name of the game in this one.Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys video games. I'm sure anyone who picks this up will enjoy the gameplay, and the natural interactions you have w/ players in-game.9/10, if I was to assign a rating."

There's no count-down and that means you're pedal to the metal once the race starts.  Then you have at least 3 seconds of not being able to tell what RPM your car is at.  It makes it hard to turn up the difficulty because you're setting there roasting your tires and not getting optimal straight line performance.  This ruins some of the competition playing online without any visual clue what gear to be in at the beginning.  It's obvious this game needs refinement as well as it's pretty buggy with navigating the menu UI while trying simply alter the graphics setting.All this being said, the game is stunning.  Off-roading a real vehicle you'd normally play in Forza Motorsport is basically why I bought this game and that makes it fun to play.  It's a good time if you're looking to simply fool around."

6109,Fabityagi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fabityagi/,2,,0,37.2,July,"25,",201,0,1,"I don't usually write reviews, but this game has made me so disappointed that I think I will make an exception. First, I will start by listing the good parts of my experience with FH5:The refund process was great, the code garbage was off my steam account in a couple of hours, big thumbs up there.Secondly, I will list the negatives, the intro of the game feels like it was made for a target demographic of infants, even if you manage to fail the first showcase mission which in itself is pretty much a miracle, you keep on getting praised like the special little snowflake you are. But aside from the cringy at best, and downright insulting to intelligent beings, story. The driving itself, you know the most important thing in a driving game has gotten worse and worse with each new horizon game. 1 was good, 2 was the best out of all of the horizon parts, 3 was not great, 4 was bad, and this is just garbage. I was playing with a Logitech G29 for the most part, and the force feedback was astoundingly good for horizon, Motorsport 7's is still way better but it's good enough for an arcade racer. The thing that annoyed me most is that the cars had no grip in the rear, like with all the other horizon parts RWD cars are pretty much garbage until you swap out the drivetrain to AWD. In Motorsport 7 RWD is drivable, so it's not like they don't know how driving RWD should feel in an arcade racer, Microsoft just decided that horizon does not deserve the work needed to overhaul the driving system, rather they'll put in the option to have prosthetic arms and switch pronoun at will. WHO CARES ABOUT THE MAIN CHARACTER IN A DRIVING GAME? Put the character in a race suit and BE DONE WITH IT. TLDR FH3 but a different map and better force feedback on wheels. If you want an inclusion simulator full price is fair, if you want an arcade racer full price is an insult, id maybe recommends getting it for 20-25 bucks, but more than that is an insult to basic human intelligence."

Most of the land surrounding the festival are just full of boring streets and desert. There are definitely areas that are fun that's for sure, but it seems empty and barren. After traveling miles in any direction it seems to overcome this, but players seem to gravitate towards only a few areas (the festival, the volcano, etc..) which makes the entire game feel like nobody is there to play with you (at least in single-player). In addition to those cons about the map, there are bugs that cannot be overlooked at the moment with constant crashing and disconnecting among all users playing the game since launch. Although all of these bugs will probably be fixed within the month, it's ruined the entire experience for me; especially when you're about to win a race or are in the middle of a sick drift, and then the game completely shuts down on you or your car stops instantaneously. Although this new arrival in the Horizon series brings many new cool things for racers to enjoy, it's just not a game i'd recommend.TL;DR map feels boring and empty, cannot resolve with a convoy because of bugs currently in game. Constant freezing and crashing while playing the game among all players"

IMO, a worse location, but at least it's a bit bigger. Hopefully DLC will spice it up like they did for 4. CONS: - Very cringe dialogue + unskippable cutscenes = pain- Very overwhelming map and the game doesn't do a good job of explaining things to you- Online play feels like a regression from 4, with no ranked mode and the 30 second timer forcing you out of menus when queuing in a convoy- No good sense of progression in the base game, but then for some reason in the hot wheels dlc they added progression which locks you out of everything you've already unlocked. Pretty weird, the progression should've been in the base gamePROS: - Performance is good - Easily locks at 60 fps on 1440p (i7 9700k, 1070 TI). Solid 60 FPS on Steam Deck as well ! - Gameplay is fun as ever- Tons of car options - Tons of race optionsIn conclusion, this game feels like a reskinned  but that game was really fun so... Update: The Hot Wheels DLC is pretty darn fun, I liked it a lot more than the lego DLC for FH4. I still don't really like Mexico, but the racing feels good :shrug:"

Can't say I loved it, but I had some fun playing. Now after many years I buy a racing game. Basically because there is nothing else fun to play. And I should say this game impressed me from the very start. It's just beautiful to the eye: graphics are awesome, scenery is gorgeous. Driving is more than enjoyable. I would genuinely love the game... if it weren't for some flaws. There is not many, but they are exterimely annoying. First, the game crushes sometimes. Generally, I don't complain much about it in other games, but crushes in Forza are absolutely annoying. They happen in the middle of customization, reset my build and make me do it all over again. Second and most discouraging for me and my friend - co-op is a complete mess right now. It's hard to get into same lobby, and if we manage to do so, one of us disconnects shortly after. We can't play some game modes because after completing them we get stuck in one screen for eternity. Current state of co-op completely discourages me from playing with friends. I really hope this issues will be fixed soon. The game itself is very fun, I never thought I could enjoy a racing game that much. P.S. Some problems have been fixed, I can finally play with my friend with almost no issues. I think the game deserves a positive review now."

The graphics are good and there's alot of cars to choose from. HOWEVER. There are 2 problems with this game that makes me not recommend it. If you buy it for the eliminator aka battle royale or the playground games, ur gonna rage a lot. Physics in this game does not make any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sense. No matter how fast ur going, if you just hit a root on a tree, ur whole car stops, it doesnt drive over it or fly over it, it just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stops and its really pissing me off. If your playing the eliminator and ur driving into the forest/slump or whatever it is, ur finished. Theres also a bunch of logs in the forest that makes ur car go stuck, so thats fun.The second problem is a really strange technical problem. Every time I challenge or get challenged in the eliminator, my game always freeze for whole 2 seconds right when the destination in placed, which means that my car always just gets out of control because I cant see what im doing. This is so annoying because if my opponents car is the same level as mine or right below mine, he gets the biggest head start and ive lost.I've played the eliminator a lot and I've had a lot of fun, but those physics and technical issue is getting pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ annoying.

After continued ""updates"" that bring nothing new to the game, one thing has been brought new and my computer has suffered from it for a while. Unbearable microstutters. Supposedly the game has a memory leak or something, but it doesn't matter if I run the game on low graphics at 480p or max at 1440p. Pisses me off. Playground games needs to get their heads out of their bungholes and actually add NEW content, and fix their game. Stop adding stuff that was just in previous games. Future edit part 2. I was able to fix the fps spikes, but the game still feels sluggish. I dunno why. Guess it's an issue with moving fast in an open world game. I still recommend this game as it's better than Horizon 4, and you can't buy any of the older games now. But, if you still had the ability to buy the first three, I would highly recommend those games over this. So, go to a used game store and pick up a physical copy and play that. This game, feels lackluster and empty. But it can still be fun at times and the sheer amount of cars is neat, though, it's fun having a car game that has common cars, like the Motorsport series. It's fun racing a fully built up Yaris against hypercars. I'm writing too much. I give up. The end"

The money farmers are complaining because they can't play the game as it was intended to, you are not meant to have all the best cars after 20-40 hour or so, it has been like that since Forza Horizon 1. This game is about actually about playing the game/story mode and earning money and wheel spins through that."

It seems to have less content because the map no longer changes with the seasons. Biggest gripe after many Horizons, the career races are too short.  Boring has hell racing a 3 lap race, or a 3 minute sprint, etc.  There are 3 long races and they span the entire map.  Fun, but there is no middle ground.  Sure you can change a circuit race to be as many laps as you want with blueprints, but it doesn't count toward progression.The blueprint system is improved in that you can now place objects in your blueprints.  Trailers, grand stands, jumps, ramps, tractors, dinosaurs, it's all a great way to add life to a custom track. It's very fun to build your own track where ever you want, but the system needs some work.   One example, you cannot edit your tracks after setting the finish line.  This is insanely annoying.  You put a lot of time into a track and TEST DRIVE it, but cannot edit after the test drive.  WHAT THE **** IS THE POINT OF A TEST DRIVE IF YOU CANNOT UNDO WHAT YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY DONE?!  And quite often the custom assets will not load into the map the first time you start a race.  Great start, needs improvement. Short career races is a design flaw and not likely to change. Updates bring new bugs or races don't function correctly. I hope they can put some TLC into the blueprint system and it's checkpoints to improve it. This game is such a sub par version compared to previous entries,  can't recommend it until they fix all this crap."

However, I cannot recommend it at the time of writing this review due to one major flaw. The main thing that makes the Forza Horizon fun for me is the ability to just drive cool cars around in free roam in a convoy with my friends. It is impossible to do that at the moment because first of all it is hard to even get in a convoy. In FH4 you could just easily join people on your friends list in game. Now in FH5 you have to minimize the game and pull up the xbox app on your desktop and join them from that. More importantly though, once you get in a convoy you can't even drive together because your convoy members constantly disappear and reappear. It has been nearly a month since this game came out and this is still an issue."

It has the best graphics, most amount of features, the biggest and arguably the best map,  better seasons then Horizon 4 and much more. Now the question comes, is it worth the price for you? It depends. If you have played Horizon 4 and you can't get enough of it, then you'll feel right at home with Horizon 5, the gameplay is very similar with minor improvements overall. However, if you have played the Horizon 4 and you didn't like the handling and progression, there is almost no point of buying Horizon 5.If you are new to the franchise however, I think this is the best open world racing game out there as of this review."

There are lots and lots of cars. That is one definite pro to this game for sure. The one issue with this fact is, they all feel very similar to drive. There is definite lack of responsiveness to driving cars. This has been an issue in my opinion that have plagued all of the forza titles. They focus on having so many cars and so much variety that much fewer attention is put into place for making them feel unique to drive. The best way for me to really truly explain this issue, is if whom ever reads this, that they should go and play ""Dirt 4"" with realism settings on. That game has much fewer cars and its clear that every single one of those cars drive differently, sound differently, and behave differently on multi-terrain. In that game, one particular car might feel better and drive better to one person than another. I wish this were the case to forza. Other racing titles, such as wreckfest and need for speed heat even have better driving controls than forza. That's because there are much fewer cars. So more attention was put into making them feel different. The sad truth to this game is: Yes at some point i may have 600+ different cars in my garage like the last two games, I may only end up driving a dozen of them, depending on the type of event and their effectiveness. But Hey, there's more tire smoke and the cars sound better."
6190,gw,https://steamcommunity.com/id/guuLord/,1,,0,127.7,November,"9,",177,1,1,"ORIGINAL POST, NOV 9th:Performance issues after around an hour of gameplay, collision glitches when jumping from high places in Baja races on some specific vehicles, extremely short LOD distances on foliage, and an exploit that allows you to use an X class car on lower class races by selecting a car of any class and then picking a tune of a way higher class in the pre-race tuning menu. These are some of the issues I've encountered so far. The one where the performance tanks after a while and the foliage LOD being extremely short are very serious issues which require IMMEDIATE attention.Other than these issues, this game is very good, so definitely recommend as long as Playground keep themselves busy solving these issues.EDIT, NOV 15th:Today it's been a week since the official release of the game. The """"""""""hotfix"""""""""" which Playground has been promising since Day 1 of the early access has no ""hotfix"" in it unless the definition has changed, as I far as I know, a hotfix does not take 2 weeks, since these patches aim to fix urgent issues in a fittingly urgent manner. Playground games has proven how little they care about this game by allowing gamebreaking issues repeatedly reported by the community to remain there untouched for what seems to be at least 2 weeks until the ""hotfix"" release. Allow me to note the glitches which affect this game, in addition to the ones I already mentioned, which have obviously not been fixed.-Constant crashes.-Performance tanking inevitably after about an hour of uninterrupted gameplay (if you're lucky enough for the game to not crash at least twice in this period of time).-Car automatically resetting itself out of nowhere.-Constant disconnections from the game servers.-The suspension of certain vehicles may glitch through the ground after a hard jump (particularly the GMC truck in my case).-The rocks on the sides of the cliffs near Hotel Mirador Balderrama have missing textures and can be seen through.-Some accolades simply do not drop, this wouldn't be such a big deal if it was just a few, but some of them are related to achievements or bigger accolades, breaking those as well. For example, I can't get the achievement ""A Royal Affair"" because 1: it simply won't drop when I meet the requirements, 2: the butterflies literally just don't spawn in Horizon Life lobbies, just races and Super7 challenges. So far I've experienced this kind of issues with 15+ accolades.-Related to the connection issues, the game might forget you belong to a Club every now and then.-Issues that make the game's graphics glitch out when some specific GPU settings are present in NVIDIA GPUs.-Ground textures glitching out and being replaced with some bizarre black water looking texture, and the infamous low LOD distance issues.-The pothole textures in the Cara Este drift zone interrupt your point build-up, this can be perceived in game as suddenly ceasing to receive point when driving over them (I'm not sure of whether this is a glitch or a feature, either way it should be removed as it is nothing more than annoying and limiting when going for high scoring runs).-Some VIP benefits simply don't work, for example I had to pay in credits for some houses that the VIP thing is supposed to cover, with this even displaying in-game, but for some reason the game simply forced me to buy it anyway, so there go 1,5 mil Credits. I'm also not sure if I'm getting double credits, I should check this as other people have reported it.There are many more glitches which others have been reporting, but these are the most notable that I've encountered so far. It's unacceptable for a triple A game to not only release a game in this state but also refuse to fix it in any way, other than hiding behind the ""there's a hotfix coming"" argument when a hotfix is supposed to be a QUICK patch.NOV 19th:The hotfix finally came out, but as expected, it barely fixed anything. The level of incompetence is so unimpressive that it depresses me to think that this is the current state of game development. The only issue that was fixed seems to be the connection issues, everything is still the same.NOV 24th:Please fix this ♥♥♥♥ alreadyDEC 4th:A patch launched today. Horizon Arcade has been rebalanced and improved in a few ways so now it is possible to complete, even while alone. Some accolades have been fixed. Like 24 new cars. The game performance seems to be a bit more stable now. Connection seems more stable as well. Game is now more recommendable, but still more stuff to fix.DEC 11th:New series has already begun, I could not get the Min, Meet Max achievement because it was literally impossible due to glitches. First thing after new series starts? There's already a new glitched challenge. By this point the developer's incompetence is astonishing, honestly this game couldn't be any less recommendable.### EDIT, switched to LinuxIf you have an NVIDIA GPU on Linux, good luck getting past the first loading screen."

The first Matrix was a perfect world, without any form of evil, jealousy or greed, but people just went nuts, because humans apparently need an imperfect world. Forza Horizon 5 is that first Matrix-simulation and it drives me completely mad. From the get go you're this automobile-superhero that the world's been waiting for. Hordes of 24-year old (practically no exceptions) British people (after leaving the EU they decided to invade Mexico for no obvious reason), cheer you on in your overpowered vehicle. From the first second the game presents you some of the top cars. This might make some people jealous in the real world, but not in this game. Everybody is all smiles and giggles. Even the poor Mexican farmers who own the lands you thoroughly destroy with your plethora of luxury cars will never protest because: They love the races so much! Let me get this straight: The game is wonderfully made, visuals are top notch, sound is great and it works like a charm, but there is absolutely NO reason to play it. You don't need to race for better cars or better gear, because it doesn't get much better then your starting-kit, just more of the same. There's no antagonist you want to beat, because everybody is happy and technically you're already the greatest hero that has ever moved itself on four wheels, so why bother? If this is your wet dream, then go for it, but i think this game is perfectly boring. And just like that first version of the Matrix, I can't be in it because it drives me utterly insane."

It was annoying since forza reddits tend to delete threads that complain about instability so I had to dig up older ones where people gave advice.-set the game to run as admin.  This should only have to be done once.-validate files before every launch-go to C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Temp-delete the folder Turn10Temp.scratch before every launch.  I do this while validating.  Creating a shortcut to the temp folder saves time.-launch game-open task manager-kill explorer.exe-change priority of forza.exe to High-go into in-game settings and change any setting.  I change the speedometer to digital and back to analog.After performing this ritual, the game runs fine.  I don't know which step(s) are the critical ones and I don't care to experiment to find out.

That being said this game is my most favourite racing game I have in my possession and will still be one year+ from now.I have a few cons about this game however but let's start with the pros;-Pros        -The map is massive, the biggest I have seen on any racing game.        -It has the longest straight road that is the highway going from far left to far right and it is         perfect for testing out top speed, this game also has quite a few long roads that go all         around the map perfect for driving a getting in some practice around corners and braking         times and such.        -The vast amount of cars and races in Forza Horizon 5 and with many more to come         means that there will be many hours spent in this game without getting bored.        -With the Playlist being a thing there will always be more items to obtain whether it be         clothes, horns, money, cars or even wheel spins to get even more of those things adds to the         game even more.-Cons        -I have seen on quite a few occasions the graphics bug out, lately I have seen glitched         grass, trees and bushes as in they are rainbow pixels that turn into the correct item         once I get close enough. The roads have also been going either rainbow, no ground at         all or black with a metal type texture to it. Maybe it's PC issues only.        -Coming from Need for Speed where every car has mass amounts of customisation and         playing this game, in my opinion the cars lack that aspect. I think cars in this Forza Horizon         should have more customisation, although it will change to performance of the car some         people might want to have customised cars that look amazing outside of the performance         class cars that the game has already.But that being said I love this game and will always love it. I 100% recommend this game to any racing game fanatic it is fantastic."

A great game and almost ideal balance between arcade and simcade that is utterly ruined by being in alpha state at best and that will try and kill your enjoyment at every turn.No matter how many patches they roll out, FH4 has shown us all a simple fact. The game is utterly broken in many aspects that devs are unable to fix, be it due to incompetence or new generation of coders inability to make sense of all the twists of legacy code put on top of itself in a huge, ugly Frankenstein's monster. When they fix one thing, two more things break. They fix one of those two things - old thing they fixed breaks again. Etc, etc. It goes, and goes, until they arbitralily decide it will have to do, when in fact it won't do at all. Some bugs and crashes in FH5 go as far as FH4 release, and they are still here, and they are here to stay.That said, you won't get a better overall racing experience outside of actual simulators than from FH5. The game is just this big, racing feels just this good, and it gets better and better as you learn how to tune and drive. Sadly, there's just no competition. Not on PC. Forza Motorsport roots made sure modern NFS and Driveclub racing feels like junior karting in comparison, and Gran Turismo is kept as Play Station exclusive title.I can't recommend buying it. Not on Steam and not for full price. Technical state of the game is just this bad. If you want to try it, use Game Pass, in there base version is free and if you want to pay for upcoming expansions, car pass etc - your MS account will save all progress if you then decide to either upgade base version by either buying premium bundle in MS store or premium edition here on Steam."

Because of that I wish I could give it a positive review but they took so many steps back as well.Reduced the timer to join an event to a few seconds.Constant matchmaking bugs cause you to have to wait 3 minutes for the race to load for you to leave and re-create your party to get your friends who were left behind.Took away the ability for party members to borrow the leader's car for many events.I'll change my review when the devs start to use their brains and put basic quality of life into the game but they probably never will because microsoft.

The buttons feel like someone who liked the 90's web design thought that style should come back. It should not.The car list is.... awful to look at. I swear I've seen this weird angle in a railroad themed game 20 years ago and was meh then.Physics have changed from 4 and others. I use a Datsun 510 with a ""Squishy Tune"" which I've had in the car since Forza 3. AWD, 2.6L TT engine, ride height max, all rebound soft. It handles odd as it can corner on just 3 wheels and bunny hop. In FH4 if it rained this tune would cause ""extra traction"" and roll overs were easy to do. Here in FH5 it rolls over pretty easy as is. Havent been able to bunny hop reliably like games passed.Game modes dont get much explanation.The car to music volume was done poorly. I would spend the time to properly balance it so I can hear the music but the music choices in the game are not worth the time. FH4 had 1 ♥♥♥♥, 1 bleh and the rest ok on the rock station. FH5's list are not ♥♥♥♥ but they dont make me want to race. Top Gear, Cruisin' USA, NFS Underground, Wreckfest and others have at least 1 song to get you in a racing mood. Hell, Surfin Bird is less repetitive than some in this game.The AI has not changed from FH4 which is BAD. Do not touch them and don't let them touch you as you will lose unless its one of those floored into the corner crashes and even then they WILL be on track before you in most cases. The AI will ride the ""Fastest"" line like their lives depend on it, they probably do, so use that to your advantage. What I race is anything like 1985 and older so if you do too make sure you go for engine, AWD and tires before ANY handling mods as the AI goes for those style of upgrades. This has been an issue since FM 4, released in 2011, where acceleration is king vs handling in more cases than the other way around.Going to keep updating as I find new good or bad:The online  racing was so bad in 4 races in a row. Cars ping off into the wilds, popping into existence, not drifting but literally sideways, bouncing off players as things bounce around. The 510 Squishy Tuned Datsun got dragged into 3 races. HOO BOY it was AWFUL. The Forza Motorsports games with this tune on the 510 was pretty predicable, FH4 I had to avoid rain and this game it has too much side grip so it rolls too easy. Now instead of just 3 variants of the same tune its now FIVE. Took out a non racing car as I was just there for the points as I needed 1 so I did the Online event. This tune handles drastically different in these 3 races than just bumming around in free roam or the Arcade or AI races. The suspension would make these weird little jumps for no reason which made it hard to drive smoothly. As another player got closer these weird ticks got worse and worse. I didn't expect to finish well but this was nearly undrivable trying to corner."

My internet connection is fiber-optic and the ""Speedtest by Ookla"" test I just ran on it says my connection speed is: Download - 94.81 Mbps / Upload - 65.90 Mbps.  My computer and my internet connection are not the issue.Regardless of how low (or high) I set the graphics and video quality in the game, it is so choppy, it can't be played.  Each time you make a settings change, you have to restart the game and ""enjoy"" the opening 2 or 3 minute video scene (after the 1 or 2 minute load time).  I suppose you eventually get past this opening scene; if you make it that far in the game.  I never did.  In spite of doing my own online searches, updating drivers, looking on Steam for help, and trying setting change after setting change, I could never get the game to play satisfactorily.  It was always so choppy the car was essentially uncontrollable.  After “researching, updating, restarting, and watching the 2 or 3 minute opening video” over and over (and over and over, and over and over…), I am not sure how many hours I spent (unsuccessfully) trying to get the game to work acceptably.  But, I do know Steam considered it “gaming time”, because they denied my request for a refund because I was logged into the game for over two hours.  I was really logged in for 4+ hours over several days after I purchased Forza 5, but none of them were actually spent playing the game - only trying to get it to work.  Forza 5 is the first game I purchased through Steam.  Between the game and Steam’s response, I’m not sure which one I’m impressed with least."

This is absolutely unacceptable and ruins the game. If you could figure out how to actually get player versus player races to populate I will change the review. I'm okay with setting the radio issues to rest if you just make the game actually competitive and playable. Don't worry about the scoreboards being full past the 100th percentile with hacked scores, just fix the lackluster networking for the LOVE OF GOD.This AAA game has serious problems. Networking issues to the extent that anyone you are trying to play with will vanish either appearing later or tossing you into a new session. Completion of events will also throw a DC notice. Any type of PVP race REQUIRES you to find a ""convoy"" using a total lack of communications technology to find drivers to join you and then drive to whatever event. They spent a LOT of time on programming COVID masks and making avatars for disabled female minorities and not ANY time improving the radio to at least the base standard of Forza 3. They need to patch to finish this game ASAP fixing networking most of all followed by making it much easier to find actual live players to race against. The fact that an extremely fun and graphically amazing game can have such massive and fundamental shortfalls is embarrassing and emblematic of the current state of AAA gaming. Everyone is using the same avatar because of the woke influence of the publisher and ignoring the people who actually purchase and play the game who are all forced to use the same avatar. They released a patch to address networking issues and now it's even worse."

Online worlds are sparsely populated, it's rare that you actually come across someone else while playing open world.- There is significant network issues when playing multiplayer races. For example, post-race leaderboards will display an entirely different order than what was observed, meaning you can finish ahead of another car but still be shown as having lost to them in the post-race leaderboard, which determines series points and rewards.- INSANELY long load times for singular multiplayer races. Not just a load time to get into online, but a wait time of multiple minutes before each race which are only 3-5 minutes long. It's entirely possible that, in a 3 race series, you spend more time in load screens than in races.- Optimization is extremely poor while not bringing any visual improvements from FH4. The graphics look worse and run choppier than the previous game, which I've tested on the same hardware on the same days. The difference in stable FPS is especially jarring.- Don't even bother playing this game with a wheel, the ffb is best described as ""numb"". Of course in an arcade racer we're not expecting AC levels of accuracy, but some sensation would be nice, and the game is incapable of delivering sensations like wheel spin and rough road to the wheel.I really want to like this game, but it's either a placeholder for whatever's next in the series, or a sign that this series has already reached it's peak and is now on the decline."

It has its issues, such as lack of (quality) dlc content, pretty mediocre forzathon seasons with recycled prize cars, and some janky (but manageable) wheel support. But nevertheless, the base game has some of the most incredible visuals, the biggest car roster, the most superb car controls and sounds, and an incredible world with plenty, and i mean PLENTY, to do.I'd say wait for a sale and get the deluxe edition, you get the best bang for your buck, and youre not missing out with the mid dlc.I will say that the community management is absolute garbage. Some of the members of the crew that manages the online community and community events are some of the most corrupt pos people ever. This doesnt affect my view of the game however, its two different sides of the company. But i figured i throw it in here :)"

I have had multiple instances in the past where I outright haven't been able to play the game because authentication broke somehow. And despite being a full-price game that's , the game relies on this login AND is technically always online, despite multiplayer functionality absolutely not being critical to the core functionality of the game besides populating races with AIs that are literally just normal AIs but with other people's names on them.This game also has a tendency of leveraging FOMO, as limited availability vehicles make up a significant portion of the game's roster, with these vehicles only being available via either a rotating shop or challenges within the game's battle pass equivalent- you have no way of knowing when a particular vehicle is going to become available again. Or even  that vehicle will be available again.With these issues in mind, it's kind of hard to seriously recommend this game, even with me genuinely liking it."

Sorry but as a developer I can't stand this bad of a user experience.  Refunding.EDIT: Bought again and got wheel working.  The game itself is actually pretty good.  Would love to recommend it but I can't go 15 minutes without it crashing.  If I can resolve the issue I'll update my review but since it doesn't even throw an error it's impossible to debug the actual cause.EDIT #2:  Fixing the crashes is impossible.  They don't even throw a helpful error for you to debug it with and that's error handling 101.  They're not going to fix the game either so make sure it's stable on your machine before the refund period is up...

Only fun is just driving around and not entering events, because it is a certainty that when you do enter an event you will be loading several times (both going in and coming out from the event at the end).

Not changing this review until this is changed.Update:Eventlab Creation does not allow you to edit a route after saving it, so if the checkpoints are bugged, kiss that route goodbye, because you have to start over instead of just editing the track you made, a feature missing for some inane reason I'm sure. Online play also still lacks options, allowing you to pick ranked versus unranked and so on, but not what performance class nor car type nor even race type. These should be basic options that aren't relegated to sparsely populated custom lobbies. A personal gripe as well there is no ""stock"" racing option. Content wise, the game is fine and I'm aware the game will be regularly updated, but among the sea of accessibility options, the game severely lacks some quality of life changes that Horizon would have really benefited from.Update2: There has been an update regarding the ability to edit map creations. Improvements on memory leaks, but will often find the game begin to lag for no reason on occasion still.Update3: For those running into the aforementioned FPS degradation, turn off overlays for applications such as Discord or GeForce experience. The developers have cited this as contributing to the memory leak that causes performance degradation. That being said, I do believe as these are commonly used applications, the developer's should really dedicate themselves to addressing this issue such that a normal user experience isn't impacted.Update4: Horizon Open is bereft with ramming, and your only method of recourse, reporting, is located on the Forza website rather than inside the game. Furthermore, if you didn't take a screenshot or have a video using an overlay program, even though they cause FPS degradation, your report will not be processed, so good ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ luck because the developers made such a stupid decision on handling reporting."

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

I really could not give a fk about any of these, I don't understand why the modern gamer must be rewarded constantly for doing the most basic of functions, incredibly patronising and annoying. Game really is for kids with 0 attention span and need the constant validation they they are doing something. It's just straight up lame and kills any sort of immersion. Cars are way more arcadey now and soulless, all feel the same, most online races with other payers are just maxxed out supercars crashing into the side railings and poles. Actually better off playing against AI for a proper challenge. Not a very social game either, no one want's to go on cruises or anything,More gamers than actual car guys playing this is probably why. Forza 5 is not a game for car enthusiasts."

They are fun. Most of the critique above is still acurate - sad as it is. I'm below 1$/hour now, so I can't really say anything. Playing online still sucks - I had a lot of rage quits. just because it didn't work properly...Edit: Now - 5 months after release - it has improved minimally, but the original review is still valid. There is some kind of custom online racing but not the way ranked would work.Edit: Now, after almost a year, some things get fixed, but it's still too buggy for a billion dollar revenue game. Game crashes all over, disconnects, ...don't buy it for full priceEdit: Not I'm at almost 400h and I don't think I will play much more. I did the weeklies, that's how the hours came together. Now in early december 2022 after a year of recycling I don't see the game improve much over the future. Do not buy. Play FH4, I'll go back to FH4 as well I guess. Also I can't get any more cars without gifting cars, because the garage is limited to a thousend cars. Fair enough. But today I had to delete paint on my cars to have paint on a new car which really sucks ass.Edit: Uninstalled it. There's so much better stuff you can do with 130GB. If I come back to FH, it will be FH4 and not FH5. Don't pay more than $25, content gets recycled and all the above criticism"

The games just got better and better.Sadly the Series seems to have peaked in FH4.FH5 has some glaring issues that were always present in the Forza series, but haven't been fixed.- The AI cheats like hell. Even worse than in FH4. i.e. when driving a Vulcan through a Corner at its limit with max Downforce, a random Silvia overtakes you with a 200km/h difference.- The AI cant handle higher performance classes. Try driving the Goliath with X cars on unbeatable, and you have to try to lose to be able to do so. The AI cars just rocket into every available Wall.- Graphics Bugs are quite common.- The Auction House is filled with bots (well I guess its realistic nowadays)- Rallye Stages are Street races with a bit of dirt in between. You cant do a proper Rallye Race only on Dirt Tracks.- The Map is just Boring. I don't need a huge map for the sake of being huge. Only the Outskirts of the map are visually stimulating, while the middle is just plain boring and empty.-Lower performance classes are neglected. Every part of the map seems to be tailored towards the high-performance classes with wide roads and sweeping corners, making lower classes boring to race.-The whole Festival thing is getting old now. Seriously.After all this nagging i still think its an okay game. Too bad this game has no real competition (The Crew 2 does not count). I still play this every now and then due to a lack of better options. I just wish microsoft and Playground games weren't this happy with the mediocracy they create."

On top of that, this game crashes so easily. Playing music in another program? Crash. Have a chrome tab open? Crash. Discord open and not even doing anything? Crash. Have no other programs open but try to paint a car in game? Crash. I shouldn't be having issues like that when I'm running a 3070 and 64gb ram. I even checked my usage and it's not even close to maxing out anything on my system. I really like the Forza series and this has been a massive let down for me."
6509,A Smol Wuffer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/popejackal/,1,,0,318.2,November,"25,",139,0,1,"Prior to the update w/ the Rocket Bunny wide body kit, I probably would've given this a light recommend. BUT, ever since the update, the game has become such a resource hog, performance plummets when trying to do any sort of streaming on it, even when decreasing the graphics quality to low since it likes to hog ALL OF THE VRAM. There's also instances where making custom blueprints would refuse to load when you're in a convoy and the game would boot you out of the race and bug out for everyone else in the convoy, AND if you get the unfortunate instance of the game unloading the whole map and reloading, you end up falling through the void, effectively softlocked and have to reset the game itself.That being said, when it works, it works...okayish. But PGG and Turn10 not taking the time fix the game breaking bugs and the club tags STILL bugging out, along with certain people effectively not being able to launch Forza anymore ever since the RB wide body kit update has soured my whole experience in thinking PGG/Turn10 doesn't want to fix the game up aside from ""You mean you want more cars?"" is quite disappointing because I did enjoy this game to a degree and love the Horizon 5 community that I have come across on Twitch but...it feels like the devs don't care enough to polish the game and stumble back multiple steps after going forward 2 steps."

No one who has remotely any idea about UX design would ever approve this holy mess of an UI.Every single car I have tested so far is controlled like a brick. If this is supposed to be anywhere near what is considered realistic then the car manufacturers out there must all be stupid like hell. The only purpose of a car is to be driven, how can something be this bad at its main purpose? A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wheelchair is faster while better controllable than those cars.Do not even try to master a car, because not only takes it forever to get from one race to another for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason, pretty much every event given you different cars to drive. You wanna change the car for the current event? Guess what, you will have to quit the event and we will put you in the middle of nowhere because it is so much fun to drive to the event again, right? right? RIGHT? Only worse than the time you need to get from one event to the next are those unreasonable loading times out of nowhere. Everything works fine, but suddenly the game decides ""Hey I wanna show you a black screen and a spinning wheel for like forever, well just because ♥♥♥♥ YOU that is why"".And do not get me started on those ""world activities"" like XP boards and such crap. Who in their right mind would ever say: ""Well this is a racing game, why not place some board on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ roof and let the player figure out how to get there with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ car. This sure sounds like fun, right, right? RIGHT?"". Whoever considers those elements fun a racing game sure must love some prostate cancer, for some extra fun.If you think a colonoscopy sounds like fun, you should buy this game."

For some reason the developers think that adding more cars is an excuse for making a lackluster and boring story with no depth to progression. The games don't change from one another, if you want to try it get it on game pass or on a huge discount otherwise it's simply not worth the money.The multiplayer in the game is horrible and not fun, in the open world people disappear constantly and convoy system doesn't work properly. Map sucks and isn't fun to drive around with only one decent drift mountain that barely passes as a good drift area. AI cheats at higher difficulties breaking the laws of physics in front of you and having infinite grip allowing it to accelerate through corners.Cars all pretty much feel the same. If I want to make an older car capable of s1 class I have to add a ♥♥♥♥♥ looking front splitter and rear wing that every single other car will have with no variety being added even to this day. In regards to meta tuning there are upgrades that are more PI effiecient than others making you never want to pick those upgrades, as a result of this only a couple engines should ever be used because all the other ones just suck."

Just buy this game!Almost everything you loved from the previous titles got better here. Beautiful visual, tons of contents, banger soundtracks.That said however, there are some downsides :- Online experience is still wonky, friends invisible even when already in convoy, and there's a frequent disconnection issue- Some annoying bugs, both gameplay and visual bugs (no, it's not your GPU artifacting, it's the game)- Game requires heavy computer power, if you're running max settings (extreme), 8GB of VRAM isn't enough. And it eats through 98% of your GPU power. Do not run any other applications in the background, even Youtube video gets heavy if being run at the same time with FH5. Also, if you've played for like over 2-3 hours, you'll notice stutterings which indicates something like a memory leak."

They all stick to the racing line like they're on a disneyland ride, completely ignore physics, and you have to rewind or restart the race over and over until the 1 AI that's always far ahead of every other car in the race decides to be slightly less insane. Once you pass that AI it becomes completely worthless like the rest of them, and never even tries to pass you. It isn't a race with 15 other cars, it's a race against 1 with 14 obstacles you either pass in the first turn to have a chance at winning, or have to restart the race until you do."
