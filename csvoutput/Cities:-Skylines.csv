Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse. Its hard finding games that I can play because I don't have use of my hands. I would recomme it to anyone with a disability.
2,Rocket,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketkiwi/,"2,800",90,1,128.6,March,"10,",255,51,1,"This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible."
3,Umph,https://steamcommunity.com/id/umph/,"1,423",111,1,323.5,April,"19,",161,15,1,"In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more."
4,Slyrae,https://steamcommunity.com/id/slyrae/,476,23,1,513.3,May,"11,",152,9,1,"This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.Some of the things worth noting:- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.- This list just goes on and on...The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :PTo sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!"
5,kybeau,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kybeau/,399,17,1,126.4,May,"19,",630,32,1,"For 2 weeks I debated purchasing  (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, ""screw it"" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.In a nut shell,  is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.+ Replayability value is here 100%+ Sound effects are great and very life-like+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, !+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though+ The ""basic"" version of  offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the  unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call  : comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. : In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting  first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with  since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)All in all,  is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo,  and , bravo: thank you for this amazing game.9.5/10If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you,  - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)"

7,TheLGR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLGR/,338,26,1,184.8,March,"11,","1,756",7,1,"This is a truncated version of this video review:If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy."
8,Doc Rock,https://steamcommunity.com/id/doc_rock2/,627,20,1,29.6,March,"10,",896,36,1,"Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The ""Chirper"" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games."

At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance.

16,"[REDi]1R MAJ princecoo [A,D,ds]",https://steamcommunity.com/id/princecoo/,426,38,1,76.5,April,"24,","1,217",8,1,"Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.Sim City, eat your heart out."

26,purple ace,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zebdrinkscoffee/,431,19,1,226.8,March,"16,",256,5,1,"Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.MAP SIZE: 10/10The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.AI: 7/10They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.INTERFACE: 9/10The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.HOW IT RUNS: 10/10It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video: THINGS TO DO: 9/10There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.DIVERSITY: 9/10The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.CLUTTER: 8/10Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..PRICE: 10/10For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.OVERALL SCORE:90% To PerfectWould I recommend this? Yes!"
27,220hertz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/220hertz/,340,9,1,"2,515.4",January,"15,",309,13,1,"Hi. I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it. If Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.As a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.The base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.Also, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).The grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.So, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation."

Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens.

This is you, too? Well then, that's because Colossal Order has brought a new era to City building simulation. But they didn't do it alone. I am not talking about Paradox Interactive only, I am talking about the community. Yes, this is one of those games, where the community not only kept this game very much alive to this day, but enriched and has even done a better job in some aspects than the developers themselves. So what you see in Vanilla Cities in 2022, is not even close to the experiences you unlock with a little help from the Steam Workshop. Yes, yadda yadda, city building simulator, forget about the *cough cough* other ones , the games you used to play when you were little. Cities: Skylines takes the cake. But let's talk about a few pointers before you put this one into your virtual shopping cart: - You just wanna play the vanilla game and chill away for a bit? You can absolutely do that, but if you're enjoying yourself and also find yourself building a new city over and over again to ""do it right this time"", then please try out mods, you will not regret it. - Once you do that and suddenly your desk turns into a city building planner's office, then commit to it. A new city is like a blank canvas for you to create and once you have created and you see everything working, you're going to feel VERY satisfied. - Feeling all satisfied and stuff, do one thing for me as well: If you do dive into the workshop and try one or say five hundred out of the bazillion mods that exist: Do favourite and give a ""like"" to the creators, it's only one mouseclick after all. These boys and girls spend their precious time to make beautiful and awesome stuff for you to use for free. The least we can do is show them our appreciation and try to help them improve if necessary. - Speaking of appreciation: You will notice that while the base game of Cities: Skylines is rated quite positively, most of the DLC's and Content Creator Packs are often viewed as a ""mixed"" bag. To be clear: Yes, some DLC might not be for you and no, you don't NEED to have them all. BUT (!) They do add more variety to the game, they do enhance the experience. Choose carefully which ones are for you and keep in mind that this game can entertain you for 1000's of hours (as it has with me) and I am COMPLETELY fine with Paradox releasing several new DLC's every year, along with the content creator packs. The pricing is mostly fair and I have so far not been disappointed. (That's not to say there are no flaws or room for improvement!)I believe Cities will continue to rock for a few more years, until a successor is on the horizon to again lift city building simulation to the next level. A big, massive, huge thumbs up from me!"

Paradox is really getting lazy on their work to milk as much money as they can out of their fanbase. Even the trailer video for their recent financial DLC shows their lazyness with how lackluster and boring it is. And the more they release these little content packs, the more you realize how much they've been setting this up from the start. You want a financial institution in your city management game?

It is just f'ing amazing that Steam is allowing companies to distribute their own launchers that send people to their own stores without consequences.Great game, but I will not tolerate this crap from Paradox.Small change as I just saw the joke in it:This launcher isn't ""spyware"", it's actually ransomware (3 new EULA's), lolWe agreed to the EULA in steam.I will not agree to the EULA in a stand alone program that is installed without consent and definitely not wanted.It might not be spyware, but it's definitely ransomeware as I can not access the game through the platform I bought it.Anyone with a braincell knows you are going to patch that workaround the first chance you get, for obvious reasons.You changed the terms of the contract when we bought the game (5 years ago!) to require additional software to run it, now enjoy the ride you programmed and saw coming per the title of the patch note.Edit 31-0-2020:This launcher is now to stay: Instead of reverting this update that bricked the game for many players, they are sticking to it instead of fixing it internally and then try again.They made it very clear they don't care about their customers.I would highly recommend to avoid any Paradox published games and if you must play them, go the ""unofficial"" route because what you buy is not what you keep and they will gladly ♥♥♥♥ you over at any time.The next EA cancer is officially here, so I vote with my wallet and horrible mouth to mouth advice regardig any of their titles.Ps; Steam doesn't gives a ♥♥♥♥ either so consider buying from GoG instead of Steam for single player games.On a tiny little detour for all you future wannabe community managers, don't be a jackass to your players, they will be one right back at you ;)//end"

Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the  DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. 's experience with  shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes.  is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about , equaling or surpassing most innovations  brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the  DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming  DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.—————————————————————————"
54,Yeen Yeen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TrashYeen/,136,8,1,42.3,March,"22,",702,0,1,"This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.Pros:- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). - District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.- Natural resource exploitation for more income.- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)Cons:- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions."

This is Pablo, from SimNation.Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1."

59,Omnirock,https://steamcommunity.com/id/omnirock/,168,12,1,61.6,March,"16,","1,296",6,1,"Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the ""best"" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.PS: Kill Chirpy."

As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them. PROS:No EA.No EA Origin.Did I mention no EA involved?Also no EA.-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.The only thing I don't like about this game so far?@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)So far and still hours later, 10/10.**EDIT 5/23/2015**I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.Game still kicks ass!"

The difficult thing is to keep the city going. ⚖️Finding the right balance between important areas like education, public safety, health care, firefighting, water supply, electricity, economy and much more is definitely not easy. And the more the city grows, the more difficult it becomes to master these things.🚦In addition, there is the complex traffic simulation, which also needs to be closely monitored.For example, you can spend several hours designing and building a working highway exit. After a while, after you have expanded your city, built a new district, recruited more inhabitants, got the economy going, the exit you built does not work as it should, usually it just makes things worse and a newer, better solution is needed.💡This concept from the example above also applies to the other areas of the game.What sounds frustrating at first is a real blessing for the game. It is motivating, challenges you and your thinking, and makes it hard to stop playing.💭I hope you understand what I am trying to say: You have so many possibilities and when you think you have finally done something right, it is disproved in the next moment and that's what makes the game so exciting and challenging.🔋Many games also develop so-called DLCs, which are usually intended to expand the players' experience. This is what the developers of ""CS"" do very well and have also really convinced the one or other time. Some of the expansions really stand out, others can be bought for a small pleasure, but are not really must-haves.🔎Here is just a brief overview and recommendation (more detailed information would require a separate review):💰Sounds too good to be true? Well, the DLCs and other little expansions have their price...If you add it all up, you'll easily get over 200 Euros. But the good side: The purchases are of course optional and the important in-game changes come for free with the updates!📢By the way, it comes with 9 different languages and thus also expands the fantastic community.👀As you have seen, this game already has a lot to offer. But the incredible thing is that there is even more: the steam workshop and its community!⚙️Anyone who is familiar with programming can create mods for Cities Skylines and share them with anyone who owns the game. And WOW, some people would have done better as developers at Colossal Order. These players, who programmed mods in their spare time, have created real game changers. Actually, I don't even want to play the game without such mods anymore, because they bring awesome additional features.🛠Besides mods, there are also assets that can also be created and provided by anyone. And WOW 2.0, there are some really unbelievable nice looking buildings, props, vehicles, streets, save games, maps, color corrections and much much more...📜In summary, this is the recipe of Cities' success and why the game is still very popular after almost 6 years. Constant development, new things, new features, for all areas and ideas. And if something is missing, create it yourself!"

For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - ""buy more of this, it will enhance the experience"". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, ""Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?"" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake."

Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero.

Just gotta get a University down and THEN I'll quit for the night.Pros:1. Excellent Tools - almost everything is easy enough to use, but hard to master. Just like any good tool should be.2. Visual Appeal - This game looks great! And it's not a new game anymore.3. Satisfying Mechanics - I normally dislike progression systems, but the ones here works well (with a few exceptions). The city logic makes sense. 4. Mods Mods Mods!Cons:1. It's really, really dense. I had trouble with this game until I had a chance to play Surviving Mars. Then the mechanics ""clicked"" better. 2. Some systems could use a WAY better explanation in the early game. For example, it would be great to have a better idea that early road placement is critical to avoid early-mid game wall (of traffic).3. Beginner mistakes mean lots of complete restarts. It can be frustrating. I recommend to bail at the slightest sign of trouble rather than trying to duke out a bad situation. 4. The simulation itself - There is a day and night, but ""night"" is multiple ""days"" long and it takes ""days"" for people to transport themselves just across the city in clear traffic. It's weird, I don't like it. 5. Traffic AI is abhorrent. Thank heavens it doesn't simulate crashes. Designing roads in Vanilla (without mods) requires a different approach from real life. Intersections and complex road junctions should be avoided in favor of interchanges and merges. Even the suburban grid requires ""tricks"" to get working right.Despite all the cons, I love this game. I just hope that the next iteration includes a much better tutorial and more accurate simulation."

Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!"

Buy this. You won't regret it. This game has two sides. Out of the box it is a fun, but somewhat repetitive after 100 hours, city simulation game. It'll still take up months of your time, but eventually all your cities will look the same.The mods is where the game truly becomes a masterpiece. Once you get the right mods, it truly becomes a giant sandbox. You'll be able to do everything from combine buildings to creating parks to the tiniest details, to combining thousands of props to create your own buildings from scratch right inside the game. Take a stroll around the city, hop on a bus... You can dream it, you can probably do it.  Pro's: - Various play styles. The developers included mods to enable Sandbox mode and Hard Mode, so you can choose how you wish to play. Want to play without money first, then turn money back on? Sure, just turn off the Unlimited Money mod! - MODS. No, seriously, the mods make this game what it is. Between Move It, Plop The Growables, RICO, More Beautification, Anarchy mods and TMPE, this becomes a completely different game. You can do pretty much anything. - Assets. The workshop is full of extraordinary assets, and it grows larger every day. - The community is amazing. Con's:- The game is build on the Unity Engine. This engine was not meant for simulation games, especially of this size. It doesn't support lazy loading, meaning all 81 tiles are all loaded and rendered at all time, and all assets (vanilla and custom) are loaded into the RAM for the entire duration of the game, whether you use them or not. As such you'll need a decent amount of RAM and a decent CPU to run the game. - Traffic takes some thinking. Cims are abysmal drivers, and so just slapping down a few roads is not enough. You'll have to start learning a bit about how traffic works. There are Traffic AI mods that improve things, but they are quite CPU heavy. Yes if: - You're looking for a sandbox city builder where you can build whatever city you like. Grab a few mods and it becomes a virtual sandbox for you to play around in. - You want a sequel to SimCity 4. No if: - You're looking for an in-depth socio-economic, demographic city management game. There is no political system.  - You own a system with an IntelHD GPU. Just don't, it clearly says it's incompatible. Stop complaining the game doesn't work."

Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population.

Yes, there are a lot of them, but you don’t need to rush to buy everything at once – each extra content can (and will) keep you occupied for a long time, so buy them little by little.

The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. What I love:Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.Not so great:DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely."

It's one of the best city builders I have played within the past decade.  The other one is Cities XL, which I played heavily before Cities Skylies came out (unfortunately that game, Cities XL, is outdated and just wearing; not good for long play).This game, however, if lively, bright, inviting, smooth, and fun.I know a lot of people have an issue with Paradox's ""DLC policy"" but you're not required to buy DLC to enjoy this game.  The game itself is fun and has updates on its own.  Also, the game is open to mods, which means you can add assets and other things created by other fans of the game from the workshop without having to worry about the DLC....and I wonder jsut how many people may argue about the DLC may have bought an expansion pack for an online game (WoW or any other,... Final Fantasy 14 in my case).  I can't knock these worked on mini-expansions small prices when I spend $50 on an expansion for an online game that allows me to use 3 new jobs and travel to a new area...even thought I will be right next to people who can access these things without me having them (meaning the $50 was just a glorified unlock code, essentially)I mean they could wait and make a massive expansion and release a fullsized expansion but I don't see the issue with sevelal small ""expansions"" called DLC.  DLC that one could wait until it goes on sale and buy them a bit along.And that is why I recommend this game.  A company that continually wants to expand on their property to keep it alive.  If you see it as them just being greedy, you're not oblidged to buy it, but it's clear that people are still buying them.  Why?  because they enjoy the game.That's the point of games.  To enjoy them.  Why not have more things added to further that enjoyment.  Much less have stuff added that is official, stable, and compatable.Or, if you're not happy with it, you're free to go buy the old and outdated city builders that avaiable on Steam here.  SimCity4 is available...but you'll never get to see any new content or enjoy any mods with that game."

I always wanted to build a big city, manage it and what is most important feel that the city is alive. And this game delivers.As in every game you start with nothing. You start building roads and zoning and people starting to move in. They require electricity, water and other services. After you provide people with everything they need the buildings start to level up and grow.  Step by step your little city becomes more beautiful with every year. After a while your city is full of skyscrapers and is busy 24/7. With the „After dark“ update you got the night/day cycles and it looks amazing. You just look at your city every night, it‘s so beautiful. Also you as a mayor can manage your city. Apply various policies to districts, like ban smoking, encourage biking or ban heavy traffic just to name a few. You can set the taxes for your residents and business and set the budgets of city services like garbage collection, electricity, water, public transport and a few dozen more.People in this game are not just pixels moving in random directions. Every person has a name, home and a job. He goes from his home to a job to a commercial district and back home. Every resident is simulated individually. Similar to Tropico series, but Cities skylines has much more to simulate.Of course like every game this one is no exception and has some flaws.The traffic is the most annoying. You will spend a lot of time managing the traffic, building and rebuilding roads. The previous game these developers have done is called Cities in motion and we can see it influenced Cities skylines, because required attention to traffic is a little too much. AI cars are stupid and don‘t know how to use lanes thus causing congestions. Of course every city has congestion problems and stupid drivers exists in real life too. So maybe it‘s not that bad, but anyway it could be better. Some mods can improve the traffic, but they don‘t change much. The game lacks in management aspect. Yes you can manage your city but it lacks depth. It is too simple. I would like to have poor districts with bad education levels, where crime rate is high and police officers get shot often and you could apply some stricter policies over there or just leave them be in anarchy.Graphics in Cities skylines can be very beautiful, especially at night. Sometimes colors are off a bit, but all in all the game looks amazing. But this comes with a price. I get 25-30fps with GTX970 wich is not acceptable, but because it‘s not an action game i can live with that. I could lower some settings but i want my city look good, it‘s not an action game so it‘s playable at 30fps.Developers support modding very much, the game has steam workshop full of mods. I doubt anyone is playing this game without mods. You can download cars, planes, trains, buildings etc. to beautify and diversify your city. Also there‘s color corrections, some gameplay improvement mods and many more.If you like city building and management games this is a must have. And considering the price it‘s worth it even without a sale, you‘ll get hours of playtime from it. Do not expect much on economic side, but all the city building is done almost perfectly."

The experience is largely incomplete without DLCs and mods - see the list at the end of this review.As with many games, you learn by trial and error plus some research. You might have to start completely over as you grow in your role of a city builder and realize your past mistakes. During my first 100 hours or so I scrapped a few cities. After each of them, there was a long break of not playing but eventually I always returned. Now, at the time of writing this, I have built my biggest city ever and still have a lot to achieve. This time, though, I'm confident that this city is worth sticking with until the end as all the major big-picture mistakes were done in my previous saves.This game gives you that ""one more thing before I quit"" feeling quite regularly. You can always make your city better, whether it's practical optimizing or aesthetic details you're willing to work on. A big chuck of the former revolves around traffic and logistics. DLCs I've chosen:- Mass Transit- After Dark- Campus- Industries- Sunset HarborYou can get all of these for a low price by buying activation keys. I'd recommend getting them pretty soon but they're not a must for getting the feel for the game. More importantly, I couldn't live without these mods:- Traffic Manager: President Edition- Precision Engineering- Network Extensions 2- Harmony- Chirpy Exterminator (optional)I want to emphasize that these simply let you do things you'd expect to be able to do in vanilla but you can't.

Now I tried it on a test weekend, and it captivated me. Beautiful graphic, the challenge to create a well functioning city (I'm just saying traffic), many workshop stuff and included editors (for maps, themes, objects), and the sheer endless possibilities to build an awesome city.The DLC policy is not as bad as some people write. Even the main game gets new stuff with every DLC, e.g. the release of the DLC ""After Dark"" enables the day/night cycle for everyone, even if you do not own the DLC.For even more content, you should see which DLC you really need:The DLC's ""Green Cities"", ""Mass Transit"" and ""Snowfall"" add a lot of new things (maps, scenarios, buildings, means of transport e.g. trams (I like   trams), etc.) and I can recommend so far.The DLC ""Natural Disasters"" is something for players who want to see their city burn (or sink). (not for me)The DLC ""Concerts"" adds some music, a festival area (with policies) and 3 associated buildings. Too small for the full price.The DLC's ""Synthetic Dawn Radio"", ""Country Road Radio"", ""All That Jazz"", ""Rock City Radio"" and ""Relaxation Station"" are just music. An alternative would be Spotify, Youtube, Soundcloud, etc.The ""Content Creator Packs"" are for people who don't play any other game or want to support asset creators. An alternative is the awesome workshop.The DLC ""Industries"" also adds a lot of content (specializations of the economy on 4 different branches with unique buildings and certain map requirements). That allows the player to build industry zones (or entire cities) only for agriculture, forestry, mining or oil industry. The associated products can be traded with the ""outside world"", or are used by other industries in their own city in small economic chains. Everything works without problems. The production and sale of special goods is an additional source of income for your city.[After ~83h playtime]I LOVE this f***ing awesome game and I LOVE this f***ing awesome community for all this f***ing awesome assets and mods ![After ~90h playtime]I bought extra more RAM to be able to use more assets (current ~1700) from the workshop (lower loading times and less stutters).[After ~221h playtime]2090 assests and around a dozen of mods.Bought ""Park Life"" for the free creation of parks and ""Sunset Harbor"" for the fishing as a new industry."

I think the company will likely scratch it and make cities:skylines 2, rather than investing a ton of resources on this game's likely bloated codebase.The bottom line is that you need a high-end computer,  and a good number of mods and workshop assets. You may also want a few DLCs which add a lot of additional gameplay options. IMHO these ""priority"" DLCs are:* After dark* Sunset harbor* Industries* Park Life* Mass TransitThere are also some content-creator packs which (ironically) are much cooler (and useful) than paradox-made DLCs. For example, the content creator pack ""Train Stations"" gives you more options to create efficient and gorgeous train and metro hubs by adding train stations with 4 platforms and metro hubs which can handle 5 different lines"

From the classic greats like Sim City, to the more recent released, Cities: Skylines stands head and shoulder above the rest.C:S is a massive city building sim with so many micromanagement opportunities your OCD will purr. You'll start by creating districts of residential neighbourhoods for your ""happy"" people to live, of which they'll constantly harass you via Chipper to be a better mayor. You'll then choose what route of power you'll provide, depending on what DLCs you have available. You can watch as you burn a hole in the ozone through coal, oil, or be upstanding and provide green energy. Same goes for water supplies and sewage; Want to watch a group of tourists swim in the sewage your city produces? Crack on.It doesn't just stop there. Rubbish, recycling, postal services, healthcare, fire protection, crime prevention, education; you have complete control over how you want to govern. Each section allows an in-depth management in supply and demand, giving you full control. This has been expanded ten-fold with DLCs such as Campus, allowing you to tailor your own universities to give one example.Create jobs through office specialisations, retail areas, or offer more lucrative avenues such as specific industries and manufacturing. This has been expanded again by the devs via the Industries DLC, you're able to create massive manufacturing chains starting from raw products, refine them and produce expensive exports to keep you in the black.One of by biggest joys in the game for me came from travel, and is so important in the game (especially when hitting a high population of 10,000+). You're able to create and manage various routes and different types of transport (again expanded in the DLC ""Mass Transit"") to allow your citizens to freely traverse your city without clogging the main arterial roads of your city. This for me was the most difficult part of the whole game, one that I am still trying to master from well over 200 hours of gameplay.Lastly, C:S has one of the most active mod developers of any game that I have played. I am using many, many mods and custom assets that allow further improvement to gameplay, more customised buildings, better beautification tools, the list in endless. The active content creators are a joy to watch, giving you new play-style ideas, better ways of implementing tools, etc.I'm playing on an (albeit older) i7, with 16GB RAM and an older 4GB graphics card and I am still struggling  to achieve a full 60fps on a medium graphics preset (though I understand this can be down to the amount of custom assets I use), I am perfectly happy playing on this setting for the amount of processing that the game requires. It chews through RAM like you wouldn't believe. Also loading times can also become a burden on lower graphics machines, again especially is using mods.Pros:Cons:Great game to relax with, wholly recommend if you have patience. 8.5/10"

161,terrlerr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/terrlerr/,195,16,0,868.9,November,"26,",263,0,1,"Despite my play time, recommending this game is tough, and in the end I just can't do it.On one hand, Skylines is a fantastic game. While the comparison feels somewhat unfair since they took different approaches to gameplay, Skylines is everything people expected from the last SimCity game, and then some. It arrived with Workshop support baked in and there are thousands of mods, maps, and assets available to modify, expand on, or customize your experience.On the other hand, after you reach a certain population point, the game becomes a traffic management simulator, so unless you understand how the AI works (or more accurately, how it does not) and start building to exploit/address these deficiencies, your cities will crumble. There are mods in the Workshop that I consider essential to working around vanilla limitations (Anarchy, TM:PE, Network Extensions, etc) that the developers either cannot or will not fix.  Unfortunately, instead of doing this, they've expanded the game's ability to spy on users for marketing purposes. The change in EULA is alarming and this is a major factor in not recommending the game anymore. The first impression is of a huge, expansive game with a plethora of options and systems to tinker with, in which you can build and run the city of your dreams. Once the shine wears off (3 years and 500 hours for me, slope was too steep on ), you realize you're spending most of your time fighting  the limitions or outright broken-ness of the engine and AI, all while the developers cannot or refuse to fix the fundamental flaws in their game but are more than happy to spy on and sell your personal information. Yep, that's right, supporting this game and developer means you're paying to be spied on now, instead of having the game you paid for fixed. Shame on you, Paradox and Colossal Order.TLDR: Get Skylines if you really like city building sims, because it's the best one available right now. Get it on sale, however, and don't bother with the DLC. With the EULA change Paradox and Colossal Order have demonstrated their lack of respect for the user base that supported the game and is now paying for the privilege of having personal information harvested while the game remains fundamentally broken.Additional edit: Now Paradox has taken things a step further and forced their launcher on everyone, without their agreement or consent, and you can't access the game without it. You're also forced to accept the license agreement, external and separate from the platform it was originally purchased on. I consider the launcher malware since it didn't notify me it was installing and didn't ask for my permission first. I suggest everyone flag the launcher executable as malware in their AV software. This is an unwanted program, no potential about it.Congratulations, Paradox. Your users have been extremely vocal about not wanting this and you forged ahead and forced it on everyone regardless. You may think this is the best approach for your players, but you just guaranteed I'll never purchase any of your games going forward."

The game has 10 small DLC packs that all cost at least 13 USD, some more.  Small as in they add little and with a limited focus.  This probably wouldn't be a problem but becomes a problem with Cities Skylines without DLC and even with mods is rather poorly featured.  Nearly every aspect of the game feels underdeveloped and plain.  As if the game was created only to be the skeleton of platform to sell DLC rather than a great game with DLC adding on to it.  It feels very much like an ice cream cone, with no ice cream.  Paradox will spoon feed you ice cream one small flavor at a time but expects you to pay a premium for that ice cream.  The entire collection of DLC often goes on sale but even at 50% off it is tough to recommend and it is only going to get more expensive.It is a great game but has no peers in terms of price.  Other studios now deliever the quantity and quality of content comparable to these DLC packs for free.  Which adds value to the purchase.  Cities Skylines does not add value but adds cost to aquire more than the bare minimum.  Paradox is not obligated to give anything for free but 133 dollars and counting while ON SALE is stupid no matter which way you cut the cake."

Placed in a vast canvas you have the opportunity to build the city of your vision, but at a cost of demanding civilians wanting every single ounce of their needs met. This is a game challenging you the further you progress.Pros:- Plenty of maps to choose from (even more with the DLC)- Realistic traffic flow, your city suffers if there are to many high traffic zones.- The ability to separate policies per district is a huge plus.- The city's leveling progression is a nice take on how well you're improving and also gifts you with funds.- The building dynamics is easy to learn and also lets you remove the snap to grid feature to build roads however you want.- Plenty of different buildings and community lots to build to assist the happiness of your citizens.Cons:- I'm not a huge fan in the beginning of building a new city you are sort of forced to build off of a highway, I understand people need a port into the city, but if you do want to build off and away from the highway it can become expensive.- Some of the citizens needs become tedious at times, especially during the later stages of a big city. The challenge is great, but at times you just see the little thought bubble and  you want to bulldoze that person's house.- Even though I paid for all of the DLC, after thinking about the purchases some of the DLC content should be integrated into the game for free.Despite it all, I love this game. It can be relaxing when you take the city building process with its fair amount of challenge.  Compared to EA's latest Sim City game, Cities: Skylines buries it in all aspects."
168,Holysword,https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/,76,23,1,525.0,June,"11,",929,0,1,"Cities: Skylines (better known as Traffic: Jams) is a city planning simulator where you spend hours designing pretty intersections and city districts which work awfully wrong.This game is a time waste sinkhole, honestly. When playing in the normal mode, your only goal is to grow the population of your city to unlock cool buildings. To do that, you draw roads and designate zoning for commerce, industry and residential areas and provide them with electricity, water and services such as fire station and police headquarters. Once reaching a certain threshold, you unlock further buildings. Nuclear power plant? Not before you reach 40,000 people, my friend! The simulation aspects of C:S are very soft. Inhabitants need industries to work, industries need commerce to sell their good, commerce needs inhabitants to buy their stuff. It forms a cycle and that's it. Industries pollute so you wanna keep them away from your residential areas, but you'll have to be prepared to see their trucks going back and forth to the commercial areas. Your inhabitants will also use cars to get to places and that can create a true chaos if you don't plan it correctly. They also use greedy algorithms (i.e. take shortest path) which is a key ingredient for traffic jams. The vehicles' AI don't know how to properly use lanes which is quite frustrating. Luckily, there are mods which allow better control of those things.Don't complain about traffic jam in C:S though, because if you do, someone will knock on your door to spread the word of the Road Hierarchy Theory and Proper Intersections Design The amount of cool mods is astonishing. The game also allows you to create custom assets from your own 3d models. I frankly spent more time in the assets editor than in the game itself!The achievements are also much easier than they look. Playing with mods disable achievements and most of the community do not hunt them anyway. Some of the 0.2% achievements can be literally obtained in 5min. The only headache-inducing ones are: - ""What the..."" requires a very random event, see here how to unlock it: - ""1001 Nights"" requires playing the game for several lifetimes; the best way to get it is to let an empty city idling 24h a day for 7~10 days,  depending on your system.Linux port was also perfect, thanks for supporting the penguin!"

170,King Link,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglink/,72,2,1,32.5,February,"7,","2,772",5,1,"I am adding my update  review and video . Review is mostly unedited (though shortened) for posterity.  --  I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted Cities: Skylines.  After Cities in Motion, games that focused on mass transit as their first two games, I was almost definite I was going to have a bad time as I disliked both of those games on some level. A couple hours later I was a bit surprised because the hours flew by.  I’ve heard Cities: Skylines is a SimCity clone.  In reality, it’s a fantastic Simcity, far better than EA’s always online SimCity that they produced.  In fact, it’s released two years after the SimCity release and just is better in every way possible.  No online, great gameplay, and not as many really annoying bugs (such as traffic). That’s the thing though, Cities Skylines is SimCity, if you hate the idea of city building, you’re probably not going to be happy here.  If you miss classic SimCity, this is a must own.  It’s not the same game, but it’s an excellent replacement for it, far superior in almost every way.The big thing in Cities Skylines is the growth of the city ties to items. When your city is a village, you can only create certain objects.  Garbage is locked until you 440 people, The Police department is unlocked at 850 people.  Want a Solar Power Plant to be green?  Get 18,000 people and not a second before that.  It actually is a great way to scope the game and let you focus on tasks right in front of you than give you infinite choices and have you build stuff you don’t need but it can limit the game in the early game.  This might not be for everyone though.Which is why there are mods, glorious mods!  The game ships with three mods if I remember correctly (I’ve gotten a lot since then), the Unlimited money mod, the unlock all mod, and the hard mode mod.  The unlimited money and unlock all mods both will unlock all buildings.  But there’s a LOT of mods for this game and a ton of great support through mods.  Basically, if you don’t like something in Cities Skylines there is a mod for it.  But the building system does have one thing that’s quite cool.  There are unique buildings in which the player has to fulfill some minor or major task such as construct a certain type of building 30 times, or produce a certain amount of goods.  If you do that, you get a special building to customize your city with and give your city bonus usually a tourism, but they also help you build the big monuments which are awesome to aim for. So it’s like a great version of SimCity, what’s different? Well, first there’s a number of tools that aren’t as good as others.  The road tool seems to hate perfect lines.  I want to draw perfect grids such as can be found in New York City.  Just long lines of perfect roads.  The road tool seems to hate me and I seem to fail at this often.  The roads do snap to each other at specific points, but I seem to miss the 90 degrees by a few degrees often.  I’m sure there’s some button to make these roads perfect but it should be easy to do this. I’ve tried to do highways and such and it’s sometimes a bit hard to make the connecting road matchup without an odd design. They’re just something not 100 percent right with the way it creates roads, not to mention curves. The reason you want perfect roads is that the grid for the city has little squares, and anything other than a perfect rectangle gives you spaces in the grid or little gaps that don’t look too bad, but can limit growth They are minor breaks but they don’t look that good and the best buildings won’t be built there. Zoning is well done though and it’s easy to throw down different types of building quickly, and replacing buildings with services don’t seem to hurt the neighborhoods much (The area around the service buildings, like a police station, recovers exceedingly fast.) The game does add a fantastic tool that lets you build districts.  But what’s brilliant here, is you can paint the district, applying almost a blob to an area so you can make your own design and rename your districts what you want.  You can also change policies specifically for that area if you want.  It’s great to grow as you decide.  The management of these districts is far easier than I expected, but I’m not a micromanager.  I like to run “Freelandia!”  where you can do what you want.  However the micromanagement with the districts is fun, and it makes your city look great. I love naming areas with different names or recreating real places I have visited in San Diego, LA, Orlando, or of course Boston.  Or just name everything after body parts.  The choice is yours.I’ve always loved city building, and the experience of just watching a city grow, and that exact experience is here.  It takes some time but eventually the player gets an idea how to figure out what’s going on or what problems to tackle.  Sadly the game doesn’t have the best complaint system unless you look at buildings.  Anything wrong and there’s a little complaint on top of a house.  There’s a twitter style feed on the top of the screen that tells you random things going on in your little corner of the world, but it doesn’t give a deep understanding of what’s going on.  Imagine if a mayor of a town could only find out what’s going on with a twitter feed.  It’s a little silly, the single interactions with the populace doesn’t work.  I'd have preferred an advisor telling me what are the major issues people are talking about.In addition, the game is VERY slow.  A single day is 10 seconds… at that rate you pass a year in an hour of constant running.  That’s a bit long in my opinion.  But triple speed makes a day only … 5 seconds!  Wait what?  Yeah.. triple speed only doubles the time in my test.  That means a year is 30 minutes.  That’s quite slow still.  I’m sure it’s due to the simulation time and such, but really, quite slow.  The game is focused on weekly cycles instead of monthlies but it’s a very long year. The one thing I’m not a fan of here is that the game currently promotes its expansions and there’s a lot.  It’s starting to become like the Sims, where there’s tons of content each one in its own expansion.  Luckily the game doesn’t feel like you need expansions as the main game is fantastic on its own and fully featured, but if you have to have it all.  In fact, there’s good quality of life additions to the game along with the expansions.  However, it feels that expansions are a bit of a mixed blessing.  You can remove DLC from Steam by uninstalling the DLC itself but in game, if they are installed they are always on.  Want to switch from a Snowfall game to a one without?  You need to uninstall the DLC. Yet the player can avoid all the DLC and the game is still fantastic, it’s a fully featured game with a lot of depth.  The ability to grow your city and then tackle new problems is rather refreshing as you can focus your talents on the smaller tasks even on a second playthrough.  Designing your city is easier when you’re able to focus on it at first.  You can fly through the ranks quickly especially once you know what you’re doing.There’s a  very solid UI as well once you learn it, and interesting challenges for the player to tackle.  There’s not much here I dislike.  Even the annoyances are minor in comparison.  I plop down a few zones and I start remembering why I love this game.  It’s not just that it reminds me of a great game.  It’s a great game on its own.  While I didn’t like Cities in Motion much, this is exactly the game I was hoping they would make, and now that it’s here.  It is kind of fantastic.

174,StrikeR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/strykery/,654,59,1,8.9,January,"4,","14,219",12,1,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders."

It has some rough edges and some odd design decisions on occasion, but overall it is a good quality game that I have enjoyed playing. Yet.. I'm appalled by the data collection that this game does, especially since it is a single player game. What is being collected and how it is used is all in the privacy policy for Paradox, but it is required to agree to the terms of the agreements to play the game now. Effectively, this holds the game hostage so that Paradox can use your data about you, your hardware, and the other software on your computer for its own benefit just so you can play the game you purchased. This makes me question purchasing and playing other products owned or published by Paradox now. Through this change, Paradox has effectively lost me as a customer because of their boneheaded data collection policies."

The main issue I have is this: When your city gets big enough the game is a piece of cake. There is depth in the city painter part of the game, but close to none in the management side of things. For a long time I'd play the game, after several hours my city would become extremely profitable and then I'd play for a few more hours before uninstalling and waiting for a new DLC that would add management depth. That DLC never came. The next DLC won't bring it. Unfortunately I doubt it ever will.  What made me go from that level of disappointment to really liking the game? Seeing in a new light. This game is an amazing city builder. Amazing painter of cities. If you want to create a city that looks and feels like you want it to you have that ability. Building what seems like a giant county of varied and unique zones with different looking towns and purposes is the best I've ever seen. Playing this game with the intention of making my own New York or London is what it's near perfect as. The DLC just gives more tools to diversify the environment. So if picture a city in your head you can make it in this game. The opportunities are there If you want to struggle to build and maintain it with tons of management tools this isn't for you. Overall it's a 9/10 for me"

After the learning curve the pervasive issues become tiring though.There are fundamental mechanisms within this game that have been broken from launch but don't get addressed. Most of them have to do with traffic. This game relies heavily on road placement and traffic management for your success so it's more than frustrating when the AI is too dumb.When a building is being serviced by something like a firetruck or an ambulance it will block the lane on the road. In the real world traffic would drive into the oncoming lane to get around the obstruction. In this game everyone waits until the one lane moves again. So a firetruck heading to a fire will just sit idling in traffic waiting for an ambulance do its thing, because it's not programmed to drive around when possible. Have the devs ever seen how firetrucks actually drive???Do you think a firetruck would put out a fire and move onto the burning building next door? Not in this game. They will be heading back to the hall for some well-deserved coffee while the neighbours wait for their colleagues to arrive to rescue the family dog.At least government waste is simulated accurately.Cars driving on the highway or multiple-lane city streets will all use a single lane instead of changing lanes to utilize all of the road. Such a thing never happens in reality. The result is a huge traffic jam whether the road is one or six lanes.These glaring problems are years old and nothing gets fixed."

The game generally works fine and everything is working as expected, and you can fix many flaws, make the game harder and add content through mods and the workshop.In the vanilla game (without mods) there's a bug that happens with water once your city becomes really big. If you're aiming at making a very big city you'll probably fall in this bug unless you install a mod that addresses it. Citizens will become sick without any apparent reason. Building more drain pipes and water towers won't fix it. Even switching entirely from pumping water from a water source to using water towers won't fix that, so you're basically screwed and forced to abandon your city.I'm surprised developers haven't looked into that and that issue is still a thing, but as I said, as long as you install the proper mod the issue won't happen.8/10."

The maps are huge and could easily take you weeks to fill out with a single city. It's a far cry from the tiny 'districts' from the latest Simcity. The mechanics, such as placing buildings and infrastructure, are intuitive and easy to use for the most part (the transit lines could use a bit of work), and rarely did I have to wonder ""why can't I place this here"" or ""why isn't this working?"".

For a game that's supposed to be focused on transit itself, this game is severely lacking in that regards if you were to just buy the base game. Snow is the mod you have to buy just to get access to a light-rail type system of inner city transit. Mass Transit is required basically to access anything above a horribly designed subway interface and the bus system.Along with this, you also need mods to play the game. I wish I could say they weren't necessary but they 100% are necessary just to make the game play correctly. One mod that was necessary was the Realistic population mod. In the stock game, a skyscraper would only have 8-9 residents total. With the population mod, this is set somewhere in the range of 100-120 residents.I just don't understand the logic of the stock game.Recently, Paradox released a new launcher and new EULA which seeing the response of the community vs Paradox just made me completely lose interest in this game. Paradox is truly showing their colors on how they feel by stating that ""you don't actually own this game and we can change your ability to access the game at any time"". For that, and the other reasons I have listed I cannot continue to support this game.If you are looking for a good city building game then I would honestly suggest picking up Sim City 4 and just using the NAM mod on that until someone actually comes out with decent city building game."

Then a friend recommended me to try Cities: Skylines. At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!P.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D
219,Kenuty,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/,175,6,1,36.1,March,"13,","1,774",0,1,"When starting off Cities Skylines I thought that the game would be another typical city builder with a mere simcity interface slap on it. The game proven that it has done many thing right the first time its come out and exceeded what sim city was however there is more work needed for the game especially in terms of the end game content. Overall the game itself is an exceptional city builder that everyone has to play if you enjoy this genre.+ Runs really well and is decently optimized, even with a bigger city depending on your rig the game would still run really smooth (Window 7 64 bit from my end)+ The interface is straight from sim city so those with experience knows how to jump into the game with ease. Easy enough for new players to  understand and complex enough even for the hard edge veterans.+ The cities goes looks fantastic with modded material and district creation, the area changes on its look depending on what type of police you set in place. + The traffic system, water, and power system all works in this game right from the start in the game creating less stress to the player( WOW!)+ The district systems lets you color out zones and implement polices for the game giving you the option to create bans on certain things such as pets or smoking ban and creating unique distrits throughout your city+ Easy to use tax system and system to use for + Bigger map sizes for building. I had a Simcity complex where I would build in the small square a while taking up as much room as I can and being efficient as possible. It was easy enough to maintain a city and then expanding. Once expanding the city gets bigger and bigger and looks amazing.+Mod support on day one players are able to download others maps, building objects etc through steam workshop. The editor is also very easy to use and import/export material in to work with.- The game lacks depth and challenge for end game content. I find the game is easy and even on hard mode( which I play on) it was pretty easy if one knows how to balance out efficiency and building his city.  In the end you will make a ton of money and just basically start plopping amazingly huge cities without a clear goal. There isn't any concept of material needs for the game to improve the lives of the people of the city (Which sim city had) to give it that extra depth.- The snap for placing road sometimes can be a bit wonky and needs a bit more work. There isn't a city preplanning tool to help you preplan and no rewind button. Once ya place it you delete it and replace it etc.- No dynamic day/night cycle and disasters. These two are important function because seeing your city glow in the night is simply amazing and having disasters give you a sort of thrill in when it does occur. Without it the game doesn't offer much of a challenge unless you mess up your electrical/water or one of the needs of necessity in which case you create a disaster from it. - The npcs are not that entertaining to watch since they do not adhere to a day and night cycle rule. Therefore they aren't as robust and dynamic if one actually follows them for a for a few.- No multiplay ( Don't know if this will ever come true in the future)- Blurry graphic at times at highest settings, turn down shift helps a bit and a bit of film grain is added to the game."

They need the dlc influx to continue with their constant dedication to their projects.  Ckii is more than five years old, and next month it is getting an expansion that has been stated to not be the last.  The idea of 'games as a service' is actually properly done by the company and its fans and creators are open with each other and share their ideas.  They are very human.  The downside is that if you didn't get on the train as it was leaving the station it is very intimidating to see the long dlc lists.  Most are cosmetic.  It is easier to think of pdx games as a subscription in which every 4-5 months you pay a 5-20 USD subscription fee to support continued developement of the games.  The dlc is optional and far better than the atroicious dlc policies of ea, activision, and ubisoft: ""Here buy this uber deluxe expansion pass edition that costs 150 USD."" Those game sare abandoned ghost towns within a year.  However,  with pdx games you know they will be around a while constantly increase player count.  And for the price of a cheesesteak, an Arnold Palmer,  and fries you can have an addtion to your game you will play for a decade.  Therefore it is unfair to equate this to dlc packs in AAA games like fallout, mass effect, and assissins creed.  You can either have a greedy company who puts out a disposable game like AC and asks foir over 100USD for dlc you care about for 2 months, or buy a map pack for CoD which you'll only find enough friends to play with for a year or so, or you can buy into a pdx title which is far more deep, has an amazing community, and will stick around for almost a decade.  If you want the later, you have to be willing to financially support the studio who desires to continue perfecting your game.  In a throw away gaming culture, I for one find pdx's practices a breath of fresh air."

242,Figureight,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Deszcz/,94,5,1,31.1,March,"11,","1,041",1,1,"To me, this game has become the new modern standard citybuilding game. It's a game that feels like it is pushing the citybuilding game genre back to it's roots. Clearly the developers learned from the mistakes of Maxis and EA with SimCity; everywhere it failed to deliver, this game has got it. With a focus on things like Steam Workshop and modding it seems a thriving community will come of this game and clearly hasn't been made to become a DLC machine. Pros:> Wide audience appeal. It feels that it can be as casual or as serious as you want it to be. Not at all daunting for a first timer to use, and even includes things like hard mode for the more seasoned city builder. > The game feels very well optimised and runs very nicely. Both my laptop and desktop PC play this game very well.> Easy to use world and assets editors for deeper customisation. Asset creations such as parks, buildings, intersections, props and even trees. All uploadable and retrievable through Steam Workshop.> It has a very detailed simulation of city life. Features things like dynamic water that makes dams usable, or gives you the ability to poison the city water supply with poorly placed pumping stations and drain pipes. You can follow people, cars, buses etc and you can see these people are living out daily lives. The city does feel alive.> Huge expandable worlds to build in. No more cities the size of a village like on SimCity. You can actually build massive sized cities!> You also have freely controllable taxes, funding and policies not only at a city level but also at a district level that can change the feel and dynamic of the cities and the people that live in them. You have a twitter-esque system that gives reports on how people are feeling based on tweets they make about the city.> There's lots to do with the roads. Many different shapes and sizes, one-way systems, highways, dirt roads, pavements etc, and they can all be raised, curved or done freeform.Cons:> No day or night cycle! It seems so many situations on the roadways (rush hours etc) can't be experienced, which makes the traffic feel a bit basic a lot of the time.> Whilst there is a lot to do with the roads, it's not always as accurate as I would like. It makes building more complex road systems a bit of a pain, and won't let you connect up roads and paths in a way you may want. I hope it gets an update soon to let us customise our roads even better.> I notice a lot of the same buildings appearing next to each other, like having a street with just the same burger bar a few times on it. More building variation and randomisation would be nice, but I imagine this could be solved with user-created content.> Some of the figures feel a bit off. The population figures always feel a bit low compared to what you may expect from the current state of your city.Overall it's a lovely feeling game and comparatively to other city builders to come out in recent years, this is definitely the pick of the bunch. It's well priced on launch compared to competitors, especially SimCity."

There are many games that have continued to release content which I continue to support but none of them do such a horrible job of throwing that content in your face only to tell you that you can't use it without paying a fee.Just remove it from the options menu if the DLC isn't installed you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥...

258,Delor,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961372576/,42,3,1,26.4,September,"1,","1,065",0,1,"Cities: Skylines feels like a proper successor to the classic SimCity games.  If you grew up on classics like SimCity, SimCity 2000, and SimCity 4, you'll probably feel at home here.  For those not familiar, in this genre you build a city by zoning out commecial, residential, and industrial areas as well as the necessary infrastructure (roads, water, power) and an increasing number of other public goods such as police protection, fire protection, education, etc.  You set tax rates which impact the economy, and try to stay in the black and allow your city to continue to grow.  It's an addictive experience of constant expansion, with another thing you want to build or problem you want to fix always on the horizon and keeping the real-time game version of ""one more turn"" on your lips.  As with most of these games, one of the things you'll spend the most time on besides simply laying out more roads and then laying down zones and support buildings is traffic management, and at this Skylines shines.  The road construction system offers you a wide variety of to configure your roads with different sizes, one-way-vs-two-way, overpasses, etc, and the traffic flow responds to what you build in sensible and complicated ways.  It's a compelling component of the game that can consume hours of your life.  Additional options such as foot paths, bus routes, trains, and subways can also lighten the car traffic in your city.  Skylines also features an intersting ""neighborhood"" system where you can subdivide your city into different sections and set different city ordinances or economic focuses for each one.  While I don't feel that the mechanics of this have as much impact as I might like, just being able to district your city into distinct neighborhoods with their own names helps bring your city into focus and give it more character and specificity.(the Nightlife expansion also adds to this system, but most of my playtime was done before that came out so I'm not reviewing the expansion content, here)  Things I don't lke about the game?  Primarily, it feels too easy.  Even from the start I virtually never drifted into the red, although I would occasionally stall out and need to make some tweaks to keep growing.  This seems like it'd be something that is mod-able, but better difficulty options for veterans of the genre who want a challenge would be nice.  Additionally, as your city develops it seems that older industrial neighborhoods will occassionally suffer mass unemployment for no apparent reason.  The economic specializations you can assign to neighborhoods, in particular, suffer from this doubly and feel like a very short road to a dead end.  The industrial collapse itself is a good thing- an interesting challenge to tackle in a game that generally lets you just keep expanding with ease- but the feedback as to why it happens is poor.  For example, faced with the situation I'd frequently click on the buildings and see that they had no workers.  Thinking that I'd simply educated my populace out of wanting those jobs, I'd try building a school-free slum neighborhood nearby to see if that brought the businesses back, but the businesses remained without workers for no apparent reason.  Also, the in-game twitter-alike is inane and way too chatty, but this is a minor quibble.  Other than these complaints, I could list a score of minor to moderate UI annoyances- the inevitable consequence of playing a bunch of a game- but the only one that really sits heavily in my mind is the dread I'd feel whenever I made significant changes to my subway system.  It's not always clear what happens to existing routes when you make changes and getting a big-picture view of what all of your current routes look like in aggregate can be difficult; a cleaner and color-coded subway route map view would be nice.  All in all, I'd heartily recommend Cities: Skylines as an enjoyable sandbox that can easily consume dozens of hours of your life."

Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.But that's the only  problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines."

The fact that they've announced yet another batch of DLCs coming till next year but still haven't bothered optimizing the game that has been requested for years is just unacceptable, not to mention every update breaks some of your installed mods (it's always been like that, but it should'nt be). Come on CO/Paradox, the game is 7 years old. Either prioritize/give us an optimization update, or give this game a rest and make Cities Skylines 2 already. You guys are milking this game way too much."
268,OperaWolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/operawuff/,773,17,0,40.0,October,"20,",307,53,1,"Cities: Skylines is a great city sim game; possibly one of the best out there. It's intuitive, pretty, and addictive to play. There's a lot of little milestones and unlocks that constantly nudge you gently forward and give you just one more thing to fix, one more thing to tweak, one more thing to add. Suddenly your city is booming and you need to place more residential. Now there's more traffic and you need to rework your roads. Once those are handled you notice some new buildings and services have unlocked, and you begin planning around where they should go. It's a great system, and the game never feels hectic or rushed. You can always do things at your own pace, which really benefits a city-building game in my mind.All that said, I can't recommend this game unless it's heavily on sale. Not because it's a bad game. It's not - it's a great game. But Paradox's DLC practices are nausea-inducing. The base game has enough to get by and have fun, but there's a ton of ease-of-living and sometimes downright necessary functions locked behind completely useless DLC. They did it with Crusader Kings, they did it with Europa Universalis, and now they're doing it here, so I doubt they plan to stop any time soon. The Transit DLC adds a ton of public transport functionality...for $13. You can set your city up to cater to the night life, with night clubs and 24/7 stores...for $15. There can be natural disasters and buildings to mitigate their damage, adding a fun bit of chaos to otherwise totally safe gameplay...for $15. And now, with the Green Cities DLC, they've added a ton of new and useful content, but locked it all behind a paywall. Most of this is stuff that should've been in the base game, or free updates. Why does a customer need to pay to unlock winter or the ability to recycle? It boggles the mind.It's a great game marred by awful DLC practices. If you want to buy it, buy it on sale and do some research on the available DLC beforehand so you can decide which bits of game functionality you are willing to pay for in order to fully enjoy the game."
269,Gill Bates,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198170832059/,51,,1,91.3,October,"23,",52,2,1,"One of the best city scenario games that is out there.I will split this review into 4 different sections. Each sections will be covering different topics. Campaigns/ScenariosBecause this game is focusing on building your own metropolis, there's is no particular campaing. However there are several scenarios, each one is focusing on something different. Plus if you will buy DLCS to this game (for example; Natural Disasters DLC) you may get more scenarios with unique goals and maps. I found this cool because if you’re just bored of creating another city, you can just hop in one of those scenarios and start digging your own adventure. Some scenarios have easy/straightforward goals whereas other’s are hard and requier many side steps in order to proceed or complete the challenge/scenario. The best thing about this I would say is the fact that if you’re starting a specific scenario, you may already have a city to start with and problems that the specific city is facing. For example, in one of the natural disasters DLC scenario, you have a small city which is under a dam and it already has some several problems. This is what I like about it. The fact that you don’t need to start over and over. You can just join into a scenario and you already have a city. Graphics/DesignThe game itself has good graphisc. Therefore I am sure that you don’t need a super expensive PC. However there’s one thing that you cannot take for granted. Bugs were the major problem for me. There’s not that many bugs but some can be really annoying or even gamebreaking. I am not really professional when it comes to bugs, but I just want to warn you that you should be ready for some minor bugs or at some point game breaking ones. The design is very neat and professional. The developers made a really good job with lights and objects. The best feeling for me was always starring at my city during the night.  But as I said I am not really into this, anways I just wanted to say that.CommunityThis is the thing that is keeping this game alive. If you will visit workshop of Cities Skylines, you will find everything. You can add car models, real-life buildings, roads, planes and etc. There’s so many things that you can save up and they will completely redefine your city. Sometimes workshop items are even better than some overpriced dlcs. (I will get to that later) When I first visited the workshop, I was there for aproximetly 2 hours. There is a large amount of artworks and discussions. So whenever you face a game-breaking bug, you can just go to the discussion. There are also videos, some are for focusing on some tips whereas others are focusing on gameplay or some other things (mods for example). DLCsThis is probably the biggest problem with Cities Skyline. This game has a lot of DLCs. Many of them are very cool, such as the Natural Disaster DLC or the After Dark DLC. But then there are DLCs which add only few new buildings and cost around 15 euros. For example, the concert DLC adds few new buildings but costs around 15 euros. (or less, correct me on that if I am wrong.) If you want some DLCs I recommend waiting for sale. SUMMARYThis game is very interesting game which is for people who like building or designing cities. Its massive community is driving the game towards the future. The DLCs are good but some are seriously overpriced. There’s few game-breaking bugs but at the end of the day. I give this game 9/10."

I doubted it is possible to bring something new to modern city builder gameplay. I liked the game, but I was right, the game doesn't introduce new & amazing features.You start with a square of clear land. Most of the time you don't place buildings, you choose land and your type ( living zone, stores or production area). Buildings are built automatically. I liked it. Most of the time you just add new roads and choose type of areas. It is the main loop. You will do it 60% of game time. After reaching certain amount of population, you get access to new buildings : schools, police, fire station, garbage storage, cemeteries and etc. You need to build new special building with each significant grows of population.After that you get road problems. There is getting so much vehicles, so you need to remake roads, add buses and metro and etc. I suppose there is more of stuff, but you need to buy DLC.In overall, I liked playing the game, I wasn't extremely happy, it was just a good game.Pros- Main gaming loop is very simple to understand and addictive to play- It is interesting to see how vehicles move and improve road situation- Zoom options. You can see how people walk- A lot of stuff if count DLCs. You can play this game for hundred of hoursCons- No goal to achieve. No story, scenario and objectives. Just make city as much bigger as you can- You need to buy tens of DLC to unlock extra features- Some mechanics was completely unclear. Metro line planning, for example.A nice City Builder game.

Warm colors.Game is easy to start and if you don't mess up completely in the beginning getting your city up and running shouldn't be an issue. Has hard mode where things are more expensive and you can also start with unlimited money if you just want to build.Big area where you can spread out your fledgling little town and thanks to mod support you can have even more space where to build. You can also make your own assets or download ready ones from Workshop and plenty of different mods are available too. From traffic management to automatically bulldozing abandoned and burned buildings.Dealing with the traffic can be a pain in the posterior sometimes in this game and you should be prepared to deal with it. Enough jams and nothing works. Fire engines get stuck in traffic and fires start burning your place down.There is no disaster system in game currently if that's something you miss and need from Sim City titles.Game runs okay, with larger cities it might start slowing down a bit. Every citizen is simulated where they are coming and going and it takes it toll when you have large enough population.If you're planning on unlocking all the buildable area with mods and your computer isn't quite up to date it's something to keep in mind.There are occasional bugs here and there like ships roaming the country side if you do certain things and traffic not using all the available lanes on a road.Doesn't have always online requirement but you can't build multiple cities and have them work together either."
289,Hlebka,https://steamcommunity.com/id/hlebka/,297,18,0,64.1,March,"20,","1,035",12,1,"TL;DRThis was once a good game until everything was put into DLCs.You now have to spend literally 200 USD (160€) to have ""a game"".Very nice city simulation. I especially like the vehicle traffic... jkBUT! 1. The DLC policy is cancerous in a way that Paradox is taking to new heights (CK2, Stellaris, HOI...).The DLC scheme is so appalling that I simply can't in any serious mind recommend this product. It just silly to expect your customers to pay for every single basic feature and such huge prices. Maybe if these DLCs were priced closer to their actual worth and desirability I might recommend but right now there is no way I would support this behavior.2. The game quickly becomes a traffic manager as soon as any major population size is met, and it's really tedious. The AI for traffic is pretty bad and it really relies on mods to try and fix it. A game should be accentuated by mods, not rely on it to fix it.3. It's all too utopian, which I know is a bit of weird criticism. The original SimCity series felt far grungier, with gritty, melancholy music, and the potential for whole swathes of dismal city blocks that looked like something out of the suburbs of Mega-City One. Given Simcity 2000 was release in the early 90's, there's a definite vibe of the 80's depression era. City games *should* have slumps, depressions, crime, social issues, challenges in terms of society and culture. Not once, no matter how big my city get in CS, did it feel like my city was anything more than a larger version of Pleasantville full of happily medicated cims.Although, the ~200 bucks price tag for full game is pretty funny since many consider 70 excessive. Just hold my beer, right?"

As far as the game itself goes... It's OK... It's much better with all the DLCs at which point it starts to feel like a ""full game"".But the base game will get old after a few hours.Honestly not worth it."

A  game. In essence, even the business model behind this game achieves this. A game with rapid DLC production means a game with CONSTANT content and support, subsequently creating a huge modding community. These modifications change the game in incredibly meaningful ways. From intricate traffic management (TM:PE), to ULT and lighting adaptations. This allows the player to transport themselves into the most realistic, beautiful looking places you could imagine. From just a small, pitstop gas station in the desert to large transport networks and interchanges, you can make anything you might see in real life traveling in your car. I would recommend this game to anyone who is interested in painting a scene you might see in real life. Or just so you can nuke a bunch of imaginary cims with meteors, a games a game isnt it?"

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today.

Are you serious?! This is ridiculous and way out of line. What ever happened to put the game in the console (PC), and press play? Personally I'm not down with that.

No need to call it a spiritual successor or anything, this game apes Sim City in every way as far as I can tell. I recall faint memories of attempting to play Sim City 2000 back when I was a little kid but the interface and gameplay was far too complex for me. I had more fun loading up the pre-set savegames of a sprawling metropolis and destroying it with robots or aliens and whatnot. I don't even really have any experience with any city simulators. However, this game does a modern Sim City better than any other game has done in recent memory.I don't have much experience with any city simulators. Now, I'm certifiably addicted to this game. The interface is stellar, the music charming. The sound effects are invigorating. The little dings as buildings level up fill my heart with happiness. The way your tiny ant-like populace pours out of your metro system after arrival is satisfying, as you know they're not using congestion-inducing personal vehicles. The ability to ""paint"" different zones, whether residential, commerical, or industrial is so delightful it's difficult to describe. Watching little buildings pop up, filling with residents populating the area is incredible to behold. You can even name every single object in the game, whether it be a building, a citizen, or even some random cougar roaming in the countryside. I took it upon myself to name every High School I built after any American presidents i can think of.I never thought this would happen, but as of 3/16/15 Cities: Skylines is my GOTY of 2015. It's been quite some time when a video game can suck away my time as well as this one. There's always more land to develop, more resources to export, more ways to attempt to fix your horribly congested traffic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. While the game doesn't do a perfect simulation, as the AI drivers refuse to take up multiple lanes in some instances, the amount of detail is incredible. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and all the cars are traveling with a purpose. It is important to make sure all the needs of your city are met, whether it be water, waste, dead people, sick people, schooling, fires, it really becomes overwhelming really quick. In fact, most of your first attempts at this game will create perpetual hellholes of civilization, tall gloomy buildings stuffed with stinking dead bodies and backed up sewage. However, in my opinion this does only galvanizes you to make your city better, by redirecting traffic and building public transports to lessen the load on commuter roads. Who knew city planning could be so fun?Cities: Skylines isn't perfect, as evidenced by the traffic stingy AI and sometimes confusing circumstances where pressing criteria around the city aren't clear. There aren't any disasters that can hurt your city (other than accidental flooding from a Hydroelectric Dam). However, as seen by the ridiculous amount of mods that have hit the steam workshop a mere few days after release, this may be remedied. You can even create your own landscape using the map editors, and I dread to see what messing around with that will do my free time in the future.If you have any interest in city simulations at all, you need to get this game now. Probably the best one to come out in a long, long time."

Get the DLC.Without it, its kinda thin, still INCREDIBLY FUN. But thin.yes it disables achievements but mods also fix Mods fix all of these problems.yes i know, IT SHOULDNT NEED MODS TO BE A GOOD GAME WAAAAAAAAAAA!I dont care. Aside from those issues including that first moronic and utterly GLARING issue, Yes you read that right, i can post screenshots if needed, but you can build a highway underground.and i dont mean in the pretty, way i mean you can have built up your city and then build the thing right under it and blow up a few...ok maybe more than a few buildings, and get on ramps and off ramps down there.Saved my industrial section.Basically, you will have a city that has four zones. And each of these zones can have a specialization, Industrial ones are the most important and they areOil, Logging, Mining, General Industry(refinement)This is the Goods chain in C:SOil, Logging, Mining--->General Industry--->CommercialWhy does that matter? If gen industry doesnt get enough goods they dont send to commercial, if commercial doesnt get enough goods, the shop closesThe shop closes the people who work there lose their jobs. And your city collapses.The very longwinded point i am making, is that EVERY DECISION YOU MAKE IN THIS GAME MATTERS.not in the unfun punish you cause you didnt do it their way kind of type.But i the, that makes sense now how can i fix it my own way type.As a composer myself I will say it is nice, but dissapointing. What I disliked was the limited scope of the score.The fact is it always seemed to be the same 4 tracks just slightly tweaked, there was a lack of dynamism in the overall composition. There wasnt a track that had a more newyork street symphony feel to it or one that made me think of L.A or Dallas. It was just strings and flutes with some pads layered in.I appreciate the additional channels added in later mods and the composer's branching out, what i wish though was more of an expansion on the original score into new areas with different motifs than, This is the landscape waiting to be developed.Maybe some tracks using the original theme but with a more developed/chaotic orchestral sound.In summary, This game is a slightly buggy but wonderful simulation that focuses on how a city behaves like a living breathing organism than on gamifying every component of it, and witha wonderful lack of microtransactions i would say this is a great game that any one who enjoys seeing their city grow and coming up with creative solutions to problems would thoroughly enjoy.TL:DRI have Severe Clinically diagnosed ADHD and maintained focus long enough to write this.You can grow up and read it if you want to hear my opinion.Sick of this goldfish syndrome gamers have developed."

This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.Highs:* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.Lows:* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. * Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say ""100 per week"" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.Verdict:If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible."

But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).So stop reading this review and buy the game.For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free)."

In many ways Cities: Skylines feels like a grown-up sequel to that game. Obviously, the two are not made by the same developer etc, so there are some differences. But overall, after playing over 100+ hours, I have zero complaints. (Although being able to drive an ice-cream truck around the city would be nice 😉). I couldn't ask for a better city sim than this. Love it! ❤️"
329,Svirt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/svirt/,52,1,1,42.8,June,"6,",823,4,1,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while."

It is a very clunky game without certain mods and every time they force us to update it breaks all of the good mods. Then even once they are update you can still expect to spend days chasing down errors to make the game playable again. If Steam would just let us hold off on the updates until we are ready this issue would be solved. I personally would wait a few months before updating to give all of the mods makers a chance to work out the bugs. Steam, you guys should really follow the update pattern set by Mojang. When Minecraft is updated they don't force it on us. We can decide when to update and we can switch back to any previous version at any time. I know that it might not be possible to switch back with any game, but just let us turn off the forced updates."

After some time, though, you will get better and better at building cities, and this is when the real fun starts.The only really negative thing I have to say about Cities Skylines, is that the DLC's are seriously overpriced.

From the times of the original Simcity i have been wanting to walk around in my creation. Simcopter made an attempt butit was to far ahead of its time and failed. And now comes allong Cities:Skyline. This game has so much detail you can follow a single person around. He will go to work,chill at a park, play on his tablet in his back yard or on his balconey. And then you zoom out to a City on the scale of mexico city or new york. its enough to get lost for hours at a time. In adition to the amazing vanillla features, the game has full mod support so you can add first person mod,new houses even add tiny props the size of a flower pot. The game itself is extremely robust. i have been downloading random mods giving no thought on compatibility so i can see how the game handles mods. i only started to get problems when i reached page 40 on my mod list. And that stability under mods is the best i have seen in any game. Take Arma 3 for instance. here is a game that was build with modding in mind and that game starts to get game breaking issues once the number of mods break the 20 mod number. This leaves the game open to create your perfect city.dont have a house you want. make it.Put that all together and you have without a doubt in my mind the best city builder game the world has ever seen."

You have four demands that keep you ever expanding your city and those are: residential zone demand, industrial zone demand, business zone demand, and services demand (being schools, hospitals, police, electricity, water, etc.)Pros:- The game does a good job at encouraging expansion. You never stagnant because there is always something to build. You can take out loans so if you don't have money saved but demands for zones or services you don't have to wait.-Roads Roads Roads Roads Roads. Everything revolves around Roads. Everything must border a road to be built. You also have traffic. Creating a blueprint for your city is 90% deciding what roads to build and how to connect everything so traffic doesn't get congested. If you are like me when you are driving in a city and curse at the city planner for nonsensical/impractical design you will be humbled by this game when you realize these little simulated folks are cursing your name just as vehemently.-You have population milestones that expand your technologies and give you a sizable monetary bonus.Cons:-Traffic AI can be a huge problem if not dealt with early on.-Some buildings require a certain population level in order to unlock/build. Like a forestry industrial zone. Why do I need a certain population to cut down trees? Thankfully you can turn this feature off and be able to build everything right from the beginning so even that is hardly a negative.Conclusion: Cities Skylines is best at doing what is does, plus you get the expansion packs which enhance the longevity of the game. it's a game worth playing for hours and hours nonstop  =  9 / 10."

May take over the player's life.Every fan of management simulation games will obsess over Cities: Skylines while anyone who would enjoy the challenge of growing a city will have a great time with this game if they can tolerate the repetetive nature that hardcore management simulation fans thrive under.You grow the city, get more types of services and problems to confront, spend money where needed, and hope that your city can reach the next classification of city type, which grants more money, unlocks new buildings, and that takes you back to square one.  This style of gameplay sometimes gets too repetetive even for my aspie mindset of repetition, but playing this game in short bursts helps me tackle city problems and prevents me from staring at the screen with a blank expression wondering about what to do next while I wonder about how to use what little money I have to expand with while I'm unable to secure any more financing, and see money trickle into my account. (And sometimes watch money run out, depending on which way my luck cuts.)It's obvious from the get-go that this sort of game is graphics intensive, and Cities: Skylines is excellent in the graphics department.  You can easily see things like rain and fog, and see them all either up close, far away, and in full 3D.  But for better or worse, fog is mostly visible from far away, and not from up close.The animation and graphics for pollution is absolutely perfect.  You can not only see the dirty, filthy, stinking haze close up, but you can also see it from far away on buildings that pollute.The only real complaint about graphics, is that industries involved in oil drilling do not build oil derricks on top of their zones.It actually took me a long time to turn on the sound, and I only did so for the sake of writing a review.  There's nothing awe-inspiring or game-breaking about the game's sounds, but I really disliked the music.  The music was totally out of place, especially for viewing densely populated areas and streets with densely packed traffic.  Your best bet is to just move the main volume slider to 0%, and play music that's to your liking.  Of course, you are free to mute the music volume should you want to hear the game and also listen to your own music.This game is so awesome, I cannot include everything I like about Cities: Skylines.  (I tried, but my original review would not fit when I tried to copy and paste!) Cities:Skylines takes features from past city management sims, and takes them to a whole new level without feeling outright like a copycat game.  I will say that Cities: Skylines has everything I enjoy about city management games dating back to 1990 and the added ability to rename buildings of every kind, create districts, and rename these districts to anything one wishes.While I do love Cities: Skylines, I am bothered by some of the game's flaws, and there's enough flaws, I'm unable to bury the reader in as many paragraphs as I wanted, but I made the mistake of including things that I wish were features, or what I thought should be done differently.  With a city of close to 36,000 people, the only complaints I have room to mention, is that collection of trash and dead bodies is deeply flawed.  It doesn't matter if one has enough landfill or incenerator capacity or space in cemetaries and creamatories, the larger your city becomes, the more likely you can expect to see icons over buildings indicating filthy, stinking garbage and rotting corpses desperately in need of disposal, and the game does nothing to prioritize collection.  A game as complex as Cities: Skylines certainly requires a tutorial, but none is included in game.  Certainly the most seasoned of us need an interactive lesson in the fundamentals. The act of forbidding tractor trailers from operating on roads via city ordinance seems like a good idea at first, it really bothers me that banning tractor trailers on specific streets (and sometimes stretches of streets) requires making micro-districts dedicated solely to vehicle bans.Cities: Skylines has the city management game genre cornered.  No other city management sim competes. Buy this game.  Buy it at any price. If you can wait for a sale, that's cool, too.  If you like the idea of giving cities a unique feel, you have the ability to rename many of the things you see on see in your city.  And when you do buy this game, you should check out the DLC available for Cities: Skylines.  Some of them are really cool, but others look like awful moneygrabs that you would think only Electronic Arts would inflict upon the gaming world.  You should especially check out tutorials for this game before you start playing it, because if you don't, you can expect quite a bit of trial and error in the building of your city, and that could end up costing you lots of money.  Especially make sure you read the manual, unless you want to look at the forums (or ask questions that were long since asked) about how to build elevated roads.The game, however, is still plenty of good fun without any DLC's or custom content, so you can expect lots of fun times playing Cities: Skylines.  Just be sure to let your friends and family know they'll never hear from you again, and be prepared to stay up all night."

So should you be clicking on ""add to cart"" immediately? That depends. While the base game stands on its own well, most of the content DLC is fantastic....and expensive. My advise is... 1.) WAIT FOR A STEAM SALE!!. The base game, along with all but the most recent DLC, is often drastically reduced during steam sales due to its age. 2.)Unless you really really like it or have an exorbitant amount of disposable income, don't bother with the radio station or aesthetic DLCs because even with sale prices, the feature DLC packs will be costing plenty."

Each starting city part is already bigger than tiny SimCity maps and you can buy adjacent lands to make it x9 times bigger still.- Smarter traffic controls. Though there are some issues with cars disappearing or turning in the middle of the road or going through each other - at least routing works. You don't have to wait hours for an ambulance or fire truck to reach its point, garbage gets collected, resources get sold.- Paint and fill tools for zoning (finally!).- Road connections can be edited. You are not restricted to just one entry point.- Pipes and power lines are back.- Can move buildings to another spot for a fee.- Fluid mechanics when placing an electric dam.- Overall better UI, city info panels and responsiveness (no fudged data like in SimCity - the number of workers and residents adds up).Cons:- Plopping/building snapping. Unfortunately they added the same damn thing as in SimCity and restricted placing buildings only near roads. This results in a lot of wasted space between road connections and in small spaces. It cannot be switched off either.- No tutorial whatsoever and the hint system doesn't cover everything. Took me a while to realize that my elderly population doesn't work and i have to constantly build new houses like in Banished.- No landscaping tools.- Not enough parks. Most of them are huge so there is really no way to make beautiful city centres unless you are building in squares.- Weather and time of day do not change.- Zoning and placing roads is often a chore since they rarely snap at proper angles... again unless you build in squares.- Annoying sounds and twitteresque replacement of the ""news ticker"" from SimCity.- Biased approach to power plants - they are basically forcing you to be eco friendly since wind turbines are cheaper and more efficient than everything else. This is very unrealistic and unfair in my opinion.- Can't view overlays and build at the same time. Huge oversight since you need to know where to zone industrial for ore and farm placement.- All of the public transportation lines look the same, got same colour (all of the bus lines are the same colour and all of the metro lines too) and are generally hard to create and distinguish.- Lack of building upgrades. This probably was the only good idea from SimCity that should've been copied here.Overall there are quite a few annoyances and issues at the moment but all of them are compensated by the fact that this game is actually fun and doesn't feel like a couped up  tiny sandbox like SimCity.Its definitely better than CitiesXL as well, since it performs and runs smoother, uses more than 1 core, does not appear to have memory leaks and feels generally better made.

And aslo the DLCs (not all of them :| ) are just as good, like Green Cities, Mass Transit, Parklife, Industries (although I still haven't playet it yet) and Natural Disasters, but you can have an amazing experience playing with just the base game.

I always been a big fan och city builders and was a little worried that this one would not live up to my expectations, like some other games in the genre....But boy this one delivers more then I could ever hope for, it's only been out for a few days and it feels extremely well polished and the amount of effort put into the small details is amazing. Probably a quarter of the time I spent in my cities have been just enjoying how it looks and following the citizens around doing what they do. The agent system the citizens are based around works quite good and basically everything can be renamed, from people to buildings.It is also possible to zone different regions in the city and give them individual focuses and different policies wich is an amazing feature that does alot for the immersion, and I would imagine could be awesome for those that likes to recreate irl cities.The tools the game has available for creating roads is really solid to, personally I love to create spaghetti junctions and overly complicated networks that barely work and then try to fix them up. The traffic simulator is working and it feels like it responds to changes in the network quite well. Public transport for the game I have mixed feelings about, you have to manually create lines for busses, trains etc using a similar but less complicated system from Cities in Motion. This has the potential to be something really good but at the same a tedious task, and it makes me wish there were more tools to track groups of citizens travelling paths.I haven't played around with mods and custom assets yet but the built in features seems to be really good and the steam workshop integration allows easy access to other peoples creations, some amazing mods for this is bound to happen.I could write alot more about this but I don't have time... I want to get back to play it again!"
380,BigBlueWolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bigbluewolf/,34,3,1,232.0,August,"19,",496,0,1,"Hands-down the best city simulator since . Even with it's known issues, the amount of love poured into this game is obvious. There's also a vibrant and talented modding community with so much content in the Steam Workshop that you're bound to find any number of add-ons that will give your dream city that extra touch you're looking for. And if you feel overwhelmed, check out the tons of YouTube videos from experienced city builders to get new players started with the basics.Without a doubt, traffic is the biggest issue with this game. I highly recommend the  DLC along with the base game at minimum. Some transit options are buried in DLC that are not transit related -- tram/light rail: , bicycle lanes and taxis: , etc -- but these aren't showstoppers. There's also excellent mods that address some of the short-comings of the traffic AI, different road size and placement options and -- most critically -- mods that allow you to fine-tune road segments post-placement for that polished look that you can't get otherwise.I highly suggest looking at videos and articles that explain how to best design your road systems in order to not have a hair-ripping traffic experience. Smart road placement, junction control, and city/district polices that suppress or encourage certain kinds of traffic all come into use here.And speaking of videos, there's tons of them on just about any aspect of the game. Want to learn how to make maps of real locations? Strategies for building on hilly terrain? How to efficiently plan your subways? Several people have probably made a tutorial or ten about each.Although the game is approaching five years old, Colossal Order is still pumping out DLC. It's important to note, however, that they are not doing it like other simulation franchises that merely offer new assets to plop on your map. The focus of the DLCs are on new behavior and features. If you're looking for new assets, the workshop is where you go. Between these two resources, the game is practically its own sequel since its original release."

Honestly, this is the type of game you can play all day without getting bored as build a vibrant city. + Easy to learn with very intuitive menues, and features that slowly unlock as your city builds. There really isn't need for any tutorials, you will learn as you play.+ Visually the game looks gorgeous, and it is a delight to go into camera-mode and just watch as your city thrives. You can even see your people as they go about their daily tasks. What is most surprising is the variety of buildings / houses / stores that are built, and they all look great.+ Day / Night Cycle and Weather to add a further sense of emersion.+ Challenging, you have a budget which you have to constantly keep an eye on. Every so often you will have growing pains, where you may suddenly run out of power or water, or perhaps a building will catch on fire, or perhaps the crime rate goes up or you run out of garbage trucks, or maybe a giant traffic jam. You have to be ready to deal with all these issues and more while trying to manage a steady tax rate and keep people from getting unhappy and moving out.+ You can buy addional plots of land and build multiple HUGE thriving cities+ Steam Workshop with a bunch of new buildings and scenerios- The biggest disappointment for me is the lack of pre-build scenerios or ""challenge levels / missions"". The main goal seems to be to just grow as large you possibly can, and then start over.- The road system could be improved a bit. It's a bit difficult to make neat and uniform roads with proper exits. On top of this, building various road types and highways is VERY expensive making it difficult to improve areas with dense congested traffic.Side Note: If you were wondering, Yes this game is far greater than Sim City"

There's a ton of different buildings and structures to choose from, ranging from residential houses and apartment buildings to commercial businesses, industrial facilities, and more.One of the things I really like about Cities: Skylines is how it gives you a lot of control over your city's infrastructure. You can build roads, set up public transportation, and even manage your city's water and power systems. It can get pretty complex, but it's also a lot of fun figuring out the best ways to keep your citizens happy and your city running smoothly.Another plus is the game's graphics. The buildings and landscapes look really good, and it's fun to watch your city grow and change over time. There's also a pretty active online community, with lots of mods and custom content available to download and use in your own cities.One of the downsides of this game is the learning curve. This game does not come with any ingame tutorials, other than the advisor hints, so failure is inevitable. That can be a bit overwhelming for beginners, especially for those who are just starting out with city-building or management games. Overall, I'd say Cities: Skylines is a solid choice for anyone who's into management games. Just be warned, it can be pretty addictive once you get started!"

Probably they had to do this due to new European privacy laws, so I assume non-EU gamers did not get this prompt. But that probably just means they don't tell you what info they are collecting (and sharing with third parties). Anyway, not agreeing to the privacy policy means not being able to play anymore. Data collection consists of analysis of hardware and software. No boundaries are mentioned there, so your entire harddrive is up for grabs. They also like to take a look at what games you own, what you play, when and how long you play and while they're at it, Paradox will also look over your shoulder while you are playing. This makes me very uncomfortable.Other info they collect which I consider private, unlikely to serve to improve the product and also completely irrelevant to share with their third parties:This will be shared with Facebook and Google (and at least 10 other commercial parties). If you don't have an account there, don't worry, this should give them plenty of info to make an account for you. Civ6 (and many other games) had Red Shell implemented, which was also a type of spyware. It caused outrage and then it got removed due to the negative reviews. Let's hope we can convince Paradox to make the same call. But it requires you to write a review.Maybe this a new way for the gaming industry to generate money because the lootboxes are now illegal in the EU and since DLC's aren't as cool anymore. But I bought this game with money, I don't want to also pay with my private info."

Well, I live in California and notice while I am driving around Angels Camp, and other foothill communities there is not much traffic!, but when I drive in San Francisco or L.A.  there is an overwhelming amount of traffic.  1+1 =   Pretty much goes with the population.   I decided to go with just low residential on my map and I first began with bus routes through those communities dropping them off at schools, commercial districts and clean industry areas.  I noticed they RODE the busses and I made good money!Next I did trams on the out skirts and inner areas of those residential areas and noticed they rode the trams!  I LOVE monorails! I always have.  When I finally was able to use monorails,  I decided to make a tourist area and then I plopped down the harbor for passengers.  It works in this game.  The tourists came.  I brought the monorail to them, having HUGE bus lines from the city in the central hub.  They use it!  My busses are organized and no traffic!   I got the airport.  Obviously, I brought the monorail to it.  I have seven monorail lines around my city!  I have nearly 50 bus lines.  I MAKE my tourists use the trams, because when they get off the monorails, it's too LONG to walk to the tourist area, so they go to the center of the road and get on the trams, which go to different tourist areas!!      This game is FUN!  Thankfully I watched a video and he reccommended ALWAYS use four lane roads, because they are easily upgradeable!  Best advice I could share also.    Mass Transit!  It's what it promises!  My monorails are FULL!  They WAIT in line for the Trams!  And they wait in line for the busses when they get off in the MAIN Monorail HUB, which has four lines servicing it!!  I tinker with the monorails, trams and busses.  EASY to see if a line needs more!  Some lines are PACKED!  I decided to put in the Space Elevator!  OMG!  LOL.  I had to put in 3 more monorails on that line to take the passengers and four more trams!     LOVE the game!  Thanks so much for your efforts!  I appreciate them and see what you have made.  Fun!"

The restrictions on the game at its peek is minimal, exponentially smaller than a triple-A produced game of recent years, with the ability to remove all restrictions.The gameplay is slick and smoother, with normal decent controls and a good UI, and an even more detailed view of finer data like the space need to build a structure alongside a road, a better resource and feedback view, and other new elements introduced like noise pollution with elements and tools at hand to counter it. The game uses a nice system of the industry type zoning, with placing them in specific types of land with resources, and then applying the type of work they do with the use of the district painting tool. Certainly a new way of production that I haven't seen before, and it's kind of nice and sort of makes some sense instead of having just one building produce one specific type in mass.The transportation and traffic controls in the game is real and it packs a punch, as it was created by the same developers who made Cities In Motion 1 & 2, which was mainly focused and is specialized on the transportation systems. So if you don't have a nice road map for you city, you will probably have issues with other cervices doing their jobs and as a result having more issues to deal with, which is great.The problems with the game consist of the game not teaching you well enough on how the systems work, but you I managed to learn almost everything to make a decently big city on my second playthrough. My first time playing the game was arguably created a horrible city, but my second playthrough was a lot nicer after having all the experience and knowledge I gained from my first go at it, and at this point it's fine tuning with my third time at creating a nice city. Not a problem, more of a nit picky thing, the monuments in the game where mediocre in it's scale and design, as I wasn't overwhelmed by it's looks or scale. Plus, the game doesn't have any sort of flying services, which left me heavily focusing on my structural groundwork immensely more so I don't screw up later on and damage my city.Overall Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder that I and many others needed, from the glorious days of the past, to the disappointments of modern times concerning a nice city builder, SC brings joy and hope that we finally get to have in this genre, for the asking price and for what you get and what you will get later on with support for community support, this is a definite good purchase.Shameless  to original post"

Similarly there are number of bugs or unfortunate quirks that this game is yet to overcome.There is a deluge of paid downloadable content, which is fine if you've been playing since release, but for most it has become extremely inaccessible; this is especially apparent looking at the DLC from a quality and quantitative perspective.The main reason why Cities: Skylines is so good, is that there's little to no competition that meets the scope and depth of this game. If you're looking for a city designing/planning game then Cities: Skylines has my full recommendation - however if you're looking towards politics or region planning then I'd look elsewhere.Make sure to buy on sale, only purchase the necessary DLC and to investigate the ever expanding modlist that this game offers.

However the issues I talk about below, and a now very intrusive EULA, keep the review as is, based on the cost to content ratio.  At a much lower price, I might recommend it, or with some basic DLC, like disasters, included in a well-priced bundle, but currently, I believe the customer is being taken advantage of - especially now that they collect your data and sell it.)Same as most others, I am disappointed by Paradox's choice to release DLC packs for what really should have been updates or even included with the base game at launch.  To top it off, the DLC is priced on the high end comparative to what you get for each one.Really... Disasters are a paid-for DLC.  Disasters have been included in city building games since SimCity way back 30 years ago.  This is not a new concept that should be additional paid-for DLC.The game could have been awesome - and even fitting to have valuable paid-for DLC worth purchasing - however, the way they stripped out so many basic features in favor of offering these at an additional premium really leaves a bad impression.  It is like playing a Free to Play game with features behind a paywall, except, you have to pay for the base game too.  Sort of twisted."

Not only does their launcher reside outside of steam you cannot uninstall it and run the game normally. There is a simple and safe way to have steam launch the game without the launcher installed, but I choose not to support them because they try to auto-subscribe you to their YouTube, force EULA for the launcher, Require a useless Paradox Interactive account with no simple way to cancel. I for one have blacklisted the launcher with my A/V just in case.All in all, I love CS and will continue to play, however I will never buy from such an appalling company which puts money and stats above integrity and their customers.Good Bye Paradox Interactive- For ClarificationWhile I can't speak for the others but from a security standpoint having something auto installed without my knowledge and not providing a decline or opt-out option; In today 'n age isn't a very smart idea which is why people are classifying it as malware. Also having it install outside of the steam game lib. presents a direct security threat as it can not be validated by steam, in fact steam has not control over it let alone manage it.( my direct option here) It would seem that steam would blindly download the launcher and auto install it at launch of CS;, hopefully there would be some safety checks but who knows.( enough techy bable )I also literally got unsubscribe from their YouTube; I highlight this because I was already subscribed and their launcher tried to auto sub me ( which back fired) you shouldn't make choices for people  IMOSimply put, I saw a slowdown on my PC after its install and in launching the game. All that aside I do plan to re visit it and if it is indeed an improvement I'll adjust my review.I personally don't approve of it unless they take out the main menu and make the launcher just that a central place to control the start of the game.-That's all folks"

447,cuddlykitkat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuddlykitkat/,19,1,1,123.5,June,"24,",44,0,1,"Probably one of my most-played games, and for good reason. It's got quite a learning curve to a) build a city that functions and b) build something that looks GOOD, but with time (and lots of YouTube tutorials) you can start to build something that feels right. Mod support is plentiful, though some things feel downright essential when playing, such as the MoveIt mod, which helps with the very finicky road-building tools the base game provides.I do have some qualms with the DLC -- without adding them on the base game feels like it's pretty... empty. There are a lot of things that feel like they should be included from the get-go, especially some of the mass-transit add-ins of newer packs like Sunset Harbor. The DLCs are not required and you can still have fun without them, but a lot of the new features added by them make the game a lot more enjoyable. Figuring out which ones appeal to you is probably for the best -- I'm a sucker for building massive tram networks so the Snowfall DLC is a must-buy for me, but maybe you're more of a monorail guy, so you should get Mass Transit (which doesn't include trams for some reason?). Check YouTube playthroughs and see if anyone uses a pack that really strikes your fancy. Some of the newer DLC packs have AMAZING starting maps too, which sadly aren't free.Overall a really fun game, even if there are a lot of little frustrations in the design (especially wrt mixed-use zoning or the lack of middle density). Mods can help a lot, as can the DLC, but hoo boy are all the DLC together expensive. Don't bother with the radio packs, though."

Cities Skylines isn't perfect (eg. rough UI, lack of goals, confusing public transport, rudimentary map editor, missing your favorite type of roads, etc etc), but it shows us what's achievable, with SimCity series back on hiatus, Cities Skylines is the new standard.The future for Cities Skylines is bright, will add more comments as I play."

This can be fixed by using the Traffic Manager: President Edition mod. - No tutorial at the beginning of the game.

You don't just place the appropriate buildings to gain their benefit as in other, more plain, city builders. In Cities: Skylines you actually need to plan your city logically. Traffic, pollution, healthcare, deathcare, fire safety, police safety, and disaster safety all matter.A city can be crippled poorly designed intersection(s) and logistics. This can lead to several outcomes. A fire may take out your industry if fire trucks cannot reach the location. Pollution can make people sick. If these sick people die they must be taken to a cemetary. I think it is fun to design cities that effectively mitigate most of these things. Each gameplay is different for me. This is especially true if you play with random disasters. I would recommend this as it certainly adds character to your city and its design."

My father is an urban planner, as was his father, and his father before him (his father's father's father copulated with goats and is seldom brought up in polite conversation). But the fast cars/money/women/goats lifestyle of urban planning never appealed to me. Much to my family's chagrin I pursued writing, and they were (and continue to be!) devastated. Before disowning me my father sat me down at the computer and urged me to play Cities: Skylines. “This is in your blood son,” he smiled, weary from a hard day of urban planning. “Please. For me. For the family.”So I started to build my first city across from a scenic river... and, I don't know. I don't know how to explain it. It just clicked. I stretched roads in a grid and began zoning – visitors to my fair city would be greeted by our booming industry district, noisy and dirty and beautifully anarchistic; past the fuming towers they would admire our chic commercial district, busy with pedestrians and bathed in neon lights; further still they would find themselves in our residential district, with manicured lawns and parks and homes galore. But to build a city you have to do more than just plan. You have to create.I built powerful turbines to power my city and laid pipes for water to rush in and out. Satisfied I unpaused the game and watched. Slowly, skeletal structures emerged from the earth, supports were raised and lowered, and buildings became occupied. Little storefronts popped up, factories rose up, and dream homes were built. Cars flooded my little two lane streets, full of wide-eyed country bumpkins presumably. And things were good, for a time. I sat and watched my little citizens rush to and fro, traffic ebb and flow, and more buildings appear from empty lots.Perhaps my father had a point.Oh, an achievement unlocked!Bad Mayor. Have 15% Happiness.♥♥♥♥.I guess I wasn't paying close enough attention – wait, what do you mean “sewage is bubbling up?”And so my city, 420BlazeIt360NoScope, drowned in a sea of human waste. Langston Hughes, a dream deferred does indeed stink of rotten meat, for the record. It was also crusty.Cities: Skylines is the sleekest, smartest, and most potentialicious city builder available currently – and may possibly remain so thanks to integrated, dedicated modding support. You'll start off in the vanilla game with a single tract of land and an off ramp. To get your city off the ground you'll do what I mentioned previously - sans massive sewage backup. You'll zone districts, set up the water and electricity, and watch your little hamlet bustle. As your population grows so will your abilities and responsibilities. You'll have to build accessible clinics, police stations, schools, and fire stations. You'll have to keep pollution (sound, ground, and water) in check. Districts lines will be drawn and policies enacted, like establishing an industrial sector in a particularly fertile area as a farming region, or banning smoking in a residential area. Prompts will flash if garbage is getting out of hand, buildings are abandoned, taxes are too high, etc. In addition Chirper, the game's Twitter feed thingy, will tweet pertinent (if sometimes repetitive and annoying) information.With every addition and upgrade you'll have to expand further and further, balancing the budget, happiness, and health of your city along the way. Eventually you can purchase as many as nine map tiles, upgrading, rebuilding, rezoning, public transit, shipping... the scope of it is a little overwhelming (old hands at city building sims will find themselves in familiar territory and will likely have bustling metropolis' in no time. For the uninitiated I'd recommend watching the frequent Twitch streams and Youtube LPs)! Mastering C:S requires a great deal of foresight. Sure, you can build the cheap coal and oil power plants, but pollution will skyrocket and illness may spread. Build the more expensive green energy alternatives and you'll contend with noise pollution and have to choose more specific locations to place them. Traffic will begin to bottleneck on busier roads, and buildings out in the boonies will be more vulnerable to crime and fire (and fire crime, “arson” sounds much to pedestrian). When you have a breather, however, it's one of the most relaxing, satisfying games I've ever played. Watching your citizens go about their days is mesmerizing... people walk their dogs, firetrucks blare by, garbage trucks make their rounds. It feels alive.Despite some technical glitches (trains jumping tracks, cars driving into burning buildings, little oversights with no bearing that SHOULD be patched early into release), I don't really have any complaints. Yes, seasons and a night cycle would have been nice, more aesthetic “flavors” for buildings and locations would keep things fresh, and more “disasters” to deal with besides those created by player ineptitude would be fun to contend with (natural, human, seasonal, or just plain silly). While the vanilla game might get boring after twenty or thirty hours, there are already mods, new assets, and maps to spice things up. Just like a real city, a REAL community, this game's replayability will be dependent upon community involvement. And I predict a lot of brilliant mods and patches to come.There's something really special about C:S and I can't quite put my finger on it. It's like waking up on DESIGNATED APPLICABLE HOLIDAY morning to a big present, and you unwrap it and it's one of those farm playsets, or when you're zooming toy cars along the roads of your city map rug, or admiring an elaborate diorama in a quiet museum. And then somewhere nearby a toilet explodes."

Because it promises in-depth gameplay, hyped by a committed community of talented artists and constantly pumped full of life by talented modders... But the reality is that it is a highly surface level simulation that leaves too many itches unscratched, even with millions of mods.For instance... - The single use zoning aspect of the game essentially locks you into North American style planning, with a CBD and sprawling suburbs. Outside of public services and utilities, you can only place single buildings, or relocate them on a lot, by using mods that slow your game and clutter your menus.- The property value system means that if you've provided enough services, every residence becomes a gentrified highrise and every commercial building becomes a skyscraper - there are no controls for this.To control the aesthetics of your city, you need to download GBs of modded assets, and then deselect the assets you don't want and select the ones you do. It's incredibly time consuming and tedious.- There are unhappiness, policy and tax features that don't really do anything, but could have easily brought deeper complexity to the game.- The maps begin as blank fields, more akin to suburban parks than any wilderness you'd find, or rural district. Creating wilderness maps is tedious, especially in balancing terrain - rivers are generally lined by cliffs. If you want hills in your city, you have to also be happy with the building graphics failing to adapt.- Industry and demand is too abstract, with commercial demand being entirely random, so a sim will travel 2 hrs across the map for 'food', instead of to the nearest shop.- it's incredibly tedious, nigh impossible, to simulate realistic (or even idealistic) looking agriculture,- There is no need to emulate historic city growth, aesthetically or realistically - no need for fresh water, you start with cars but not trains, trucks but not ports, etc. The game demands you build a modern car-oriented city and you will struggle to implement anything else. The game refuses to let you operate at a human scale - you can easily throw down train lines and free ways, but all of the ways that these concepts impact us as city dwellers is washed away.I could write a book on all the issues I had with this game...Mods help the game immensely, but they also slow it down, make it immensely tedious, and make it unstable. They make the game very taxing for PCs, and you will often lag fairly early into your city building experience. They also trying to combat deeply ingrained mechanics, rather than work with them - you can't mod out terrible design.In my opinion, much like many Total Wars and like the Elder Scrolls series, this is a good 'base' of a game that is severely lacking in thought and depth, and needed longer in development to have its kinks ironed out. I am hoping a sequel to this game would have significantly deeper mechanics that offer more control to the player and more realism and context as to why cities are built they way they are."

So if you build a large city, it actually gets easier to manage transit beyond a certain point, because the maximum number of simulated citizens is spread out over a larger and larger area, leaving your roads and trains more and more deserted.The traffic simulation is still notorious for having miles of backups in one lane. You can micromanage around it by using mods to specify which lanes should go where, but it's tedious and imperfect.Almost all of the DLC has just added more content into a broken game, rather than fixing the underlying mechanics.

480,[🅰]вѕσℓυ𝓽ツ🎮,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iubjaved/,24,,1,10.6,July,"1,","2,424",0,1,"Building a city can be difficult. Nobody expects you to succeed in this already lively world packed to the brim with popular and famous cities. It won't be easy, you'll need to start small and work your way up, but if you plan ahead, budget popular, and take care of those who enter to call your city home, good things will come in time.Let's start from the beginning. You’re thrown into the chaos of financial and structural management immediately, with no tutorial missions or levels. But that's fine because it won't take longer for you to get into the game and it's mechanics. Cities: Skylines is developer Colossal Order’s first meaningful foray into the genre. A developer better known for their transportation simulation games with the Cities in Motion series, one would think that a city-building simulation game is a pretty natural progression. One would be exactly right in thinking this as Cities: Skylines is magnificent. There’s no point trying to hide it, because it just is. Cities: Skylines is just how a city-building simulator should be. If you despised SimCity for its tiny scale, this is not a tiny game. Skylines begins small, but as your city grows, you're able to unlock more and more of the surrounding countryside. It gets to the point where you can start building satellite communities just for the hell of it, because your primary city is so damn big.Now I don’t want to give people the impression that Cities: Skylines is re-inventing the wheel for the city-building genre. If anything, they are merely improving and tweaking the wheel to fit modern standards so that we are no longer consigned to playing games made more than a decade ago for a good city-building sim.One of these things is the fact that the amount of land your city encompasses isn’t just limited to the 2km x 2km square that you start with. You get to “buy” more adjacent land tiles to eventually encompass 36 square kilometers of land, and that’s without mods that can bring it up to 25 tiles or 100 square kilometers. Another interesting thing they’ve done is uncouple the idea of commercial and office buildings. Commercial buildings are like shops, departments stores and cinemas, which historically was jumbled up with office buildings. Now they are two separate things, thus allowing you, the player, a lot more freedom when it comes to deciding how your city will be laid out.  Speaking of districts, that’s also another pretty cool feature that Cities: Skylines brings to the table. You can now draw out what constitutes a district and actually give it a name. Cities: Skylines also does a good job of pacing the development of your town, Most things will be locked and unavailable to build in your town until certain milestones, usually populations size, are met. This is good on many levels as it prevents you from over-investing in infrastructure and services that you can barely afford as it is. Then there are some features that are missing that one would probably expect or highly desire in a city-building sim like a day and night cycle. Say what you want about the 2013 SimCity, but it was pretty cool to watch streetlights go on and off and your sims go about their daily businesses and participate in rush hours.Cities: Skylines is how city-building games ought to be. It’s fun, it’s pretty, it’s easily approachable, yet, difficult to master. It doesn’t have all the features that one might dream of in the perfect city-building simulator like a day-night cycle or swathes of data and statistics to comb through when optimizing your city, but it does absolute wonders with the features it does have."

It has become heavily infected with Paradox's microtransaction disease, but 95% of the content that you really want in the game is available on the workshop or in the larger DLCs. The game is relaxing and engaging with pretty good performance if you consider the complexity involved in rendering a complete simulation of a modern city.

The reason behind it is because I tend to be very bad at organizing my priorities in games such as this. Too many factors to take into account. Too many different things that could, and will, go wrong if you're not careful. It's just who I am. For whatever reason, probably a price drop and the good reviews, I decided to purchase the game. At first I was a complete mess, lost doing the simplest things, but instead of abandoning it as I would have a few months ago, I decided to look for some tips on youtube, and then a few guides. I was hyped that you could do so much with the city and started playing and building randomly at first, trying out stuff I had seen. Some of it worked, some of it didn't. The thing is, I started to like what I used to hate about these type of simulators. When my city didn't work anymore, I built a new city and started again. I think now I have the hold of most of the basics and I'm ready to move on to the next step! Maybe buying another slot.

489,SpaceCouncil,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceCouncil/,55,8,1,34.4,August,"3,",751,0,1,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder and economy simulator in the vain of the oh so fallen from grace SimCity.  is essentially a sandbox for you to plan out, build certain amenities and hopefully people will want to move in and make your city thrive. Initially when you first jump into the game it starts with many of the options grayed out and it sort of gates you in this manner as you get used to the basics of building roads and zoning out areas as well as providing electricity, water and sewage treatment facilities. Then, as things unlock such as healthcare facilities and schools, you'll be able to get a better grasp of each system. You'll have access to crime, fire safety reports. As well as noise and actual pollution overlays. Should you desire to “go green” the use of wind turbines are also available as well as a corresponding wind chart for peak efficiency. The game makes use of a relatively humorous but sometimes annoying fake twitter for your citizens to @mention you and tell what you're doing wrong and in rare cases what you are doing right. At least in my experience. You can inact policies like water preservation or power conservation and even things like mandatory smoke alarms in homes. Typically, at the cost of increased upkeep while decreasing use of resources or in this specific case the likelihood of fire even though that's not technically what fire alarms do. This is how the game “gameifies” that sentiment. There are weather effects and a day/night cycle. Which led to a moment I don't often have in gaming that was slightly existential. For setup, I was early on in my learning the game and had not really understood how to get things going faster when the first night struck. Without power, without people living in my city, it was entirely pitch black; And I had this rather obvious realization the more I think about it but at the time was borderline transcendental though I'm not fond of the connotations of that word; I was sat there “We really are just floating on a rock out in space”. As though this was not already obvious to everyone. This just seemed like a very odd and probably the least likely of places or style of game for someone to have that thought process. Let alone in a game at all. The game also features mod and steam workshop support which leads to nearly endless types of buildings and other various ideas that modders can come up with. There is also economy and budget screens to adjust taxes on different districts or different zones. As well as increase or decrease funding of maintenance on city utilities and services. If I had anything bad to say about the game is that it is not always overtly clear how to do something. It requires a lot of tooling around and experimenting.  In a very specific example setting up bus routes is rather ill contrived, at times down right purposely misleading in its functionality. Though a tutorial on proper usage can easily be sought out if need be outside the game. It also features what I'd consider a fairly unique aesthetic. It does indeed have a film grain slider. Which when combined with the depth of field and lighting gives this almost physical model like appeal.  Like it's a table in your basement with your model trains running along it. Zooming in, if you just look down a street it almost feels alive. I want to invoke the powers of Mr. Rodgers here but I fear the reference may be lost among the traffic."

It's so small on my screen that it is almost unreadable. This problem is being experienced by many other players of the game aswell.

499,miklol,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lobinou/,313,15,0,59.1,February,"8,",166,27,1,"TL;DR: sandbox game for creative players. If your creativity is channeled through problem-solving, then this game will leave you wanting.I have tried so hard to like the game.Hands-down, technically the . The problem is: I don't have the urge to come back to it. 5 hours in, lack of interest settles in, I just give up and start over. Rince and repeat. I  though I'm looking hard.Therefore it's aimed at  players, who just play on unlimited resources and invest time in designing a beautiful city.Lack of challenge makes you fail to see the point of anything after a couple hours. ""Ok, I can improve traffic, but what's the point, people still come to my city and budget is fine anyway"". ""Criminality? Okay, whatever. Budget's fine"".""Cool, I can fine tune the budget with all the sliders!... I can make tax-free zones for specific industries!... but I don't care and won't ever use it because there's absolutely no point"".If you're the kind of person who just wants to design stuff, then you'll have a blast. If you channel your creativity through problem-solving, then boredom will settle in quickly.If you're anything like me, then you will find that there's no point in moving away from the ""grid"" city-design. Every block is a square, crossroads are crosses, because that's the more efficient choice. So if you're a problem solver, all your cities will look the same.That may sound stupid to Americans, but here in old Europe, cities have grown organically over the course of millenias: cars are barely allowed in medieval city centers, which have tons of pedestrians-only walkways; low-rent flats are usually in the cities' outskirts; then, further away, the big business center with highrises, accessible by road or public transportation, built in a very windy spot or on an old marsh, because that's the only spot where our ancestors didn't build anything...I dream of the day a city-builder will have us build a city through the ages. Imagine the challenges! Your 1200 AD city needs wall for defense, but cannons will soon render this useless and you'll be left with crumbling walls dividing your city between center and outskirts. Industrial revolution comes around and now you need housing for workers, railroads for supply: means you have to burn down some of those outskirts houses and decide what to do with their poor inhabitants... Enters XXth cenury, in order allow cars into the city you need larger avenues, so then again you need more space! Residents won't be happy... Then, fast-forward 2010, there is so much traffic that you need to reshape everything around cycling and public transportation...You could choose to start in the New World around 1600 AD, where challenges are entirely different...If you built your city originally on a marsh, or trapped between mountains, or in windy plains, then you would have different challenges and opportunities, renewed every new era.Now, THAT would keep me playing till 4am. Cities: Skylines? Sadly, no."
500,"Saul Slendamann, Attorney at Law",https://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/,19,1,1,46.7,February,"7,",725,0,1,"This was the best citysim to come out in the 2010s. Cities: Skylines not only towered above EA's perfunctory 2013 SimCity reboot, it stood up with the all time classics of that series, striking a balance between SimCity 3000's accessibility and 's depth. That's to say nothing of how redundant it rendered the samey Cities XL series. The base game is alright by itself, but not only are there already more DLCs and expansions than SimCity 4 ever got, Steam Workshop integration makes finding and using player-created mods ten times easier than it was for SimCity 4.The only real problems I can think of are that there isn't much of a tutorial for new players - they just get interface popups every time they start a new city - that the user interface isn't quite as intuitive as in the classic SimCity games, and that some of the expansions/DLCs are rather expensive yet light on content. The learning curve problems can be overcome with time and perhaps an internet guide or two, and community reviews can alert you to what DLCs are worth it or not. The DLCs also go on sale semi-frequently.I have three main criticisms of the gameplay itself; not enough to sink the game, but noticeable things that are worth downloading mods to address.* The first is the way the game handles industrial traffic: in the real world, a fair portion of it is shipped by rail, but in this game, it's mainly sent by road, which absolutely clogs up your road system beyond the traffic an industrial area would normally produce in real life.* Even with all the DLCs that have been added to the game, Skylines still lacks a key tenet of modern urban planning, which is mixed use zoning. Without it, the game struggles that much harder to get out from under the shadow of the outmoded 1950s/60s urbanist planning mindset that SimCity generally modeled. I suppose with that in mind, the store blurb isn't lying when it says the game is a 'modern' take on the 'classic' citybuilder. Other than this, it's still a fun experience.* A third issue is that the game charges you with delivering the corpses of your dead citizens to cemeteries and crematoriums, and every so often your city will go through ""death waves"" where a bunch of people die at once, because immigration to your city tends to come from waves of people who are around the same age. You end up needing more deathcare buildings than real cities have, especially since in real life, it's generally not something city governments do in the first place.Those are still ultimately minor blemishes on an otherwise good game, and for people new to city simulators, I'd say this is the best you could possibly do apart from going over to GOG and picking up SimCity 3000. While some of the expansions add goal-oriented scenarios, the meat of the game is in freeform city building. It gives you more freedom than any previous citysim did while maintaining the experience of managing a city, and for people who just want to make things look pretty, there's a built-in infinite money option that removes budget worries.For people who are already familiar with classics like SimCity 4, you frankly probably already own this game, but a rundown here won't hurt you any. It's generally a worthy successor, and the easier modding alone makes it worth picking up if you haven't for some reason. It adds a couple of the EA reboot's better features, principally freeform roads and optional resource extraction. More attention must be paid to traffic logistics, given that public services now actually utilize your road system, and perennial traffic jams kind of make it hard for garbage trucks to make their rounds, as just one example. Sewage also must be dumped back out somewhere - hopefully not in the same place your water pump is taking input. The in-game radio stations are neat, and a couple of the DLC ones even have jazz reminiscent of SimCity's music.I'd like to close by saying how great it is that there's an entire expansion dedicated to ""green cities"" and climate sustainability. Even if it is paid content, the mere thought counts for a lot. The main game, at least, is well worth trying out."

I've been playing since Simcity Classic and SimCity 2000!  ♥♥♥♥ I'm getting old.EDIT 2-28-2019:  I also would like to mention that these types of simulation/tycoon games have more niche followings and DLC's allow them to support the developers yearly income years after the game released vs pushing out $60 copies every 2 years that are made from scratch and compromise on features.  After all, Colossal Order is only ~17 employees.  The mods alone for this game give it amazing unlimited value without the DLCs"

If you are looking for a Citybuilder wich focusses more on BUILDING your City.Its detailed like no builder before, you will spend hours decorating your town, plazas transitstations and so on...When you are looking for a MANAGEMENT- Game this falls a bit flat.The management focus here is all about traffic. Public needs and politics are on a pretty basic level and after a few hours you will have no problems with money. Citizens are also so easy to please, it could be a bit more detailed with different Political partys and public uprising, sadly most mechanics wich go in this direction are so basic...  After like 100 hrs i didnt give a s*** about pollution or anything like this anymore.I would generally reccomand turning off money and activating all buildings from the beginning in ""Sandbox mode"" and just use Money and the unlock mechanic for the Scenarios, it don´t matter and after the first 1-2 hours on a map money is pretty much just a timer. Its nearly impossible to get into debts and is just a limitation to BIG building project.It seems like this is one of the most common reasons to give this a downvote so i´ll talk about Mods here:Yes many mods seem nessesearly and i would loose my interesst in Cities pretty fast without Anarchy mods, more beautification and manymanymany more. BUT instead calling the devs ""idiots"" cause they cant implement what others already done, im sure this comes down to One reason: HARDWAREWith the ~60 mods (and ~2000 Assets) i use, my RAM usage is at 20+ GB without Stuff like Loadscreenmanager it would be at 25+GB.The ""Casual PC"" still uses 8-16 GB RAM and including all this nice stuff like Trafficmanager`s alternate AI ,turning off vehicle limit and so on would make the game unplayable for manymany ppl.Also there are the  Consoleversions, the current consoles (x-one ps4 switch in all their versions) were outdated the moment they got announced (for someone with a Gaming PC) and now years later they are just scrapmetal. A friend of my plays this on his X-box One Elite (ofc without mods) and its soooo Laggy...  Dunno what to say here...  Maybe f*** Consoles?The 2. most usuall reason to dislike are the DLC´s, and THIS is a Point i can kinda understand (to certain extend).There are 3 Types of DLC´s in cities:-The ""Big"" ones like Industries or Greencities wich add Mechanics, Buildings and so on. ~10-15 bucks-Content creator packs, wich are made by modders and add some District styles. ~5-7 bucks-And Radio stations. ~2-5 bucksSo with the basegame beeing priced at 27,99 € wich is half of a so called ""AAA Fullprice title"" i cant see this beeing a cashgrab :)While i would absolutly reccomand getting the Big ones, the Content packs and Radiostations are something about personal taste.For example i got all Big but only 2 content packs and NO Radio station.Radio in generall is pretty cool, commercials for shops in your town or just some talking between songs adds to the atmosphere. Sadly most stations contain this ""Generic Student music"" think its called ""Lo-fi"" and thats just not my type of music, Gold FM and Jazzstation are the only ones matching my taste so i keep waiting for a Pinkfloyd/Cash/Hendrix station (or keep creating my own stations).The Content creator packs are made by dudes and dudines known to the community since years like Avanya and im using sooo many additional mods from this guys, i feel ok if they get some attention and cash.The Big DLC´s are for the most part worth the money, or lets say ALL are worth the money. I just think at this point they should include some of them into the basegame like After Dark or Mass Transit or lower the price of this ""old"" DLC´s. Most Seller will already give you the basegame and 2-3 DLC´s for the money Steam charges you for the basegame but...  Steam is Steam is Steam.So if you are the dude that wants to build a woodchopper and a mine to make tools to upgrade his houses, just to unlock the next generic production line (like for example in Anno) this is the wrong game, if you want to spend hundreds of hours fixing your traffic or modeling your trainstations.... go get it!!!Small note at the end: Somewhen back... 2016? 17?  Steam changed lots of stuff at the Workshop and made it pretty much impossible to use mods with dependancys to other mods in offline mode. While using assets and props is no problem (as soon as you Copy paste them out of steams Mod folder and into the games own, some Mods cant find their dependancys as soon as you change the directorys (yeah sounds logic). Since they changed this Steam is ""investigating"" what casues the problem... So at this point since 3-4 years...  Talked to the Cities devs a few times about this and they cant do anything about it, all they could do is posting their request to Steam in the official forums.Edit 2022Since a while the DLC spam went overboard.The last three ""Big"" DLCs: Plazas, Sunset and Airports are sadly just lazy reskinns of Parklife and simply dont integrate as well into the game as Industrys (Also a Parklife reskin tbh)While the industry DLC is something you will use on every map, multiple times while building different types of specialized zones during different ""stages"" of your town development the airports... well you usually build only one... and this not even on every map.P&P is actually something I (and many others for that matter) been waiting for a long while, sadly its really REALLY lacking content. There are so few building options for Zonables... its just terrible to look at. Without massive use of Workshop assets this is a no go.And Sunset... is basicly a mini dlc for the industry dlc with the fishing industry, and offers barely any content worth the money. Trollybus is a bus/tram hybrid with noone of their strenghts but all their weaknesses in one, and the few Holiday/harbor assets... pfff...And worse... both Airports and P&P been released in a terrible buggy state. Even now months after Airport release the Plane AI is still a total mess, both on ground aswell as in the Air, while P&P still suffers from multiple issues with pathfinding.The amount of content and worse the REPLAYABILITY of the last DLCs is a joke compared to the old ones.Again you will use industry DLC zones all the time, in every game, multiple times...Parklife? Heck since parklife i barely ever use ""generic"" parks and instead use Parklife all the way... using this DLC content on every map a few dozend of times....To be fair, not every ""Old"" dlc is well done, campus or after dark aint that great either.But neither been they released as Buggy nor been they this empty or disconnected from the game.AlsoHardwareThis was a huge part in my original review and i had a lot of understanding for the high demand... But right now its become pretty depressing.A regular Basegame map + all big DLC + 4 Content creator packs + 3 Districy style DLCs andIm now at ~24gb ram usageUsing no Mods at allMy current modded decorative town im playing? 64/64GB ram usage.... 256GB Pagefileand this is using Load-screen-manager + Load-Order-Tool wich both improve the Ram usage for example by merging identical textures (something the basegame dont lmao).And seriously i dont plan to upgrade to 128 GB ram for Cities only....We need less DLC spam and more Polishment right now..."

It's so relaxing to play that I use it to calm down sometimes when I'm stressed out. I think the expansions have added a lot of depth to the game but if I'm honest the reason that this game has been so successful is because CO have completely embraced the modding community. There are so many amazing mods out there that really improve the quality of the game (such as traffic manager), meaning that you can really go as indepth into creating your city as you'd like. It is more of a traffic management sim than a city management, but to be honest I'm obsessed with roads and I can spend hours just building a single junction on the game. I like building cities knowing in advance that certain junctions are going to become too busy, and then setting myself challenges to fix it without knocking down anything, as would be the case in real life.All in all, I would really recommend this to anyone who enjoys Simcity or other city building games, especially if you love traffic simulation."
515,Andrew Blaze,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bluntrauma69/,265,13,0,194.6,January,"22,",141,0,1,"This is a good city builder but at half a decade old it shows its age. They haven't made any updates to the engine or base game despite newer hardware being available. The game props itself up with the modding community. The most obvious example being the need for a mod to buy more than 8 building tiles (which is at most 20 percent of the visible map.) BigCity on the workshop by sankai expands this to 25 tiles. Despite mods being abundant, the developers locked borderline essentials behind DLC. Parklife and Game Day come to the top of my head as egregious examples. It's up to $200 for the bundle with all current DLC. As far as I am concerned, if the DLC costs twice as much as the base game, it's time for a new game. No one likes throwing money at software from 2016.Adding in the launcher is an obvious issue that others have covered better than I could. There are now more intriguing options by smaller developers that are better priced, take advantage of newer hardware, and do not rely on predatory DLC. I do not recommend paying full-price for this game in 2021."

517,sinon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lantaril/,99,31,0,331.0,October,"28,",274,0,1,"So this is a hard decision whether or not to recommend this game. Ultimately I have to say no. Here's the reason:tl:dr: the longer you play the more you play against the shortcomings of the game's engine and AI which is something the developers are expressively not going to fix. The DLC all add new content of varying quality which let you build ever more beautiful cities, but doing so will shorten you life by several years because of rage induced heart failure. /tl;drFirst this game starts as a city builder and it's great at that. It's really the best city builder out there at the moment. Up to this point (a city of 30-40k inhabitants) I wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's gorgeous and motivating and everything you can possibly hope for in a game like this.But somewhere around that mark the genre of this game shifts and it's no longer a city builder, but a traffic manager. And oh boy does it suck at that. First and foremost and completely unfixable: The traffic AI sucks! The driver's decisions are so mind-boggling that you constantly sit in front of your screen jaw dropped in disbelief. In other words it's not about managing traffic but trying to find a way to play the AI, fixing it's inadequacy by means of road design. But you don't get the tools for that. Managing lanes? Nope. Needs a mod. Directing trains with signal lights? Nope, not possible. Getting info whether or not some industry is in the reach of a cargo station? Nope, that's a secret. But in the end you don't even want traffic to shift onto tracks because train AI is even worse than car AI. Cargo stations are too slow to handle the traffic they have to suck up even in a small industrial area. And there are no bigger train stations. Mods provide these, but the AI doesn't have the ability to choose empty platforms so you have stations with 4 tracks, but only one is used. And there is nothing you can do about that.So you try to fix the problem again by better track design. An important information for this would be the length of trains because you can't set stop signs and your trains constantly clog up crossings. But that's no info you can get. So it's trial and error. Which is driving you nuts after 5 minutes because - last point - the game engine's limitations. I swear to god: If I have to read ""slope too steep"" or ""tile blocked"" one more time I'll throw my PC out of the window. Example: you build a one way track but then decide it would be better if it went the other direction. 50% chance you can't inverse the already built road because ""blocked by other object"" or suddenly the ""slope is too steep"". So you delete the segment that's blocking your way which suddenly changes the terrain around it that was adapted to the road you had previously built. But now you can't build that part again because both ends have adifferent height now and guess what: ""Slope is too steep"" and the buildings next to it - which were perfectly fine 5 seconds ago - now block you path. And this is mid- to lategame. ALL. THE. TIME. And this is why - with a heavy heart -  I have to say: Don't buy this game."

So I used to be a wholehearted supporter of the people who made this game. But recently (5 years after the game was released) they forced a new launcher on us and said we have to agree to having our data collected and sold to companies not associated with this game at all (like facebook and google to name a couple). If we don't agree to the new EULA we can't play the game which we already paid for. There is no option to opt-out, no option to roll back to a previous version of the game before the launcher was added, and no consideration for the legality of forcefully installing software onto my computer that collects data and sends it somewhere else. And when a lot of people complained, the public face for the company, Azure, lied and said it was only about 40 people posting over and over and most people were happy with it. Looking at the recent reviews on the store page says that's not true. And there is also a suspicious rise in the number of positive reviews to counter the hundreds of negative reviews they are getting. So Paradox and Colossal Order are engaging in some highly shady business practices that I want no part in. I recommend nobody to buy any products from them in the future."

Expensive but sometimes useful DLC packs (none of which are worth it at full price IMO), game logic that is so deep and different that it sometimes feels like learning a new language, and hiding almost all of your useful structures/resources behind a scaling set of milestones that is set off of your citizen count.  If you weren't turned off by all that, this game is very relaxing to watch (once you're past the initial half hr), has a HUGE selection of assets/mods in the workshop, and is extremely pleasing to the eyes both graphically and in watching all your different systems in action.  I'll mention this yet again - I found that a lot of the systems like public transportation were extremely difficult to gain even a basic grasp of without watching videos.  Highly recommended, but plan on losing hours just learning the game on Youtube, and even more hours losing yourself in the game :)"

Sure, the models and textures are quite poor up close, but the game wasn't designed to be viewed from a pedestrian's perspective, despite the (admittedly awesome) first person mods. But simply looking towards the horizon, above your city, it's magical.The music is cheerful - repetitive a bit, but cheerful and fits the bustling city atmosphere. Chirper starts off as a nice way to learn from your citizens how your city's faring, then becomes grating with the same tweets being given off about cats rescued by fire detectors, or how nice a place the city is. The rest of the sounds nail the busy metropolis theme.Gameplay is stellar, and very, very strategic. You lay down roads of various widths, then zone out areas for either residential, commercial or industrial buildings. Put down a coal plant, or several wind turbines, and deliver power to the masses. Set up the water pumping station and the sewage dumps - but be careful not to leave sewage upstream of the pumping station. Lay down services, such as medical clinics, fire stations, police stations, landfills and so on, and make sure they get as much coverage as possible. Create leisure zones, parks and other attractions, reduce noise and pollution, and allow for decent public services, to improve land value and level up buildings. Expand as your city does.The degree of simulation is such that you can follow individual ""cims"" walking out of their house, to their car, driving through junctions (and maybe getting caught in the infamous jams), reach their workplace or education facility, spend some time there, then return home. Every single citizen has a little schedule to follow. The water, which you can channel through a dam to power your city, is fully simulated, and badly placed dams and waterfront protection can cause flooding, which is not exactly good for your city. Traffic is the player's biggest threat - if you don't plan way, way ahead what you're doing, you are going to grind your city to a halt.The modding community is fantastic, providing addons ranging from highway interchanges and junction types, to new buildings, to enhanced AI logic, simulation, traffic actions and so on.It is a huge rush wildly flailing in panic at the sight of multiple problems occuring across the city, almost entirely due to poor traffic flow, and so is the relief that comes after successfully dealing with said situation.I really like this game.

(Hello EA, I am waving at you)- Map size is small at the beginning, but can be expanded later, at the end is somewhat the same size as the 4x4 in SimCity 4, which is huge (EA? Are you still here?)- Mod and custom asset support!CONs:- It is hard and easy at the same time. Let me explain: to make a perfect traffic in a big city is almost impossible, if you don't want to destroy everything and make your city a big highway intersection (which I am not a fan of). On the other hand, keeping everything in terrible traffic have no consequences at all! I think this is bad, because the game doesn't reward you if you make a good traffic. I have just watched a stream when a guy used only dirty roads in his city over 40.000 pop, and the city worked perfectly. In SimCity 4, when you do this, people moves out of their homes, because the commute time is so high, and so the offices/commercial/industry will fall too. I really hope they will fix this.- The public transportation has some issues too. According to my experiences, only buses can be operated profitable. Also, train traffic is ridiculous: even a metropolis should have less train-traffic, and most of them operate nearly empty (10/240 passengers or so).- I am not a big fan of working cities with only skyscapers. In SimCity 4, when you zone high density residential, but people feel they don't want to live in a mega-block, they will build some low-dense housing instead. Like in a normal city. Here, you zone high-everything, and they just build a Manhattan in the middle of nothing. But overall this is a great game, and I highly recommend it! Also, I am quite sure they will fix all the bugs and consider changing some of the cons I mentioned. Happy gaming!"

It is an actual city building game (which doesn't require an internet connection btw) that has pretty much everything I liked about the older games in it, but it also adds in a few fresh mechanics that keep things interesting. The traffic patterning, the modeling of pollution, and the electrical grid I find to be vast improvements over older games mechanically, and I love the water effects as well(I spent a good 5 minutes watching a dam fill up. It was mesmerizing) The only thing that I can gripe about if I get really nitpicky is that you have to plan transit routes and I would like more transport options. However, those could be easily rectified with a mod similar to NAM for simcity 4, and this game is designed to be easily moddable. Other than that, it's a very stable game which isn't terribly resource intensive for your PC. 10/10 would inadvertantly flood the highway leading into town with a dam again."
547,MrSpuddies,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrspuddies/,102,8,0,426.0,February,"10,",78,20,1,"I've put 160 hours into this game. My max population I ever got to was over 70,000. Ive done it a couple of times, but i always restart because i'm trying to discover a solution to a HUGE problem in this game.The problem is traffic. The AI in this game are programmed horribly. They will always take the shortest route to their destination. Instead, they need to be programmed to take the fastest route to their destination.For example, lets say most of the AI turn right at a certain intersection. I put a 3 lane road there so that they can have two right turns. (I need to add here that there is no function in the game that allows you to specify which lane goes where. You have to install a mod for that).  I allow the AI to use the first and second lanes for right turns. 99% of the cars will use the first lane & 1% of the cars will use the second lane. This is because they are programmed to take the shortest route to their destination. Because of this, you will have 100 cars in one of the lanes and 1 car in the other lane. This is illogical. Instead, they need to program the AI to go for the FASTEST route.Here's another example. You have a three lane road that eventually hits an intersection. Going straight at the intersection takes the AI cars to a suburb area but turning right takes the AI to the shops. 99% of the AI will be turning right, so they will all drive in the far right lane even if they are 50 miles away from the intersection. locigal humans don't do this, so it creates traffic problems you wouldn't realistically have in a simulation.A final problem i've found with this game is the death waves. You have to be careful to allow building of houses 1 little plot at a time. If you allow the development  of a huge plot of land, for example, all the AI will move in at the same time. Then, they will NEVER MOVE OUT until they die. I think someone estimated each AI has a life span of like 18 years, so after 18 years in game time, suddenly the whole neighborhood will die of old age. You will experience what the community calls ""Death waves' and it will make the game painful once your population gets to be about 40,000.These two things are game breaking in my opinion."

I love this game; it’s a little bit more flexible than most city builders out there. But, Its dumb how overpriced the DLC content is and how little it brings to the game. From the release of this game I’ve seen constant praise for (not really so much the game) the developer of Cities Skyline, I have to wonder what's going on? If a company like EA did something like this to their game (which they have) people would be screaming bloody murder.To be honest I kinda get it, good developers are hard to come by. But a company that gives you one new building for $15 is not a good company. That’s a company that is trying to imitate the most hated company in America, EA. Now don't get me wrong, the game is incredibly fun, but with all the overpriced DLC the game has out right now if you refuse to buy any of it like me, you will end up missing out on a lot of important game changing features. They need to combine all the DLC they have, and release it with a 10-15 dollar price tag. The game is not worth all the money you need to put into it for so little content. That's why I can't recommend it right now.It's funny to me how the new Sim City did this and died a horrible death. But only recently have people started to catch on to this developer and see just how much they are milking their EXTREMELY loyal fan base. I hate to see it. I hope they correct the situation soon."

As a matter of fact, I even joined Facebook just to play CityVille. Unfortunately, it was already shut down. Since then, I never was able to play city management games again due to my student responsibilities.I just started Steam 3 months ago because of peer pressure and curiosity. I was wondering why teens are into gaming more specifically DOTA and CS:GO which were really popular in all computer shops here in the Philippines. I was not a big fan of it though and I am afraid that I might get addicted to it and that I may not have time for my academics and extra-curricular activities.Then everything changed when I scrolled the Steam Store. I saw this game, Cities:Skylines, and it sparked my interest. I never knew Steam would have games that are economically educational and helpful. I then started playing this game and WOW, I was just so amazed. I imagined it to be like CityVille or other mobile City Management game but it is more than what I have imagined. It is not just about putting Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Services to make a city but you need to be concerned on traffic management, public transportation, healthcare, education, citizens' safety, water supply, waste deposits, electric supply, and many more. I then started to play with the DLC's and I was astonished. It made the game better and complex which I really love the most. I was really satisfied on the game and I learned a lot of economical behaviors just by playing it. In the end, I got addicted to it LOL! It may have lessen my sleeping period but atleast I am having fun, right? and besides it is economically educational. It was one of the reasons why I chose ABM for Senior High School. I am very thankful to Cities:Skylines and Steam for entering my life.I really recommend this game to everyone!Hoping to see more helpful DLC's soon!"

So I won't rehash that.I have tried to think of counter points to the above, something negative, but I can't really name any. There are a few missteps I made in my first few games - such as planning / designing areas in a tightly aranged format, preventing easy upgrades to roads. But that's part of the learning curve I mentioned above. There's really been nothing bad about the game at all. There has been one oddity / amusing gaff: a road twisting when elevated, cornering too tightly, and positioned too close to last point - but that's the only thing.One thing I would like to suggest to the devs, is to make the single-instance trees to have more of an effect (an effect?) on noise pollution.

Youtube videos have helped me a lot, to be honest. When I first started, the game was just giving me more and more and more information that I was not able to keep up with everything and felt overwhelmed. However, I've watch couple of videos that have really helped to how to start a city on ''the right foot'' and I've pretty much made improvements but I'm obviously still lacking a lot. You gotta be responsible of the income, taxes and all the money that you spent, making sure every cent you spent is worth it so you don't waste more than needed. As the city grows, there is more demand, which personally makes me anxious and nervous *laughs* but it's really fun because you end up spending more than 1 hour (in my case, 2 hours even)  trying to figure out ways to grow the city and then you look at the time and you get surprised because you've been playing a lot without even realising because of how good this game entertains you.If you have enough patience (which I don't have, but still, it's manageable) and very creative and learn quickly about the structure of the game, you'll easily catch up with this and I can assure you, you'll enjoy it in the end. The cons is that if you are like me, you can get very overwhelmed and anxious when there is lots of demand.I'm still trying to grow my big city, it's hard but I get the help from videos since I don't think you can learn just by yourself in this game.

The right mods only make it amazing.SEVERAL points off for making it really, really dry, however. The lack of humanity or personality in the form of questing and city dweller and government interaction makes this feel like I'm just building a model and not an actual city with little actual sims with wants, needs and feelings. Secret: name a street Steve. I think the game could expand much in this way in the form of tasks and quests. Replayability is maximum level on this game.

There are mods to support mods; just sayin'. Dev teams just cannot produce the dedication of enthusiasts due to the monetization and required quality control: mod support was the best outcome here. And there are some fantastic people out there creating awesome assets and mods. I can spend hours watching the fascinating traffic if you change the chaos with TMPE or try to build a good looking waste management facility. The worst thing about Cities Skylines: it's a Paradox game. That means your data is for grabs, you get a useless launcher so they can grab even more data to sell and you get their standard DLC treatment. But luckily the game itself is very much enjoyable, and the DLCs also add nice stuff. Some are much better than others of course, but I've seen much worse on Paradox games (Prison Architect used to be my favorite - until the added DLCs broke most of the base game) so I'll tip my fedora to CO for their quality DLC builds. If you love city builders and you don't have Cities Skylines yet, shame on you (seriously, it's 7 years old now). If you are thinking about trying a city builder, this one definitely tops the list.

What is the point of having different road types if your citizens use one lane? It is not a deal breaker for this game, but it does pull you out of the fantastic city environment Paradox Interactive worked so hard to make. - Maybe 2-3 crashes within my small time played. It's not really an issue but I thought I would list it.   7/10 (If the issues with the traffic are fixed it is easily a 8/10)"

I like to see my cities grow from little hamlets to big cities with over 75k people.II) I can be creative. There are so many mods and so many roads and style of playing and it is so cool.III) It's (somewhat) realistic with the base game. In vanilla (no mods), the graphics look amazing, especially for an indie game. Bravo paradox!IV) New patches. This game has been patched and fixed and it makes the game less buggy in general.V) The price is cheap. With one steam card ($20), you can purchase this game, which makes it cheap for what it allows you to do. (P.S. this game is 1/3 the price of SimCity 2013(?).)Cons:I) It makes my PC lag a little. I have a pretty mid ranged computer with no graphics card, and It runs okay. It gets choppy though, and I have to turn the graphics down.II) DLC. There are a lot of features locked behind DLC, but its still worth it. (Pro/Con. Depens on how you see this.)Overall, this gets 4.5/5.

607,Shazam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShazamGaming/,20,,1,13.1,December,"26,",396,0,1,"Much as I prefer to let each game stand on its own, certain games demand comparisons. In the case of Cities: Skylines, developer Colossal Order has overtly modeled its game after SimCity – not just the fundamental concept and methods of building and maintaining a simulated city from the ground up, but much of the look and feel as well. And on almost every count, Skylines compares very favorably to the former standard-bearer of the city-building genre. It is, in fact, the best of its kind to come along in a full decade – a powerful, flexible, beautiful, and all-around impressive simulation that lets you build sprawling, single-player metropolises to your heart’s content. Building has to be its own reward, though, because the lack of random events or disasters leaves the job of running these towns feeling sleepy and meditative.Playing as part mayor, part god-king with the power to arbitrarily bulldoze your simulated citizens’ dreams and create schools with a click, building a city from scratch is mostly conventional: lay down roads with the easy-to-use tools, designate zones for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings, provide utility services, reap the tax boon, then repeat the cycle with new stuff that’s been unlocked by your growing population hitting new milestones. Skylines finds a mostly happy medium between the complexity of SimCity 4 and the relative simplicity of SimCity 2013 by automatically attaching zoneable areas to roads as they’re laid, but still holding onto obligatory busywork like laying water pipes. Those basics are all tried and true - you couldn’t have a city-builder without them - so it’s mandatory that they be done well. Cities: Skylines does that.The first way this sim knocks it out of the park is in its scale. Each game begins as deceptively small, constricting you to a four-square-kilometer area (the same size as a SimCity map, entirely by coincidence I’m sure), but quickly allows you to buy access to an adjacent plot of land of equivalent size. Then it does this seven more times, for a total possible area of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there’s plenty of room. And while you can’t directly edit terrain while you play, there’s an included map editor where you can create any land mass you choose before you jump in - or download one from the prominently integrated Steam Workshop mod support.With such large cities, it’s fantastic that Skylines allows you to define and regulate areas individually. Simply paint a chunk of your city with the District tool, and you can not only name it so you can spot it easily on the map, but give it unique policies that regulate everything from mandating smoke detectors to reduce fire hazards (at a cost) to legalizing recreational drug use for lower crime rates, or banning highrise buildings to create defined downtown and suburban areas. In industrial zones, you can specialize the businesses to exploit a map’s natural resources in the area to mine ore, drill for oil, farm on fertile land, or harvest trees for forestry. You can even create tax incentives for a specific type of zone within each district.Let’s zoom in for a moment: we can see individual humans walking through the streets, going to work or school, engaging in leisure activities, or returning home by the thousands. They drive cars, take trains, and even walk dogs. (You can individually name them, but I suggest naming them Waldo, because there are so many that if you find that specific one again you I say you basically win the game.) This is where you realize the time scale becomes absurd. On the slowest speed a day lasts 10 seconds – three and a half on the fastest – which means the journey to work could last a week. But the lack of a day and night cycle means time doesn’t seem too unnatural, but rather an abstraction to serve the speed at which things are built and tax money flows in.Making a major city’s traffic flow smoothly is a puzzle I haven’t come close to fully cracking yet, but I do feel good when I easily create overpasses and freeway onramps to experiment with routes that direct the flow and ease the gridlock... at least partially. By default, most advanced road types are locked out at the start, which makes planning a city around trains or subways nearly impossible (unless you plan on supervillain-level demolition later on), but there’s a sandbox mode that’ll allow you to build whatever you want, whenever you can afford it. (There’s also an unlimited money mode.)Mass transit is a tricky beast. It’s not enough to lay down bus stops and train stations; you have to plot out routes individually, or no one will go anywhere. It’s easy to get lost in that, especially as routes start overlapping and it’s frustrating to get your bus stop placed on the correct side of each narrow road. But there are a lot of options, and the endorphin rush from making a red traffic data overlay turn green makes it all worth it.Up close, buildings are colorful and detailed, right down to small animations like rooftop fans spinning. A slider in the options menu gives us control over the amount of depth-of-field blur applied to distant buildings when zoomed in, which mimics SimCity’s attractive diorama effect. Skylines doesn’t match the graphical quality of SimCity, though, and given the great numbers we see them in they don’t quite have the variety needed to prevent most neighborhoods from looking pretty much the same.What Skylines isn’t good at is telling you what you’ve done wrong, and what problem you need to solve right now. For instance, when I hit 50,000 citizens, the gauge at the bottom of the screen that indicates what new zone type my city wanted in order to expand bottomed out. It didn’t want anything at all. Hundreds of buildings were abandoned, without explanation. How can I address the issues that are hamstringing my city when I don’t know what they are, and the in-game advisors provide no insight? I built new residential, commercial, and industrial zones and waited; eventually, without my taking any deliberate action or receiving any explanation, the zones filled and growth resumed upward of 100,000. I don’t understand why.In that light, it’s fortunate that it’s fairly difficult to send your city into a death spiral without actively trying to, or making worse financial decisions than Greece. It has to be as deliberate as placing a sewage drain pipe directly upstream from your water pump – basically piping raw sewage into your citizens’ tap water – or borrowing more money than you can ever hope to repay. Even crime is disappointingly easy to keep in check with a single police station serving a town of 40,000.It’s limited to man-made crisis-management because there are no earthquakes, tornadoes, destructive floods, nuclear meltdowns, zombie outbreaks, UFO or monster attacks, or anything fun like that. The only thing close to a disaster is a fire, and those don’t spread from one building to another, even if left completely unchecked. I don’t mean to fault Skylines for not cloning every single feature of SimCity, but I do consider disaster management to be a major part of running a big city, and without it Skylines lacks a certain sense of excitement that’s been a staple of the city-building genre since the beginning.More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the simple joy of building. It’s a really impressive and often beautiful simulation, where an amazing number of virtual people go about their business across a huge swath of land. Getting in and creating something is easy, though mastering it will require extensive research on community wikis to understand why growth is stunted even when you address your citizens’ apparent concerns. Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder."

Mods support is essential in this game, as they handle most of the issues that are not addressed by the game developers themselves, such as better traffic management or public transport configuration. Without the mods, the game is still fun, but with them it is spectacular. The amount of mods and other stuff it has to load for the city to work requires a good PC, and most of the time a good few minutes for the game to load. Not to mention troubleshooting, should something go nuts... But, should there be no recent game update and the mods are all OK, it is a great game.Sadly, the developers are not so great. DLCs are a big way to milk money out of the players. They are usually required to run selected things, and also the whole game collapses for a few weeks as a free update usually damages all the mods. Not to mention whole cities were damaged due to the discontinuation of some mods...I would definitely buy the game - however, look for a bundle such as Humble Bundle, in order not to pay a huge load of money for DLCs.

It's a far cry at this point from the early city builders. This game can be almost daunting to get into, and it can be oh so easy to have everything bog down in gridlock. I've lost count of how many cities I started and threw away because my initial foundations just didn't work. A wealth of expansions and an uncountable horde of mods only adds to this complexity.But with this complexity comes an experience that you can lose yourself in with tinkering. Tinkering with road networks. Tinkering with bus routes. Tinkering with the latest neighbourhood. Speaking of which, you can actually have those, breaking your city up into regions which you can apply different policies to or different design aesthetics. Your city can evolve into a complex patchwork of specialisations and characters. Like I just spent hours building a lovely transit-oriented development with a park and trail network at its core.And this is a game that has been growing, evolving, constantly adding functionality.Fair warning: this game can be a bit of a beast, especially as your cities get larger. Still, I built my PC in 2014 on an i5 processor with 16GB of RAM, which I threw a new graphics card into last year.

It can be sort of comforting to play, but cities almost always end up being the same sort of US suburb, and most of the challenge is, every time, traffic management. Your cities have no history, no focus unless you impose one artificially (and even then it's more aesthetic than functional), no life (it's depressingly easy to bulldoze whole districts - the citizens who lived there relocate without a squeak), no charm.

658,Freelancer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/freelancer799/,51,4,1,6.9,March,"11,","2,193",1,1,"[Disclosure: This was reviewed due to a review copy provided by Paradox]After 2013’s debacle that was Sim City it was time some new devs stepped to the table. Cities XXL was a huge miss as Focus Interactive did nothing to improve their terrible running and clunky game so the question is, did Colossal Order (a Paradox dev responsible for Cities in Motion) deliver? Yes, oh my god Yes!Cities Skylines is another game in the long list of city building and managing simulators that have been trying to succeed in the shoes of what was Sim City 4; released more than 12 years ago. From the dev that created Cities in Motion, Colossal Order does something that no other city sim has done and make a truly great game that brings back the feel of Sim City 4 and my favorite of the series, Sim City 3000. They brought it back to its basics which included zones, different building types like electrical, water, fire, police, medical, fun and even the unique landmark buildings.When you start creating your city you start in a small 2km x 2km square that can expand as your city gets bigger and you annex other areas to a possible 25 tile, 100km2 area (with the support of a mod that is already in the steam workshop). The game also locks different building, zones, etc. behind population goals so that it isn’t too overwhelming however there are mods that allow you to unlock everything to start if you wish along with unlimited money. The game will also allow for steam workshop when it releases for people to create their own user content to add to the game which could include more buildings, new modes, user made cities and much more.Along with the buildings and zones there are also the financial and policies that make a city sim a true city sim. They are simple enough and not as annoying as was the advisors in sim city 3000 but they change things greatly including outlawing private traffic in certain zones forcing people to take mass transit instead. What those policies and other specific buildings do is increase the happiness of the people in the commercial, residential and industrial zones. As your happiness increases they are more likely to accept higher taxes and recommend more people to move in causing an increase in desire for residential and other financial zones. I can also say that Colossal Order certainly know how to make their transport lines work and work well because every form of transportation was easy to create and maintain.That being said the roads themselves were difficult to make sure they were right especially having off ramps connect to highways. When I bought my first annex there was a highway running through it. I thought it would have been easy enough to figure out how to implement a overpass/rounded off ramp to have access to the other side of the highway however I had to do a lot of work to get a new one working. First I had to delete the existing off ramps and highway to make way for a 4 way off ramp. On top of that in order to make sure a one way road/highway continues to go one way, instead of detecting which way automatically the roads go you to build the road in the same direction traffic would flow. Took me about 15 minutes to realize this. Hopefully it’ll be something they patch after release because I can imagine it’ll be something some people will complain about.One other complaint, and maybe it is something I’m not used to due to the simplicity of zones in Sim City 3000, I don’t like the way zones sit for  “squares” off the road for each road you make. I’m more of a fan of dragging and dropping to make a zone like it was in SC 3000. That is just a personal preference. However all you can do with the roads is quite impressive and though I did play this game quite a bit I wasn’t able to play it enough to truly design a city that looked great.Now this game looks quite impressive and the buildings are quite varied enough to make the cities and areas look unique. Mod support and steam workshop is only going to improve the variety of buildings after release. The engine runs smooth, however capped at 60 fps (not that you really need more since this isn’t a action moving game), and looks great. The UI is clean and they actually made a change to it as I was playing my review copy in the last week.The sound isn’t anything spectacular, however it is there and does work well with what the game is. If you zoom in to roads you can hear cars going by, if you do the same for various areas you hear what you would expect to hear if you were walking on the street. The ambient music also makes it nice to listen to while you are designing away. So nothing over the top but fits quite well.Overall, Cities Skylines, I feel, is truly the best city sim game since Sim City 4 and in fact is better than 4. It has everything that you could want in a city building game; large building areas, variety in design and buildings, unique challenges in building and managing and a great looking engine.  This is a must in my opinion for anyone that was looking for the next good city builder especially those that like to play in offline mode.Review with screenshots:"

With the game tasking the player into the development of a city with a variety of tools at their disposal. I would first like to commend the developers for allowing a player to micromanage areas of their city to create stunning areas all created by hand. Along with the game presenting dynamic traffic systems. Something unheard of by their predecessors. By forcing the player to  deal with traffic, police, fire and medicinal issues as units in the map area of effects of games such as Sim City 3000. If you are a fan of dynamic city builders.

If you like just building a nice city then you'll love Cities: SkylinesSort of like Planet Coaster, Cities is basically just a map painter. You can't literally do whatever you want but you would be hard-pressed to come up against any challenge beyond screwing up traffic configurations.

You can build your own interchanges/intersections/pretty much anything from scratch, and the AI will realistically follow it.- Mod support (Steam Workshop enabled too). The developers even endorse modding. Does EA even know what modding is anymore?- NO DRM! Yes yes, I know, SimCity doesnt need to always be online anymore. But this game has no DRM other than the cd key you get on Steam.- HUGE maps. You start with a small plot of land, but are able to purchase neighboring plots as your city grows. This means you can have a sprawling metropolis with multiple town centers/airports/highway systems.- The ability to divide your city in to separate districs, each able to have their own policies/taxes.If you are on the fence about this game, definitely go for it.

They did a bait and switch, or something that criminals do.. I am sure there are others like me on here who would love to file a class action law suit via a breach of contract.. Since when i purchased this game i agreed to pay money to play the game, at no point did i read that they would be using my personal data, or stealing information from my machine, to make more money off of my personal computer usage...They have violated the original terms of service i signed up for..

680,Whoota,https://steamcommunity.com/id/whoota/,14,,1,406.1,March,"20,",420,1,1,"City building, one of the great monuments of mankind. Isn't the blatent repurposing of the earth's bounty for our mundane consumption and shelter the epitomy what it means to be human? Yes it is. And when you play  you will come to appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in such an undertaking. It took me seven resets before I finally got a city running properly; and even then did I throw all my progress and work out the window just because it wasn't perfect enough. City building is strategy game in the truest form. It requires long term planning and foresight. Overlooking any aspect at the start can come back to haunt you later on. Like in my first city, everything was running smoothly until everyone fell ill from polluted drinking water. The tides from the coast weren't very good at disposing the sewage. So instead of fixing it, I decided to throw all that away and found a new city alongside a flowing river instead. With the water problem covered for now a new plague rose up. Power. I had to learn a few tricks from a pretty good youtuber to get the basics down; he showed you could start a city with a single wind tubine and save much more money for facilities. However, turbines are fickle and the wind is their enabler. As a result, it became a structural struggle to provide power for my budding metropolis. Once again, I threw the stuff away and started a new city, besides a river, on a hillside. At this point it should be clear that this game has a significant learning curve. You really need to invest and try stuff to get the hang of it. However, it does turn out to be rewarding, as your city vivibly evolves under your direction. It is welcoming to see a game so strong in visual feedback. A bustling city is more amusing to behold than a dying one, so it is an extra motivator to keep exploring and trying for new stuff. Now I'm in my 5th game and power and water are no longer a problem. The real challenge presents itself when you're expanding. Expanding is hard. You basically have to create a new city from scratch, and you effectively double your resource consumption in the process. Once again, your early choices make all the differences. Depending on how you positioned your first district in regards to the highway can make all the difference for the new stream of inhabitants and commuters. You'll have to consider traffic flows from a very early point to make them work in the long run. And that is how I began my 6th city. So after much trial and error, I am now running my 8th city and it is running like clockwork. I even have a booming oil and ore industry, as well as a modern office district and many options for easy living. At this point it helps to explore the extremely well crafted advisor windows. These intergrated menu screens can give you a direct glimpse into the affairs of your metropole. Fire safety, crimerate, congestion, pollution; it's all expertly depicted with easy to understand colour graphs and real time feedback from the system about current problems. The interface is such a marvel, I think more games could benefit from it. As your city grows, your scope zooms out and you move away from street corner politics and small scale renovations. Your footprint grows and so does your city.  is possibly the best city building game ever made. Thanks to its direct feedback from the real time game, excellent interface and amazing graphics, it is a game worth building a city in, and then to wish you could one day live in it.Granted that you don't mess up at the start because no one wants to live in highway congestion. Punishing at the start. It certainly rewards the intrepid frontier's men/women."

IT IS. I played the newest version of SimCity a day before release to kind of compare it to before I played this one.. The controls are so much more difficult to learn and understand, it feels clunkier and messier and in general like you have less to do and less control of the game. I am so impressed with the simplicity, beauty, and user friendly format that cities skylines has to offer.It has already showed to be immensely popular to both play and watch others build masterpieces or piles of dirt on twitch. Something about this game is just so freakin' good.For a $30 price tag, I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who has any interest in building or simulation games.

I have played this game for what does it say, 18 hours or something like that? I dont even know anymore. The reason I do not know anymore is because when you start playing Skylines hours in real life seem to just disappear. You can start for the first time at 8 pm and not even realize it is now well past midnight.You start your city with nothing but an in an out road. Maybe a Train track. You build, you develop neighborhoods, commercial areas, and industrial areas just like in all the SimCity games. Eventually you get enough people to buy an expansion slot which allows you to make your city bigger, and bigger and bigger until eventually you have this huge map that seems like there is no end to it. The only grip I would say I have about this game is that there is a max amount of expansion slots you can buy for your city. Which I guess is alright, but it would be nice if you could just keep going and going. Then again I dont know how well that would work or even if you could keep up with maintaining the whole city from Burned Down buildings or abandonded buildings, or making sure there are enough Cemetarys in your city to go an pick up all the dead bodies each day.

Left the game run for a bit and the city collapsed due to many of the roads being damaged, looks like an earthquake, however disasters and weather are turned off.  Anyone else have this issue?Despite many complaints (check the forums and negative complaints) including my own the game still has bugs.  I've enjoyed this style of game since the first Simcity.  The bugs don't appear right away with a smaller city as such everything seems fine at first and the game is enjoyable.  After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent.  Some people have managed to make a large city without issue but many have not so its hard to say where the problem lies.(different windows versions, certain DLC, etc)  This may explain all the positive reviews as most haven't played long enough to have this issue and some were lucky enough that the issues never manifested on there system.  After spending hours building your city up is when the issues start to become apparent.  I have spent a lot of time on building multiple cities trying to narrow down the problems and insure that it wasn't my city design.  The first and main issue is garbage.  There is a great article in the forums on how its handled called ""Garbage is Rubbish"", however all those issues aren't game breakers.  As your city becomes larger the incinerators send out less and less trucks.  There is no logical reason for this to happen.  Many have suggested poor traffic layout is the issue but even if it were (its not in my case) it still has no logic.  ""There is a traffic jam across town don't send out any garbage trucks across the entire city but pay everyone for the day.""  Traffic is another whole issue that could take up a paragraph but again its not game breaking just unrealistic, annoying, and somewhat limits any creativity you may have in your city design.  With average happiness running close to 90%, traffic efficiency averaging around 90%, and 20 times the required incinerator capacity there shouldn't be any issues but it breaks somewhere between 150,000-300,000 population every time and garbage trucks just stop running across the entire city and of course the entire city collapses.  Crematoriums seem to have a similar issue but I've never had them get to the point of complete collapse.  Mods were added to see if any of them would help but they didn't.  Tech support was of no help and of course denied there was any issue.While experimenting with the garbage issue I noticed something else.  Your net  income isn't entirely based on fixed game factors and adjusts itself.  I can only guess this is an attempt to maintain some semblance of difficulty and 'balance' so you can't let your game run for days to have a large bank account even if you design the perfect city.  At first I thought it might be my city design and management that my profits were never very large but as a lot of time and experimentation went on there is more to it.  The best example which was tried several times with different cities is that a good size city ran for a couple (real) days without making any changes and though the weekly income bounced around slightly it averaged out at pretty close to $0 and the overall bank account hadn't really changed very much.  A mod was added that quartered the garbage costs, the mod doesn't affect any other game mechanics and no other changes were made.  At the time garbage costs were around $200,000 so they quartered to $50,000.  In theory after this the net profit should average out to $150,000 but this wasn't the case.  Initially the profit jumps up to close to this amount but after a short while it settled in around an average profit of $15,000 and then stays there.  It seems no matter what was done it would never maintain anything over $20,000 average net profit for more than a short burst.It's unfortunate that all my play time was basically beta testing instead of just playing and enjoying the game.In closing this game has so much going for it and most of the issues it has are minor and could be overlooked if they could only fix the big issues."

The concept is beautiful. The abundance of detail and balance between macro and micro-management put all other city building games to shame. The details and feeling of creating and building something are exactly what you would hope for in a game like this. The community and mods are great and contribute wonderfully to the game. The progression from small town into large city is clean, along with the management decisions you are required to make regarding budget, design, expansion, etc. Then the problems start to show up. The most popular complaint is a very valid one: traffic is bad. The AI make unreasonable and confusing choices with regards to traffic, and even well designed cities with proper infrastructure have highly unreasonable and unnatural traffic jams. This can only be worked around by taking extreme measures with road layouts- it is impossible to design a normal-looking city that doesn't have completely destructive traffic patterns. Certain facets of the game are not clearly explained, such as taxes (income based vs property based), how industries supply the city, what the ""Not enough goods to sell"" error means, etc., and require players to make educated guesses or search forums to find out. The scale of houses/buildings size to people is seriously off- you really have to use your imagination to get around the issue with scale. Things that should be a part of the base game are sold as DLC, and without the DLC, the quality of play is compromised. The population count is highly unrealistic. There are massive death waves, and the deathcare services are extraordinarily inefficient. All public services, for that matter, are inefficient. Fire and police departments, waste services, schools, parks, and other public buildings have unrealistically short ranges, forcing you to build far too many. Finally, and in my opinion worst of all, you just simply can't build a big city without massive issues with lag or the game crashing outright, even with a beast of a computer running the lowest settings."

I wont explain traffic because its a common problem explained in MANY other ""Not recommended"" reviews that explain its flaws way better than i can. My biggest problem is the DLC; Most of the more expensive DLC are quite literally features that should be in the base game alone, it doesnt make sense (other than to milk your money from you) to put them behind a heafty paywall.

I came across  and started watching that on my secondary monitor while I stumbled my way through the game. His videos have been game-changing. I went from mildly enthusiastic to severely obsessed in a matter of days. This is easily the best city builder out there. From controlling infrastructure to detailing my districts. From using the vanilla game to deep diving into the mod scene. I cannot stress how much game there is to find here.

So in a six lane street they will stand all behind each other and all other lanes are free. You can compensate it by either building many shortage-pathes for your cars to split the traffic or by using a mod which improve traffic habits a bit (but not optimally).-Service cars are pretty bad in servicing. Also need here a mod for.-Low vehicle limit in the city, which is compensated in the engine by magically despawning cars. Need a mod to disable despawning for real traffic simulation (mentioning that traffic simulation is an heavily sold aspect of the game). But that hits the low vehicle limit pretty hard. For powerful computer there is no option to raise that limit, even as requested since long. Needed another mod to allow service cars to spawn prior non-service cars if you hit the limit (which is pretty soon).-Bad multi-threading, known since engine release. Unity engine got fixed this problem and released since ages the official update for it (easy to implent), which Colossal Order refuses to implent, yet.-DLC politics. Sadly the new way of the publisher to squeeze money. I like Paradox, they have a community-focused and innovative way to produce titles. Im a huge fan of their series (EU, HoI, CK).

I won't be surprised if this ends up as GOTY...no doubt it will be a nominee.  I haven't been this excited about a simulation in a LONG time!"

I'll go ahead and mention the cons even though they in no way amount to anything significant enough to not get it. As a lot of people mention the traffic AI is frustrating, maybe the biggest challenge of the game. but in reality traffic is a major challenge for every city. The whole ratio of times thing is weird but best they could do i imagine. i wish the city size to population was realisitc. You have this massive metroplex with skyscrapers, multiple airports and countless suburbs and the entire population of the city is like 65000. that makes no sense. idk why they have it like that. the expansions are seemingly really expensive for what they give you so that sucks too. but just the base game is awesome. anyway overall awesome if you have a decent rig that can run it smoothly its a very relaxing but engaging gaming experience."

They knew the launcher would be unpopular, given by their announcement post title reading: ""Yet another launcher, please don't riot.""What followed in the forums has been a mass of damage control, user censorship, and betrayal of the gamer base. (*1, *2, *17)Some History, why does this matter?EA released SimCity back in 2013, and with it was an always on-line system that didn't work, and it caused countless issues.  The company didn't care what their users said about it, they forced it on everyone. It caused no end of issues with many people unable to just play the game, and users in frustration giving up on SimCity, and others, like me, who didn't buy into after hearing about all the problems.  Plus, there were a number of game play issues.  The game was visually better then previous SimCity games, but was frustratingly limited in what you could do and how big of a play area you had. (*3)What came of it?2 years later, Paradox Interactive (publisher) and Colossal Order (developer) created Cities Skylines.  It was hailed as the spiritual successor at the time. For all intents and purposes it was, and for almost 5 years, and a dozen DLCs, has been the premier City Builder game on the market.  Others have come and gone, but it remained #1.  It wasn't perfect, had some bugs, some serious, but over time, the game smoothed out and was really great. (*4)What has changed?Paradox Interactive has decided to put all of their products into a single 'launcher' type application.  It seems so far that the goal is to create a Origin/Epic/Steam style game launcher to sell their products under.What's the problem then?The problem is, they have decided to do this with the existing game, and they've done it poorly.  What we actually have is a 'launcher in a launcher' problem.  their launcher doesn't manage the deployment of Skylines and other paradox games, they've left that up to steam.  The issue is, it's creating conflicts within Steam because Cities Skylines is deeply integrated with the Steam Workshop for mod delivery.   The launcher is causing massive issues for many players.What they have told us is the launcher was for adding features like mod management and advertising to the game, but this is on top of a launcher (Steam) that already does mod management and advertising.  This is subjecting users to extra steps to start the game and in some cases, renders the game unplayable, or destroying user maps.The community has asked them to remove the launcher, but they refuse.  Thus, why the history mattered.  A workaround was discovered to bypass the launcher, and many users went with that.  But to this day, months later The launcher still prevents users from playing the game, with no relief in sight.  A game they payed for is still unplayable.What else happened?Along with this unpopular launcher (*8, *7) came the Paradox Representatives in the forums. When the complaints started to come in, the PRs on the forums started calling users names and badmouthing users and such. (*5)  It got nasty quick. Paradox pulled those problem PRs (*6) but the damage was done. (*9, note: nothing done about it.) Paradox's true feelings towards their users had been revealed.Stack these two issues together and those of us who remember the EA fiasco realzied it was EA 2.0 all over again.What is this launcher, anyway?By definition, it's a Trojan. (*10) When you purchase the game, on the Steam Store page, it does not list the use of 3rd party software, like what you see with Origin and Uplay games.  Before the update, if you clicked 'Play' in Steam, Cities Skylines would start right away.  After the update, when you clicked 'Play' a 'MSI style installer' would launch.  It gave zero options to control the install, nor the option to cancel it.  It also did not install in the game directory, but in a hidden area in your User profile on Windows.  What this meant was if it broke, Steam could not fix it, and when you 'uninstalled' Skylines from Steam, the launcher stayed behind.  So, you think your about to start Cities Skylines, and you got their launcher instead.The real thing is, this launcher on Steam is NOT the same as the one they list on their site. (*12, *11)What does this launcher do?Advertising, mostly.  It is basically, Spyware. (*13, item 6)  It's actual primary purpose is to gather and collect user data and transmit that data back to their providers that include: (*14 section 6, *15)Everyone does this, right?  Why such the big deal?For this Launcher, it is its primary purpose.  Companies make a lot of money selling user data. (*16)  The reason this is such a big deal is because for 5 years, this wasn't happening.  The choice to ignore Paradox and their accounts and just Play the game is all their was.  They gave an incentive to create an account by offering an in game item if you logged into them, but now, it's much worse.  This launcher does its best to force you into signing up, and only offers a tiny 'skip' option to get around it, nagging the user until they give in. This is also where the history matters.  EA forced their users around, and when Paradox came out with Cities Skylines, it was preceded by the community that they 'got it' in regards on how to treat their users.  For 5 years, this was the perception.  Until now.  Given now how Paradox is deleting posts, corralling users around the forums to minimize the appearance of how this looks, all damage control to cover for the fact they are forcing this onto the community with the hopes it will just 'go-away' before they move on to their next steps in this.What about Colossal Order?  What do they say?I actually reached out to them.  They basically said, they don't own the IP to the game they are making, and that they don't have a choice in the matter.  They are being forced into this.  They didn't come out and oppose the launcher, but they also didn't say they support it either.  They basically have no choice.What can be done?STOP, right were you are, and don't buy the game or any more DLC.  Don't support a company that sells-out their users to Google and other data collection big tech firms.  Make a Stand, say NO!  Start right here, make a difference!  They already sold us out who've been playing the game for years and stole our money and sold us out, but if you have not bought the game, or it's DLC, please, make a difference, don't buy it! say NO to Google sellouts!R.I.P.

Cities: Skylines filled a void that SimCity created. Once SimCity was king of citybuilders. They were all solid, except the last installment. That game pushed details and beauty, but to make it playable for non-high-end pc's, they severely limited the greath of the sandbox. This design decision went against the game itself: a sandbox game shouldn't have a shortage of sand. I think the ambition killed the game.At that time I think they released some DLC, but it was a pretty new concept, which I refused to buy.Then after a few year of nothing came Cities: Skylines. It gave players what they wanted: a game not too demanding for the pc, but without immediate limits. And it works really well! Now 5 years later it's still the ruler of the City Builders. Happy with this game, but sad EA let an icon die...Zoneing - the concept of zoneing should be reworked. The zones for industry, parks and universities are absolete. Just zoneing for policies is enough.Traffic tools - unmodded the game handles traffic really poor.Two times a year the game gets a dlc. They provide sidegrades of the game mainly, to provide richer tools.After Dark - tourism is nice, but day-night cycle should be part of base game.Snowfall - a very mediocre dlc. It's nice to play in a snowmap during december, but very boring during other times. This dlc should be reworked to make snow an option on normal maps.Natural disasters - fun for a short while. It introduced scenarios, which are great!Mass transit - fantastic!Green cities - solidation. While nice, could be part of base game.Parklife - really nice sandbox tools. However the firemen can't enter parks, so it always turns into a collection of ash.Industries - 4 big specialisations. I really like this dlc!Campus - nice!Sunset harbor - small and (too) simple. There are 4 types of fish, but are the same product.Radio stations - all bad.Skin packs - I always forget to use them."

789,xythrort,https://steamcommunity.com/id/charlesgorby/,20,2,1,376.4,May,"5,",14,0,1,"I've been enjoying C:S for almost two years now. I tried to run it off of a 2nd or 3rd-gen i5 processor with native graphics and that flopped at first. But, 6 months later, I bought a laptop with a 6th-gen 4-core i7 and NVIDIA GTX 960M. The fans run loud, but the game runs beautifully at 1080p maxed out. So, before you read the review, read this to get a sense of the game's needs.Let's now get into the actual review! First off, one of the things I immediately noticed playing C:S was the amount of freedom you're given. So much land, so many different building options & features--this game has it all! And here I am, more than four years after the release, going on about C:S! Something else that was noticeable was the workshop support. I am glad to say that NO OTHER GAME I know of on Steam has this much support on the Workshop. There are literal MILLIONS of items to download onto C:S. At least hundreds of thousands. And, while some are better than others, they all combine to make your game a better one in the long run. Plus, everything is customizable, meaning the game can cater to my needs as well. Lastly, there is no other game like C:S. Although SimCity tries (and fails) to keep up, no other game can surpass the level of support, freedom, or amount of time you can play this game for without getting bored of it. One of the greatest parts includes how you make what you want. Mods are needed, sure, but everything you do in C:S is basically original to you. It's a your-eyes-only game or a community-shared game. It all depends on what you want to do. And, you get to choose that decision!I can't seem to find any major thing wrong with Cities: Skylines. I cannot stress to you how freakin' much I love this game or how the team is still creating major updates and packs 4 years after launch. I expected to play this 1-2 years max. But, my expectations were outdone. This entire review is honestly an understatement, and honest. You can't forget that I am being 100% honest when I say it's worth the money. Packs? Maybe... But, whatever you're thinking about this game, it should be positive, because that's all I think when i play this game. Thank you and good night."

797,Daassie,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatcigarette/,19,,1,171.9,April,"5,",209,0,1,"This has been a very pleasant city simulator so far in big part due to the user-friendly user interface and mechanics. The city is a joy to build, prod and tweak and you only need a few keys and your mouse buttons. While many good lessons have been learned from mobile gaming (simple menu structures, addictive feedback FX, hint stream, etc.), the game offers a good amount of depth, freedom and player challenge. The city will grow automatically but not run itself and will certainly need a strategist and grand architect. The player's role is as it should be: balancing, optimising and developing the city, not monitoring every last building and citizen, yet you still can if you want to! Speaking of, the citizens behave in a consistent and logical manner (if not an entirely rational one, but that is arguably good simulation!), making the city feel alive and controllable. - Fun to play, full mechanics, satisfies tweakers, AI is good.The Steam Workshop support brings a massive boost to the content just weeks after release: if you struggle with building intersections like I do, there are dozens, even hundreds of ready-made and user-tested Workshop ones available! No more eternal gridlock! There are also buildings, decorations and all sorts of stuff if the basic selection gets too repetitive. The default selection is nicely finished and has a good level of detail. - Steam Workshop provides ideas, help and variety.The only negatives so far are the pretty limited soundtrack, not enough variety in Chirper messages, no road ruler (grid), and the Steam Workshop items are missing their thumbnails. These are minor inconveniences so far and two can be circumvented; play your own music and keep a manageable number of content installed so you know what is what. The roads do snap straight, but sometimes it is not clear when they do, and different angles are hard to produce accurately.All in all a great experience so far, and I haven't seen half the content yet!PS. Compared to SimCity? Better flow, nicer UI mechanics, less obtuse, better mod and community support - and no EA/Origin! There is a Paradox account you can register, but it is not mandatory. I don't know how the performance will be once my city reaches beyond two map squares, but so far there have been no slowdowns or glitches.Still going strong; the game has switched focus from pure growth to efficiency and large-scale management. I still get to build simple and fun new places (these maps feel pretty huge), but the core of the city is now an optimiser's dream. Education, roadworks and public transit are a real balancing act.I still can't get enough even after failing two cities miserably - they just feel like learning experiences. My main city is a place I constantly want to go back to and build and improve.The engine shows no signs of slowing down or glitching even with four (or was it five) map squares built, and game load times are fantastic. No real bugs or glitches in sight, everything Just Works. Except Tweeter; that thing is really starting to annoy me, because it has no relevance or variety anymore.Still very much Recommended."

The game offers a diverse and massive modding community, which is a key to enhancing any city building game, and not to mention it's easily accessible with Steam Workshop.  This game also earns a plus on a near flawless release(when compared to its competition), and I have confidence that it become more than what Sim City 4 had became, in less amount of time(Sim City 4 does have a decade+ of development).  My only complaint, and it's merely opinion oriented, is I wish this game used a darker saturation for the color of its buildings and vehicles.  I personally wish they would have used a similar color scheme as Cities in Motion 2(for realism).  However, with the mod community, you are able to change this.

I am currently at about 1000 hours of play time and I can tell that my money was spend well. I highly recommend this to everybody interested in city builders or who is looking for a relaxing game with progress in it.+ very beginner friendly, comes with a  intrusive tutorial+ Open communication with the enormous community, also really great support+ regular updates, with lots of improvements+ a variety of good DLC that can Improve your game, but are NOT essential (e.g Natural Disasters or Industries)+ the game gets more difficutlt the bigger your city gets, so it doesnt get boring, just more challenging. additionally , the game can be made more easy/ difficult in the content manager.+ most mods are only necessary for advanced players and those that want to change certain aspects of the game (e.g building a vietnamese themed city, therefore adding horizontal trafic lights)+ Almost completly bug free ( see below )- a lot of small DLC that should be implemented in the base game, or at least be available for free (e.g content creator packs)- ""intense"" modding (20+ Mods and/or 1000* Assest) causes the game to multiply the loading times by a factor of 100, its also the only steam game I know of that causes such a hugh variety of problems with modding- Some mods (e.g Traffic Manager) are  for even basic players/ everybody above beginner- a lack of features for advanced players ( eg better asset editor with more options) and the QoL is also mostly achieved through mods- an AI that is more  then  (at some point it will eventually drive you insane)But besides these negative things, the base game provides fun for at least 100 hours and thourgh additional content and mods a much higher playtime is granted. Also the positive aspects overwhelm the negative ones and through updates, many of the former problems where solved. So if anybody is struggleing with investing their money into this game I would recommend trying it out, waiting for a discount or just look up some gameplay on Youtube. I still enjoy playing this game and after some time, I had a feeling about which mods I need and which i want. And just like game like Minecraft, playing with mods is more fun, but if you play once a month or 3 times a year, its definitely not necessary."

I do love it, althought I kind of feel like DLCs for this game are overpriced for what they offer. Also there are many areas where I wish we had more control in details. Overal this game is not as detailed and offers less than Sim City 4, but I think those beautiful graphics do compensate it. Also it supports workshop and you can find many great mods and in skins and gameplay wise. But be careful as having too many mods at the same time can break your game."

She was a golden retriever named Sparkey and she was the best damn dog a kid could ever have. Was she perfect? No. She would seek out and consume cat poop and begged at the table when we tried to have dinner, but I didn't care. She was an awesome dog and I spent hours playing with her. Near the end of her life, her liver shut down. She started to ♥♥♥♥ and puke in the house, and even started to snap at me; she was in a lot of pain. In the end the vet suggested we put her down. It was a sad day. I had lost a best friend that I had for years, but it was for the best. Later we got a new dog. A Yellow Lab/German Shepard mix named Milo. Milo was not Sparky, but he is still an awesome dog. Playful, good with kids, cutely vocal and a big lump who's good for hugging. He isn't perfect either, he sheds like crazy, but that doesn't make him a bad dog. Why did I ramble on about dogs? The Sim City Franchise is Sparkey, with 5imCity 2013 being her post liver-failure. A game series I remember fondly as the stuff of my childhood, willfully editing out what happened at the very end. Cities: Skylines is Milo. A new dog, a different dog, but an awesome dog. If you are a fan of city building games at all, you are going to want to pick this game up right now. It is only $30 AT LAUNCH. That is not a sale price, that is the full undiscounted price and it is worth double that (which, by the way, is what 5imCity 2013 cost at launch). It is stable and fun out of the box and with adamant mod support and a dev team that is actively listening to the community feedback, it will get even better."

I'm also going to give you a warning that this game may eat away at your hours. Reading over the reviews, I've seen this game a multitude of times compared to Sim City. The biggest comparison I see is that, this game has been labelled ""easier"". In some sense it's true, but when you realize how big your city can be and the unique styles you can give to your roads, it can get complicated. The game is about building up a city, but eventually turns into managing one instead of it managing itself. The  is relatively simple. Everything is laid out for you, and as your city grows, so does your ability to build upgraded or newer buildings. Taxes can be adjusted, budgets can be adjusted (for parks, buses, water works, electricity etc...), and loans can be taken out. Even if you are not extremely familiar how economics work in a municipality, the game does it's best to advise you of everything going on. Placing police stations, fire stations, hospitals, or even schools becomes very easy as the game does an extremely good job in showing which areas are covered. What can drive a few people nuts is putting water pumps near sewage dumps. At first, you may smile as you see water is being delivered to your residents and that the sewage water is far away (especially in the first level with the lake). You'll then notice a lot of water being polluted and eventually making it's way up to your water pumps. It is imperative that my readers know to build down stream or to use water towers where sewage may be an issue! They also make it easy to see what crime rates are (check the top left of your screen), what your citizens happiness is, pollution, electricity and water availability, natural resources and a few others. The biggest feature in the game to me it seems, is the ability to really architect the roads. In Sim City, you are able to put zones wherever you please. In Skylines, you have only the choice to build near roads. Zoning is made easy and can be done with a fill brush tool or individual squares can be assigned. A huge feature in Skylines is districts. Districts are designed by you and are designated by you as well. Want a forest industry? Want a mining industry? Want a farming industry by residential areas? This can be done through districts. Definitely a notable feature in the game. Bus stops and other sort of transport is available. They try to give you as much control as possible within the game. Bus stops are designated by you and are placed where you'd like them to be. At first it is difficult to control where the bus goes when placing the stops, but choosing the RIGHT side of the road is important for it to work properly!  are appropriate. The music is neither condemning or over the top, but the repitid Sounds follow your screen, and you will hear buildings burn if they are on fire. At first glance, I thought traffic was extremely horrible in my city. I zoomed in closer and saw they actually park their cars in front of their house. Good to see the attention to detail put in. I bought this game on sale and am quite content with the product. I would like to have a feature where I can drive through my city or even go on a rampage with a truck. Maybe it's asking too much from a city builder, but having complete control like this is what differentiates the best from the rest.RATING : 7.5/10"

With mods, the game becomes the best city building game ever made, by far (at least if you're like me and are looking more to create a pretty and atmospheric city rather than enjoy deep management and simulation gameplay).	A massive catalogue of cosmetic mods (both for adding new assets and tweaking the graphics) and robust asset editing combined with utility mods like Prop Anarchy and MoveIt makes it possible to have everything looking just how you want it. I treat this game as more of a canvas to paint on than a game to play.	Colossal Order have released several free updates to fix bugs and have been generally good at listening to the playerbase. My personal biggest complaint, the traffic AI, hasn't been fixed although there is talk of changing it in the future.	The base game goes on sale regularly and a large majority of the mods don't require any DLC, so it's been good value for me.If you're looking to interact deeply with your citizens, scheme political and diplomatic schemes and solve complex civil engineering problems, you might find this game lacking. If you want to build an atmospheric, aesthetically pleasing model city then I can strongly recommend Cities: Skylines."

835,Darkelfguy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkelfguy/,12,,1,175.1,November,"27,",878,1,1,"Like many players of Cities Skylines, I was a long time fan of SimCity, starting way back in the 90s. I was obsessed with games like SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4, so when 2013 came around, and a new SimCity was finally coming out, I was pretty excited. I had heard the negative press of course, the online connectivity, the rumored small city zones, but none the less, I was starved for a good modern city builder, so when launch day came, I was still excited. I ordered some Imo's Pizza, and then proceeded to wait 4 hours to even login to the SimCity servers. But once I did, I had a blissful city building experience. For two hours. After that, there was no room to build anything, and traffic was nightmare. But without an alternative, I kept playing anyway.Fast forward a couple of years to 2015, with the imminent release of Cities Skylines. By now I was a bit wary of a new city builder. I had given up on the new SimCity and gone back to SimCity 4, but I was still hungry for something new, something modern, something with curved roads.  So I bought Cities Skylines, and I've never looked back. Now true, the game didn't have a lot of the same features as SimCity at launch. There were no disaster options, no day/night cycle, and the graphics were a little dull. But all of that has been added in or updated either with patches or new expansions, and whatever's still missing can be covered by the modding community, which is perpetually pumping out tons of amazing new assets to populate your cities with. The comparison to SimCity and Maxis couldn't be starker. Whereas one abandoned support for SimCity fairly quickly, Colossal Order with their continued and dedicated support for Cities Skylines has offered some of the best post-launch updates of really any game studio in the industry.While I do have to knock Skylines a bit for subpar music that doesn't hold a candle to the SimCity soundtrack, as far as everything else is concerned, this is the absolute best city builder on the market, and with so many expansions and updates, there's absolutely no reason not to give it a try!"
836,Mordgier,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mordgier/,61,5,0,68.1,February,"23,",702,2,1,"Yeah it's a bit late for a review - but I'm glad I'm writing one now as had I written it at release it would have been full of praise as a must buy game...Thing is, almost a year later this game still has a ton of irritating bugs that you absolutely must install mods for. I could deal with that - except the mods are poorly supported and very frequently break with patches leaving you with useless save games.I could even deal with that - if the patches that  the developer was putting out were fixing major issues. Thing is..they haven't. CO seems to have forgotten about the many annoyances of this game and been happy to let the modding community sort them out.Unfortunately it seems that many of the issues that this game suffers from just have not been adequately addressed by mods. Traffic is a complete nightmare with the AI behaving oddly and as such designing a high density city is incredibly tedious as you will spend 99% of your time fighting with traffic.Ok - fine, we can say that the traffic is the core challenge of skylines as really beyond that the game is trivially simple - but even that turns into hours of frustration as the tools you have for building roads are amazingly clunky. Some of the most popular mods are ways of disabling pillars, road intersection angle limitations and slope limitations for roads - but even those mods are tedious to use as you have a very clunky interface for building roads and no built in teraforming tools. The mods that do exist are clunky to use or result in incredibly ugly and unrealistic looking roads.These are all issues that have been listed from day one - so where are we a year later? Same place of course! CO has released a pair of unimpressive DLCs which are mostly cosmetic and at times annoying. After Dark does not add much except tunnels that is of any use and the night mode is just another layer of frustration as building at night is difficult - unless you get that mod that lights up your mouse cursor. Snowfall adds trams which are basically expensive buses with no other advantages that I can see - there is effectively no real reason to use them besides aesthetics as metro and buses get the job done better and easier.  Heated pipes offer little change in the game.So here we are - a year later and the game still feels like it needs ~30 essential mods to enjoy and even that enjoyment is basically fighting with the road building system for 2 hours to build a single good looking and working highway off-ramp.I really want to love this game but every single time I play it I feel more drained and frustrated by it than my day job."

I had my pet peeves with SimCity 4 and was very much so looking forward to SimCity 6 (2013) which ended up being an EXTREME disappointment and should have been called SimTown instead. I was finding myself completing a City in less than 2 hours, and got so frustrated with the game that I took to their Facebook page and left a rather lengthy post that hundreds of others seemed to share the same feelings in regards to the lack of attention put into the game.Then comes Cities: Skylines. My girlfriend actually purchased a copy for me as a gift and I had my eye on it for awhile, just never made the purchase because I didn't have time to play (full-time developer).I can honestly say this is everything that SimCity SHOULD have been, or at least what EA Games promised us it would be.-> []The steam workshop is the HUGE seller for me. Almost any building, tool and mod is available to integrate into the game. I have well over 200 addons packed into my game, and almost an endless supply of buildings I can place, which ensures my city doesn't look the same everywhere. This is probably my FAVORITE thing about the game, is the huge support for this game through the workshop.-> []Everything from the terrain tools, the different types of roads you can place, and the ability to toggle the grid system on/off makes it possible to pretty much create anything you want. No two cities should look alike if you truly utilize the tools you are given.-> []When I play these simulators, I don't like going through and playing the scenarios and having to watch my money. This game gives me the ability to have an unlimited source of money, and just build away. -> []Everything is beautiful in regards to the games appearance and performance. FPS is extremely smooth, and the entire city looks amazing (especially at night with the lights on). I haven't ran into any bugs, and I can pretty much crank the graphics up to ultra for everything, and the level of detail is very very real.-> []It is relatively easy to control traffic in this game. You just have to map out where your dense traffic is going to be, and adjust accordingly with the right roads, and the other methods of transportation are great as well! (Bus, airport, tram, etc).I did find one minor annoyance. It appears that Sims get sick quite frequently, especially in a highly populated city. Theirs almost never a moment where I don't hear an ambulance screaming past me where I'm building.  In fact one time, I was just browsing the city, and one of my main busy roads had 17 ambulances one after another, going to different calls... that's a little excessive.... I don't even see them that much in Los Angeles...Overall, it's a great game, and definitely worth the price. I think the DLCs are a little over-priced for what they provide, but that's certainly not a reason to not buy the game.It looks like EA Games is no longer the king of City Simulators.Regards,Richard"

""Slightly"" Cars will plie up because the random cars not owned by people in the city are trying to use your city highway system as a short cut between highways connection: A and highway connection:B So you have either HAVE to make a bypass for those cars or your highways will be clogged. The new dlc does add more details to the cites transportation information screens. However not enough for example I recently started to use a lot of underground passages to make people have easy connection to schools or medical buildings. I see the many homes that people leave to use these tunnles but I do not know *HOW* many people are using them. Nighttime is nice. But the speciality of areas to section into your city seem lacking. However my biggest issue is no shock here. Taxis. I thought the taxis would work like buses jut spawning the needed amount for the area or route. Nope Taxis are a limited number. Making them nothing but flash for your roads and never making the expense money back. It seems that with more they add to the game the more the games traffic isses become more bothersome.

However, they seem to have cut that out in this as in transport that has diffrent type of mass transport and effectivness in this game. The game seems to be designed for a road/highway based city. And any other methods bedamed. Which I personally find very not upset just wishing it was better. Tunnels add a new useful way to manage roads/highways. However the tunnels are not labeled so over time underground ends up looking like the L.A. freeways system but underground.Further there is not enough detailed information. Industry will complain about not having enough resources. However there is no way to just add the import costs to the city expenses. Which is very confusing because there are city view overlays that show trucks driving to industry with imports. It seems that over time the industries are not able to order more imports. This problem also effects office/commercial these sectors also lose the ability to get the goods needed to function. Moreover, If you connect industry to office/comm industry for a time sends the needed goods to the formerly mentioned sectors. Alas the mentioned issues mean that after a time the problems kick in so massive amounts of these sectors are abandoned. So you will have to delete large sections of those sectors. Moving on to transport it works by placing lines in the path you want it to go and press the  line to place the stop. That is how the game explains it to you however that it is very messy to place many lines on bus and trains/subway. Traffic is another big problem. And can not be fixed without placing messy lines of highway making your city look like the L.A. freeway system. Oh and the cars on the highway drive like ♥♥♥♥ cutting each other off and slowing down the other cars in the lanes. No matter how many subways or buses or trains I place in hotspots. People still use their cars. After playing the game for another 100+ hours my traffic controling skills are better so after about 90,000 people in my city THEN the trafic goes to poop. However this game is not marketed as a grand city builder just a basic one. So it shouldnt have taken me and extra 100 hours to get a handle on the traffic and mass transport. Moding is highly easy for this game I still find myself using very little ""big"" mods other than road intersections and what not because heavy mods make my game crash."

It's such a smooth game to play. It runs like a throughly tested, well polished game. The vibrant colors and excellent soundtrack in the game instantly puts me in the mood to build my dream city. The game tools provides one with an abundance of creativity. So much so that I felt overwhelmed with all that I am able to do. I'm only limited by my imagination not the game mechanics which is awesome! Some of my favorite aspects of the game is the simulated people, yes folks each little pixlated person is an indivisual in City Skylines! I love the water dynamics and how they can create a challenge which adds to gameplay and not take away from it. I love all of the transportation options with more types promised in the future. I love the soundtrack and if I had only one regret, it was not getting in on that pre-order offer to get it.  But what I love most, is the potential of this game through the modding community. This game is built with modding in mind. Can you imaging the many props and gameplay mods that will flow from the talented modders for this game? I can hardly wait, and guess what? The modders are already making assets and gamemods for Cities as you read this. I honestly can't praise this game enough. If you are interested in City Builders and you've been burned by other games, look no further. Cities will most likely satisfy everything you've ever wanted in a city builder game. I whole heartily reccommend City Skylines.  :)"

More on that later, first my list of pros and cons;PROS:- Water has current, which you have to plan for so as not to polute your own shores.- Water can controlled, both current and levels using hydro dams.- Citizens have specifically assigned residences (and jobs), making traffic more realistic.- The various interface overlays makes determining the placing of utility structures very easy.- You can practically do anything you want to when it comes to roads/highways/ramps.- Graphics are superb and performance is amazing, regardless of zoom level.- You get the feeling of SimCity, without the bad taste it left behind.- Completely customizable routes for buses, subways, and trains.- High number of road types for you to select, everything from gravel to highways.CONS:- Constant ""tweets"" got pretty annoying after a while.- Tweets about problems that shouldn't exist (ex. dead person, with a crematorium next door).- Building with full fire coverage would burn down and prompt you to check fire coverage.- Not enough options to deal with garbage and collection ranges seemed unrealistic.- A lot of specialty buildings had ""noise"" zones that seemed unreasonably large.- No real options to deal with industry polution, other than to keep it away from everything else.- Not enough random building names, I'd often find 6-8 buildings in a row with the same name.- Small number of maps included (although more are available).- No way (that I've found) to have a subway come to the surface.- No streetcars- Ships (cruise/cargo) movement seemed extremely unrealistic, as if it was an afterthought.- Music is EXTREMELY repetative, I had to turn it off after a while.- Road ""snapping"" can be annoying when working on highway offramps, even when it's supposedly turned off.Now that I've given you that basic list, let's get down to brass tax.  Everyone is correct when they say that this game is everything that SimCity should have been.  That said, it is lacking in a few basics that SimCity actually had.  The biggest thing in my list of pet peves for this game would have to be garbage collection.  In my 80,000 population city (real life) there is one garbage dump and the entire city's garbage has been going there since the city was built.  In this game, by the time my population was 10,000 I had 4 garbage dumps spread out across the landscape.  By the time I hit 80,000 there was an entire district devoted to garbage dumps (10 of them) with 6 insinerators trying (unsuccessfully) to keep them from being full.  I even had the recycling policy in place, and still my garbage dumps were overflowing.  Oh, that's another thing, no recycling centers?Anyway, when you put this game beside SimCity there really isn't any question that Cities: Skylines is the superior game overall.  It does have it's issues, but it's by far the best all around city building game that's been produced.  Don't go into this game expecting your every city building dream to come true, just enjoy it for what it is.EDIT:Since the addition of the Workshop to Cities:Skylines most of the problems I mentioned are easily solved by downloading 3rd party workshop items, like a recycling center.  This game is now my #1 city building game."

With all the mods and assets (for free, by the way) on Workshop for this game, the DLC's are not at all necessary.  I've been playing this game for years now (2,496 hours at the time of this review) and have never been bored once.  And the only DLC I ever bought was AFTER DARK …. only because it gave me bicycle lanes.  I've felt no desire to purchase the Disasters or the Mass Transit DLCs, even if they were dropped to $1.00 each ….. okay, maybe the Mass Transit one if only $1.00.  But I've gotten off-track of my point, which is that with all the mods and assets that are free for this game, you don't really need the DLCs.If you just subscribe (it's free) to the First Person Mod by Tony56a, you can have days and weeks of fun just traveling around in your city.  As a Cim yourself or just riding along in a vehicle or a Cim wherever they go.  The game is COMPLETEY DIFFERENT – and sooo much fun – once you jump down into it and actually look at it from ground level.Frustrated with creating a city?  Don't bother to create one --- on the Workshop, you can subscribe to a city of your choice (again, for free) that is already all set up for you, mods and assets, roads, city services, and all, and immediately start playing about down in the city as a CIM yourself.  Or you can start from there (with all the frustrating work of setting things up) already done for you.  From that point you can play with what you subscribed to or start adding in or removing anything you like from the city.Anyone who hasn't tried this game is cheating himself/herself of one of the most fascinating experiences ever …. and I gotta tell ya, NO ONE could get me to play ANY computer games before I was forced by a family member to sit down in front of this one for one hour and play it.  Now I'm hooked and spend almost all my spare winter season hours on it  …  and, to my shame, some of my summer gardening hours as well.And, honestly, for a vacation into a world you can make into your very own, the initial price is more than worth it.  If I lost it and had to start over and buy it again, I'd actually be willing to save up till I had $60.00 US and buy it again, if that was what it cost then.  And really, all anyone ever really has to pay for is the initial game, regardless of what the naysayers are whining about."

The greatness and reputation of the game in of itself stands on its own, just read the reviews. It's by all means- and probably by miles- the best city builder, so i don't need to discuss it. That is why this review is recommended.What's to take note is that there's some pretty aggressive info-selling going on. Ever since i got this game, whenever that was... A year and a half ago? My email has been consistently getting spam mail on a weekly basis. My email has since never recovered from the spam mails. I don't care much personally since it's easy to filter out, and to protect yourself from privacy requires almost full paranoia nowadays considering everyone's grabbing your info at every entry on the internet, but for those that care about their personal information, you want to stay FAR the hell away from Paradox because they are merciless with your information, and there's quite a few testimonials to it on top of their privacy policy serving as a confirmation.Something else about Paradox, as a game studio, is that they truly live up to the year-long support that triple cAAApitalism keeps promising and never delivering on. Paradox pumps out patches and DLCs on a consistent basis for years for fantastic games like Stellaris and City Skylines. However, is it out of principle, passion, or a clever gray zone strategy? Did they intentionally rip features out of City Skylines to be sold as DLC, or is it something they developed later after the games' release? And if so, how ''early'' in the games' development came the release? Was it essentially just the bare bones that was a functional game and all the ''details'' and ''extras'' being sold as DLC? Is Stellaris and City Skylines supported for so long only because they're successful and continue to bring profit? I don't know, but at the very least they make good games and also allow people to experiment and share their own stuff with mod support. While City Skylines might be expensive to enter nowadays (Lol even base game is still expensive after all these years, really?), it wasn't back then. Spending 15 bucks every 4 months or so for a DLC was pretty worth it, but it stacks up a lot with the years."

I love simulation games, but this one grew stale and was not for me.The first several hours were really enjoyable and I even went as far as to get the After Dark DLC at a sale price since I anticipated I'd be addicted. But only a few hours later did I realize I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. There are no ""scenarios"" to play, adding actual goals to the game, unless you get the Natural Disasters DLC (and there are apparently very few). You're just left to endlessly build a city with intricate micromanagement. If that sounds like your type of game, buy it! If that's all you want, this game will be perfect.My major complaints that led to me stop enjoying the game began with the lack of customization. For the first while, before your city's population adds up and you unlock more features, there's not much to add personalization to your city to make it feel like your own. Different types of roads and other customizations are blocked off arbitrarily in the early portion of building a city, and you'll only get access to these by boosting your population by a stated amount. It makes sense! It really does, but it made the first hour or two of starting a new city absolutely boring. I feel the game would have benefitted from loosening these restrictions.... and to follow that up, you may say ""there are mods, though!"" Yes, there are, and I was very excited to try them. However, the community proves that there are troubles with every update. Mods become incompatible, unsupported by the developers, and as a new player, lots of research will go into finding out how to use these mods and have them appear in your game, like custom buildings or styles. Many times, just trying to make sure custom content appeared in the in-game ""Content Manager"" would crash the game just after a few items. I thought it was just because I originally ran the game on an external hard drive, but I eventually tried it on my internal SSD, and the mods just seemed to hamper the game.If you have a lot of patience to learn the sciene behind the custom content of the game, and don't mind the aimless city-building with not much else to look forward to but ""more, more and more"". This is a sandbox game for you, no question. I understand why some people like it, but after the amount of time I played, I just feel exhausted and need a long break. The pleasure of growing my city sort of numbed itself."

EU4/CK2 have each got a couple dozen DLCs over the years with a combined price of soon-to-hit-300$, expect this game to drown in a dozen (quite possibly incompatible with each other) DLCs as well.Besides that, Paradox has increased (up to 100% increase in some regions) prices in many regions without any announcement beforehand, right before the Steam Summer Sale 2017.If you're willing to throw some of your money away and are willing to indulge Paradox in their cupidity, go ahead.

I have been playing simcity for many years, and I am sure that I am not the only one that was very unpelased with simcity 2013. Was it horrible? Nah, but it was not as good as it should be. Cities Skylines is the modern city builder I have been looking for. No city restrictions and no online DRM BS. The game allows you to build insansly large cities, and the modding community is already pushing out some really cool stuff, especialy with the asset and map editor being a thing.  It does not have the same kind of quarkyness that simcity has, and wont have the same kind of random events, but it is satisfying to watch the city grow.My only real problem with the game is that it does not tailor it's self way to new players. If you are new to the city building genre then be prepared to fail a lot, as this game will punish you for the smallest of mistakes. If you are like me and been wanting a great modern version of simcity then this is for you, along with the modding community I would definetly say that this game is well worth 30 bucks."

I'd wholeheartedly recommend it to you, because it gave me hours of fun, relaxing and on times challenging gameplay. It did everything SimCity promised but didn't follow through, and it has a phenomenal community to boost. I own the game and all DLC on PC, I own the game on Switch and I even own the board game. That's how much I love the game.But: Paradox (and I'm pretty certain this was Paradox's idea) had to force another Launcher application on us. A Launcher that (as of writing this review) adds no useful functionality to the game for us gamers. And to make matters worse, their community management resorts to being everything from defensive about it to being outright toxic towards their customer base. They keep telling us it's beneficial to us and doesn't spy on us. Network Analysis Tools beg to differ. This launcher connects to not fewer than four servers. They harvest data, without your consent, and they're intransparent and defensive about it.At the moment it pains me to say: Don't buy the game."

It will take a lot of hours to get to know the game better. The game is not simple, as it seems at first. If you do not think over the details, you can immediately go bankrupt and go into a minus and loans. Everything in the game is interconnected, one without the other does not exist. In the game you should not forget to build power stations, water supply systems and, most importantly, build roads thoroughly. One action can easily ditch the city by raising the water level in the wrong place or put a refinery near the pumping station. A big plus is the animation in the game. In the evenings, the lanterns are beautifully lit, and in the morning the sun is brightly reflected in the windows of high-rise buildings. A sufficient number of amenities, social and city services make the game rich, it is always pleasant to build a park and educational institution and see how the level of welfare of the district increases. A huge minus, which is terribly annoying - this is traffic ... I don’t try to increase the speed on the roads, delete extra dorgas, make rounds, roads are still loaded, and this worsens the work of all city services. It is also a frequent problem - they cannot take out corpses from houses, although there are a lot of cemeteries and crematoria. I still do not understand why this happens even on free roads. I recommend the game, for more understanding in the Internet games there are many guidelines."

If Sim Cities was better, this game would have been shunned by the most part of it. People are giving this game way too much credit.   To begin with, the vanilla game by its self is mediocre at best. The gameplay is okay but the vanilla textures are an eye sore. And half the texture are just reused from their older, more transportation based game, Cities in Motion. Sure it maybe a good idea to reuse but the textures just don't look all that great. People really give this game so much credit because of the mods, not the vanilla game. But the more mods you have, the slower the game runs thus having to limit your mod intake.    I bought this game when it was only $16.99. Once the developers saw the profits they were making, they raised the price on us, an EA move. Once they saw we bought their first two DLC's, they began to create more and focus less on giving us free updates. Half of the DLC content should have already been in the game. A day and Night cycle, above-ground metros, season, etc.    I'm just saying, the game used to be worth it when it only cost half of what it was. If you do buy it remember, you are really only paying for a quarter of the game, keep in mind that EA... I mean Paradox Development Studios just wants your money."

(HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH EXITS BEING ON THAT SIDE)Those are the biggest game breaking bugs in the game but lets go to the head scratchers.You can put the taxes up to 29% but everyone is going to complain and as far as i know its not possible to go more than 18% even if the land value is up the roof and everyone is happy.Your citizens will always complain.Water physics, yea they don't exist and dont get me started on building a hydro power plant, just dont do it or you will 100% drown your city because water is wet and dogs say woof.Now to the performance part.The graphics are MEH compared to Sim City but for some reason the game runs slower, I believe it's becuase of bad optimization but im not sure, Im not alone with this problem as alot of other people are having the same issues even though they have better PC's than me.I start to suffer at a population of 20k with a maximum of 50 fpsAnd at a population of 400k thats when we are talking 20 fps maxNot will you just take a performance hit but the time will go slower and progress will ""stall"" (It won't actually stall but it will take longer for stuff to respond to the changes you've made)My setup: i5-6600k (3.50GHz) with a Sapphire RX480 Nitro+ (4GB) with 16 GB of LPX Vengance RAM (3200MHz)So to wrap this up by saying, this is just a tiny portion of the bugs i've encountered but there still is alot more but these bugs stand out the most to me, Would i recommend this game, at the current price HECK NO, but i would recommend waiting for a discount then get it i guess, but only if you're ready to face everything i've mentioned and alot more.EDIT: I was wrong, it wasn't just 40€+ it was '79,91€ Add all DLC to Cart'"

In my point of view this is mainly caused by the following issues:I could still continue with this list for a while.

At the time I got this game, which as some time ago, I was a Simcity fan, well I still am. Not as much since the disaster of Simcity 2015. I was intrigued when I saw Cities: Skylines, I saw good potential. I took the risk of buying it, not doing much research about it, sure enough, I picked the right game.Cities: Skylines is basically Simcity, but even better. You can put in so much detail in your cities. Managing traffic without any care will also lead yourself into bigger problems than what Simcity would do, well for me at least.You have your modes such as the original, you have to manage your money, and have to be smart on your spendings to make the income to keep yourself afloat. Then you have The Sandbox, which is the only one I play, to be honest. You don't have to worry about anything, really. Well, your city of course, but money isn't much of an issue.You have your utilities to supply your city. Such as Water, Electricity, and Sewage and so on.You place down your zones, such as Low-Residental, High-Residental, Commerical, Business, and Industry.You have your transportation, although not all are included, as yes, DLC's. But the DLC's are kind of worth it, I'll explain more about this later. Anyways, you have your Subway System, Train System, Airplanes, and Buses.You supply happiness to your city, placing their wants and needs. Build a park to make your city look more beautiful, put in school systems so your citizens actually have a good education for better jobs.The Downloadable content for this game is actually pretty good,  although some are bad in my opinion. But these DLC' add's more to your games. The DLC's I would focus on getting first would be these:Each of these DLC's will add more to your game. For example, with After Dark, you'll be able to add some nightlife in your city, or with Mass Transit you'll have better transportation. It's good and bad for the DLC's, you just have to pay more to experience more, but in a way, it's sort of worth it if you're dedicated to playing this game. I'll likely review these, later on, in the meantime, I don't have any of them reviewed.Oh yes, there is indeed Mod Support. a very good amount too. It's also easy to use them also because all you need is the Steam Workshop!You can have some enhanced mods, such as AI improvements, buildings, and more! Just also note, some DLC's are required for some mods. Usually, the creators will give out the requirements needed for the mod, but other than that you should be okay.Steam Workshop Link: If you want a good city building of a game, Cities: Skylines is a perfect pick for you 101%! There's so much you can do in this game for a city builder, more than what Simcity had in the past. Using mods is although risky, but it really, really enhances your game so much more.On a final rating of a scale 1/10, I would give this game a 9.4/10!"

Across the bottom of the screen is a toolbar that contains all the stuff you need to create your city. Initially there is only a limited selection for you to play with. As your population grows more tools become available and the pacing is just perfect.Features like global policies that can reduce power consumption or increase fire safety are introduced at a rate that never feels like a bombardment. The same goes for buildings and services. Rather than a sit down and read endless pop-ups style tutorial features are gradually introduced so that only small explanations are needed at each stage. It really lets you get hooked even during those often tedious early learning stages. Another reason Skylines is so fun straight from the start is that each and every tool you use is so effortless.There’s a zone system used that is very similar to everyone’s favourite Sim City game. But again the tools are there for you to make your life easy. Streets come ready equipped with grids attached that you can either paint one square at a time, use a paint brush tool or even a fill tool to create entire blocks easily. Then waiting just a little time everything comes to life as buildings are erected and citizens go about their daily lives.All this simplicity isn’t to imply that Skylines isn’t complex. Underneath the user friendly interface there are a set of menus and tables that reveal some of the numbers that lie beneath. Finances, happiness, healthcare, education, crime and transport are all detailed enough to make Skylines worthy of any city building fan.The only thing that some may not like is the slightly sandbox style, especially later in the game. Once the learning curve and introduction of tools is done with there are very little objectives to give you direction. - Cities offer room for expansion- Beautifully detailed miniature village style looks- introduction and learning curve- Great tool designed- Lack of objectivesDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT |  | MASTERPIECE"

You will manage everything from waste disposal to public transport and of course traffic flow. In addition you can also designate areas as districts which allows you to more fine tune policy. There is also a very active and robust modding community and the ability to create and share your own assets if the base game content does not satisfy you.

People are asking for help on how to get the crime rate above 50% achievement - this shouldn't be something people need help with, it should be easy to make happen just through bad city management.  I wish my doctors would go on strike, or that a riot would happen, or that schools demanded a bigger budget.  Even the wind reducing a bit during certain seasons would give me a challenge because my city is powered 100% by clean wind power.

I advise watching beginners guide youtube videos as you can get into debt pretty quickly if you overspendAfter 200 hours of game play, I have lost count of how many times i have restarted my city, and have yet to build a megapolis (100,000 cims), not only because of getting into debt, but wanting to bulldoze everything and redesign my city! I have got to the point where I force myself to not destroy my residents homes for a new bypass to a new neighbourhood, but instead try to upgrade the existing infrastructure, as if it was a real city.When I first got the game 2 years ago, the vanilla game was missing a lot of features, but with the dlcs, they have added a lot of the popular mods into the base game, I still run a few mods (namely traffic president and move it) to help increase the realismThis game and its soundtrack is very relaxing, I can play four hours without realising, and in that time all I have done is build a big custom park. I have found that detailing is everything, it makes your city look more natural, rather than boring grids everywhereTL:DR If you liked sim city, buy cities: skylines.

Best decision I made that week. My friend taught me the basics and my city went from strength to strength, which made my friend jealous because it beat his. When I was younger I loved playing Sim City 4, and still want to play it from time to time, but Cities is an improvement on that game. I no longer find myself looking at Sim City and needing to play it, if I want to build a city I'm drawn to Cities now instead.HOWEVER, some of the unique buildings require you to do badly, even being in the negative money. So I had to go from 4.5million to -1 which was harder work than it really should have been. That's not really a negative to the game in itself as it makes you work hard to get these giant tourist traps, but I don't personally like having to turn my glorious city into a hell hole to get all the monuments."
939,Hey Blinkin',https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198258792690/,209,38,0,33.7,January,"26,",35,36,1,"If I had to summarise Cities Skylines in one word, that word would be frustrating.I really wanted to love this game. A city builder surpassing the classic Sim Citys in both scope and detail. I've seen the wonderful things others have built, and I want to join in on the fun, but the game is just too frustrating. I've come back to the game a few times, each time thinking this time would be the time I really get into Cities Skylines. It has never happened.Just starting a city is an ordeal. Before you can start having fun you need to connect your city to the highway, which sounds simple, but if you're a perfectionist like me it's about the most frustrating experience you can have with a creative game. There's no way to connect your town's roads to the highway in a way that looks orderly without tearing most of the highway apart and rebuilding. It's a sysiphistic effort of demolishing and rebuilding roads just to get to the good parts. I've literally spent over an hour doing this multiple times.Placing roads is very finnicky, and getting them to curve the way you want is a skill I wasn't able to master despite putting hours of practice into it. I can consistently get a 90 degree turn, but that's it. Building a curved road feels like trying to sew while wearing oven mitts. I can get the broad strokes of it, but the details are seemingly impossible and require tons of tedious fiddling. Trying to get to parallel lanes of a highway an equal distance apart along a curved path is a nightmare. Even when they're striaght it's not as easy as it should be. And all this happens before I get into actually building my city.The worst part of road building is there's no universal grid to build on. It's great that you don't have to be confined to a grid, but having the option for a universal grid would make city planning much less frustrating, especially if the highways enetered on that gird. There is a sort of grid system, but it's based on existing roads only. You need to build a bunch of temporary roads to act as a square and ruler, then delete them later. If you want to roads on opposite sides of the map to be parallel, you have to build a giant road between them first. It doesn't sound so bad, but do these things hundreds of times in a row and it gets infuriating. The features for building roads in line with your existing roads have improved since I bought the game, but it's just not good enough.The bulldozer tool feels especially clumsy. There doesn't seem to be any way to drag a bounding box (probably because there's no grid). Just a series of clicks. You can sort of drag the mouse around, but it's unreliable. And you can only bulldoze one very short section of road at a time. Nodes along the roads are about two road widths apart, so when you build a long curved highway, but you don't like it, you must individually bulldoze a dozen separate segments. Again, and again. Why don't I just ctrl+Z and try again, you ask?THERE IS NO UNDO FUNCTION.This is the thing that ruins the experience for me more than anything else. Even MS Paint on Windows 95 let you undo three actions. I've heard there's an undo for terraforming, which is nice, but it doesn't help me when I accidentally demolished the middle section of a bridge. If you delete one segment in a long curved road, you may as well delete the rest and start over, because there's no easy way to get that road the way it was before. You'd think there'd be a built in tool to create a smooth continuous curve between two existing roads, but I haven't found one. Getting parallel bridges to have matching supports and uniform height takes considerably more work than it's worth. You can't even edit existing roads without mods. Speaking of mods, the game is far too dependent on them. For basic functions even. It's also much too dependent on user generated content in general. The default premade highway transitions will never have the lanes the same distance apart as the highways on your map. The game only comes with about a dozen maps. I understand the appeal of a whole steam workshop full of maps, but most of them suck. It's Sturgeon's Law. Even the good ones aren't going to be what you're looking for. They're all either too flat and dull or have such complicated topography that building a city in them is more like tetris than city building. Spending an hour browsing the workshop looking for the right map isn't something I want to do every time I start a new city, I just want to get to the fun part. There's just not enough content. Unless you want to scour the workshop for assets, every hospital in your city is going to look identical.I've seen people do amazing things with this game, but I just don't have their patience. This game is work.Bottom line, there's just too much in the way of having a fun experience. If the game ever gets a sequel with an undo function and a universal grid, I'll buy it day one. But until that happens, Cities Skylines isn't worth the tedium and repetition.I'd only recommend this game if you're okay building sloppy and like the simulation aspect, or are willing to put in an inordinate effort to do something creative.Ah, who am I kidding, I'll try to get into it again in a few months."

It's a real nice touch, I'll defintely be keeping this game installed. Thank God that this won't drive people away from an absolute masterpiece of a game, with an execellent community. Seriously, this is an amazing game, as soon as Paradox learns not to throttle the golden goose I would suggest you purchace this game, and defintely if it's on sale, because snapping up some of the wonderful DLCs is a definte to-do. Despite how laggy or slow it may seem at points, it trades in speed for stability, and boy is this game stable. I found myself with over 300 mods installed at one point, simply because the game could handle it and still have a good framerate(by my standards mind you, I can work with 25fps, so I could well be biased). Obviously, I had to cut back such an addiction because it was taking me more time to load a save than I was playing it for, but I can still get away with so many of the community's fantastic add-ons and content. And that's another thing: the community is amazing, I think sometimes they out-do the devs with their outstanding work; be it roads, buildings, vehicles, tools or maps, they never cease to impress me. The creative minds brought together by this game are truly something special, which makes the recent ToS disaster all the more sickening.TL;DR Cities Skylines is a masterpiece of a game, the king of the castle in the city-building genre, I cannot shout enough praise for it, however the recent issues with the new Paradox Terms of Service have tried to force players to accept unrestricted datamining on their computer, making the game a risk to the privacy of anyone who uses a computer with the game installed. Thus, if you want the game, save up your money and hold tight until this is resolved. It's a real shame this situation has arisen, and hopefully some closure can be reached in the near future."

It looks great, runs well, and does a great job in offering a variety of transit and building options.  The lacking aspects beyond some more services (such as libraries or museums from SC2K for example), are mostly in the fine details, as creating transit lines can get quite finicky, and having to manually demolish abandoned building becomes a chore with a large city.

I tried it for 20 minutes and couldn't stop playing after that. The biggest challenge is city traffic. I didn't have problems with anything except traffic. Traffic dictates what you do in your city: not only you improve your roads but also re-arrange your industrial and business areas. Cons of the game: - auto saves are turned off by default. I lost abut 2 hours of work(game progress) because of game crash.- auto saves when enabled only create one save file. Devs could learn from Factorio. - in-game twitter spams the same messages over and over and becomes annoying fairly fast. But that's a fun feature for beginners- doing curved roads is a pain. When I try to create a curved path from my city street to a highway it is so ugly. - Not enough in-game info on some problems. For example in late game my new industrial areas have no workers for them, but there is enough of residential area around. Forums help. Also the ""Not enough city services"" warning isn't helpful, I still don't know why it happens and how to fix. - It is not clear why vehicles on a 3-lane highway only use the middle lane and pile in a long traffic jam. - Lots of things in the late game need to be investigated on forums, there's not enough info in the game itself, and you wont be able to figure it out by yourself.Some lulz:- To unlock some government building I had to reach ""Average garbage piling of 40 per household"" milestone so I turned off all garbage trucks. That was a huge challenge for my city. Almost devasted it. Population size dropped by 2 times, lots of bancrupted buildings.- To unlock theater building I need to fully fill 5 cemeteries. And I figured this out when I had not a single cemetery but crematoriums all over the city."

In my opinion, its biggest problem is the lack of strategy. You might be confused;thinking ""but there are so many different buildings to build and factors to consider"". The thing is, every building, resource, and factor in the game does the same thing, which is attract more people. No matter what building you build or policy you implement, it does the same thing. Sure, one building might increase healthcare, but healthcare increases the population. The one element of strategy in the game (maybe, I don't have the best undesrstanding of it), where you need figure out how to most efficeiently get people around the city. In my opinion, this game is a cowclicker. I think the reason this game got such good reviews is because of its atmosphere. You get a sense of progress watching buildings go up, your population grow, leveling your city up. Its rewarding and fun, and the reason I have put many hours into it. In conclusion, if you want a very strategic and difficult city simulation, I dont think this is the game for you. If you just want to relax and see your city evolve, then you might enjoy this.Edit: There might be some other problems I didn't mention, but I just wanted people to know about the problem above."

I've played some city simulation games before, but nothing is like this one. Cities Skylines is very complex, but not too complicated to understand. It's exciting to keep up with what your city requires: houses, shops, factories, electricity, water supply, transportation, education and more! It does take quite a while to understand the game. When you get used to it, that's when the fun starts. The hardest part of the game is not what and where to build things, but how to maintain the people's happiness and well-being while the city expands.Pros: - beautiful graphics- detail-oriented- incredible gameplay elements- great and surreal sound effects- has many map choices with different difficulty- doesn't slow your game down when the city expands (another city-sim game I've tried does slow the game when the city is large)- achievements and card drop available.Cons:- No tutorial, so you just need to play and learn from the tip and try to experience by your own.

Hear me out: I've always avoided city building games like the plague because I thought they weren't my cup of tea. The free weekend came along and I thought ""why not?""... look at my hours now.Specific buildings of all types, colors and flavors, intersections, maps, different lighting settings, gameplay-altering mods... just about anything can be found in the workshop. Be warned though: using mods disables achievements.You might think a game like this is too complicated, but the truth is... it's not. Cities: Skylines is as complicated as you make it. Sure, if you're a beginner (like me), your first cities will fail, but that's exactly what makes this game so replayable: you learn by failing, and it's fun as hell.Rural town? Metropolis? European capital? Futuristic city? A replica of your town? As of now, they've released two expansions: After Dark and Snowfall. They'll release more, and that's good, but there's no way to buy a game+expansions pack, which means that no one knows the pricetag for the ultimate experience, and you might end up spending hundreds of euros in the game if they keep releasing expansions. You might think ""how is that a problem? If they release more content, I'll happily pay"". Well, look at . Would you pay 4,000€ for the full experience? I'm not saying Paradox will take the same route, but they could, and you should be wary.Cities: Skylines has quickly turned into one of my favorite games. I've always liked . This game is like having your own, but alive. I thoroughly recommend it."

This game offers a level of depth and complexity that is truly impressive, allowing players to create and manage their own bustling metropolis with ease.One of the things I love about Cities: Skylines is the sheer number of options available to players. From road layouts to building placement, there are countless ways to customize your city and make it your own. The game's intuitive user interface makes it easy to experiment with different ideas and see the results in real-time.Another standout feature of Cities: Skylines is its attention to detail. The game's graphics are stunning, with vibrant colors and intricate animations that bring your city to life. Whether you're watching cars drive through the streets or planes take off from the airport, there's always something to marvel at.But perhaps the best thing about Cities: Skylines is the sense of satisfaction that comes from seeing your city grow and thrive. As you unlock new buildings and services, your city will become more efficient and prosperous, attracting new citizens and businesses to your city. It's incredibly rewarding to watch your hard work pay off in such tangible ways.Overall, I would highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who enjoys city-building games. With its impressive depth, attention to detail, and sense of satisfaction, this game is sure to provide hours of entertainment for players of all skill levels."

But all you need to do is point and click when it needs them, and the effect is INSTANT. There is no prolonged penalties for no having them, if you forgot them? oh just click and problem solved, everyone's happy again. Nobody remembers a thing from yesterday.It's simply not challenging and not rewarding enough for a good simulation. Past a certain point you will literally be swimming in money with nowhere to use. And with every services everywhere you can simply AFK and turn off those annoying beeps notifications/tweets as they dont matter at all.And lastly those requirements for unique buildings are quite ridiculous, some of them requires you to literally ♥♥♥♥ up your own city to do the milestone. It's not exactly fun / interesting / challenging to do them (ie: citizen health under 20%, 70 000 people died off from that; or 1000 abandon buildings in the city, population dropped by 30 000) It's just there for the sake of ""achievements"".

And although I did not play with the newest patch released some days ago yet, most issues which annoy me are - according to patch notes - still there.When rating the game, I do so without mods. And without, the game gets pretty fast boring (for me) if you want more than just a ""build the prettiest city sandbox"". In my opinion mods are great for enhancing replayability or making smyller adjustments - but they should not become a necessity.And even though I had to think a long time about it, I still find my negative rating fitting.When I started playing it I really love the game:- graphics is not overwhelming but looking good, giving a nice city building flair- sound is soothing and does not get onto one's nerves- relatively good balanced progress- not feeling too fast or slow and I only seldom sped up the time- building/maintenance costs are fine- tax management simple but still ok- love how water/energy systems works (not too simple, not too much micro-management)- street system is doing good- district system nice, especially with the different resources for industry- actual water physics simulation! Building a hydro dam(n) needs real planning (and some testing, save your game ;) )Then I found some flaws; the in-game message chirper is kind of annoying (and badly placed btw), it's ridiculous to not being able to scroll with holding right mouse button, some view management is sorta weird and transportation volumes are not realistic.This is where the mods come in: for all those and more minor issues I found good working fixes in the workshop and from what I saw, some of the issues were fixed in the past, so in time you might even be able to go without them.But - here it comes - in the long run, the game does not fit my needs.In general it's too easy. After some harder times (in terms of cash problems) in the beginning, it gets pretty easy as soon as you get to use the high density zones. In my second city,   I had a plus of 10k+/week. Even though I kept building here and there and making everything looking nice, I was not able to spend my money faster as I got it.Up until then it is real fun. But from this point, it is making the game a bit too sandbox-like with the focus on ""how to make it look nice"" and without the hassle for careful planning how and where to expand the city.Besides this, there are some really down-bringing issues in the game, that get more un-nerving in the long run.These are mostly unrealistic behavior or balance issues:- Electricity production is a joke. From the beginning, wind-energy is in term of $/W not only cheaper than any coal or gas plant, but also non-polluting. As soon as you get the solar power plant, you don't have to worry about energy at all, as it is even cheaper. Also neither wind nor sun energy has differing output, like dynamic wind speed or clouds. So there is no reason at all to not build wind/solar plants- The resource system does not have a real depth: Yes, you can set specific districts for agriculture, ore, oil or forest industry. But besides more/less tas and pollution (and different buildings, obviously), there is no really meaning in that. Yes, you can use the oil for your oil energy plant, but why? Wind is still cheaper. And there is no big difference in export or anything, too.- While the water pollution system is nice, the land pollution is very very friendly. Have a coal power plant? Well, pollution only spreads about one-two blocks - after that you can build residences again.- AI for garbage and death care needs improvements. Death care: In larger cities (30k+), there are continually areas where dead people wait for transport to the crematory or grave yard - even if you have enough of them and they are not using all of their vehicles yet. Garbage: Trucks are working (yes, SC in your face :D ) but the system to send the garbage from a full dump to a incineration plant is not good. Even the old SC4 was working better in that case.- UI/views. I still cannot click a street and see who is going where, like SC4 rush hour -> this might improve the generally nice transportation system a lot!- The game lacks in terms of content: some areas (medicine) are great - others (power, industry resources, politics, tourism, ..) have too few buildings/possibilities.- Simulation is not realistic enough/goes not deep enough. Too easy power simulation, too easy fire/crime/medicine/education system, no real impact of industry/resource choices, etc.If you want to just build a nice city, go ahead. I had a great time so far with the game. Had to install a few mods for that, but with them it is fun for some time.If you expect a nice city builder simulation, maybe it's better to wait for a DLC/the next part. Seeing that the game seems to be quite successful in terms of sold copies, I guess there is a good chance for one or the other :)"

I don't buy products on Steam that use additional launchers.  I've had Steam for ages and reluctantly accepted its DRM and questionable business practices as a necessary evil for PC gaming -- but that's as far as I go.  And now, Paradox wants to force a separate launcher in order to run this aging game FIVE YEARS post release... the greed of Paradox never surprises me anymore.  A lot of people still don't understand why so many gaming companies always try to force more launchers on people.  Yes it's now more inconvenient and time consuming to start a new game, you'll be bombarded with advertisements for more Paradox crap before allowing you to play the game you already purchased, it's slower to load, and buggier (which I can all attest to first-hand). Yes it doesn't even uninstall after you uninstall Cities; you must know to uninstall this launcher separately or else it's on your hard drive forever, doing... ??? (classy).  Of course it'll also collect various private info about your computer turning the game into its own form of malware/spyware (this one literally logs your keystrokes according to multiple people who monitored the .exe), but none of this is even the worst of it.  The worst part is *why* they do all this in the first place:Exploitation.  Plain and simple.  The launcher exists to exploit you for your computer's information by collecting and selling it to whomever they please for marketing purposes.  It has zero benefit to us, and WILL exploit us for their financial gain.  Paradox now will have an additional revenue stream thanks to all our private information collected by this new additional launcher.  If they were being remotely fair about it, they'd at least now be charging us MUCH less for the game, its many expansions, and other DLC to compensate for all the money they're deceptively making off of their customer's backs.   As it is now they're just shamelessly double-dipping in profits, and doing so off OUR backs, their paying customers and loyal supporters AS IF THIS GAME WAS FREEWARE.Some people may be fine with this.  Some understand they're being exploited and tolerate it willingly.  Others are just gullible enough to believe it's fine because Paradox told them it is. ""This launcher is in your best interest!  Paradox isn't a business desperate for every nickel we can shake off your lousy hide, we're just your friend!""  But the rest of us have been around long enough to know better, have a shred of self-respect, and have to work for a living -- none of us appreciate this.  Unless this launcher is completely dropped (and I doubt it will be), I'm done buying Paradox products.  Friends and family I constantly talk into buying games will be steered far from Paradox games as well."

Even with the exploding population, their leader overestimated the cities growth and now the new jobs were having trouble finding people to fill them. In another attempt to fix a problem and with no land to make new homes, their leader tore down hundreds of homes and replaced them with high capacity living quarters. However. no one moved in. and now the balance was beyond repair and the city fell into debt.Now their leader fell into anger. He felt that his people were ungrateful for all that he had done to try and help them. It was then that he showed his true self.

Simcity 2013 was a major disappointment on all accounts.I have been fortunate to have been invited to test Cities Skylines' modding tools during the beta phase for the past couple of months. And during that time I have also been able to play the game. Cities Skylines exceeds my expectations. The potential that can be unlocked by the community and by DLCs provided by CO is unbelievable. I am absolutely overwhelmed by how great this game is. Additionally, I have gained the utmost respect for CO. It is unbelievable what a small team of creative people can do. Aside from developing a fantastic game, CO actually listens to the community to the best of their abilities.

Its very good as it doesn't force you to do anything, on your first city it gives you tips but in general they just leave you alone to play! Its quite realistic and has lots of ideas which you can relate to in the place you live. The new snowfall expansion is sounding very promising, released on 18 february! The after dark expansion is great, it doesn't add much for the price but adds a new element by adding the prison and taxi service. btw the after dark expansion doesn't add the day and night cycle, its already on the game.

Such a basic feature in a CITY SIMULATOR is slightly important to me personally. It makes road layouts horribly complex, requiring strange numbers of single-lane junctions splitting off main roads to avoid pile-ups on multi-lane junctions (where the AI simply forgets that more than one lane exists).Another irritation (not as big, but still there) is the focus on green energy. Yes, it's clean, but for some reason it's also way more efficient in this game than all the other power sources, so it creates a pretty big imbalance and leaves no choice.I probably wouldn't have made this review if I hadn't checked the store and seen the massive jump in price it's had since I bought it. Considering there's also an industry DLC being added (keeping in mind the game has terrible road transport which will heavily influence that sort of gameplay), I think I'll just drop this off my library for now."

Everything runs extremely well and cities feel legitimate and alive.The game does have some flaws here and there, yet it's still a very simple and straight to the point city builder with no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ attached. (DLC, DRM) It does takes quite a bit aspects from SimCity 2013 though (honestly a scary amount) but thankfully leaves all of the bad ones out. With regards to how it compares to SimCity 4 though, I'd say SC4 is still superior but just barely. Cities: Skylines offers a more simpler and easier yet less balanced economic system than SC4 did, which isn't necessarily a good thing. SC4 also had better information screens, the ability to modify landscape in-game, and doesn't have this questionable building unlocking progression. Also, I need to mention the lack of 'God' controls and commands such as disasters that SimCity 4 did have.But thankfully, the game has just been released and the dev team will continue to make updates for months maybe years to come and the modding community for this game is already phenomenal.Graphics: 8.5/10Audio: 8.5/10Gameplay/Replay-ability: 9.25/10Interface: 8.75Traffic/Simulation: 9.25/10Mod Support: 9.5/10Overall, I give this game a 9/10."
1010,ErickaUnlimited,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ErickaUnlimited/,37,,1,338.4,July,"10,","3,113",0,1,"Cities: Skylines is another contender in the city simulation/building management genre. It plants its roots among games such as Sim City and Cities XL to name a select few. What Cities: Skylines does is take those games, turn them upside down and offer a fresh new perspective on a dated genre. To say the game surpasses previous games of this type would be an understatement. The game pulls ahead of the race and never looks back. The developers wanted something new and exciting and Cities: Skylines has it in spades.The overall gameplay is much the same: you start out on a pre-defined landmass with a stack of cash and only your imagination standing in your way. It's your job to name your city, form your plan of attack and make your city thrive (or fail if that's your thing). Much like previous installments in the genre, you'll have your selection of various densities of residential and commercial business, as well as industrial zoning. Cities: Skylines adds to that, offering you the ability to specialize areas for specific purposes with city ordinances - farming and forestry, higher taxes, lower taxes, pollution control, heavy traffic bans, legalization of marijuana...you get the idea. Rather than just zone an area and let it grow, the game offers a deeper look in balancing out wants and needs of your city.Aside from zoning and city ordinances, Cities: Skylines delves into other noteworthy favorites: Emergency services, schools, recreational and public transportation (roads, buses, trains, airports...etc). While most items don't have much involvement aside from adjusting budgets, you are given the ability to create a multitude of transition lines and customize the stops, name them and change the vehicle colors. It helps keep everything neat and orderly.Where the game really shines is within its ability to create mods and custom assets that can be implemented into the game by the community via the Steam Workshop. This takes the vanilla game to a whole new level, introducing new buildings, cars, parks, landscapes to build on, monuments or something entirely brand new. Without the workshop, the game is still pleasant and quite enjoyable, but there is a lot missing in terms of diversity. The workshop gives you that diversity, practically slapping you in the face with it. It takes Cities: Skylines from a great game, to an outstanding game.Now, like all games, there is always room for improvement. While I feel the game is great and I've thoughly enjoyed my time playing it, I feel it falls short in some of the deeper city management aspects. Taxes, for example, don't often need adjusting outside a very fine line unless you want to go bankrupt or have your citizens moving en mass. Once you get your city off the ground, it's very difficult to ""lose"", if you will. You'll be making money hand over fist unless you crank up the difficulty, which then makes budgeting more of a necessity, especially in the beginning of the game, but less so later on as long as you don't do anything drastic that puts you in the red. Since there are no natural disasters as of this review, and fires are localized to just the building on fire (mods do change it so they spread), widespread epidemics aren't a threat, making the need to prepare all but nonexistent.I feel the game is wonderful for what it offers, but feels too easy at times. However, I don't feel any of those negatives negate the enjoyment the game offers. Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great city builder. It's something I had been waiting for since I played Sim City 4 into the ground back in 2004. If you're into the genre and looking for the right one, Cities: Skylines is, in my opinion, one of the best games out there at this moment. I highly recommend it."

Cities: Skylines is promising, but I'm not totally enamored with it. I feel bad for saying this because the people at Paradox Interactive seem like a cool group of people. I'm pleased it has done so well for them in such a short period of time. I hope it leads to further improvements! CO seems interested in gathering feedback on the forums.Skylines does many things right - ease of road construction, traffic modeling, and the city builder basics. By far the aspect I enjoyed most was building roads and watching the traffic. I don't get into the creative aspect of city building, so my contentment comes from overcoming challenges provided by a detailed simulation. I need to feel like traffic problems matter more than they do in Skylines. People should be mad when traffic prevents them from arriving at their destination. Businesses should shut down if their workers never arrive. I didn't really have money issues, which maybe would be solved by using the hard mode mod. It is a pretty beginner-friendly game, so don't expect a great challenge out of the box.I think creative types would get more out of the game then I do, and beginners to the genre are given a warm fuzzy hug. My negative comments aside, I do think it is the best of the 'traditional' city builder type of games - the new SimCity and Cities XL. It's also kept my interest longer than Banished due to the interesting road building in Skylines. By their nature, city builders can get repetitive and I don't have a high tolerance for that.I hope the game gets a lot of post release support, and Paradox has a great track record when it comes to that. Maybe after some updates my opinion will be a little more positive. My with more details is available."

All the ones that I actually like are pretty dated, and the older UIs usually prevent me from having any fun.  Cities Skylines is different.  Most the strategy comes from road building where traffic is your major enemy.  This makes prudent planning vitally important and means you can kind of skip over the micro-managing (if you wish, but there are plenty of options too).

IT'S VERY MENTALLY TIRING!! every time developers publish recent game updates, the mods break and broke the save game which I build in ages!Also, instead of improving the essential mods that the community build to become officially and stable ways to play, Paradox always publish recent updates which I think are not essential tools but like more beautification.

The only down side I have come across is lots of broken assets in the workshop. I do wish it would be cleaned up once and a while.

If the base game had included the DLC as updates I would completely say it's worth the price, but it's just not.Still a great sim, just milked by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company. So if money isn't a problem for you, great buy it. If you worry about money like most people you might find it hard to fork up $15 so you can have lights and tourism.

Make sure to do your research to try and get the DLCs you want, and try to buy the DLCs on sale. While the base game is great by itself though, it does have a few flaws, like poor traffic AI and awkward road building mechanics. I recommend trying out the base game for a little bit to get a good feel for the game before installing some mods like Traffic Manager: President's Edition.  Also, just get the base game.

You can say that this game is community called Sim City 5, because this is more of Sim City that Sim City 2013. It playes well, it runs well, maps are huge and expandable, it's sometimes hard, but as soon as you get used to it- you're good to go. Yet it lacks some non critical stuff, like terraforming in Mayor mode and day and night cycle. I really desire to see those implemented in future updates if that is even possible. Everything else is a mix of SimCity 1 and 4 with tons of cool additions, like districts, resource system, sound pollution, few new services, it's a great mix i must admit. Developers also care about modmakers, they supplied us with object editor, map editor and implemented steam workshop, this will give a huge lifespan to this game.

You must start by placing some basic road down first and then you have access to the Hydro and electrical Buildings as well as the growable zone markers. As your population increases more stuff is unlocked to “increase” difficulty, but the challenge usually starts after reaching 20k when the traffic starts because of bad planning. To grow your city you want to meet the growable buildings needs, such as parks, public transportation, emergency services, garbage and dead collection, etc.The game ends when you either go bankrupt, meet the scenario requirements or get board of the city you are playing.The game can be easily cheated with the asset creator, by creating buildings that cost nothing but are for lack of better words Overclocked. Then there of course the mods that can make the game harder or easier and many that make the game a lot more enjoyable. Many thanks to the modding and asset community.So my problems with the game is its over priced, it not that optimized, and I no longer want to support Paradox as a company any more, it has joined EA and several other companies in the Never buying a game from you again category.I would write more but lost my train of thought and this is more than enough for now."

The problem is: there's no challenge. Sure, there are the usual problems with traffic, but any of those problems are made by the player, not that the game tosses a wrench into the machinery. You don't even have the usual problems with pollution or disgruntled people, because as long as there is a pretty even mix between industry, residential and commercial zones with a park or two placed, no one will ever be unhappy - I even got a prize for the most beautiful city, and I didn't even aim for that - I just plonked down a couple of parks. The graphics is fantastic, the music fine and the sounds... kind of annoying, especially the sirens that you will hear a lot. There are no bugs that I can think of, so technically speaking, this is an awesome game, but only if you don't want to be challenged, just building a city. And for me, that doesn't cut it."

The economic simulation is extremely shallow and it is pretty trivial to make tons of cash and nearly max out the quality of all the zones. Every issue that plagues real cities is completely absent from this game, such as homelessness, poverty, corporations given tax breaks to move in becoming a services burden, farmers rights vs developers, etc. You can completely zorch whole districts and nobody complains and there is no popularity to keep up. There are no difficult scenarios where you have to make difficult choices to pull some city out of hell. There are districts you can make and assign different municipial laws to them and they sound important, but the only change some thing by 1~3% and are completely unnecessary for managing your city successfully. Even SimCity 3000 did this way better.This is more like a very easy to use CAD program for city scapes. If you have some city layout utopia you want to build up and take screenshots from tons of angles, and buy DLC to take screenshots while its night, raining, or snowing, go for it."

The vanilla game is, ok, but, Mods is where this game shines, as there are literally hundreds of thousands of assets to mess with. Having said that, not all of these things play nice together, so, you'll spend some time trial and error.Get the compatibility mod, as that will save you a massive headache trying to figure out what plays well with other mods and what doesn't. If you've got a good game going, add some assets, and your game bugs out, you can delete all assets from the marketplace, then go back to a save that you new worked, and it'll download the mods/assets used. Sadly, it'll only download 200 at a time, so, if you have 5000+ assets it's going to take a while starting the save over and over again (worth it though).You can also create collections to help save you time in the future, as well as follow your favorite content creators.All in all, it's a game I come back to over and over again, especially now that I have the perfect mix of mods and assets.

From the moment you start playing, you'll be hooked by the game's incredibly detailed world and its impressive scope.One of the standout features of Cities: Skylines is the level of customization available. From the layout of your city to the policies you enact, you have a remarkable amount of control over how your city evolves. The game also offers a vast array of building options, from roads and highways to schools and hospitals, allowing you to create a city that is uniquely yours.The graphics and attention to detail in the game are also outstanding. The landscapes are breathtaking, and the game's day-night cycle is truly impressive. It's easy to get lost in the game's world and forget that you're actually playing a game.Another impressive feature of Cities: Skylines is its challenging gameplay. Managing a city can be difficult, and the game offers a wide range of challenges to keep you engaged. You'll need to carefully balance your city's budget, keep your citizens happy, and plan for disasters like fires and earthquakes.In addition, the game's community is vibrant and active, with a wealth of mods and user-created content available to enhance your gameplay experience. Whether you want to add new buildings, create new maps, or modify the game mechanics, there's something for everyone in the Cities: Skylines community.Overall, Cities: Skylines is an outstanding game that offers endless hours of fun and entertainment. With its impressive level of customization, challenging gameplay, and active community, it's a must-play for any fan of city-building games. I highly recommend it!"

Most games nowadays use EOS to implement cross-platform multiplayer but Cities Skylines has always been a pure singleplayer game. If I have to be monitored by malware if I want to play a paid game, I'd rather not to play at all.The following is my original review.---------------------------------Out there you can find better and more exhaustive reviews than what I could possibly ever write so I'll keep it short and simple: if you love management and/or city building games, you owe to yourself to get Cities: Skylines, the best game of the genre since SimCity 2000 and SimCity 4. My own highlights:* Complete design freedom: if you can think about it, you can make it in the game. The game doesn't offer what you want to do? There's probably a mod for it in the Steam Workshop; if there isn't, you can easily make one and share it with all other players!* The best traffic simulation I've ever seen in a city management game.* Gorgeous graphics.* Cross-platform: Windows, Mac and Linux compatible.Why are you still here?

Bought this game on release day and had hours and hours of fun and watched the game growing in functions as the amazing Developer added more features into the game and put larger additions into dedicated (but thankfully not mandatory, except for some mods) DLCs for individual customization of the game.All of that worked perfectly and you could create your own personal dream cities and places you would love to live in. And with the mod support you could even add real existing landmarks and give your places the personal touch it needs. I always loved that and watching the traffic move and how people live their daily lives in their city was fascinating to watch. Seeing places evolve, grow and become your personal digital neighborhood.Heck even the day1 Mod support was always top notch and for over 4 years i loved this game to no end because of it's smooth and unproblematic integeration into the whole Steam eco system and even ran perfectly under Linux which was one of the main reasons why i bought it.However... Paradox, the Publisher, decided to ruin everything with the introduction of a own and completely pointless Launcher for this game.. So in order to play this 6 year old title now you need to create an additional account next to your steam account to play this game and to make matters worse, they did not even publicly announce this. It is to this day (May 23rd 2021) still not clearly stated on their steam store page and the install of the launcher is not even optional but mandatory. So in order to keep playing this 6 year old game now you have to sign up for an additional account and give away personal infomation even thou all of that was never needed and still in't needed as it does not add anything to the game at all because everything always worked through Steam. As it should.Even horrible companies like Rockstar or Bethesda announced their introductions of their launchers and clearly state that on their storepage. And those companies are beyond malicious. Let that sink in for a moment.And since Paradox clearly doesn't give a damn i cannot recommend this game anymore to anyone. Sorry, Paradox does not deserve your money. Do not make business with such a shaby corporation. I just feel sorry for the Developer as THEY are the ones who suffer from thisn idotic publisher behavior.The Moderator team of this game's Steam forum also censor every bit of legit criticism and pretend everything is fine and dandy and everyone loves these changes. The worst possible way to handle things and another proof how scammy and disgusting this publisher actually is.Nobody should be forced to simply accept this BS.So i say NO. I CANNOT recommend this game anymore.Publishers who retroactively force propriaritaty launchers with extra accounts, into older titles with patches should be expelled from Steam."

I highly recommend this to anyone with fond memories of any SimCity, as this is THE spiritual successor, and holds the crown in the community for best City Builder quite easily, IMO.Two main things to note:1) This game gets significantly better with DLC, especially Parklife, Campus, After Dark, industries, Mass Transit, and Green Cities...2) This game gets significantly harder to run with DLC... Especially on your RAM & Page File. You can easily play the base game, with around maybe 1-2 DLC on 8GB of RAM, but anything more than that and you'll completely consume your entire allotment of RAM, you're entire page file, etc...So while I heavily recommend this game, I also warn you to make sure that you have at least 16GB of RAM if you think there's even the slimmest chance you'll buy more than 1 major DLC."

1084,outlandking,https://steamcommunity.com/id/outlandking/,11,,0,12.3,January,"29,",66,0,1,The game now uses it's own launcher which is full of ads for DLC and overpriced microtransations. It requires authentication from their own launcher to play so it's now a huge pain in the butt for those that travel a lot. It also requires agreement to a bunch of end user agreements.Overall the game is decent but the corporate garbage around it isn't worth the hassle.

One thing I can say is the game is very bland and gets old quick without the DLC. I also dislike how much DLC there is and the price point for most DLC is pretty high for the content provided. But with that aside the mechanics are good and the game runs very well on my laptop as well as my desktop. With the DLC its a totally different game (even if you don't own them all). I recommend this game to anyone that enjoys games like Sim City and other modern city builders."

1095,Topperfalkon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/topperfalkon/,6,,1,73.4,March,"22,","4,709",0,1,"It's perhaps easy to see how Cities: Skylines has done so well, considering the failure SimCity 2013 was.I've played SimCity 2013 and Cities XL (not their latest iteration), but so far I consider Skylines to be a far better City Builder.SimCity got a hard rap for the online-only requirement, followed by a week of connectivity issues post-launch. The shame of this was that it detracted from an actually rather good simulator mixing challenges with creativity.Skylines has no multiplayer element, so likewise there are no weird online-only requirements. There are a bunch of available regions to start off in, each with differing amounts of available land and resources. When you start your game, you'll be presented with a highway connection and a basic guide to get you started, similar to other city builders. The game unlocks more tools as your population increases, making sure that you don't overbuild when your city is young. For the most part, all of these features are identical to other city builders.Where Skylines differs are the range of public transport available, and how they work. You can set up individual train lines, metro lines, and bus lines. This isn't a surprise, given that the game comes from the same team that developed Cities in Motion.One of the most interesting features I've experienced in the game so far is their water flow modelling. You start off having to place water pumps and sewage outflows into your nearest water source. However for rivers this means that you need to build your pump upstream of your sewage to avoid poisoning your population.Where it gets even more interesting is when you build hydroelectric dams. These dams will have a variable rate of power production based on the strength of the river it's blocking. Building a dam also has an interesting side effect; it causes the water level upstream of the dam to rise, which makes it really easy to flood your city if you're not careful. It's not something I've experienced in a game before. Oh, the game also lets you decide what side of the road your people drive on, which is a first as far as I know.This leads me on to some of my frustrations with this game. There's currently no option for terraforming an active city (as far as I can tell), which means that making flood-preventing earthworks is currently impossible. Likewise, thngs like road tunnels are completely missing from the game as well, although the developers have said these will be planned as part of a free update. It'd also be nice to have some better info overlays around road usage, as by far the biggest challenge in this game, like many other city sims, is dealing with traffic flow around the city. As an aside, it would be nice for one of these games someday to allow us to try out different junction types.However, by far the stand-out boon for this game is it's excellent Workshop support, which has already seen thousands of submissions in the short time the game has been avaiable, including contributions from the occasional former Maxis employee. I spent yesterday being captivated by a selection of highway interchanges by some dude in Germany (I think),  that's no joke. I could easily spend more time in the Workshop than the game itself, there's so much to see.The game was made by Colossal Order, but it's under the stewardship of Paradox Games. Given the game's success so far, it seems like this game will more than likely recieve plenty of support for years to come, with expansions and DLC being provided in a CK2 style, along with free updates and the like.+ Familiar city builder style, mixed with some novel public transport and water features+ No crazy online-only requirements+ Excellent Workshop support+ Its current success ensures it'll be well supported for some time+ Cheaper than Cities XXL now, cheaper than SimCity when SC was released- No obvious ability to terraform, making flood defences impossible- No ability to create tunnels limits road options or the ability to create tunnels under water bodies- Not as many features or items as other city builders, which might reduce effective play time.Honestly, at this price I have to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys city builders. It may not have quite the same number of features as other games, but the mod support means there's more than enough stuff you can add to the game until the first round of content updates start coming to keep you going."
1096,LoneWolf2056,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LoneWolf2056/,6,,1,44.8,March,"13,",386,0,1,"I have been waiting to play a more modern version of Sim City 4 for a long time and this game truly delivers, with the more modern and easy to read interfaces and overlays so you can very quickly spot areas that are lacking in services and tons of new features make Cities: Skylines an awesome city building experience.With a huge area to work with you are free to make a single vast sprawling metropolis or small interconnected towns, the ease of use and the space actually allowed me to use the curve and free form road tools as I didnt feel the need to pack everything in to a boring grid structure so my cities look a lot more interesting as well. Visually its a very colourful game with a really cool aesthetic that makes it a pleasure to look at from every angle, there are tons of little details in the city as well.There is even an almost puzzle solving element to the game, figuring out traffic. It is incredibly satisfying when you find the solution to your traffic problem and then just watching everything smoothly and quickly get around your city. I was amazed when I followed a Cim who walked to a train station, travelled to the next city over, got a connecting train, then a bus all to get to his work on the complete opposite side of the huge map. It is incredibly fun and satisfying just watching your city unfold in its daily business.While there are a few minor flaws and issues that could be fixed or improved, like the ability to hide or show only certain transport routes to make editing them easier, the fun and enjoyable gameplay completly blows any issues away. Future free updates are already promised and with modding support I think I will be playing Skylines for a long time to come.It's easy to quickly lose a lot of time and get completly absorbed in this game, absolutly fantastic, highly recommended."

What better way to teach kids the value of well funded schools?This game exists mostly because under the ownership of EA the Simcity series has really faltered.  Major technical issues and limitations and lost opportunities and hurt the series.This game is easy, much easier than any Simcity game I’ve played.  Some of it is easier because things just work better, like the water pipe systems.  The economics are just a lot easier.  I actually think this is  realistic.  I live in California, and here government funding isn’t really an issue, the issue is that throwing money at problems doesn't really help a lot.  Traffic isn’t an issue of money, it's an issue of  to do.  Same goes for crime, education, and especially , or even pollution.

It's very difficult to get all the DLC, but if you work hard you can get enough money to pay for the DLC. Unfortunately, you won't have any time left to play the game, with all the work you'll be doing to be able to afford all the DLC, and even if you did, you wouldn't be able to mentally keep track of the DLC you gathered, unless you're some sort of genius. So really, take this as a remedy to your gaming addiction. This is where the fun ends and responsibilities begin. I keep falling for this trap, where I think I want to feel like I did in the old days when playing the various Sim City games, only to end up disgusted at how much DLC this DLC simulator is packed with, and how any attempt at playing the game would just make me feel bad for not owning all the DLC. This makes me snap out of my delirium. I go read a book or watch a movie instead. The book doesn't force me to pay to know one of the characters names, or for that special chapter in the middle of the book, or for a map of the world that the author drew. Movies sometimes include deleted scenes, but even they are usually not essential and so in-your-face as this endless DLC. Eventually I always return to this DLC simulator, hoping, wishing it weren't so, and I see the DLC, piled on top of DLC, made out of DLC and turning the very essence of reality into DLC. Did I mention the DLC yet? DLC, DLC, DLC. DLC, DLC and DLC. It's an excellent DLC simulator. I no longer experience the game."

It's sold at a reasonable price, it has huge scope, & the modding community is awesome adding an enormous amount of content for free.I do have a few gripes however...Traffic becomes a real pain as your city grows. It becomes a major frustration trying to solve your cities traffic woes. Adding other means of travel has little effect as roads to & from your airports, harbours, & train stations often just moves the issue from 1 place to another. Trains themselves become a real headache as there's only 2 entrance & exit tracks on the map. The problem is that your cargo & commuter trains share the same track. You can split them once they enter your city, but they enter & leave your city on the same track. This causes them to back up which has a knock-on effect on the cargo & people aboard. Things are fine at low density, but as soon as you add high-rise high desity the traffic just really starts to go pair shaped.Another issue I found was the death rate. I don't know whether ibola is hitting my city, but whole blocks die off in a matter of in-game seconds. I live in a town, & in the 12 years I've lived there only 1 person has ever died. I keep pollution right down & clincs & hospitals abundant. It must be a balancing issue.All in all it can be a fun game, but as the city grows the game begins to irritate me.

1116,Sponge Platinum,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpongePlatinum/,10,,1,37.3,July,"5,",241,0,1,"I've never played a city simulation game before, but this one is apparently considered one of the best, and I had fun playing it. You can be anally involved in the tiniest details of traffic organization, or spend the entire game in god-view 1000ft above the city. At first you will mess up and make rookie mistakes in city planning, but helpful tutorials and obnoxious pop-up messages will have you learning quickly. There is a downside to being successful though. For the end game buildings (Monuments), you must build a variety of Unique Buildings, half of them only being awarded to you for being bad at the game. For example; high unemployment, massive trash buildup,  high crime, poor health, and many abandoned buildings. You must deliberately ruin your city to get these last buildings, which sucks. The rest of the buildings however, are simply unlocked from population checkpoints. When you're not worrying about handicapping your city, you'll be scratching your head on how to solve the various problems that crop up, two examples being trash and pollution. See, citizens need trash services, but these buildings only cover a very small area, and create pollution. Thus, you have trash burning facilities inside the neighborhood- which cause people to get sick from the pollution. No matter how many Health services you have near the area, people still get sick and die, and there's nothing to fix it other than by creating gaps where nobody lives. Now mind you, mods can fix these inconsistences, but the devs punish you for using any mods by locking you out from earning achievements entirely. In conclusion, Cities:Skylines is a competent and fun city sim. It has some problems, many of which can be fixed by mods, but in doing so you are not allowed to earn achievements. The progression in end-game is flawed, but the rest of the game is steady and engaging.Also, apparently the Deluxe Edition doesn't come with ANY of the DLC."

The game has so much content to offer so just let your imagination do the rest and build your own dream city. Besides, if you want to add even more variety you're always free to download mods and assets from the steam workshop. Things like unique buildings, props, vehicles and other additions will enhance your gaming experience by a huge amount. In my opinion, I'd say that the game isn't perfect but you can make it near-perfect by using different mods to fill the gaps. For example, the traffic management is so tricky and poor that sometimes you feel like playing traffic simulator but with the help of mods you can solve this problem much easier.The maps are enormous and can be increased in size even more via mods. It may take dozens or more hours to finish the city, especially, if you're making it look pretty and pay attention to small details and not just the population. Speaking of details, the game looks polished in high-up view and even while you're zoomed in all the way (or using first person camera mod).I've been nagging about mods the whole review, meaning, that the incorporation of workshop was the best approach to make this game by far the best city building simulator that you can currently get. But beware, having a lot of mods result in  FPS drop!"
1136,WooX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ironwoox/,5,,1,92.6,March,"20,",630,0,1,"this review is gonna be in 2 parts ( the game itself and comparing it to other City builders games)PART 1:  the game itself.Cities Skyline is a City builder game,  it runs smoothly  on  most machines but not on older ones or laptops , it requires allot of power to run. the game only have 1 mode which is build your own city.  u manage the needs of the citizens from electricity education and other services.  until you build a city big enough to expand and manage the traffics ...etcthe Price tag is acceptable for what the game offers. if u are new to these type of games its a good entire point. the end game is lack luster though but if u reached that level u alreay have inversted 40-60 hours inOverall its worth while. so I recommend it as it's the best city builder game available on steam.--------------PART 2 : Comparison to other city builder games. 1- SimCity5 (2013)the game UI is very similar which is nice, cause u don't need to relearn stuff from scratch . the game graphics in cities skyline is kinda better. but almost similar to Simcity.cities skylines have very Huge building area compared to simCity Which has some major Pros  and cons at the same time.what simcity was aiming at when they did give u small areas is to give the players more challenge on how to manage their city as u cannot build everything in one city thus increasing the replayablily  of the game. where in cities skylines u only need to build 1 city and manage it. there are no neighboring cities to interact with.also in SimCity5 have online multiplayer mode. as u can play with your friends making the best use of your cities co-op to build a huge workplace the benefit the entire region.unlike cities skylines the end game is lackluster. I only spend playing  40 hours and already built everything in the city reached the final stage and have no problems with my city. only build cemeteries all over the place.only real issue with simcity5 is their launch disaster .[so the final verdict is that simCity5 is far more superior version than cities skylines]2- cities XL at first i thought this is another installment of that franchise . but i was wrong.  if we look at these 2 games Cities XL is way more complicated than this game. overly complected and their UI is messy  unlike cities Skyline where it runs more smoothly than that game. Cities XL do not offer expansions of the cities but gives you Huge area to play with. u can still interact with other cities using Token system.  but beyond that nothing els.from my experience with both games I prefer Cities: Skylines over Cities XL series."

Even for the simplest of task like disabling that annoying chirper, or disabling fog so you can clearly see your city, or adjusting ambient sound, mods, mods, mods...

Apart for the fact that you need a mod for lane selection so you can force that behavior, said AI chose to circle the roundabout than to take the preselect road...-low performance: I'm at 4790k, 16gb ram, rx480 4gb and I play at 1080p.

You know, it's fashionable to sell your users data nowadays..I know I tried, with 464 hours on record you cannot say I haven't tried, I hoped it would be the Sim City we never got. But it's to damn much frustration, especially if you're in the dads with little kids and too little self time category, like myself, who want to build something nice, not picture-like cities polished in and out like the ones built by youtubers with too much time on their hands, but ...nice.

I haven't been so addicted to a city building game since Cities XL & SimCity 4. The Modding Community is nothing short of Brilliantly Creative, with so much stuff to choose from in a relatively short amount of time since the games release last March.There's so much of an area to build upon that you just can't stop yourself from creating a Utopia of your dreams, and the graphics are very nice, but better when Modded. The soundtrack is soothing, and I like the environmental sounds too. You can rename just about anything in the game from Buildings to Cars to your Cims. Speaking of Cims, there's a ""First Person View Mod"" out, that will let you go to ground level, and ride in a car, or walk around. It's perfect for touring your city, or just getting that ""Up Close & Personal"" view.One thing that this game can use is a proper Day/Night cycle that Cities XL & SimCity did very well. There is a Mod that does this, but that too needs to be better. Buildings don't light up at night, and the night doesn't last too long. This is a feature that a Big City man like myself wants so badly.So treat yourself to this the next time it's on sale! It's worth the regular price too, if you find you can't wait for a sale, and eager to play it.My Mod Collection is listed below in 6 parts to make it easy to find what you want.

1156,MCSpaceWolves,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MCSpaceWolves/,5,,1,298.8,February,"7,",181,1,1,"Well, where do I begin? This game is a piece of art. The molding, modeling, and overall feel of creating your city are amazing. The intricate roads, traffic, and demands system really bring a new depth to the game. Along with aspects of rush hour, weekends, day-night cycles, and even services depending on the very complex network of roads, rails, and the subways that you set up. This game has it all. It even charts, tracks and gives each person on the street a different life. Where to go, jobs, housing, and income. Taxes that are affected by not only what you have but also land value and more.  The Game has so many aspects and complex things alone. Once you add mods and DLC the feeling it gives is unreal. when playing this game I feel less like a player and more like a god. Being able to build, design, and progress a city to the point where it feels like your own masterpiece. It even has complex aspects of mixing industry between residential areas to allow for better commute times, employment, and even efficiency. Then there is the polices aspect of the game, a great way to manipulate a certain section of your city, by breaking them into a district and adding rules and regulations. Along with these aspects come the facts that your city grows at the pace you play. Using taxes and other methods one can lower raise and even steady the demands and flow of people into your city. Now thought the thing that tops this all and adds the absolute best aspects of this game is the physics. We are talking real water physics hear you can flood your city not by just magically raising water levels and it appearing but by water actually flowing, evaporating, and moving in waves. That is just the water thought there is even wind speed, direction, and temperature. These all affect the game as a whole. Wind can actually move pollution to certain areas. Thie effect both the water and the people. If water becomes polluted upstream it effects everything you have downstream. All this stuff together is still just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to this game. So now here begs the question should you buy this game. YES YES AND YES. This game is worth every penny. For a city building / God game it is one of the most complex, aesthetically pleasing, and fulfilling game out there I give this game a 4.5 out of 5 stars. Now you might be asking wait where is that other .5 start well there is one shortcoming of this game. The rate at which it crashes. It needs some optimization and fixes overall. Especially when it comes to CPU and ram usage. I have an eight-core processor with 32Gs of ram and the game still takes a hit in the AI area. It also uses none of my RAM and runs on only a single core. However, if these things do happen to get changed in the future  I would be more than ecstatic to change my rating from a 4.5 to 5 out of 5 Starts."

But I'll say that this game is a lot of fun if you have the extra money to spare, otherwise the predatory DLC make me sadly give this game a Do Not Recommend. This game is a very par game on its own, and I think what made it stand out so much is because it is the successor to the disastrous Simcity 5. If you're looking for the best city simulator on its OWN look at the SimCitys from the 2000s. C:S uses the standard Paradox DLC model: make the base game just playable enough to the point the player seeks things that really should have been in base game. Parklife, After Dark, Industries, Mass Transit, maybe Natural Disasters are probably the only DLC that were worthy in my mind. All the others are overpriced and don't add much to the game. And then there's mods. The saving grace of this game. Mods fix almost everything. Low FPS? Fixed. Fix traffic? Done (well, make it work better). Better assets than vanilla C:S? Yes. The Workshop is seriously the only thing that allowed me to make a city I actually liked looking at and felt realistic. But the Workshop also showed how thin C:S really is. Same buildings over and over again, almost all looking weird and out of place. Traffic takes the quickest route possible, cuts off each other constantly, police and ambulance travel ACROSS the city to reach a destination that has an emergency building right beside it. Huge performance issues after around 50k people. A lot of these issues can be fixed with mods, however C:S on its own is rather disappointing. Personally I'd wait to see what C:S2 has to bring, or get this game on a big sale.  Do I have fun with this game, yes, with mods (especially fun with the multiplayer mod).  I'm gonna give the game a 6.5/10 on its own, and a 8/10 with the right mods. Like I said before, buy this game on sale if you want it."

It is extremely enjoyable, even more with mods, but if you want to unlock everything in a legitimate way you will need to give it some time and plan your gameplay well in order to unlock the unique buildings, etc.I do not own all DLCs. They are too expensive to buy all at the same time. You should better buy the game and DLC's when it is reduced. Unfortunately, the discounts only from time to time go lower than -50%. Sometimes you can buy something for -66%, but it won't be any of the newer DLC's.Graphics are great, you can zoom it and enjoy the really detailed view of the city (I would recommend doing it at night what makes this game looking just beautiful - you will need Afterdark DLC though - highly recommended regardless of cosmetics as it adds tons of content to the game).You can play it well on relatively old PC, even older laptop with dedicated graphics should make it (lowering details is highly recommended). Even dedicated budget laptop cards (like GeForce MX150) can do well, but I would recommend at least the 4 core CPU. The only real problem I encountered and which is really annoying is the management of deceased citizens, what can make your life really hard when your city is big enough (I would say it can be difficult for new player over 50,000 citizens and without smart decisions it is a real challenge when your city grows over 150,000). There are the ways to overcame it of course, but you will learn it with getting more experienced.Similar problem applies to garbage collection but it is muuuuch easier to fix, expecially with Green Cities DLC (or mods).I would add some content to it as there are some aspects that could be done better - more buildings! - but Steam workshop provides dozens of addons for free. If would be nice if Paradox made use of gamers suggestions (and mods ideas) to add content to their game for free or at least cheaper than usual.The game is extremely enjoyable and the more time you spend with it the more you understand it and every new city you build is more complex and governed better.Regardless of some issues, I can honestly give this game 10/10 in city builder category (8,5/10) for every other gamer, especially strategy fans."
1166,TooZooted,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ICOUNTMONEEEEEEEEEEEEEY/,7,,1,163.8,February,"17,",74,0,1,"Summary: Cities: Skylines is possibly the greatest city builder ever made, but that does not make it perfect. As stated in the summary of this review, I do think that Cities: Skylines is one of the greatest city builders ever made. There are a lot of small details that make this game a cut above everything else, and the level of detail put into the environment and the lives of the people in your city make this game the most detailed city builder ever made. Surprisingly, this game runs beautifully despite this insane level of detail and very pleasing graphical design. There is a lot of replayability in this game, and you can easily sit down and lose track of time taking care of your cities. These factors alone make this game a recommendation for me.However, despite being one of the best games in it's genre, Cities: Skylines has a lot of problems. My first issue with this game is something that the developers love to bring up when talking about this game: the traffic simulation. Generally, the simulation is pretty good, but cars will almost always run into each other, and cars are happy to change 3 lines at once and stop all traffic along a road right before they need to turn off of a road. I have had 4 lane freeways rendered useless because cars will all jam up into 1 or 2 lanes, leaving the left 2 lanes completely empty and the right 2 lanes completely clogged up. Thankfully, because the developers support the modding community, there are mods to help fix some of these issues, such as mods that allow you to customize what lanes cars are allowed to go into at certain areas of a road, and mods that allow you to remove unnecessary traffic lights at an intersection. The simulation is pretty good, but not perfect.Secondly, I think the DLC's cost too much money and do not provide much content to prove worthy of the $13-$15 pricetag. This isn't a big issue, as the base game is so cheap and regularly on sale, and content such as the day/night cycle are added to the base game, but I wish the DLC could just be cheaper or provide more content. My final issue with this game is that, at least in my experiences, the game is not fun to play unless you are in Sandbox Mode and have Unlock All/Unlimited Money on. The roads, buildings, and utilities that the game let's you start with are so small that you pretty much have to build an ugly ""money generator"" every time you start the game to keep yourself from going bankrupt and having to restart from scratch. The starting cash of $70,000 is nowhere near enough money to get yourself going, and I have found myself at balances of $10,000 after building all the essential roads/infrastructure of an ugly ""money generator."" From there, I just have to wait until I have enough funds and people to where I have unlocked all of the core roads/utilities/buildings and to where I can actually design a good looking and functioning city. Going into a sandbox game with several mods installed has been my favorite experience while playing this game. This being said, the developers have made a great move by adding Steam Workshop support and an in-game asset/terrain editor. Accepting the modding community is one thing that has made this city builder so much better compared to terrible city builders such as the most recent SimCity. You can find new roads, new buildings, new maps, new themes, and pretty much anything else you could ever want, on the Steam Workshop. The community has really accepted this game and helped improve it from it's already great state. Therefore, despite my negatives said above, I recommend this game to people who love management games, to people who enjoy city builders, and to people who generally have a lot of time to spend tweaking, creating, and restarting cities."

1179,SkyeRangerDelta,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pldynEOL/,5,,1,111.7,November,"3,",523,0,1,"Cities: Skylines is an utterly fantastic game. Paradox to this day has still never failed to deliver a great game. C:S as I will be calling it in this review is by far the greatest city-builder in it's genre. The realism of the game's details is striking and the way you handle your city's economics is not hard at all. Some people (like myself) will compare this to SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow, and at this point it's safe to assume the C:S has blown it out of the water. I'll put it here in bold: . The last EA game that I consider any good at all, was SimCity 4: Deluxe Edition. I've never throughoughly enjoyed a game that was produced by EA after that.Now C:S; yes, there are DLC's. Yes, they are paid for; but here's the beef on that. The base game is so good that the DLC's are out there to futher customize your city. And not cosmetically (essentially), I'm talking like, take for instance Match Day (which is the only free one at this point), it adds a Soccer stadium to the game. Yes it costs alot, yes it looks cool, and yes it actually does something. Your city must be able to handle the traffic flow of people coming in to see games in the stadium. The game events will cause massive influxes of money, but you have to be able to handle it. Point is, the DLC's in this game are useful (except maybe Snowfall, which has a heck a'lot of snow).The eccentricity of C:S compared to other games is incredible. Here I will discuss how and why it is. C:S offers many, many game mechanics that were never seen in previous city builders. One blatent example is the Steam Workshop. C:S has the ability for the community to create new content for the game and upload it so that others can incorporate it into their cities as well. Yes, SimCity 4 had assets (and dependencies, ahhhhhhhh dependencies), but you had to go through all the generic troubles of installing through directories and have the right dependencies (AHHHH). In C:S you check a box. Boom.C:S in-game mechanics include real-time water. I love this feature. I think it's one of the best mechnics in the game. SimCity 4 has water, but it doesnt...really....move. C:S does, and it moves! If you build a dam for hydroelectric energy, you better make sure that it was placed properly because (coming from personal experience) if you don't, and the water level behind the dam surges up and over the river banks and into your city and suddenly you lose half the populous of your city and then there's like no money, and a crap city, then oh well, you done did bad. That is what makes C:S so good. Your decisions make a direct impact on your society (not to say that you can direclty place this kind of house on this kind of zone (and correction, that is possible through assets in the Steam Workshop)).I don't think it's possible to right a review on this type of game without saying that there is quite a bit of a learning curve. C:S has a pretty big learning curve. Each city starts out with 2 highway connections. 1 incoming, and 1 outgoing. The way to plan this first part of your city will be your money maker. If you plan it badly, then your traffic will cause you some headache when you go to fix it and the placement of certain buildings like medical facilites and schools will make you lose money when you discover that they were placed in an area that won't let you upgrade a road, or something of that nature.Keeping on with the learning curve and moving into traffic. Traffic is another animal in this game. Yes, you have to worry about the flow of traffic in your city, becuase if your incoming traffic is being clogged up with trucks and what not becuase they are making this crazy turn in an intersection, it's safe to assume that you can change that into something more useful. The flow of traffic in your city needs to be carefully managed. Traffic is money. Outgoing goods from your industry earns your city money. So does incoming goods to commercial zones. You need to have an efficient route through your city if just passing through and so forth. C:S has spent a good amount of time developing this system and I have to admit, I'm still a little flumouxed on getting certain parts of my city to flow like they should.Last section in mechanics I want to talk about. Land Value. Ever since release, Paradox has added some amazing and cool looking things into the game. Canals for instance (yes, there are canals, and quays (keys), and other environmental tools) will provide a serious land value bonus to an area. The more desireable the city, the more people come, and the more people come, the more money you make. It's a very pleasing sight to see all that green in an area after you plop down a canal and the water is in there (not overflowing into your city as I have had before). The enviornmental set itself is a very intersting tab. Say you are designing a city not for the heck of playing the game, but because you want to design the most cool looking city you can (and you can, with the infinate money mode (screw the citizens!)), take ""Strictoaster"" on YouTube for example. He is a urban designer, that not only does it as his job, but in games such as C:S (his favorite) and Planet Coaster. His work is phenominal. It's a real testiment to the powerful game that C:S is.C:S is incredibly detailed. If you were to zoom in all the way onto a road, you could see the minute rocks and pieces of stuff that goes into making a road, IN THE ROAD. When it rains, there is flowing water on the sidewalks, and roads. Citizens will pull out their umbrellas and hats (some are caught off-guard and pull out a newspaper over the head). Not to mention the nighttime graphics. I think the best time a city is in the full screenshotting glory (unless you have a beefy computer (That is, better than this one I have)), is at night. The towering lights of skyscrapers, orange glows of the avenue street lights, and the sky-shining lights of suspension bridges over heavy waters. All of that is just incredibly well designed.I will have to throw this in there. C:S does require a bit of a good computer to get the game looking good. Playing it on a 1.4GHz i5 with integrated intel HD 5000 graphics doesn't do much for you (saying that from experience after looking at longer loading times, trees that look like pieces of plastic, and distance rendering that looks like blobs of paint on a box). I would suggest you actually read the system requirements to get the game running.C:S is a city builder. The sheer amount of time you spend refining your city is enough to keep me realing on one map for weeks. C:S has an infinate amount of hours in it. Theoretically, as long as you don't get bored of it. As soon as you've spent that 3 month period on a city, and you have that feeling that you've done your best and it's done, you can simply start up a new one. On a new map. Or a community created one.Mechanics: 8/10Visuals: 9/10Gameplay: 8/10Quality over SC:CoT: 10/10**Thanks for reading that, that's the longest review I've ever published. :P"

With the release of Simcity (new one) my anticipation didn't get satisfied, but I got more impatient instead. Because new Simcity was nothing I was waiting for. After a decade Simcity 4 was still a better game then the new one. However, one stormy night I was crawling in the river ""city simulation"" tagged games in Steam and I found a gem; Cities Skylines. I bought it with a discount and started the play immediately. The only think first couple of hours I felt was a huge regret... The regret that I DIDN'T FIND THIS GAME EARLIER!After playing 250 hours, sleepless nights and wasted weekends I still couldn't master in this game. Traffic is still a ♥♥♥♥♥, my Industry still cannot thrive, I have zillions of dollars but I'm still not satisfied!.. I recommend this game to anyone who remotely likes city simulation games.

1189,Staryn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/,5,,1,31.6,June,"30,",575,0,1,"This is the modern SimCity.  Plain and simple as that.  It does suffer from Paradox's overwhelming DLC policy, however.  Unlike SimCity, I noticed that getting the city started is easy.  People will flock to the city very quickly, compared to that old game.  For the most part, the game play is the same, you lay down roads, zone residential, commercial, and industrial zones, and make policies.  Try to make more in taxes than you spend.  But Cities Skylines adds a lot more to that.  To start, the road management is very in depth.  You can name your streets, decide where they go, you can make one-way streets, different lane sizes, road types, decide on where to put stop signs and traffic lights, so on.  It might be my favorite part of the game, and it is influenced by the previous Cities games, Cities In Motion 1 and 2.  Another great feature are districts. You can define a certain area as being a district, with its own name and policies.  A smaller part of the city.  This lets you control individual areas better.  It also comes into play with industries, such as agriculture.  If you want a farm, you need to create a farming district.  In what's become a standard feature of Sim games, you can see individual citizens and click on them, to see their names and details about them, like where they live.  If you liked SimCity in the past, this is its proper successor, no question.  It does what a sequel should - smooths out the original gameplay, then builds on it."

In my opinion, it would have been wise if the developers had made buildings that looked more realistic as base buildings and less garish, then fewer mods would be required. Now, however, with each update I find that with about 200 assets/mods downloaded, one will always corrupt my files. This is so very annoying, I feel as though I waste my many hours given to this game if it all gets corrupted. And the answer isn't as simple as ""don't play with mods."" Quite honestly, the game is pretty much crap without mods. It's flat and lackluster as it isn't much more than boring and repetative tasks with few rewarding acheivements (buildings and the like) or gameplay progression. Frankly, a rework of the base buildings pack is in order. We've seen what this game capable of - meet that expectation Paradox. All things considered I have definitely enjoyed many hours of this game (500 hours or something crazy) - I'm a pretty devoted fan, but I'm starting to feel dissapointed. Haven't tried it yet, but the Mass Transit expansion seems like a great move. Regardless, the game is worth a try.

It was mind-blowing.In fact it was a concept that rocked so hard that the Los Angeles based Guns N Roses (the ""One Direction"" of the late 80's*)released a song to celebrate its greatness called Paradise City.*(*These facts may be erroneous and are awaiting citation.)So now we've witnessed the city building ""big bang"" we need to get out of here before the Libyans find us.It's time to go back, not to the future, well to the future of the past, but not the future of the present!  (I love time travel!)It's 2011, One Direction have just released their first album (One Direction rose to popularity to fill the gap in the time line left by Guns N Roses who may or may not have gone missing during the alien attack on Los Angeles in 2010 as depicted in the documentary ""Battle Los Angeles"" **)(** Almost certainly true but citation is pending.)Another important event of this time period was the release of ""Cities in Motion"".An excellent little  transport simulation game by Colossal Order which had you placing bus stops and metro stations across little city maps then sitting back and watching the ensuing commuter nightmare as your ineffective planning came to light.My own gaming limitations aside, this was a gem of a game and left me wishing that I could manage the city development around the transportation network I was building.It's back up to 88mph again, a flash of light later and we're in 2013.The Monstrous  Sea Creatures emerging from the ""Pacific Rim"" have failed to take out ""One Direction"" and in a desperate attempt to free our airwaves from the ironically titled ""Best Song Ever"" Disney released a counter attack by way of Princess Elsa begging these Guns N Roses replacements to ""Let It Go"" ****** This information may be slightly inaccurate as I fell asleep during Pacific Rim and went outside to ""build a snowman"" shortly after Frozen started.The other big news of 2013 was the release of Cities in Motion 2. The BIGGER is BETTER sequel to the previous transportation sim. It was prettier, the maps were much larger and your transportation decisions would impact city growth.Whilst still only a transport sim and not a city builder this was another great game in the franchise.The other, other big news of 2013 was the release of SimCity.Yes I know we started our time travelling journey witnessing the birth of SimCity back in 1989, but it seems that,  despite spawning 3 sequels over the interceding years, a meeting was held by shady men of power where they discussed what they could possibly call the next game in the SimCity Franchise.They'd already had SimCity, SimCity 2000, SimCity 3000, SimCity 4 (I assume they'd dropped the three zeros because they thought their audience incapable of counting up in 1000 increments any further.....)  so they came up with SimCity 5.I speculate that It was at this point one of them decided that the One Direction haggled minds of the current generation could not be expected to count all the way to 5.... so they decided to drop the number off the game title all together and SimCity was reborn!And what a rebirth it was, not since Elsa had taken off her gloves and started freezing everything she touched like a frigid version of Gold Finger had such outrage been  seen.You had to be online all the time to play the game,  their servers were overloaded so you often couldn't play at all! (both of these issues were fixed later)  but most importantly, the maps were tiny, tiny things with very little room for the one thing this game was supposed to be about, City Building.It's time to charge the flux capacitor one last time, we're going home!It's 2015, Not content with their domination of the airwaves, One Direction are on tour.A public warning has been issued labelled  ""On the Road Again""The announcement includes the groups  whereabouts and an anticipated timeline to allow the general public to avoid several high risk locations, which are often large venues where people would normally gather, despicable.Anyway,  the Bigger news of 2015 is that the city builder is back!You wait for years for one to come along and then two arrive at the same time.Firstly we've had the release of Cities XXL, a competent  city builder in its own right, but much like many of One Directions songs, it's almost an  exact copy of what came before it.This hasn't gone down well with people already exposed to that particular franchise, if you've heard one song, you've heard them all, right?And now we have Cities Skylines, but is this the salvation of the city building genre we've all been hoping for ?When I first fired up Cities Skylines I was immediately filled with disappointment.It was pretty, it seemed to have all the features I could want in a city builder, but the map size was tiny, SimCity 5000 tiny.The same white dotted line marked out the edges of the postage stamp sized buildable area as I'd butted against in SimCity so many times before.... but I was wrong!You can't imagine my relief when I realised I could purchase new plots of land to expand my fledgling  metropolis.The map is in fact huge, you can buy and unlock land to expand out not only in ""One Direction"" but in which ever direction you choose!I swear I've never felt such relief when playing a game before.It was like finding out that Guns N Roses hadn't really been taken down by aliens, It wasn't only an amazing discovery, it was a game changer!As you would expect from a developer who's previous titles have been transportation management sims, the transportation mechanics in Skylines are excellent.You can place bus stops, set up bus routes, implement a tube system, play with trains and even boats. The public transport system is so fully realised and well implemented I really can't fault it.Roads aren't neglected either.There's plenty of choice between different road sizes, one way systems, Yes, you can set streets up so cars can only go in ""One Direction"" (Best Pun Ever*) , roundabouts etc. All there waiting to help solve your traffic problems by way of substituting them with the problems of noise pollution instead.(*Best Pun Ever, may have been the  hidden bonus track released by the unexplainably popular boy band - reports are unconfirmed but it does seem to relate to the noise pollution issue). <snip>( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit  )"

Speaking of which: The scenarios you can play (certain maps with special challenges) are really fun and indeed rather challenging.Graphics and Music really fit well into this sweet game. If you like building, building and yes: building (trial and error included) and always wanted to manage a city (like in the old Sim City games), then go for this one! Its really worth it, even at full price. During a sale I cannot imagine anything to stop you from purchasing :)So far, this game has always been stable and even on my older machine the performance is very good. CONsTraffic has some issues (behaviour of cars and trains), but what the hell, you learn to deal with it.DLC's are a bit too expensive imho, but someday there will be a sale for them too, I guess. Nevertheless they are a real bonus to the basic game and I definitely want to have all of them someday ;)CONCLUSIONIf you like drowning in an atmospheric simulation, where always at least some small things are waiting for you to get fixed or built, rebuilt or optimized - this is the game you probably want :D"
1226,⎝MuX⎠,https://steamcommunity.com/id/paythebills/,4,,1,57.0,September,"2,",449,0,1,"I have been playing city builder games since, I was 10. And, I played Simcity 4 the most - sucked at it but, well, I was a 10 years old with zero English knowledge. I, also, bought and played SimCity (2013) and I really enjoyed it. The multiplayer, content, and easy to play, It was fun to kill time with my friends on it. Yet, with all those ""city boundaries"" and lack of any challenge. I found myself staring at Cities: Skylines while holding my innocent wallet. I had to think twice while buying the game as I witnessed many Paradox Int. games with hell lot of DLC that even costs more than the game. Well, I bought it and I found it OK.  Game comes with: Support; It's awesome to have modding since, It brings much more content and increases lifespan of the game. I find modding essential and I extremely recommend Fine Road Tool, Auto-Bulldoze, Precision Engineering, and Penguin's Transport Realism Project. Obviously, It's a city builder game. Traffic (road building gives you cancer), health and pollution (I lost a whole city to damn germs), education (being a dummy makes you set stuff on fire), crime (relatively easy to deal with)  and much more. Building public transport network carefully is essential, randomly placing stops will only bring more traffic and chaos. That being said, even though I don't have it, I recommend checking out Mass Transit DLC, or just get MODDED!  Like, physics. The game got somewhat nice water physics but, lacks air/wind, which are included in SimCity (2013). When you build a dam you have to make sure your city won't get flooded and your dam gets good amount of waterflow through it, otherwise your city becomes a ruin, and if water flow changes direction, your damn becomes nothing more than an expensive bridge. Not having wind physics makes it easier to build industrial zones, you don't worry about air pollition poisoning your far away citizens.   The game normally does not have day and night cycles and guess what! DLC FOR DAY AND NIGHT CYCLE (After Dark DLC)! Which sucks even more. Unlike the SimCity, the game time is based on just Days/Dates instead of hours and days. So, you get a poles-like day and night cycle. Natural Disasters, also, comes with a DLC but, well, not everyone recommends getting that DLC. The game itself is a superb sandbox. You start with a huge area to build and within time as your population grows, you get access to surrounding regions. Giving you more space to work on, you can plan your citys future expansion and maybe even create remote towns - buildings scale according to the road they have built next to and the space allocated to them so, you won't get skycrapers on your peaceful countryside. You can even build a second or a third city but, unfortunately, game only recognize them as a whole unlike in SimCity (2013). Still, you can govern them individualy by using the district tool.It would be cool to have a ""City Differentiator"" and multiplayer. There can be Multiplayer Compatible Maps with (assuming there is 20 squares) 5 squares assigned to each player or just like singleplayer but, with planning/drawing tools and more intellectual people. Imagine connecting your city to your friends' by building half of a bridge as s/he builds the other half, or carefully planning and building a whole city with your friend(s). BTW, It's not a country/state simulator so, different cities might have been a stupid idea.There might be some features I'm missing as I only played the game for 33.3 hours. I haven't slept for two days so, expect hell lot of lingual mistakes.  I can update this review later when I get a proper PC that can handle the game properly :S Thank you for reading so far."

The game is chock full of bugs that have never been fixed (you can find plenty of help in forums going back many years) because they are too busy making DLCs to sell you rather than making sure the base UI actually functions consistently.

It looks decent and can run reasonably well on a modern pc. ;) The gameplay is rock solid, diverse, highly mod friendly (The workshop is fully of ass kicking custom assets and welcome additions like the resolution upscaler) and still manages not to overwhelm newcomers. Forget games with XXL in their title cuz Cities: Skyline really delivers! Period. No, srysly ... there is no other city builder besides Skylines. This is the SimCity we all wanted a couple years ago, for just a fraction of its price. And by the way, their small DLC offers are completely fair - add meaningful content and are completely optional. Like the trams they added in Snowfall - its cool, nice to have - but totally not required for even the largest city. So far I had a ton of fun  ;)Update 05/2017: Regarding the harsh critique of the pricing of the various DLCs, the Colossal Order makes sure that every major DLC also adds free features. In fact the latest offering, Mass Transit, overhauls the road and transport line UI pretty substantially. A release price of 13€ is preeetty fair, considering there are always unique additions to your core game play. However, performance issues on higher end rigs still persist - which is a real shame. Still, there is simply no alternative to C:S - at least not when you want a city SIMULATION and won't be satisfied with placing nice looking extra police cars to your massive city that is =)"

The districting tool is fantastic and adds a new element that really makes your city yours.  The city details are every bit as good as SimCity 5, but the game is smooth as silk, and the maps are far larger and even more visually appealing.   No stupid patches every time I log in or online always requirements here.  I cannot wait to see what the community is going to create for this game.  The only negative I see is that sometimes there are mismatches between building names and what they look like (e.g. a laminate floor factory is named ""Burger World"" etc.).  The interfaces are intuitive and slick, and the city progression will keep any gamer interested in pursuing city growth to higher and higher limits for days if not weeks.  Nice work here all around.

Today i will be reviewing the city simulation game called Cities Skylines.Being a player and user of many simulated games in my long time playing simulated city games, i found this one to be great. I love the atmosphere of it and the building in it. In my opinion, it is not too hard like i found some A-Train simulator games, but not too easy either, like city life simulators. It is right in the middle of difficulty. It might not be too friendly to new users who have never played a city simulator, it does have nice tips in the game to be helpful. Also, the modding community for this game seems very active and looks like it will be for a long time. Because of the pleasant atmopshere and how the game is adding things quite a bit, and the modders beautiful works for this game, i give it a very good positive review due to many of these facts. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do. Thanks for reading!PROS:- This developer has made other city buidling games in the past, so has experience in making them.- There are great things in this simulator, and it only constraint depends on how much your pc can handle for super big cities.- The community is very wonderful when it comes to making super really good mods. Check some of them out in the workshop.CONS:- Everytime the game gets updated, mods get broken. Be aware of this if you plan to install wonderful mods.- Building a city too big can put a strain on your pc.- The traffic system in the game is somewhat bad. Alot of times you get traffic games and even on the train rails the trains are backed up.- DLCS can make the game much more fun, but they cost alot. Try not to buy them all at once, but wait for sales to purchase them.UPDATED: Ever since they keep releasing new dlc for this game, it gets better and better. BE AWARE this usually breaks mods until there updated. I have not played all dlc's as it is hard to stay up with them due to my fixed income and the price of some of the dlc's."

The amount of detail and customization in the game is insane, everything you do counts toward making an impact on your city, from planting a small tree to overhauling your highway. It's also crazy how you can literally pick a random person and follow them through an entire day through their life, and you can do this for the thousands of people in your city, absolutely insane.At first, starting a town can be sort of hard, because the player may need to plan ahead to the future while maintaining the current population happy, and when your town keeps growing you're going to have to look back at your town and solve problems that you didn't have when you started. This level of challenge is what keeps the player motivated to keep expanding instead of keeping what they have.If there is only one slight issue I have, which is not necessarily the game's fault is the amount of paid DLC that paradox is offering. I understand that extra content is always a good thing, but part of me thinks some of this stuff could have just been a free update to the game. Still, Cities: Skylines is an incredible sim that will push you to your absolute limits.I give Cities: Skylines a..."

All the game mechanics just fit into this game like clockwork, which is why you can get so immersed and play countless hours on end.City Planning - Be aware that you should plan out how each part of your city should be built. For example connecting public transport lines, roads or even power grids might involve destroying certain buildings which can have a negative affect on the population happiness. Districts - These can be used with the brush tool, you can then add a district policy on a housing area for example, which might focus this area on recycling more.Natural Disasters - This DLC is worth while and allows you to prepare for and counter any natural world disasters that might occur by planning things like evacuation routes.Global happiness - Like most strategy games, the overall happiness of your population is always an important factor to monitor. Build things like public transport, provide them with basic services like education/healthcare as well as basic needs like jobs or natural resources and you won't have anthing to worry about.Overall, while Cities Skylines has a bit of a learning curve for beginners I highly recommend you pick it up simply for the immersion, my final score 8/10 :)"

If the demand for housing goes up? Build a road and zone it for houses. How about Industry and Commercial? Do the same thing.Sure, there are other things like resource management where you actually have to have the power, water/sewage, and other civil services.

The size of the buildable area really gives you the flexibility to build your towns and cities how you want them to be rather than being forced into a style based purely on space limitations.For anyone considering buying it or who already owns it, there are a few essential steam workshop items to have:-Road protractor (tells you the angle in degrees and length of any road being built from another road),-Extended Transport UI (makes it much easier to manage your transport routes once they have been placed),-ARIS remove stuck vehicles (requires ARIS skylines overwatch first and gives you the option to click on and then remove  any vehicle in game, which is essential!!),-All areas purchasable (enables the purchase of every tile on each map. You still start with 1 tile and have to purchase the tiles as normal but can build in a 5x5 area which makes the scales feel much more realistic) and finally-Prop Remover (autonomously monitors and removes certain ugly repeating signs such as the donut squirrels and identical illuminous billboards, this also makes my game run a tad smoother, especially at night)"

If anyone remembers in the months leading up to the release of SimCity we were promised a true multi-city experience with different specializations and the ability to build a simulated region, rather than just a city. The reality that hit us was that SImCity only allowed the construction of cities that are tiny in size, the modelling of both traffic and people migration was done horribly and no actual modelling was in place and that the game was practically broken from the outset. After wasting some time (since then there was nothing really going on in this space) the guys here released Cities: Skylines. After being disappointed with the Cities XXL, I was cautious in buying this game, but after the sterling reviews I bought it. It is a masterpiece of city building simulation with constant support 2 years after release an extremely active and amazing modding community and simply the best, most modern and amazing city-building simulator on the market. Everything from buildings to traffic, to mass transit, to migration to assets, trees and... well, everything is amazing, and yes, after you install your 20+ mods and multiple assets you might run into some kinks (although none if you just run vanilla), but really, if you like these games (and I do, since SimCity (the original) was the first game I played in my life, while being in 1990s frozen Moscow as a child and SimCity 2000 was what I wasted my elementary school hours back in the states) you should really stop reading this, buy the damn game and enjoy building to your heart's content."

There are a few issues, which i am willing to pinn to the fact it's fresh out, though a few of those really should have been adressed prior to release.- No autosave! > Really? Game like this? With no autosave? I've already lost hours of gameplay because of game crashes.- Emergency services being ignored by other traffic reguardless of road type. > What do they have them sirens for then, if they stop at traffic lights anyway? Enough said.- No terrain mod tools available in game. > I would have expected these to be in, other then the map mod tool, they should be available while playing, payed for, certainly, but you should be able to buy some dirt and shove it along the shoreline to make a proper dam, or flatten that big mountain in the middle of your city.- Inability to modify the base maps. > if we can't have tools in game, why can't we open the default maps in the terrain modifier?- Water. > Don't get me wrong, love the water physics, though it does seem a little sluggish in places and crazy in others, bit hard to predict at times.These are the few issues i've noticed thus far in my 10 hours of gameplay, more might come up, but overall i am happy, just really, really missing the autosave and really really baffled by the emergency services.Rock on Paradox!"

Very nice balance you have to integrate in your cities' design between the  residential (low/high density) vs commercial (low/high density) vs industrial.2.  Day and Night cycle affects the functions of cities which is new for me. Ex The sound pollution at night in a leisure district affects low density residents.  There are many more examples.3.  This game doesn't spell anything out for you besides using the basic functions of zoning, road connecting, traffic etc.  You have to experiment for yourself to see how policies, roads, crime, or new building work together.  If you are a cookie cutter gamer, you might not like this pro.4.  The economy is how you control your city. Its the lifeline.  IF you have no money all you can do is raze structures, rezone, tax higher, redistrict.  No more city buildings to aid your zones.5.  Land values increase your taxes, if you design your city well to meet individual needs, equity goes up.  6.  Graphics are fantastic. It makes it easy to get lost in your creation. 7.  Rename businesses, districts, citizens, buildings.8.  Workshop content keeps the game fresh once you break that last few achievements.9.  You can create your own maps to build your own cities in if you dont care for default variants.10.  Set paths for buses and metros to combat the terrors of the common enemy in cities: rush hour. 1.  The Zoned buildings will be repetitive.2.  Puting in water pipes can feel like busy work.3.  No natural disaster to spice up the game once you are satisified with your creation(possibly a future mod or expansion I hope). 4.  Traffic lights = Inefficient. No other way of putting it.  Combination of timing with lights and the AI pathing the vehicles.Conclusion:  If you are into building cities, Get this game.  Its relaxing, interesting, and stunning.  Be creative and be the next Robert Moses (New York), Hippodamus of Miletus (Ancient Greece), or Georges-Eugène Haussmann (Paris) of the modern world."

And I plan to keep playing this game with how I have it kitted out with Mods. But a negative review I must write.I remember when it released it was everything I wanted and more. It was the sequel to the other city building simulation game I desired. Sure, it missed some of my favorite features of that behemoth, but it was all so new and checked all of the boxes that I dreamed of with the 4th iteration of that other game and even had some I never knew I wanted checked. It was exciting, terrifying, fun, and challenging in all the ways I like these games. That disappointment of a population dwindling or the excitement of a city flourishing. It was intoxicating and I remember many nights spent late at my computer thinking “One more block and I will get off and head to bed,” or, “just let me see how that budget pans out. I’m sure my city will thrive!”It was innovative and it was brave. It created countless hours of fun more the enhanced with the vibrant modding community.So why, all these years later, the negative review?Well, because over the last couple of years, and more especially in 2020, something just hasn’t sat well with me about this game.Not just because they have this new, and let me be clear, pointless launcher. In fact, I started writing this review before the launcher well, launched. But because this innovative, industry challenging game feel overburdened with mediocrity. It felt, it feels, like the game I really want is just around the corner, but all these years later, still is around the corner.I remember when the After Dark DLC was announced and the excitement I had thinking about my city gaining a night life. The parties, the tourism, the districts I could design and the city night lights. It was fun think about what the future was going to hold for the cities I loved and build and designed.And then I got it. And the feeling came that has grown, year over year to the writing of this review. A feeling that the developers lost touch with their audience.Instead of this night life, I got traffic sinks, noise complaints and more work than reward. My city still felt lifeless and the people in it lifeless. The day was not different from the night in business, traffic or activity. It felt bolted on to meet business objectives, to gain a few more dollars while the narrative in my head still felt unsatisfied. And with each DLC I was greeted with more of the same. Snowfall brought me a theme rather than dynamic weather or a sense of season, Green Cities brought me skins and textures and expensive policies to a world without reason, Natural Disasters brought me more of the same, and Park Life, Campus, and Industries gave me dynamics that added work, but no real bonus that I couldn’t get from the vanilla game’s assets.The real tipping point for me came in 2017 with Mass Transit. At the time, I was playing a popular transportation management game, whose sequel recently released and which further cemented this compliant. I was excited thinking “I hope they put some of those elements, I mean, reason to have logistic complexity to the game in. I mean, building an oil line or moving minerals to the industrial districts could be fun”. But instead, I got blimps and broken ferries. No new or better airports, no trains or tracks, no logistics systems. Just busy work.And it all kind of culminates into this feeling that I wanted so much more, especially in DLCs that I just never got. Like the developers could build features but didn’t play the game.I wanted neighboring cities I could build relationships with, or citizen that added life to the world, logistics that required resource management, or something that would give me a vested interest in the game beyond that of earning money and populations as a stat to grow. I wanted the DLC to do things like add real seasonal transitions, or schools that trained specialists in the industries of the city, or green policies and structures that allowed for customization of tolls, taxes and industry in pursuit of zero emissions.Instead, each DLC introduced new ways to have traffic problems, or activities without enough options or customizations, or a lack of storytelling or logic that made the features valuable. It just added Chirpy messages endlessly saying the same things about how oil bad and police storage and power meters suck and tourists complaining about bottle water showers and the cost of living. While bugs that needed fixed like buildings with crime through the roof next to police stations, horrible traffic logic, broken disaster response and an endless deluge of broken AI and broken systems that made some of my most beloved cities abandoned by me because I just didn’t like what the DLC did to them.It just felt like rather than exciting, innovative features…I was given more busy work for $7.99 or $15.99.It was mods that saved this game for me. Traffic Manager that aimed to fix the broken AI, Move It that allowed actual infrastructure customization, building story addons that gave people and buildings history, Real Time that gives a feeling that people go to work and a reason to overbuild transportation, and many, many more in that infinite way modding communities work.And it was Paradox and their developers that killed it for me.In the year 2020 City Skylines is not worth the full $30 USD price tag. To be honest, it is barely worth $7 (current sale) even if you added all of the DLC.It is an out of touch game that suffers from the fate as the 5th game of the other city building giant that is also out of touch. I would advise saving your money, exploring the genre and getting this in a humble bundle or waiting until the next great city builder is released. Hopefully with the features the community, and the more importantly, the players, want.TL;DR – 2/5 in 2020, the game needs mods by the community to stand on its own and the developers are out of touch. The DLC is mostly incomplete and adds more bother than content and entertainment. Wait and buy the next big city builder or get on deep sale with the DLC, maybe in a Humble Bundle less than $15.I rate games on a scale of 1-10, with 5 being average, 1 being unplayable, and 10 being Iconic.I rate City Skylines with most of the current DLCs a 4/10. it is an average time sink, but heading in the wrong direction. (modded, 7/10, the mods make me want to sink time into it)"

Obviously that does not say much when you compare what has come out since SC4 but still it is a great game.  Roads that are curvable, the ability to make your own buildings (think BAT tool in SC4 but a ton easier to figure out and use), custom bus lines, custom train lines, custom subway lines, taxis, ferry service, expandable roads, click and follow cars/pedistrians ...It is not perfect mind you, the ability to bulldoze and flatten land does not exist (well it does on slopes with low % grades, but you want to flatten a mountain, that is not happening as no option to do it).Also, once you reach 8 expansions of your city limits that is it.  No option to buy land past that (at least that I have found).  That said 8 extensions is a lot but would be nice to build more.  Right now I have a city at 110K population though it has been there for a while.  Thing is there is a huge online community that has gives tons of FREE downloadable content which makes the game interesting.  Currently I am on 92 plus hours and still loving it.  Just downloaded the expansion AFTER DARK (that costs money in case you were wondering) but it gives more eye-candy and transport options.I currently give it an 8.5/10 which says a lot as it is rare I  ever give a game 8 or higher.Included a vid showing how in basic vanilla mode (I have 1 or 2 mods that do not impact traffic flow on this vid) you can reduce traffic congestion (plus shows you gameplay overall):  A second vid gives an overview of two of my cities just so you get a feel of different parts of the game indepth:"
1307,Hatch,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965282243/,7,,1,5.8,December,"1,",329,0,1,"is one of the best city builders out there.  In my opinion it's not the best but it's still very good.  Sim builders are subjective so this game may be very good for a player or boring depending on how you like to play builders.  The reason it doesn't appeal to me is because this game concentrates more on  than simply plotting down buildings.  There are some buildings and items you can plot down like DLC content, parks, emergency buildings, schools, water and power management, etc.  But skyscrapers, houses and other common buildings you can't pick from a menu and place it.  Most of the building area is managed by zoning off areas (residential, commercial, office, industry).  In other words, depending on how well you run your city will determine how many buildings and homes your city residents build.  If you don't have enough educated people or zoned neighborhoods then businesses will not build up.  If you don't have enough jobs people will move out.  If either one is neglected too long then buildings shut down and you have to demolish them to make your city appealing.  I will say that the road customization and mechanics of the game is pretty good.  Some of the DLCs look very impressive but I've not bought them.  The Natural Disasters DLC looks like it'd spice up the games some. If you like city management and like the city to build itself then you'll love this game. If you like to pick buildings and other structures from a menu to place at your heart's desire and not worry so much about the management stuff I recommend Sim City from EA.Great city builderRoads cusomizations are on pointManagement - for those who like a challengeGood graphicsWorkshop itemsUnlimited money option - for those who just want to buildDLC contentSteam cloud save - if you get a new PC you'll be thankful for this!More of a management game, not enough picking structures from a list and freely placing them.Music could be better.Sometimes the game goes after you about one problem and it seems nothing fixes it.  For example, I felt like I had to keep building schools because my citizens were uneducated. After about a dozen schools I was done...just over it. And my city was still very small.  My first game had a similar problem, public health. Had to keep building more and more clinics.  This could be a problem without unlimited money turned on."
1308,[Ono] Kurz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/meccar/,6,,1,"1,120.2",November,"25,",510,0,1,"Review by KurzScore 10/10Introduction.Cities: Skylines is an exceptionally well-made game, where you can dive into an immense world of management. I will try to give you some insight into the game, but with tons of things you can do, I can only cover the most important aspects.The game was made by Colossal Order Ltd and released in 2015 by Paradox Interactive.GameplayHave you ever had the feeling that time stands still? That’s how it is to play Cities. You can play all day and into the night, and when you look at your watch, you realize that you should been at work 3 hours ago. This game will draw you in like a sponge and force you to create the wildest cities to date.Let’s start off with the different options you have to play. Starting with an empty map, there are different types of maps to choose from like Savanna, Forest, Islands, and so on. Each map has their own specified natural resources.Alternatively, start a scenario. In scenario mode you will get different task to handle like traffic or natural disasters.You can edit everything in this game: maps, themes, assets and scenarios.Starting your own new city, there are some basic things you need to make for your city to work. You start out by making some roads for your citizens, then electricity, water and sewage. With the basic needs in place, you can start to zone your residential, commercial, and industrial zones, and grow your city. As you expand and you get more citizens, new buildings will unlock to keep up with the demands of your people.The beginning of the game is difficult and time consuming, because you are starting out with a set amount of cash. You need to be careful, and not spend too much before your city starts to generate money. But once the gold coins start to flow into your account, you can build more, better and bigger things. Cities will always challenge you even when you have your finances in order, since by then, the traffic has increased, and you have a new challenge.Traffic is the most difficult aspect of the game to manage. It is extremely difficult to get a city with a population of 200,000 to have no traffic jams. It’s possible, but you need to use all the tricks in the book to get all your roads green and jam free. There is no greater feeling of achievement than when you are able to make a city jam-free. There are a lot of different roads to choose from, like gravel and highways. To be able to manage the traffic, it’s important to get the bus lines and subway lines connected and spread out in the city.People move into the city automatically when you zone, and if you have the right utilities in place. But if you want to boost your visitors, you need a well-managed city and some unique buildings. The space elevator generates a lot of visitors, but before placing it, you would need a waste network and transport systems in place. You will also get visitors from docks, airports, and trains.Parks and recreational areas are a way to make your people happy- the more the merrier. The sims just love the green areas, and it makes your city look great.There is also a DLC which allows you to make your own customizable parks.You can play the game any way you like. Personally, I love to make a city as beautiful as I can get it by making suburban areas with curved roads and a lot of green areas. The mountain maps are perfect places for constructing beautiful scenery.The menus in the game are easy to use, with an explanation for each icon. This makes it easy for new players to navigate the game. But there are a lot of icons, so it will take some time to be able to navigate with ease. The different icons will unlock as you progress through the game, making it great for people new to Cities.Informational views are a great feature to check your city’s status. You can check where you need to fix a traffic problem, how your transport system is connected, water, power, and so on.DLCCities: Skylines has many different DLC. I would recommend getting all of the gameplay DLC to make to most of your cities, and the music DLC when you want some new music.Since there are a lot of DLC packs, I would recommend buying them on sale when you could get the DLC at as high as a 50% discount, and that’s a great bargain.Music & GraphicsThere are some basic radio channels to listen to, but if you love the game as much as me and play for 900+ hours, you need to change up the music. That’s easily managed by making your own playlist or by buying one of the many music DLCs for the game.The standard music of the game is perfect for the game and makes you relax and have good feelings.The game is some years old, but the graphics are up to date. Beautifully-made buildings and surroundings make this game a really enjoyable experience for the eyes.You need some great PC specs to run the game when you have more than 200,000 people in your city.Steam WorkshopThere are 100,000+ items in the workshop which you can implement into the game. Some are almost mandatory like the automated bulldozer and automatic emptying, which relieves you of the stress of emptying the garbage and demolishing abandoned buildings. Remember that if you choose to use the workshop items, you would not be able to get steam achivements.ConclusionThere are no words to describe this incredible city-building game. It’s the best game I have ever played, final.If you like to build and manage, Cities: Skylines is mandatory in your library.10/10Pros- Unlimited possibilities- 100,000+ items in workshop- The feeling of greatness after completing a full map- Beautifully designed buildings- Great tools for editingCons- Needs a good pc to run a big city- The need of emptying garbage- The need of demolishing abandoned buildings- Price for DLCWritten by Kris KurzPlease follow our reviewer`s at our Steam Curator page:"

I love the fact you can use your imagination when it comes to building a small town, or even a busy metropolitan. I do recommend finding some of the mods that will allow you to play more of a sandbox style such as unlimited money, no pollution etc. The DLC's are worth it and I have purchased a couple to add neat features to my game play but not required if you do not want to buy them. If your looking for a game that's relaxing I would recommend this one."

Watch ""Our Passion for Cities: Skylines"" on YouTube and you can see the game developers talk about the love they put into it. Compared to SimCity, there's bigger maps, more customization, lots of dlc, mods like crazy, and attractive models and environments. Having played a lot of SimCity (along with older iterations) I have to say Cities: Skylines has a better road tool. If you play these kinds of games you'll know how huge that is. There's a lot to like here. I love that you can create districts and set policies unique to the district. I do wish they'd put out some futuristic dlc, similar to SimCity's Cities of Tomorrow (probably the coolest dlc in a city builder ever). I would give it a 5 and for the current level of tech in this genre, it maybe deserves one. I rate at a 4 though until Cities does something truly revolutionary with the franchise, like letting me mod in-game to my heart's content. Then I'd really be a god."

It was super rich but then I left it for a minute and it turned into Detroit when I came back. :/In all seriousness: this game is a must-have for city-building enthusiasts. It had a very profound effect on me and raised my interest in city planning, city policies, and traffic engineering. It will suck you in and make you curious about urban planning. I highly recommend this game. Based on what I've seen and heard, it's the best overall modern city-builder."
1317,DelScorcho,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DelScorchoo/,4,,1,113.1,March,"19,",410,0,1,"The review is this:  All the good stuff from SC5, none of the bad.  Where you got all of the bad stuff from SC5, Skylines has improved it to where it works.I am not writing this to badmouth SC5, I spent hundreds of hours playing it and enjoyed it for the most part except for the major concerns players had:No single highway in/out of your city causing major traffic bottlenecks.  The game allows you to expand your city to larger areas (Major concern of SC5 players).  The game includes Metro stations unlike SC5.  As far as public transportation you can not only place them but plan their routes like Cities in Motion.When you build roadways it will grid out exactly the depth of your city buildings construction of what you zone next to the road.  The highways are reconstructable to your liking.  The road tool to create curved roads was a little bit confusing on how to make the desired curved effect at first, but after a little while of experimenting it is not difficult and a much stronger mechanic then SC5.The thing I like the most is you are unable to construct High Density areas right at start.  You must start with Low Density and earn by population growth the higher density/metropolis buildings expected to see in a major city vs. a small town, i.e. small towns don't have nuclear power plants.  Civs will sort of trickle into your city little by little instead of having a massive population boom which undercuts your public services.All in all it is exactly what everyone was hoping for from SC5.For all the DLC complainers, I also own SC5 Cities of Tomorrow and found that enjoyable with all its problems, although I won't buy any more SC5 DLC's, if Skylines releases any DLC's I will be purchasing them as the developers obviously have learned from the catastrophic release of SC5 online play is not required."

1323,Muticere,https://steamcommunity.com/id/muticere/,9,1,0,121.7,August,"6,",314,0,1,"I'd like to state upfront that I don't think this is a terrible game or that in general I say no one should get it. It's just that ultimatly after hours and hours of playing it, I can't in good faith really recommend this game for what it is.  Because what this game in reality is a traffic simulator with a vestigial city-sim attached. In developing this game, it's really obvious that the traffic aspect was an idea that they were really proud of.  Rather than cars being just visual representations of the traffic metadata as in other city sims, Skylines opts to give every vehicle an identity. Every vehicle exists in the game and has a purpose. And if it takes too long on the road to achieve that purpose, issues naturally arise.  Suddenly, a busy intersection means garbage trucks don't make it to homes and buildings, hurses don't make it to pick up dead bodies, and so on. Things back up, and suddenly your whole city is falling apart. The problem for me is that while this is an interesting and no doubt complexly coded idea, it's not realistic. In real life, traffic ebbs and flows throughout the day, people take different routes to avoid high traffic times, etc. If you're going to go so far out of your way to develop this insanely needy traffic system that your whole city lives and dies based on it, what does it ultimately mean if it doesn't adequately represent what it's trying to simulate? And sure, that metagame IS interesting, I can't lie about that. It's easy to get caught up for hours playing the game trying to maximize your traffic efficiency. But it's also exhausting after a while. I'm writing this review after spending probably 20+ hours on a city and eventually just giving up on it after I made a small expansion out into a new area and finding that one change completely wrecked traffic for a huge segment of my city. Up until that point I had been having fun, a few high points were making a popular tourist destination and damming up a river to make a hydroelectric plant. The Dam was especially fun because even though I found an excellent spot, initially it wasn't generating electricity because all the water was flowing off in an opposite direction down an alternate river, so I used a bit of terraforming to block off that alternate route, only to have the dam fill up and overflow into my city, so I had to create a canal to deal with the overflow, sending the excess water off into the sea elsewhere.  It was a genuinely interesting set of issues that came up and the mechanics, and physics, involved were really cool.  But now I sit and am quite disinterested in expanding any further because, again, I have to figure out traffic, I have to play this traffic metagame that is only so interesting before it becomes tedious. And sure, I get that maybe I'm just not good enough or smart enough, but that's fine. I'm able to admit that maybe the game is what beat me in the end. Ultimately the game stopped being fun for me so I stopped playing. The bulk of my hours I sank into the game were from when I first got it, up to around 2017. At that time I gave up on it for similar reasons to why I am now, and now I feel the same, this time only making it two weeks before I'm just exhausted and done. For future city-sims, I'd recommend they do their traffic like SimCity 4 did. In that game, the traffic was essentially just a visual representation of the traffic metadata going on in the background, but also the cars did have some identity and purpose, too. It seemed to do something similar to what Cities: Skylines does now, but better and less overwhelming. And it's frustrating, I want to enjoy this game. There's a lot to recommend and it seems like it should have been a great game to fill the void left by SimCity.  In all realism I imagine I'll come back to the game. I'm like an old-school WoW player, I always come back."
1324,agreeksailor,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197976333824/,407,36,0,142.2,April,"6,",593,47,1,"TL;DR The game is a nice leveling sandbox hampered by unintuitive gameplay, unusual traffic decisions, limited building styles, and confusing UI decisions. The less micro you like in a game, the more you will like this one. If you don't like being on rails while you play and want to have fine tunning controls, this game is probably not for you.Edit: As of the most recent update, while many things have been improved, the core complaints below has not been addressed. I do hope they address at least some of this, but for now everything below is still accurate. I have also clarified the maximum zoning size.Unfortunately, I have to move this review to not recommending for now. Once the rose colored glasses come off, there are some major issues that need fixing before I recommend this game to anyone but the most forgiving of individuals. The game is pretty good and can be a lot of fun...but those who haven't bought it yet will probably be heavily annoyed by the many frustrations this game also provides. Issue #1 Traffic. People will tell you there is nothing wrong with traffic, but there really is, and I can explain that problem in a sentence. Cars are always moving. Car leaves origin, travels towards destination, returns to origin, and heads to destination again. Because of this loop always running, there is no way to fix the traffic problem. People, businesses, factories work on cycles in real life. What's more, they are not constantly productive. Some forms of agriculture produce goods daily, some weekly, some monthly, and some are a once a year thing. Major comercial sectors time their shipments to arrive at night when there is limited traffic and thus deliveries are more efficient. With no day/night cycle and thus no low traffic/heavy traffic cycles the game punishes otherwise efficient designs by having only one mode of traffic, heavy. This is what creates all of the other traffic problems observed. Sure you can build around these problems, and there are many people who gain great pleasure from dealing with such. If that is you, then this game is probably for you. Otherwise, there really needs to be cyclic traffic flows in this game. Low traffic weekends in industrial areas, high traffic commercial. Residential needs to be low traffic most of the day.Issue #2 Limitations. There is a lot missing from this game. Asthetics, public building options, utilities, even auto constructed building have very limited and generic asthetics. Because of this, you will quickly find that one city looks just like any other quickly leaving the game feeling very cookie cutter. Having multiple building styles that alternate every 10 years or so would go a long way to fixing this and creating a feeling of a progressing city. Mods can only help in a limited way here. This is a fix that really needs to come from the devs. Issue #3 Zoning. There is only one way this game zones, that is automatically as you lay your roads. You can color in the blocks representing what can be built, but no matter what, you can not define the shape of the area you want constructed in. This forces you away from more organic designs as the game attempts to create numerous obnoxious shapes when a simple rectangle would have done much better. Such choices are not in your hand, and there are no creative work arounds as zoning is immediatly deleted when you remove a road, and anything built on it. Even if you are just trying to fix something and all buildings would still be with road access where they need it. Fix, let the player zone an area as industrial, commercial, or industrial then let them build the roads afterwards. The game can then highlight areas wasted due to lack of road access. This would allow for more organic, fun designs. As the game currently exist, and as a reply to ""NGB"" the image below represents how it currently works.Issue #4 Building Footprint Sizes. Thanks to the way the game is created, you will never have large flowing fields of green on the outskirts of your city. Every single building has a maximum size of 4X4. Yes there are limited buildings that are larger you can construct manually, but you will never see large areas develop on their own. This is a direct result of how zoning is handled. Fix for this, fix zoning, then let the building bases have larger sizes.Issue #5 The Fan Base. This is going to be the number 1 reason I am not going to recomend this game to most people. Currently, the fans are to put it mildly, hostile to any criticisms of the game. Collosal Order has made no mistake and can do no wrong, so any issues you see are your fault and that's all there is. This isn't a problem in itself, it's a problem because there are so many like this that people with real issues can't talk about them because these fans derail threads and stop any form of productive discussion on the proplems. This is a good game that needs work, it is not a priceless work of art that needs to be preserved in its release state. There absolutely are design decisions in this title that need to be reconsidered. When you have so many that attack those that would suggest this game needs more work you can't have the discussions that need to happen. What's more, it's hard to get help when the fans are so abusive. There are many aspects of this game that just are not intuitive, and there is a significant portion of this fan base that will leave you not even wanting to use the forums. This is the real shame of the success of this game. This game was almost too successful for its own good.Edit: A screenshot from the comments on this review which shows an example of the response criticism of this game recieves. Notice that no points are refutted or discussed, just a blanket everyone else thinks this game is wonderful. I think he may have also been trying to criticize me...but the jab seems to have gone over or under my head.There are an abundance of places where you can read the virtues of this game. This is the devil advocate review that only focuses on the bad or at a minimum the questionably implemented features that detract from the experience. The bird is not an issue to make you not buy the game, however, you will be punished for modding it out by turning off achievments. While there is a mod to re-enable achievments, what will probably start nagging you is how you have to keep downloading mods to fix questionable design decisions. An ingame option to turn off all nag screens and the bird is not too much to ask. These are the basic things that serve to move this from a must have to a marginal recomendation depending on whether you can ignore the issues and are willing to work around the ones that can't be ignored. For me the answer is no, which is why I have stopped playing for now.I am aware that the devs have planned a number of improvements to the game, if any of those improvements affect the issues I have highlighted, I will gladdly return to fix this review and its recomendation status. While I have highlighted the fans as the #1 issue for me not recommending the game, it doesn't really factor in. I hope people that applies to read it and reply proving me right, even better, maybe they read it and realize they could be a little more civil to their fellow humans. Who knows?

You all know what's good about it so I'll be focusing on the negatives.In short, the major flaws are:- Not friendly to newcomers. No tutorial, no campaign, limited and often useless hints and prompts (an icon tells you something is wrong but you don't know what it means.)- Lack of personality and charm. You never feel like the mayor of a city here. I like the tweet bird feature a lot and find it useful but it's the only bit of info that makes you feel connected to your citizens. Unlike Sim CIty/Tropico it has no advisors, and little comedic flavour. Comedy isn't necessary and it seems to go for a more realistic serious route but then adds weird goofy looking vehicles and colours which are too vibrant and stick out. I feel like in those other games I zoom to see the lives of citizens more and am more attached to my city.- Need for mods. You need mods for a better experience. From graphic,prop and asset mods to traffic and better road tools. Not really a massive flaw but should be mentioned. - Often feels like you're playing a frustrating traffic simulator more than a city builder. Honestly this a big one for me. Sucks away the fun when I spend half my time trying to fix traffic issues. - Some lackluster and expensive DLC. With all the DLC it adds up and a lot of the DLC fall a bit flat. Snowfall DLC for example felt very basic to me - Seasons don't change so you're stuck in a perpetual winter and the added buildings were very meh. Overall it feels like there are some missing features from the base game.There is enjoyment to be had. It's not a bad game at all. As I said it's a great sandbox city builder. But the flaws stop me from enjoying it and don't draw me back to it."

Alerts tell you that there is an unfinished translit line, but clicking it does not highlight where the issue is. Connecting electrical and plumbing systems does not make a whole lot of sense, the former utilizes transmission lines which are unnessecary when there is develpoment, but development does not remove them. Aligning roads is super tedious and no undo button. So it didn't appear quite how you wanted to? Too bad, tear it down and try again! No matter how hard you try to make a nice even grid there will always be gaps. Possibly the dumbest thing about this game... there is a twitter simulator build in that constantly chimes in with annoying comments that I can't figure out how to turn off.. only put a hat on it. wtf.Try to put a train station near existing roads and rail lines, I DARE YOU.Seriously I hate this game. Gonna go play Sim city 2000.UPDATE: Tried this game again years later as I had the itch to do some city building. I see they have $100s of dollars worth of paid DLC, but have not fixed any of the issues that were present at released. Still very buggy. There are mods that add improvements that really ought to be in the base game (Metro overhaul mod, Traffic Manager, UNDO) I've been lead to believe that there are mods that can address the zoning gaps that cause wasted space around curved roads etc, but haven't figured that out yet. In its current (and heavily modded state) it still seems that you have to choose between making an aesthetically pleasing city and 'playing the game.' Its not even an issue of being limited financially if you try to play by the rules, the game requires you to place trash incinerators and colleges every 3 blocks instead of allowing you to place them remotely and connect them with transit. Similarly, you need to alternate residential and commercial districts in just the right way in order to make the game happy, so ultimately you have very little freedom to build the city the way you actually want. The rebuke accept the apologists that say that is a ""design choice,"" rather than a ""bug"" I would argue that it is at best, bad design.Do not buy."

First of all, this is my first game I've played of this genre. The closest I've played is Banished (which I love), but this has a great deal more depth in managing your city. I did watch 6-8 hours of ""how to"" videos on youtube before I played for real. And I highly recommend that to anyone new to the genre. What you'll find when you do play and figure it out a bit is that it is highly addicitve as there is always just ""one more thing"" to do before you can quit. The intricacy of how everything has to be balanced is a sweet feature. For instance, my current town has about 54,000 citizens but I leveled off at about 40,000 for a while and couldn't figure out why. As it turns out (hello Google!), I had over-educated my population so nobody would take my factory/ industrial jobs. So my unemployment rate was a bit high and nobody wanted to move to town! So, I shut down 2-3 elementary schools, 2 high schools and a university. Presto....the average education level of my citizenry took a small dip and the town started growing again! THAT is some sweet relational effects. There are things you can do to make use of a highly educated workforce, but then you better have exceptional outside contacts (road, rail and ships!) to bring in goods to feed/drive your economy. It is fascinating. Now excuse me while I get back to Wertydurd and crack 60,000 residents so I can build a dang airport. 12/10"

Plus, if a path or road being placed would change the housing setups, it should say. Normally it does but sometimes it will distort the road causing some houses to be destroyed.It would also be good if parks could be custom build, such as drawing them into holes within groups of housing, and gaining access to these parks with the better paths mentioned earlier.Last of all, but also probably of least importance, who expects you to provide your own cities power; there should be a way to plug into the national grid.Despite these, I have really enjoyed playing, and I plan to continue doing so.

Every last citizen (or ""Cim,"" in a nod to the Cities series' inspiration) is modeled; every last car or truck on the road carries a Cim or else cargo for a defined destination. Busses pull up, and individual Cims board and depart. They drive, take the train, or even walk to their destination. It is this level of detail that truly defines the transit side of the game: if one of your roads is clogged with congestion, there are very specific reasons why, and your options for dealing with it are vast. Add more roads? If so, which type? Would a bus line help? Probably not if it's all truck traffic; maybe a cargo train station? Hell, if it's all one factory that's causing the congestion, which can be checked by clicking on the individual trucks as they come and go, maybe you could even destroy the factory. But outside of the transit side of things, the game is just ridiculously easy. As a veteran of SimCity 1 through 4, the defining challenge of that game -- the fact that you're always broke -- is gone here. My second city was generating such insane amounts of cash by the time it hit 10k citizens that money stopped being a factor altogether, letting me do completely insane things like putting entire interstate highway systems underground or putting subway stops in every insignificant little suburban area. Things like crime and health require very little attention to manage. Your town's buildings are apparently made of gasoline-soaked cardboard and are constantly catching fire, so you need something like 5 fire stations for every police station, but again it's not a big deal since money is a non-issue. Your city's expansion is limited by your ability to do all that tedious R/C/I zoning.Well, that and your ability to manage your city's transit. It's like all the rest of the game is just an excuse to frame the devs' real interest: creating an intricate transit simulation, with every last train, plane, ship, bus, truck, car and scooter simulated individually. So while the series pretends to be the offshoot of SimCity, it's actually the offshoot of Cities in Motion.But whatever the shortcomings are, it's certainly better and far more fun than the dumpster fire known as the latest SimCity. Actually, I bet dumpster fires could be kind of fun IRL, but never mind. Qualified thums-up: grab it when next on sale."

The developers rely on the modding community entirely. The mods are what hold the game together and without them the game would be long dead.Mainly good for people with higher end pcs that like to decorate massive cities, but the game as far as actual simulation is bad. The game mechanics with population, traffic, budgeting, and demand has been undeveloped since the release of the game. Although it is fun to play, without mods from the community many of the issues are underwhelming where there is no actual simulation happening. The simulation of overcrowded stations and the amount of transit with the dlcs is fun to control, it is still underwhelming as far as realism. Industry is essentially workforce free. Even so the game is not new-user friendly as the lack of actual challenge leaves it more like a sandbox with some plopped down pipes and power lines."

I'll admit the game did crash once for me, but it seems to have been an isolated incident. After playing 26 hours, this one crash is the only negative I can come up with. The game seems to squeeze all the juice out of my system in terms of CPU and GPU usage (Intel i7 Quad Core 2.67Ghz, 16GB RAM, Geforce GTX465), but in return it gives me a smooth and enjoyable playing experience! Unlike the competition, you can build large cities, but there are no slowdowns, no stuttering and no need to restart the game every 30 minutes. As of now, to my knowledge, Cities: Skylines is the only good city building game available. The other two I'm aware of (Simcity, Cities XXL) don't even come close, as they have too many problems."

I have consistently seen water flowing UPHILL, over and into massive areas of land that are many times over what the river fills, all because I simply raised a bit of extra land for my city, the game just breaks because it doesn't want you using that specific bit of land which vastly takes the fun away from trying to make unique and challenging cities.Also the DLC is a joke, the game is missing a lot of things that the DLC provides, including important and much needed roads and missions or scenarios, city games are begging for scenario missions as a challenge and you have to pay £100+ if you want access to cities skylines full game.if it wasnt for the water, I would genuinely still be playing now, I love building challenging cities in uninhabitable situations. but losing a city after 25 hours of building simply because the water mechanics are broke was just too much."

There is an almost manic level of detail going on in terms of the simulation.  The thing is, this isn't like the old sims.  You're basically a network manager and nothing more.  You create the infrastructure then let the game go.  For the most part it is sitting watching the little guys fiddle about with their lives whilst you snore peacefully until a milestone is unlocked so that you can add new structures or until you have the budget to buy up more squares. I really found this very dull and very easy.  Once you get to grips with the controls for roads/intersections and bridges and once you realise a little forward planning is required then it really is pause, set up, play, pause, set up, play and those sections where the game is playing are utterly dire.I much prefer the likes of Tropico with events and charachters as well as the user picking their own buildings and choosing where to put them. It's a miss for me.Having seen and been entertained by a few streams I decided to revisit.  My opinion is still the same.  The game is very very easy and it is just a matter of waiting for enough money to come through so that you can deal with whatever issue you have.  My only issue has been that I have massive demand for housing, but raising taxes causes everyone to leave rather than slowing growth.  That's easy to fix, you just lower the tax and everyone floods in again.  I really don't understand why so many people have traffic issues.  It might be that they're doing block zones which is stupid.  If you mix your blue and greens and have multiple angles of approach to your yellows combined with good public transport then your traffic will be fine.  Ultimately what I said before stands:  Create a space, let it go, pause, create a bigger space.  The best way to play this thing is everything unlocked from the start so you can create a beautiful and unique space.  Playing it realistically is just kinda dull."

If your PC can handle it, you can creat an entire region, with a central city and suburbs and towns, all interconnected by road, rail, or metro.Great Game++"

It's one of those games you can't put down once you start playing, while Civilization has it's ""Just one more turn"" this game has ""Just 5 more minutes"" or ""I'll quit, I just have to get this road straight... what, it's an hour later now?""The fact that it's also Steam Workshop enabled promises that there'll always be fun new things to build in your city.I'm not sure how big the area you can build on eventually will become but so far I can buy 8+ new areas, just as big as the one you start with, which I think is bigger than the full area you have in SimCity.My only complaint is that it's a bit hard to get the traffic to flow properly. It seems no matter what I do I just push the issue further down the road. Roundabouts help a lot, but the two you have access to are waaaay to big. A single one lane roundabout to keep the traffic flowing rather than getting stuck at traffic lights would be great, then again, there might be one available sooner or later thanks to Steam workshop.Scores for those that desperately need them:Graphics: 6/10 - The game could use some more varying buildings so you don't end up with the same three or four buildings repeated over and over.Sound: 7/10 - Music is nice and adds some ambience, which is all that is needed in a game like this.Gameplay: 9/10 - Like crack.

I wasn’t wrong- this is a very well thought out game on paper- but where the problems lie is underneath.Playing Cities: Skylines is like trying to drive a semi truck with a toothbrush motor.The game engine feels egregiously under-equipped to deal with its base features, let alone any of the amazing custom content the workshop has on offer. Its not me- I’m running a GTX 1080 with 16gb ram, and around 3-5 non graphical mods, but the game still can’t keep up with itself. Loading times are upwards of 20 minutes, crashes are constant, and severe and constant lag spikes during gameplay are pretty standard fare. Every time I play I find myself having to reboot my PC after quitting- it seems Cities gums up my circuits long after it’s been shut down. Besides all that, there's the company behind the game- Paradox Interactive, which I feel will soon overtake EA as the most hated game company on earth.They care not about my experience- they've mananged to shake me down for the base game AND several of their [not-worth-anywhere-close-to] $20 DLC's. They force you through their launcher, make you sign up for an account, sign a creepy EULA, and subscribe to their youtube channel.I so wish I could play the amazing game hidden under the overwhelming issues, but after waiting this long for some sort of real performance improvement, I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance.[EDIT] I wanted to update as to the instability issues. The game has released more and more updates and DLC, and I'm now running at 3060ti, Ryzen 9, 32gb ram. None mods. Game still runs like a lawnmower on diesel. BSODs my PC, sometimes, as well.And in case it wasn't obvious, Paradox still sucks."

First of all, playing without DLCs or mods is kinda useless due to the loss of huge part of content. But let's talk about all that stuff as a whole thing.As a real mayor, you have to listen to requests of citizens and reduce their discontent, otherwise the population of your city will decline. In addition, you should plan placement of police departs, hospitals, schools and so on in order to make your city balanced and prosperous.While playing you will understand how to properly organize the movement of cars without traffic congestion, develop infrastructure, expand the area and a lot of additional stuff.I remember hours I spent reading about real city planning after a game session. This reminds me about childhood dream of becoming an architect when I grow up. But now I'm a programmer and I can say that there are really interesting projects on Unity and this game proves it."

It came out soon after sim city failure so i guess you know why it got so popular. I've played it for a while and i'm disappointed. There's no target of this game. You can get highest tier of city in no time, money is very easy to get and it becomes boring after a while. But the game itself is good. It's very friendly for mods(which are cool) you can make a nice city but i'm really missing a target in this game. someone could say that you don't need a target in game like that... well... true but if you played a very old game called City Life(there's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ remake of it on steam) you know that trying to get everyone happy, employed and get every group of people is very fun. That game was making you strugle to get that 1% of snobs and so on. in Tropico 4 you also have targets and it makes it a fun game(would be pretty boring without it). so you get me by now. its just a pointless city builder. it's not even economical game(like a lot of city builders). So building cities. it's pretty good. you have to provide water, electronics(not by making a building but with pipes and wires), you have to take rid of trash, road traffics, you've got airports, buses, metro(or tubes ya british wankers), pretty much everything. So in overall - pointless but very good city builder                                6.5/10(just for being pointless)"

To be honest, I haven't really played any city builders, since I played the first Sim City many years ago, but as a huge fan of this classic, Cities: Skylines is just the game I've always been waiting for!The game has just beautiful and very detailed graphics, it looks just awesome, especially the level of detail, you can see virtually anything, if you zoom into your city, the buildings, cars, people, trees, bushes and more. And the best thing is, when you zoom in very close, your city looks just like a miniature city, just beautiful! And you will hear all the sounds and noises from your city and its citizens.In Cities: Skylines, you can build almost anything, several types of roads in diverse shapes, different kinds of power plants, wind turbines, a hydroelectric power station, then of course residential areas, business areas, industrial areas and office areas. Furthermore you have lots of different ways of traffic beside the cars and trucks on the roads, you can build train stations, freight depots, bus stations, ports, cargo ports, airports, subways. There is just a huge variety in this game, so that you can build the city of your dreams the way you want it! But also you have to ensure, that your people are happy by building power plants, water pumps, police stations, fire stations, hospitals, parks, schools and many more buildings to keep things under control like electricity, water consumption, crime rate, education, fire safety, health, waste management and many others. Then you can create own districts and set guidelines for your whole city and for ever single district and specify your districts for a certain industry like forestry, agriculture or oil industry. You can and must control anything in your town, which is a challenge sometimes and huge fun anytime. You can even rename any building, any vehicle and any person in your city!Additionally you have an extensive map editor to create your own maps and you can just do and create anything. Also included is an object editor, where you can change objects or create new stuff for your city AND you can share it with everyone out there using the integrated steam workshop. In the workshop you'll find tons of mods, objects and maps to increase the variety of Cities: Skylines and double the joy about this game.In my current game I've played 21 hours in the last 5 days, since I bought it and after a few fails, where I went almost bankrupt after a few (ingame) weeks, I managed it to build a big city with 57.000+ citizens. Because in the beginning, you have to be careful with your money, you have to find the right balance to earn more money than you spend. But after a few tries, you'll get it done, cause only if you earn a lot of money, you can expand your city. And you can expand it a lot, cause you can always buy new territories to enlarge your city area, I think one new territory measures about 2 x 2 km, my city has 7 right now and you can get up to 25(!), which is f**king gigantic.In conclusion, I must say that I'm already addicted to this game, because it is soooo awesome, beautiful graphics, very detailed, nice sounds and music, a huge variety in the game, you can control anything in your city. And the developers of the game will also bring new features and updates/patches out, to make this game even better (hardly possible)."

""Games are expensive to make, be happy they're not more so."" But when you're as massive a success as the (originally) Unity title, Cities Skylines, you don't need DLC, let alone do you need to charge over ten USD for each pack that adds something that should have been in the game anyway. You can argue all you want about it, but it's hella expensive to feel like you're getting everything you can out of the game, even with the DLC on sale. It nickle-and-dimes you to death.Don't get me wrong, the base game exceeds expectation, but do not underestimate the fact that you are missing what is escentially another half of the game locked away behind about fifty-six (not on sale, of course) dollars. Do you know how many more games you could buy with that that you'll undoubtedly enjoy more than being able to have a tornado rip through your city a few times and set up a blimp route?It's for this reason I don't recomend the game unless it and its DLC's are on sale, or if you're just really into the base game, which if you are, kudos.

While this is understandably done to not force players to buy other DLCs in order to enjoy a certain DLC, this results in mechanics feeling shallow and forcibly copied.The game is overdue for an overhaul.

I've sunk way too many hours into it - it sort of sucks you in and before you know it you realise you haven't eaten anything for 8 hrs because you're so obsessed with getting those railways down right! Seriously though, as a fan of city builder games (and coming from Sims 3 where you can basically create a world from scratch) this does it in a more satisfying way because it's intuitive, as fast or slow as you want it to be. The buildings generated seem to subtly complement each other, which is a great feature, and makes your city look really professional. An ingame tutorial on the more complex building stuff would be nice (is there one? I didn't notice) otherwise you're relying on Youtubers to give you tips. You can micromanage or build on a broad sweeping scale and the game seems to follow your style. Anyway, I  highly recommend, but prepare to lose large chunks of your real life!"

Solving for efficient traffic solutions is one of my favourite things to do in new builds and it's very satisfying seeing that traffic flow number stay high no matter your population, not to mention how mesmerising it is seeing traffic flow through an intersection you built! Learning how to create a realistic city layout is counterintuitively where the longer-term learning curve is for the game if you're a builder, and it's really fun picking up how real cities are made through your experience with the game.As a city  game I do think it still falls a bit short of the SimCity peak - the vast majority of the game's difficulty is in traffic management for the most part, and once you can solve that to a reasonable degree then the rest of the game's difficulty is pretty trivialised. Education as a whole is ridiculously overpowered, money basically becomes a non-issue past a certain city size, power generation is a straight upgrade the further up you go with no downsides, and there is no intercity or regional management to be done. If you have absolutely no interest in building a good-looking city and don't find traffic management interesting you will probably not enjoy the game as much, though - as with most things - there are mods to fix it.That's really where a lot of the strength of C:S lies in, its mod support - things like road and building placement, the 9 tile limit, vehicle/entity caps, population distribution, and a few other things all feel very restrictive in the base game and performance is not good especially on computers with weak CPUs, but all of the above can be fixed or mitigated with mods. It is a very good investment if you like the game even a little bit, and I don't envy console players having to do without them!The DLCs for the game are also fairly priced and interesting, IMO. Some of them are more narrowly focused than others so I would definitely prioritise if you're on a budget (special emphasis on Industries which is my favourite) but all of them have their uses in regular gameplay, which is a nice change of pace in the overall cynical climate of the modern gaming industry today.Overall, totally awesome game with an almost unparalleled community modding effort paving the way for a continued future. Paradox regularly runs sales and I would totally recommend grabbing the game when they do next!"

Never been fixed either, so that's fantastic.Figured, okay, it's a very moddable game with a rich modding scene, surely there was a mod that fixed this issue.Yes and no. You see, all there is are a variety of cheat mods that basically let you add demand on a whim, essentially skipping the whole point of it and the gameplay around it (I mean why play the game and balance demand for zones n whatnot when you can just bring up a slider menu and flick it all to 100+% amirite?), making my choices really boil down to ""kill my save and stop playing, or cheat and play sandbox babby"". Heck that my dude, I don't think so.Aside from that, the game has an endless list of issues and things that don't work or are seemingly completely meaningless in gameplay. It doesn't take you long to realize how painfully obvious it is that the game was meant as a sandbox builder, not a legit city sim.If that's your thing and you just wanna build a city that looks cool, then sure, good game for you (vanilla is kind of wonky for that, but there are plenty of mods that let you do more with it, lots of custom assets and other neat stuff too), but not so much if you're in it for gameplay and challenge."

It doesn't really matter what you build or where you build it, as long as there is not traffic you're fine.The 1 and only reason I dont recommend this game is because it gets repetitive after a short time span. The game itself is beautiful, the fact that I can zoom in and see such great detail is the only reason why I still play every once in a while."

By ideals of Cities: Skylines, planner Colossal Order has obviously demonstrated its excitement after SimCity – not only the key thought and procedures for building and keeping up a duplicated city starting from the soonest arrange, yet a phenomenal part of the look and feel as well. In like manner, on fundamentally every check, Skylines considers insistently to the past driving figure of the city-building kind. It is, truly, the best of its kind to arrive in an entire decade – a remarkable, adaptable, staggering, and all-around marvelous reenactment that permits you to gather sprawling, single-player urban regions to your heart's substance. Building must be its own reward, regardless, in light of the way that the nonappearance of eccentric occasions or catastrophes leaves the control of running these towns feeling drained and wise. Having influence pioneer, part god-ruler with the ability to subjectively bulldoze your reenacted local people's fantasies and make schools with a tick, building a city with no arranging is for the most part standard: set down roads with the simple to-utilize contraptions, dispense zones for private, business, or mechanical structures, give utility associations, secure the cost help, then rehash the cycle with new stuff that has been opened by your making individuals hitting new points of view. Horizons finds an all things considered chipper medium between the multifaceted plan of SimCity 4 and the relative straightforwardness of SimCity 2013 by method for in this way adding zoneable zones to paths as they're laid, yet meanwhile getting a handle on mandatory busywork like laying water channels. Those stray pieces are all attempted and genuine - you couldn't have a city-design without them - so it's required that they be done well. Urban districts: Skylines does that. The crucial way this sim pounds it out of the excitement center is in its scale. Every preoccupation starts as misleadingly little, contracting you to a four-square-kilometer zone (a misty size from a SimCity design, by fortunes I'm certain), yet rapidly permits you to purchase access to a near to plot of place where there is vague size. By then it does this seven more times, for an aggregate conceivable space of 36 square kilometers. Suffice it to say, there's an extensive measure of room. Recalling that you can't especially modify space while you play, there's an included guide supervisor where you can make any land mass you pick before you skip in - or download one from the unmistakably combined Steam Workshop mod support. With such wide urban zones, it's extraordinary that Skylines licenses you to depict and organize runs exclusively. Basically paint a lump of your city with the District instrument, and you can not just name it so you can spot it effectively on the guide, however give it novel procedures that control everything from advising smoke locators to lessening fire dangers (at a cost) to supporting recreational prescription use for lower wrongdoing rates, or banning highrise structures to make depicted downtown and common zones. In mechanical zones, you can sharpen the relationship to misuse a guide's normal assets in the region to mine metal, enter for oil, create on rich land, or collect trees for officer advantage. You can even make constrain motivations for a particular kind of zone inside every zone. We ought to zoom in for a minute: we can see specific people strolling around the paths, going to work or school, sharing in beguilement works out, or returning home by the thousands. They drive autos, take arranges, and even walk pooches. (You can openly name them, yet I propose naming them Waldo, in light of the way that there are various to the point that in the event that you watch that particular one again you I say you essentially win.) This is the place you appreciate the time scale persuades the chance to be ludicrous. On the slowest speed a day endures 10 seconds – three and a half on the speediest – which deduces the excursion to work could most recent a week. Regardless, the nonattendance of a day and night cycle proposes time doesn't appear, in every way, to be an excessive amount of unnatural, however rather a reflection, making it hard to serve the speed at which things are made and charge exchange streams out. Mass travel is a sketchy savage. It's missing to set down transport stops and get prepared stations; you need to plot out courses freely, or nobody will go wherever. It's unquestionably not hard to lose all capacity to peruse a compass in that, particularly as courses begin covering and it's dumbfounding to get your vehicle stop set on the privilege half of each obliged street. Nevertheless, there are a considerable measure of choices, and the endorphin surge from making a red advancement information overlay turn green makes everything upheld, despite all the burden. Close, structures are awe inspiring and point by point, direct down to little improvements like housetop fans turning. A slider in the choices menu gives us control over the measure of essentialness of-field obscure connected with inaccessible structures when zoomed in, which mirrors SimCity's drawing in diorama influence. Horizons doesn't sort out the graphical method for SimCity, nevertheless, and given the goliath numbers we see them in they don't correctly have the assortment foreseen that would keep most neighborhoods from emitting an impression of being vague. More than anything, Cities: Skylines is about the crucial satisfaction in building. It's a truly magnificent and as regularly as would be prudent staggering reenactment, where a bewildering number of virtual individuals continue ahead over a huge swath of land. Getting in and making something is direct, however acing it will require wide research on social event wikis to comprehend why progression is vexed regardless of when you address your subjects' prominent concerns. Try not to expect strengthening conditions or sporadic occasions, yet do plan to be awed by the scale and different moving parts of this city-build.(All reviews are retrieved from the Internet and piped through a succession of synonym tools three times both for humour and to save time.

My favorite part of SimCity 4 with Rush Hour and mods was dealing with traffic. There is something about planning for traffic and dealing with the aftermath of traffic issues that come with growth that really appeals to me. For me, then, Cities: Skylines really scratches that itch. I do get frustrated with services like garbage and, especially, funeral services. They do not make the game more fun. But for what I want it to do--be a traffic sim with a decent interface and a fun, if simple, city-building mechanic beneath it--this game is the best I have found.

A short while after draining the body of water, grass soon grows on what was once dirt and you can plop down more city. You can even put sewage pumps along that area beforehand, remove the water pumps before turning them on, and flood your new stretch of city with poop water. If you really hate your citizens, you can place new water pumps in the ruins of your new-ish poop-flooded part of the city and your citizens all throughout your city will become poisoined and die.Sure most of that has little to do with the whole city building thing most of the time but it tells me everything I need to know about their dedication to detail and sandbox mechanics."

After many, many, many failed attempts I finally had a large successful city. This were going very well for myself and I was happy... until my people started getting sick. It took me a minute to realize polluted water had got into my drinking water and was poisoning my people, bummer. I corrected the problem and thought all was well, nope. While my city continued to grow and expand a fairly large amount of business's struggled and would close. New business's would build atop of the old and would fail some how fail to draw business to themselves despite never having that problem before.. I have no idea why.There is one positive.

You start with a fairly decent sized square of land and can expand this out into a sprawling metropolis - giving you the satisfaction of seeing your efforts bloom into a real ""city"" rather than just an increasily busy, small square.Others have covered far more in-depth than I have - but from my point of view, as a casual player who likes to dip and out of the game, slowly building up a city that I can see previous efforts and decisions continue to impact, the game is an absolute winner.Highly recommend it!"

There were no stakes, only minor milestones that simply unlocked new buildings, and no clear reason to be building a city at all, other than the fact that you could. This has great appeal to some people, so I am not going to claim the game is bad, it is just not for me.I think the thing that pulled me out of it the most was that I could not understand what my people wanted. Why were they happy or unhappy? Why did they choose to live in one neighborhood over another? Were they not using the bus system I just built because I put it in the wrong place, or because they would rather drive? Were taxes to high or too low? What was my industry producing, and did they have what they needed, or were they struggling? Why did that building get built there, other than the fact that I made a road and designated that area for commercial use?I never felt like I understood what to do, so I just kept expanding and watching houses and businesses appear, and I hoped that all was well. The only interaction I had with the people in my city was with the simulated Twitter.

So, although I am somewhat biased, I can wholeheartedly recommend Cities: Skylines to any avid simulation gamer. The UI is quite intuitive and because of all the available mods and options, you have precize control on how you want to play the game in regards of economics, traffic managing and map design. If you are looking for a particular feature, the workshop is your best friend with thousands of mods and assets.A word of caution about minimal system recommendations, the better your rig, the more you will be able to get the most out of this game when it comes to actual gameplay and not just pretty looks or resolution. I have a 32 RAM, GTX 980ti accompanied with a 4770K CPU. At the moment I have 533 mods and assets installed and it takes about 7 minutes to load a new map. A saved game might be slightly longer but I haven't clocked that.I set all the graphics to max and after the first few hours I was forced to lower the settings slightly because the game began to bog down. A few more hours in and I have to experiment again with my settings because the larger the city, the more heavily your hardware will be challenged. Which is only logic, but I found that with one small street of extra industries or housing added can make the game from running smoothly to the commenly known tack-tack-tack motion the cars will be displayed while driving.It's easy to a add high amount of mods and assets, but it does ask for some insight on the player's side. Because sooner or later you will run into mods that aren't up to date or conflict with other mods. So if you're not too experienced or just can't be bothered, use these sparsely.Recommended because:- Precize control on indepth game mechanics and economics- Stunning graphics- Huge amounts of mods and assets available- Highly detailed and immersive- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the gamePoints of critic:- Gameplay experience depend quite heavy on up to date hardware- Mods and assets will sooner or later cause conflicts- Quite addicting. Feels like time in real life flies by as fast as in the game- Railway and harbour feels very basic and more of an afterthought"

But, it definitely is one of the great one for this genre.Here are some of its goods and bads.Goods:+ Its public transportation is much better than any other city builder out there, and I think it’s definitely the best one.+ District is an awesome feature. It makes each area in the city feels more distinct.+ Road tools is also great. We can make almost any road layout with the current tool.+ The area for the city is huge, with and without mod.+ The graphics is great. This one is a matter of preferences, but for me it’s great.+ Asset editor, map editor, scenario editor.+ Fully integrated with steam workshop made us easier to mod the game even further.+ Developer is very generous with its free patch. They even include day/night cycle for free, which they could charge it if they want with the After Dark DLC.Bads:- Building variety is lacking and feels a little lifeless. For the variety one, it’s not that big of a deal, since it can easily be fixed by mod and DLC.  fixed by Sunshine Harbor & Parklife DLC- Once building is built in, they won’t change the layout on upgrade. For example, 2 1x2 building won’t upgrade into 2x2 building. And also the biggest tile for growable building just 4x4 tiles. fixed by After Dark DLC fixed by Parklife DLC- We can’t export or import electricity, water, and sewage from the neighborhood. fixed by Natural Disaster DLC"

Good job for the developer(Colossal Order) who created this beautiful game that I really love to play, but as much as I love this game, I really hate how the publisher tried so hard to squeeze every single penny from this game, Like wow 200USD for a ""full"" game? Seriously? It's not even AAA+++++ games with RTX PRO MAX ON, 2000++ IQ AI, or a Very beautiful/natural/super-immersive game that will blow your head and turn your PC into a Concorde flying in supersonic speed.Don't get me wrong, Like I said, I love this game but the monetization by the publisher is just killing it. And yeah Mod do exist in this game and you can slap it till it exploded but you're still gonna miss few or tons of part that you cannot use till' you paid more. Lack of competition is prolly the reason why they're able or have a reason to charge you more, I hope there'll be other game like this that has better ""Value for money"" for us Low-Budget-gamer :c-Here's a simpler explanation about this game- It's like a Burger with Bun and patty, but it feels bland isn't? very normal stuff without other things like veggies, fries yadda-yadda, you can add Broccoli or a even chocolate(?) with mods if you're into it but few mods requires you to have a certain DLC like..

You can model the real world aesthetically and functionally with this game. You can build small towns, huge metropolises, and even small regions in Cities: Skylines. Especially with mods and a beefy PC, you can build anything you can imagine and spend as little or as much time getting every detail exactly the way you want it. This game is great for people who love to build and decorate as well as for those who like to solve puzzles. Traffic is a major challenge in this game, and it works very much like real life for the most part--so you'll need to learn how to deal with it to build large dense urban environments that work. There are tons of great DLCs and mods available for PC that add endless possibilities to the game. If you loved SimCity, this game seriously blows it out of the water--so jump in an buy it already!   ***Keep in mind that you'll want a decent computer for this game! An SSD and ample RAM definitely help, but the CPU power the simulator requires as your city increases in size is the most important factor to consider. A decent graphics card is all you need for this game, and it will look awesome."
1568,Cazgem,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cazgem/,3,,1,"2,978.6",October,"7,",81,0,1,"A fun, worthwhile purchase if I ever made one! I bought it as a mental distraction from school during a high-stress period, and haven't stopped since. The DLC's, while expensive, are super fun and are worth picking up if you find them on sale in particular. If you're wondering ""Where do I start?"" when it comes to which DLC's to buy, I recommend the following:1) Mass Transit - Overhauls Puiblic Transportation and allows for better movement of your citizens from one place to the next.2) Industries - This takes industrial areas into overdrive and is heavily focused on logistics, controlling import/export, and controlling production lines within new industrial zones for oil, farming, ore, and forestry and culminates in unique factory buildings that can be highly lucrative to your city, utilizing the end-products of many of your districts. If you like the nitty-gritty, logistics, and traffic management, this is for you!3) Campus - This allows you to create three new university campuses that replace the standard ""University"" building altogether. The three campus types each have a levelling up system (similar to industries DLC) and allow for expansive, realistic campus areas top form in your city. The end-game benefit of these are the 9 unique schools (3 per campus), 3 museums (1 per campus), and the academic library that bring significant benefits to your city's education system, medical centers, public transportation, tourism, and more. Finally, you gain access to 5 varsity sports parks that have regular gameday matches that bring in huge crowds, and make your citizens happy when you win and a little upset if you lose. If you love academia, want some logistics to manage, and have the itch to work on some beautification, then this is the DLC for you.4) Park Life - Whereas Industries is about systems and logistics, this one is all about beautification and leisure. This is the first DLC to feature the leveling up mechanic (from 1 to 5 stars) for each of the four park types: city park, zoo, nature reserve, and amusement park. Each area has different attractions, props, and visuals that when used properly can have a HUGE radius of effect in your city while also potentially encouraging your citizens to walk through the park instead of driving to work. This DLC is for any lover of the game, but particularly those interested in making things beautiful!Then, after these ""primary"" dlc's, there are a few other DLC's that add a bit, but not nearly as much as the above:Green Cities, After Dark, Snowfall, Match DayThese four DLC's are cheap and/or free (catch 'em on sale!), and are smaller in scope. Green Cities adds green infrastructure to your city such as bike lanes, eco water treatment plants, etc., After Dark adds leisure districts, cycle pathways, and a few transit options that are nice additions tot he base game. Snowfall adds snowy maps, the heating system, and a wealth of wintry assets that make for a fun new coat of paint on an already fun game. Match Day and the Music Festival DLCs add a little bit of management to your cities with a large sports stadium, and music festival grounds respectfully that are fun to design an area around.All around, this game is wonderful out the gate with lots of replayability. The DLC's magnify this, and the Steam Workshop mods multiply this even further. Even if you don't typically partake in city builders/simulation games, this is worth your time/effort/cash to try."

It is similar to the SimCity series however it allows for a lot more personal content and creativity that can make the game more realistic and fun. What is wonderful about this game being on steam, is that anyone can create their own assets and make them public for everyone else to enjoy on the Steam Workshop. This allows people to create a unique city that doesn't just include assets created by the developer. Players can also model real life cities such as Toronto with buildings such as the CN Tower, Rogers Centre and City Hall. Similar to other city building games, you can plan out which kind of zoning you want to be built there, you can manage planning policies such as height restrictions, traffic rules etc. There are many forms of transportation that can have their own transit lines with stops that you choose where they go. This game is not just about making the city look great, or how big it can get, or how many buildings you can place. This game is about making it function well and your goal is to create a good planned city that works for its people. I would recommend buying the DLC ""Mass Transit"" but I wouldn't recommend buying some of the other DLCs as they are too expensive and do not provide enough content to justify the price. Also to those people who are giving Cities:Skylines the game a negative review even though you like the game, just not the prices or content of the DLCs..... GO TO THE DLC'S STORE PAGE AND WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT IT. DO NOT WRITE A BAD REVIEW ON THE OVERALL GAME IF YOU LIKE IT BUT DON'T LIKE THE DLCs.Thanks"

They took the same idea and expanded into all the areas a good city builder should. Workshop support for player made buildings and mods make the game endlessly replayable.Make your own maps and build huge cities on them.  Creating bus lines, subway lines, feels great when streamlining your city.  The game really is best in class by far compared to all of its competitors. Pros- Great Mod/Workshop Support- Huge flexibility in designing roads and districts.- Runs great and looks great!- The details that you can see make the game really immersive.- Cars actually park on the street/in parking lots.- Good soundtrack.Cons- No nighttime (yet)- Had two incidents where the game crashed (possibly mod related)- One of my save files got corrupted. (Has been good for a while though)- Some buildings can be a tad finicky to place sometimes. Silly Airports.- No Multiplayer.- Traffic can be a little silly at times and won't utilize other lanes.

1610,quarxilon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/quarxilon/,3,,1,"1,307.3",July,"19,",66,0,1,"Finally, a perfect blend of two classic genres: urban planning and traffic management. Especially traffic management. Although the game is meant to be a successor to Simcity 4 and an epic ""take that"" at Simcity 5, it's more of an expansion pack for Cities in Motion 2 since you'll be spending most of your time building costly road layouts and alleviating impossibly-complex traffic grimlocks originating from said road layouts. Thankfully this time you have a proper user-friendly GUI and grid/non-grid transition system to assist you when placing and aligning splines according to your OCD level. Be sure to always focus on transit-oriented development rather than classic suburban sprawl as this game is almost completely Northwest Euro-centric in nature.Compared to SC4 though, many vital elements are either oversimplified or nonexistent; whilst new concepts such as sewage disposal are shoved up your ass without regard to any learning curve, and normally mundane tasks become so overpowered such that it's an instant game-over if your rubbish trucks are too slow. (No, seriously.) Starting a new town, however, is considerably less tedious as there are in-built milestones to restrict asset requirements to your population growth level. But ultimately, this game is set in the present day, when your cims expect everything from power to water and even Internet services from the moment you zone your first residential area and have nearly zero tolerance or grace period for any unfortunate events; so treat all your peepur like stereotypical teenage white girls at all times or it's express bankruptcy for you. Whether take this as a challenge or setback, your mileage may vary. Interesting new features like fluid mechanics and restricted aviation pathways also help to determine your final city layout, reducing the monotony of the mid-game era.Personally, I feel that Colossal Order have definitely learnt from most of their mistakes committed in CIM2; whether or not Paradox published games' infamous DLC-spam policy also applies to this release is yet to be confirmed. Many of the other ""overwhelmingly positive"" reviews seem to be rants from starved city-building fanboys and SC5 haters who long-awaited a player-friendly magnum opus of the genre, praising CSL for the messianic role it plays in the wake of SC5's epic failure with little thought about the potential shortcomings of this hastily-released masterpiece. Even though flaws in the Unity Engine's ability to cope with the game design remain evident, it's clear why this game broke 1,000,000 purchases in about the time it took for Gangnam Style views to hit 100 times that number. And yes, you can mod that in-game too, for free."

There is immediate satisfaction when buildings start to be built in the zones that you assign.- The ability to assign any area you want as a district and make it follow the unique policies that you set can be fun.- This game also brings a challenge as you ave to figure out how to make the traffic flow without any major traffic jams.It is definitely worth getting and especially if you got SimCity and was disappointed in the result of that game."

There is so much more complexity and entertainment to be found in this game over SC.I've only played 18 Hours of it so far and in that time I've roamed around Los Santos from GTA 5, Venice, France, UK and Gotham.I've ruined two worlds by accidentally polluting the water and putting thousands of people in hospital running up my debt and now finally after those 18 hours I've finally got the hang of the game and I'm now safely running a 30k pop world and rising.PROs- Higher learning curve required over SM- In-depth tax, resource management, budget system- Mods- Large Landscape- Custom MapsCONs- No autosave feature- Mods disable achievements- Manual BulldozerPossible future patches could include the cons listed.An autosave feature would be a godsend, every so often my PC decides to randomly cut off for no reason and if I haven't sayed for quite some time, that's a huge chunk of my time wasted as I'll have to do it all over again.Some mods actually benefit the game without deteriorating from the experience (unlimited cash) such as a the autosave mod.Having to manually click each indivual road or house item can over time become tedious, automating this like the Bulldozer in SM would be beneficial"

I didn't watch videos to familiarize myself with it, but I did have to look up two questions I had in Google during my marathon.  That's not bad, right?

1626,High Steaks,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nnog/,4,,1,14.2,March,"12,",205,0,1,"Really love this game. It's what Sim City 2013 should have been. Plenty of teething problems that need patching though. Poor multi-lane traffic behaviour for one. Vehicles tend not to pass eachother and clump up when merging regardless of the number of lanes. Highway ramps are waay too good. They are one direction, single lane but vehicles go full highway speed on them, regardless of what you're joining to, making them a panacea for traffic troubles. Jam at a junction? throw down some ramps! kinda fun though.Sweet water physics in this game but don't bother building a hydro dam. The resevoir becomes static and you get no energy out after a while, at which point you may as well mercilessly delete it and wipe out your newly zoned industrial district because what the hell you made a save point just before. Also the flood plains don't become any more fertile, and space is plentiful in this game, so what's the point? Huge tankers can (as is a rule in city-sims) turn on a dime at 180 degrees a second in shallow waters, but harbors still need to be placed in direct line of sight to sea... what? Why can't they navigate a simple estuary? Helmsman is wasted potential.I had a major problem with garbage. You can't simply remove dumps without emptying them first. When you empty, say to an incinerator, ALL the dumps trucks are used to empty it, and still takes forever, making the city suffer... if you don't notice thats whats happening. Also dead people (if they die in residences) are not dealt with by ambulences. You need hearses to come pick them up. Not only that, but like dumps, cemetaries become full, so with a click of a button the church is digging up the bodies, throwing them back in the hearse and driving them to the crematorium. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ brilliant.Districts and policies are a great feature. Combined with the sheer map sizes, they make it feel like a real city. You can have a high density downtown with a rent thats too damn high, an industrial district with reduced safety laws, more accidents and huge profits, some farms, a woodland reserve, a Beverly Hills with ridiculous taxes and high land value, all while forgetting about Jim who lives next to the dump and is dying from air, water and noise polution (yes, noise does hospitalise people in this game. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ genius.)Despite all the extra challenges, its still very easy to make a huge income. Partially because a lot of the expensive services pay toward themselves, you have loads of space to work with (See achievement ""SIMulated City: Have an area the size of nine map tiles"" - shots fired) but mainly because freight harbors are OP as ♥♥♥♥. Shame there isn't too much of an end-game as Sim City, as that had Godzilla, zombie outbreaks and Great Works... Definitely missing out on these features. I mean come on, you need cemetaries to hold the dead... it logically follows that when it maxes capacity there should be zombie incidents. Someone make this happen with mods, please?TL;DR: Solves the problems of Sim City, creates a couple of its own.

The developers are active as well.However, I do not recommend modding it which is unfortunate because modders have created such amazing content that you'll never want to go back to vanilla once you mod it.Mods just destroy the stability of the game and that's without any conflicts whatsoever.Loading times are positively immense and SSDs don't fix it.Simple commands such as ""quit to main menu"" become broken.Curiously, uninstalling and removing all files and saves and associations doesn't fix the various stability problems. Once the game is broken, it's broken. The only thing that fixed it for me was when I switched to a new OS with new drives...and of course some basic ""core"" mods immediately caused the same stability problems.The core game is excellent. Modding it ruins everything and sends you down a rabbit hole of seeking detail and perfection.

1631,Awesome Alec,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AwesomeAlec/,3,,1,281.5,October,"26,",409,0,1,"Picking up in a world where good city builders are far and inbetween, Cities Skylines has a lot to offer. Much of the complaints about Sim City 2013, world size, always online drm, limited modding, are one of the top selling points of this game. This game has a massive moding community with not only tons of vehicles and buildings, but also gameplay altering mods that change how traffic behaves, adds more roads, and so much more. This game is a great addition to the city building genre, but there are some critisisms in mind that I wish this game did better. The challenge in this game is often lacking, once you build up any kind of positve cash flow, the game turns into a city painting simulator with minimal management necessary. I also wish the game handeled some aspects of it more like Sim City 2013. Education in Cities Skylines tweaks how often sims burn down their house, and what jobs they tend to go to. In Sim City, education would make industrial zones cleaner, people wealthier, and more, along with with Cities Skylines already has. At the end of the day, both games have their stengths and weaknesses, Sim City has a stronger city manager game, and Cities Skylines is a great tool for people to sculpt their perfect cities with ease."

In SC4, education played a more diffuse role : on development, traffic, crime, etc. - in short : the effects were more subtle and organic, you needed to consider your city as a whole and to really dig up the semi-opaque system. This is the same for almost everything, including policies.In that matter, even if CS might appear as SImcity at surface, it is very different and in fact more simplistic at core, having only space management and maybe traffic management as things to balance.Having all the DLCs, the game is pleasing as a slow-paced relaxing game (some radios are incredible) but seriously, all the DLCs for just that ? No real simulation engine improvment, lacking features (snow : I lwas hyped by this but the mechanic is just dump, a city is either almost every day covered by snow or never, no seasons, ...). The only good things about having all is having at least variety to building, else the game feels pretty bland...Bland...this is the word which comes at the end. Thjis game has just not the humor and the atmosphere of the good old Simcities. It can look beautiful but this does ironically create the same feeling of ""leaving"" city, you do not really feel as a mayor.As an evaluation, I would put a mixed review but end up with a ""No"" because of the recent direction, for the terrible value for price and teh fact that there is not enough ""No"".PS : it is funny to see how EA is ruined by people but the DLC policy of CS is not that better. Compared to SC5, OK (hard to do worse than this in terms of content), but it doe snot mean that Paradox/CO are angels. Their DLCs are half-finished and expensive. I'd rather pay more for FINISHED expansion than for this"

The DLCs add a really nice amount of features, but I dislike when a company creates new features mainly to take more money from you than actually deliver new content that worths a DCL and not a simple update.The other main issue is that this game cannot have more ram.

I may not exactly agree with some of the pricing for some of the DLC, but I would have recommended the base game regardless. However, with the launcher update, I don't think I can honestly recommend this to others. I simply don't understand what they were thinking when they decided upon such an action. I won't speak for others, but personally, I don't feel the need, nor the desire to be signing up for an account with Paradox's website just to play a game that I've already been using just fine until now without one. If I had felt said desire, I would have already done so without basically being forced to do it. I've read that some people have found work-arounds for not using the launcher, but the fact that's even necessary is just a tad ridiculous. All of the reasons stated in the post that came with the update for the reason why the launcher was implemented also seem rather weak, such as it making it possible for people to see news about sales and such without the need for social media (which I have long ago abandoned), something that I can already find out through Steam easily enough."

Other than that, you cant fault the game for much. With the right mods the game can keep you busy for weeks just micromanaging the immense amount of traffic in the endgame until it finally just works, before you notice that traffic at the other end of the city randomly broke again, or your ore mines need to be moved. This is the perfect game who loved making model railways with landscapes as a child, except you do the whole city and have to accommodate a sometimes very stubborn citizen AI (Why are a billion cars trying to get through this single lane?).

I stayed away from SimCity 2013 after hearing all the bad reviews, although I enjoyed SimCity 4 a great deal. Being able to customize assets with a neat in game tool is pretty sweet. Having the game be very open towards modding is a huge plus too, and hopefully the developers will update the game frequently with bug fixes and new features.What the game should improve on/add -- Population and job density: After upgrading low density commerce and residential to high density (which at first looks like the equivalent of medium density buildings from SimCity 4), the increase in jobs and population per building is quite low. The city I have right now has a decent amount of medium high rises, yet sits only at around 10,000 population. If I had built this city in SimCity 4 I would probably have around double the population I do in Cities: Skylines. I'm sure some modders will fix this, but it would be nice to be fixed in vanilla too.- Allow for roads to be dragged across other roads: Currently if I want to build a 4 lane street and connect across multiple 2 lane streets, I have to drag and connect to the first one, then stop, click again and connect to the 2nd, since if you try to simply drag them across all the roads at once the game brings up the ""space in use"" error. - The graphics: Yes I know graphics aren't everything, and I don't need an amazing looking game for the game to be fun. My beef with the graphics is that the buildings and terrain have this blurry feel to them most of the time, which is acceptable viewing them from a distance, but up close they should be pretty clear to the camera. - The cars: In my opinion they look too plain and generic. Yes they have different colors and types, but for the most part they honestly look like those colored cars from The Game of Life board game. More realistic and detailed cars would be nice to see.- Ability to drive around your city, akin to the U-Drive-It mode from SimCity 4. Definitely not necessary to add in the game, but would be neat to drive around the city, either first person or 3rd person. 1st person would be much cooler, but 3rd person would be easier to code in most likely.Overall I would recommend getting this game if you like city builders.

Fixing it is very frustrating, or even impossible, due to bugs, and requires tearing it down and retrying- spending budget and time. Bad results and frustration are the reward for understanding this game's ""logic"".  There are however, other (non road) solutions for traffic problemsAlthough the game is fun at first, quickly, you realize you _NEED_ one way roads (because there is a bug where cars _always_ stop even if by every rule and logic THEY DO have priority.) and thus overpasses to get these connected. Having just come from a session of FAILING to construct workable overpasses about 20 times in a row, I am done with this game.Every time I get a road constructed the way I like it, it tends to be constructed wrong direction. This means I have to change the direction, but- with my overpasses- I  get a mesage I have no room. So I tear it down, try again, repeat X20.When it finally works, it looks like a piece of crap.Since there is no 'mixed' review I have no idea to vote it up or down. I'm conflicted."
1714,Boomer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PatchOnline/,3,,1,373.9,August,"1,",469,0,1,"Making the sequel to a beloved, but dormant, franchise must be tough. I can’t imagine having to satisfy the expectations of both fans and investors alike to be an easy goal. Do you sacrifice the hardcore, ultra-loyal, fans by appeasing the masses, streamlining the game to reach a broad an audience as possible and in turn potentially maximize profitability? Or do you go full niche, give in to every request by the long-time players, making the game an unintuitive, unprofitable mess? For EA, and Maxis (R.I.P), the choice was easy. Screw the fans, casual gamers are all the rage. And so, Sim City (2013) was born. It made a butt-load of money, and a million people played it intensely for a month. But crippling online features, limited gameplay accessibility, and lack of sustained support from Maxis led to it ultimately being forgotten, and such an embarrassment to EA that the franchise was put on hold indefinitely. While the fans remained hungry for the true successor to Sim City 4, they wouldn’t have to wait too long. Not more than two years later, a tiny Finnish developer - Colossal Order - backed by the Swedish kings of strategy – Paradox Interactive – stepped up. They’d seen an opportunity to do right what Maxis could not, and make a boatload of cash at the same time. Cities: Skylines was released in March 2015 to thunderous applause. “At last”, the people cried, “at last the King has come.” Both critic and gamer alike rejoiced that someone had heard their whimpering sorrows. Sure, it wasn’t the godsend gift many had hoped for. It was a little rough around the edges, but something had filled the gaping hole of a vacuum that Sim City had left. There was freedom. There was room to expand. And more importantly, perhaps, it was community friendly.And that was the thing - Colossal had been listening from the very beginning. They heard the complaints from Sim City, and responded aptly when making Cities. And when concerns were rising over their own game, they listened, and responded. The community asked for daytime cycles, Colossal answered. The community asked for disasters, Colossal answered. If the community accomplished something Colossal could not, they looked to the community as an example. Mods became a staple of the game, and many features that have made their way into the game post launch have been through the mod scene.For many people, nothing will ever be able to truly topple the King of City Simulators, a.k.a. Sim City 4, just through sheer nostalgia. The game was more or less the uncontested champion for over a decade. Gamers have poured countless hours into that game; I know I have. But Cities: Skylines certainly tried, and in my opinion, with great effort and success. I adore Sim City 4, but it certainly feels dated. And while Cities may be lacking in certain areas, I have to say it sits an equal to SC4 in most ways. And the ease of modification for the less technically inclined (myself included) through the workshop, adds a ton of replayability. So, to summarize, Cities: Skylines is the true successor to Sim City 4 we always wanted – and Colossal Order have certainly outdone themselves. If you’re looking for a City sim, this is the game to get. Out of the box, the game is easy to get into and gives you plenty of room to learn its quirks. The game revolves around problem solving, and most of them require creative thinking. Of course, if you feel either over- or underwhelmed, there are ways to either increase or decrease difficulties in certain areas of the game. It may require a mod or two, but the community is large and very creative, and whatever you seek has probably already been created.So pick it up now, or wait for a sale. It doesn’t matter. If you have the creative itch, you’re a problem solver, and like to look at pretty cityscapes, play Cities: Skylines."

1717,GG =(,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vacbanblyat/,7,,1,4.3,September,"28,",39,0,1,"Cities: Skylines is a city builder developed by Colossal Order, the guys who were responsible for making the Cities in Motion series, and published by Paradox Interactive, and I have to say this is hands down the best city builder we’ve ever had on Steam .The size of the game is astonishing, by default the game features a 36km^2 map which is almost ten times the size of the map we’re given in SimCity 2013, and with the help of mods from the Steam Workshop, this can be expanded to a mind boggling 100km^2. Even though there are no interactions between cities that are on different maps, it is frankly not necessary, with the help of the powerful yet easy to use building tool, you can build multiple cities on a single map.Despite its humongous size, the developers paid close attention to details, in fact, detail is the word I’ll use to describe this game. From the entire traffic network, down to individual citizens, every aspect in Cities: Skylines are properly simulated. You’ll find lorries, colour coded depending on what they are currently carrying, delivering their cargoes to their designated factories, citizen actually living in a permanent home, and ambulances rushing to accident scenes, then little paramedics will get out of their vehicle, and few seconds later return with a patient on a stretcher. I also love how water works in this game as well as the fluid physics, it is completely unnecessary to have it in a city builder but in this case it has added so much more to the experience. Water has currents and flows, so you'll want to pump water on the upstream and set up sewage pipes on the opposite end, else you’ll start pumping polluted sewage water back into the system. You can even drain a lake dry completely, or accidentally flooding your city because you demolished a dam, playing with water has never been so fun. This is a city builder perfected, and with the support of Steam Workshop, further enriched by the endless creativity of the community. Cities: Skylines is a must buy for anyone who has the slightest interest in city builders."

It is more flexible compared to other (city) building games and revived the old genre somewhat. Now to why this game recived a negativ review: DLC-Policy!!!To me it is incomprehendable why Paradox keeps going with the way they release DLCs. Either they live in their own bubble, where they keep recieving praise for there DLC or there are enough people falling for there scam..The game was released in 2015. Since then little chanced in this game. As it is typical for Paradox there were occasional ""free"" patches acompanied with a somewhat expensive DLC compared to what you acutaly recieve. Mayor free Changes where the Night-Day-Cycle, Weather and upcoming ""Green Cities"". All of these mechanics where- to put it nicely- a nice addition to your game, above all it increased the immersion.  But then there are the DLCs. Paradoxs DLC-Policy was always somewhat questionable but with Cities:Skylines it almost feels like your part of a big scam! There is almost zero subtance to all of the published and to be published DLCs. Don´t get me wrong there are mechanic hidden in the DLCs but it is content that should have been in the game in the first place. All you get when buying one off the DLCs is a new building here or a new specilization for your districts there (like leisure or tourism in after dark) . Other existing mechanics get more fleshed out. The upcomig DLC ""Greener City"" will finally feature the possibility to handel the sewage! What a revolutionary feature!"

While to a certain extent it is true, the replayability of this game is heavily increased and the gameplay itself is enhanced with the addition of community contributers who created some pretty amazing mods, which is one of the reason I am now addicted to this game :P+ Fancy graphics! Slightly cartoony though :P+ Heavily animated in many ways, such as character animations, they don't look so robotic especially human-dog interactions :)+ Strong modding community whether you are after cheaty types of mods or simply gameplay enhancements+ Really nice strategy game that puts a lot of gamers to test with city planning, or else you might mess your entire game up. But when complimented with mods it may turn this game into a casual gameplay to kill your spare time :)+ Although lack of tutorial, there's a huge community of players making youtube guides etc and the game itself can be easily picked up after a few hours of play through~ AI Pathing are a little meh, most of them only ever takes the shortest routes possible and end up clogging up even my 6  lane roads (I mean IRL you could pick different routes to your destination, but sadly, ain't the case in C:S). With mods it takes a good chunk of traffic into alternative roads and ease the traffic though!~ Can't play it on the go with my surface pro, but that's not the dev's fault :P So people with wooden laptops, this game might brick your laptop before you can load into a game hehe- DLCs are a tad bit pricey with what the content offers (e.g Snowfall DLC offers new challenges in winter settings, but lack of seasonal effects, feels like I am colonising Antarctica all year round, and trams ain't offered in Mass Transit sadly, so I had to buy them both :( ), though most of us players don't mind and yell ""shut up and take my money"" anyways. - Perhaps have an actual tutorial town/scenario for beginners in the future so people like me don't have to keep watching youtube videos or go trial and error and waste x amount of hours straight.Overall: 8/10, can't wait to throw more money at them when they push out new DLCs :P"

Traffic is awesome and your city can contain up to a million individuals that have an actual life-cycle. Features a really simple building and zoning system with excellent tools to make it how you want. Maps are huge and has water with real dynamics.All this, on the Unity Engine, which is pretty amazing! Oh, and it comes with full modding support (w/Steam Workshop integration)!Now, It's not perfect and could use some improvments in some areas (see below), but I'm sure Colossal Order will provide us with plenty of updates and expansions in the coming future.

There are hours and hours of fun here!What I did not like (this might change):- Bulldozer tool does not support destroying large areas, only one object at a time- Laying down water-pipes is kind of boring (Maybe I just got spoiled by SC2013 here)- Placing buildings on curved roads can be kind of hard in some cases- Placing down large intersections from assets kan be hard if the terrain is not perfectly straight- Placing roads straight relative to the border is really hard because the road does not snap (SC2013 had the Shift key for this)- The ""Tutorial"" you get when start the game is not that good- The ""Tutorial"" popus can get annoying- Music does not seem to be normalized, becoming way to loud in some sectionsWhat I liked:- Everything else"

As a complete package I would rate this game over Sim City and it's expansion pack ""Cities of Tomorrow"". Bigger zones to build out on, basically these equal the size of Sim City regions. Better road management options, better public transport option (subways!), Day/Night cycle based budgeting, mods, great graphics, overall a more complicated but more rewarding game.Couple of things it falls short on would be budgeting, while you have more fine tuned options to adjust your finances, it lacks the ability that Sim City has where you can indivualy reduce/increase funding to say schools. In Cities Skylines if you adjust the budget for Education it affects all schools, so for example one school may need more funding because it overcrowed. By increasing the funding to education it increases all school funding nore matter the type. So while I may now have enough money to suuport the Elementary school, my high school is now over funded. Region play is missing from Cities: Skyline but makes up for it in the size of maps. Plus the avaliability of terraforming and making your own map!Industry is handled better in Sim City than Cities: Skylines hands down. While in Sim City specializing in certain industries (Oil, Ore, etc..) has a progression type mechanic too it, you dont start out with all the goodies. In Skylines you more or less lay down Industry tiles, district it to whatever you're trying to produce (farms for instance) and just kind of let it go. No real interaction with it like there is with Industry in Sim City.In my personal opinion it's still a vastly more fun game and with Steam Workshop support the possiblities are endless!"

While their games reliably still clear the low bar set by some of their competition — there’s a world of difference between the noble failure of “Star Citizen” and the artless cynicism of “PLAYERUNKNOWN‘S BATTLEGROUNDS” — three entire “Assassin‘s Creed” games have taken their toll.Now, with sequels becoming more of a rule than an exception, Colossal Order finds themselves at something of an inflection point in their young history: Are they going to recommit to the bold originality that made them such a powerhouse, or are they going to continue recycling old stories in order to maintain a steady diet of new product?The answer, it seems, is both.Fresh and stale in equal measure, “Cities: Skylines” represents the best of what Colossal Order can be, and the worst of what they’ve become. Impressively, it often does both of those things at the exact same time, the game illustrating the developer’s limitless imagination, but doing so in the service of a tediously derivative adventure that can’t withstand even a scintilla of scrutiny. This a game that finds them trying some (long overdue) new things, while also falling into some of their worst habits; a game that doesn’t come to life until it enters the Land of the City Builders.All of it — the good and the bad — is on full display right from the very first scene, which crams five generations of sordid family history into a prologue that’s as dazzlingly inventive as it is frustratingly schematic. Illustrated in a series of houses spawning from the ground, so colorful that you almost wish the whole game was told in two-dimensional cutouts, the player (you) tells us the tale of his great-great-grandparents, who became city builders.The fissure that resulted from that selfish decision cut so deep that the player still feels it when his story begins 100 years of solitude later. An otherwise sweet old lady, the boy’s painfully underwritten the hostile mayor has banned all music from the traditional Mexican city that she shares with the player, his parents, and his senile great-grandmother, Cities: Skylines. This being a Colossal Order game, however, the player has a dream. And wouldn’t you know it, his dream is to become the greatest musician since his idol, the late and legendary Sim City, a statue of whom stands over the square in the center of town. Eventually, the player becomes convinced that Sim City is his great-great-grandfather, and through a hazy series of events that feel more inspired by “Anno” than they do anything else, he’s spirited away into the Land of the City Builders in order to find the guy and get his blessing.The set-up is as labored as it sounds, “Team Frotress” lead designer Valve and co-lead designer Gaben do everything they can to bring us into this world with the same kind of succinct grace that gave “Left 4 Dead” and “Shovel Knight” such instant power. It’s not enough. The first 20 minutes of “Cities: Skylines” are tedious at best and cringe-worthy at worst, the game plunging into a non-white community with the same child-like enthusiasm with which Colossal Order has previously immersed itself into any number of fantastical realms. As great as it is that Colossal Order finally created a protagonist of color, the exoticism of the player’s world almost defeats the purpose.This hyper-detailed game displays a clear respect for city building culture — three cheers for racially appropriate casting! — but seeing city builder folklore through such a distinctly American lens results in a nagging sense of otherness. It doesn’t strike this white critic as a fatally grievous problem in a game that takes some positive steps forward, but the sheer Colossal Order-ness of the whole thing makes it feel like “Cities: Skylines” is wearing another country like a costume. This isn’t just a matter of identity politics, even young kids will notice how awkwardly the developer-issue premise clashes with a story that doesn’t support it.Like a rat who dreams of being a chef, or a superhero forced to blend into suburbia, the player’s destiny runs perpendicular to his place in life, but that’s not what “Cities: Skylines” wants to be about. There are a number of reasons why it game leaps off the screen as soon as the player crosses the bridge into the spirit world, but one of them is that Colossal Order’s screenplay abruptly shifts its priorities. As a story about destiny and desire, “Cities: Skylines” is as lifeless as its supporting cast. As a gleefully macabre children’s game about remembering those who have come before us, it’s a soulful delight. That those two ideas remain as separate as the land of the shooters and Land of the city builders prevents this from becoming one of Colossal Order’s best, but “Cities: Skylines” finally sings when it crosses over to the underworld.A fluorescent kingdom that resembles a blacklight Disneyland, the Land of the city builder is remarkably well fleshed out for a place that’s entirely populated by skeletons. They get to live in this city building realm and dance the grim fandango for as long as they’re remembered by someone on the gaming industries; once forgotten, poof, they’re gone for good. We get to visit on a city named by yourself, when the city builders cross over and visit the loved ones who remember them, a process that involves the dead passing through an airport-like immigration check to confirm that someone has actually placed a photograph of them on their mantle. That bodes well for celebrities like Sim City, but not so well for scoundrels like No Man‘s Sky, who dresses up like a good game in an amusing attempt to fool the authorities. The Virgil to the player’s game, Cities: Skylines leads the player through a magical underworld, befriending his ancestors — and some truly awesome houses, or animated bunch of pixels — along the way.The naked desperation of the city structure provides the heart and soul of the game, and it’s genuinely touching to see the player partner up with family members he either misses or never got to meet (and to see them meet him in return). When it comes to kids games about the first stirrings of loss and the bittersweet gift of memory, “Cities: Skylines” might lack the emotional directness of last year’s “Pacman,” but it’s redeemed by its perspective. The dead are marvelously designed, their bones so tactile-looking that the game almost looks as though it were shot with animatronic models. Even when a villain is revealed and the story begins to sour, there’s so much to see that your eyes remain transfixed even as your mind starts to poke holes in the premise (why does the player need to bring a photograph back if he now remembers an how the city looked without one? Are cities built before the invention of photographs totally screwed? Does Instagram mean that we’re all going to be stuck down there forever?).The finale underscores the feeling that the game doesn’t really add up, and it doesn’t help that Sim City’s signature song, “Spongebob Squarepants,” is an eminently forgettable ballad. But by that point, your eyes will be too drunk on visual splendor for your ears to notice. If “Cities: Skylines” leaves us in a conflicted state, it’s a fitting end for a game that finds Colossal Order stuck at a familiar crossroads, unsure of how to handle their heritage. All the same, it’s good to see that there’s still some life in their ideas."

The UI is a little obtuse in some areas, and not all of the important information is clearly conveyed, but you can get used to it.  Traffic is a big part of the game, and the quality of your road layouts will make or break your city.  Fortunately, the AI is very adept at pathfinding through your streets, and problem locations can easily identified by the traffic jams.  The economy is very easy and forgiving, so you can mostly just focus the fun part of designing and not have to worry much about micromanaging your economy.  Everything SimCity (2015) did wrong, this game did right."
1766,Rakqoi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/rakqoi/,3,,1,60.9,November,"29,",607,0,1,"Cities: Skylines, though a pretty good city simuation game, is more of a city painter. Many mechanics are simplified and automated (electricity and plumbing come to mind), leaving you plenty of time to focus on building your roads and districts exactly how you want them. The game actually provides little to no challenge, beyond your first city. Once you understand the basic mechanics, literally the only difficult part of the game is managing traffic, but once you get that down, nothing is more satisfying than watching cars and trucks flow freely throughout your beautifully crafted city. If you're looking for a challenging simulation strategy game, this game may not scratch your itch. But if you're seeking to watch your tiny settlement grow to a sprawling utopia, crafted specifically to your liking, this game is amazing."

Game is fun once you get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ out of the way.=====Tencent (They have stock in Paradox, heads up) just mandated the addition of a standalone telemetry launcher with three EULAs and mandatory account creation to access the game that's been without such until now. The only thing the application does is service targeted ads, enlist you in an email campaign, and grab as much data out of your C drive as it can. (No options on where to install, instead installs directly into AppData, USER/Roaming, and USER/Local before sending multiple megabytes of telemetry information to their servers.While there is a workaround to completely disable and uninstall the launcher  it should not have come to this.I still play the game because I enjoy it, but I have blocked all outgoing network traffic from the game and all other paradox titles. Cannot recommend until telemetry gathering is removed entirely."
1770,MiniFi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/minifi/,3,,1,219.3,June,"6,",69,0,1,"The best description of this game is a ""City Sandbox"" than as a city simulator. You'll notice many people who really love the game love design and have felt hampered by requirements imposed by other city games. If you are looking for a realistic simulation then this isn't for you. Unless you are talking about traffic. Road network flow is actually quite accurate and you can spend hours trying to figure out how to design a proper road system, or how to mess it up. The game is beautiful, the cities are fun to build, playing with the water tool is fun, seeing each simulated character using your transit system is emjoyalbe. All opinions, mind.The biggest drawback for this game is probably the lack of difficulty/accurate simulation. If you are looking for something that attempts to respond as a real city, you won't find it here. Basically, the game is very very forgiving. I've been able to get almost every achievement on my vanilla starter town, even the hard 'evil mayor' ones. In fact, the largest difficulty I've had involved getting everyone sick to get the landmark, then building extra hospitals and buldozing half the city's polluted water supply to try and get back afloat. All admidst my population dropping to about 1/8 of what it was. Coming back was really hard but also really fun. There is potential for things to be difficult, but you usually have to make it yourself.Same with an accurate simulation. You can't reinact Pittsburgh by cutting the school budget to pay for a football stadium and see the uneducated aftermath - in fact all education in this game seems unreal to me. People are happy with water, power, and a job. It is a difficulty figuring out how to make them unhappy! Again, it's a city sandbox. The game tries really hard not to force anything on you. I think there are pros and cons to this method, but this game is good at what it sets out to do.Tons of mods. Not everything can be changed but much can, which is really fun. I'm planning to learn some C# to edit some things about this game, and possibly add more depth to the simulation.TL;DR, when making your decision, remember:City Sandbox not City Simulatorand make your decision based off of that. 8/10"

If SimCity 2013 was too small for you and your people not having a permanent workplace and a home annoyed you immensely, then Cities: Skylines is what you need.Of course, some things that many people enjoyed in SimCity 2013, like modular buildings, are not present in this one, but this is only true for the out-of-the-box game. The wonderful thing about this game is that you have an enormously creative community that publishes a huge amount of mods that range from simple ""quality of life"" fixes to new game mechanics and total revamps. The game provides easy-to-use mod tools that allow you to stop relying on someone to make this thing you always wanted for you and try to create it yourself.All in all, this is is a great game that motivates you to learn new things (like real-world city and road design) and rewards you with stunning views of the masterpiece that you have built - only to encourage you to start a new city that would be even better and creative than the previous one.I have played this game for more than 100 hours and I definitely look forward to playing it more when the new Natural Disasters DLC comes out."

There is also a very nice camera mode for all of us screenshot freaks out there. The controls are good as well.Fully expanding one map takes about 30 to 50 hours depending on what playstyle you’ll choose. I’d recommend against a speed-run, main reason being the built-in mod with unlimited money so you can go wild with that if you wish. The game has a quite laid back vibe to it and even features a 2x and 3x fast forward buttons, however it can be punishing if you decide to go fast. On the other hand, even if you go slowly you just can’t avoid some trouble; after all it’s a city! What I found especially hard in this department was a ‘death wave’. Building quite a few cemeteries and crematoriums will help you with that, but you must be prepared for your population to decline once in a while. That’s the least of your problems, though, if you decide to buy Natural Disasters or Snowfall DLCs.You won’t be disappointed with what this game has to offer in terms of managing layers of your city. Everything is there, from water pipes to international airport. The experience is great even without any of the numerous DLC packs, although some do add substantial content (Mass Transit, After Dark, Parklife).If you opt for one of the European maps, make sure you consciously decide what kind of buildings you wish to have because there are two types. European version looks much classier and simply beautiful; however buildings don’t become as tall even when on maximum level – it’s just as developers thought we don’t have skyscrapers in Europe. You get them in ‘vanilla’ mode (by default on non-European maps), but lower-level assets look quite ugly there, a little bit too generic and with too much screaming colour for my taste. Luckily, you can assign ‘European’ or vanilla style on a district to district basis. Last thing I’d like to praise is the fact that industry zones and office zones are interchangeable, so you can make up your mind if fighting constant pollution is your cup of tea, or would you rather turn your citizens into corporation rats.I highly recommend this game.Do yourself a favour and give it a try next time it's on sale. 9/10"
1797,"Me, I'm Counting",https://steamcommunity.com/id/st0m/,12,,0,405.3,January,"23,",626,0,1,"This game is fun, and I've spent many hours on it. However I'm gonna say overall it's not been the best experience. Each time I come back to the game I have to re-build my mod list. This is a mixture of the classic drop-off of interest from developers over time, but also that every new DLC release seems to break previous mods. The rate that DLC comes out for this game (usually not free) means that mods are lucky to survive for more than 12 months without being broken, abandoned, and then superceeded. The DLC itself is fairly pricey for what little they add (£10 for snow: wow!), yet you're still reliant on user-created mods to get the game working in a reasonable and coherent way.Mods such as Precision Engineering, MoveIt and Traffic Manager (TMPE) are almost essential to be able to accurately and easily create road layouts that function in a realistic manner. Without them the traffic in this game suffers badly from poor routing and quickly becomes overloaded and bogged down. Considering these issues have been present since release they're long overdue for some TLC.Most recently the devs saw fit to add a ""launcher"" to the game. This appears to do nothing more than take an age to start up before closing when you launch the game. It's designed to push the usual irrelevant drivel (social marketing campaigns, advertisements, various encouragements to hand over your personal details, etc) yet it doesn't seem to offer anything worthwhile for the user. I can only assume this is the latest method of gathering data about the playerbase without actually paying attention to the current complaints and issues.

However, in this case it's different, on the basis that the launcher was released out of the blue a couple days ago and:- The game takes agonisingly longer to load. Booting this game feels like it takes at least three times as long as it used to, not including the extra clicking you have to do to actually start it when the launcher loads.- Worse performance. The game wasn't well optimised for very large population cities before, and for whatever reason I'm getting more stutters and worse fps with the new launcher. Nice.- The launcher installs itself without consent when you attempt to start the game. In addition, I haven't tested this myself but the launcher is apparently not uninstalled when the game is either, so if you're uninstalling the game be sure to check that.- 3 EULAs when launching it for the first time after the launcher update. For data tracking. This is ""nothing to do with taking private info. We get some basic telemetry, but we're not installing spyware."" but it's still quite hmmmm. What is ""basic telemetry""? What is it used for? is it anonymous?- This telemetry is sent to three different servers in various places around the globe.- A worryingly large number of people are reporting broken save files, and even the game being unable to launch at all since the launcher was added.- The ""justification"" given for adding a new launcher was very poor and every reason given was either already perfectly visible through steam or ""we want to advertise more stuff to you""Even if the whole ""tracking/spyware"" accusations are completely unfounded, The fact that this new launcher inflates loading times and hurts performance as much as it does, and on top of that forces ads in your face (because the DLC ads on the main menu already weren't enough I guess) is grounds for a negative review alone. I love this game, played hundreds of hours and purchased many DLCs, but this atrocious launcher that literally does nothing but harm the experience is inexcusable. I cannot recommend purchasing this game or any DLCs for it until this launcher is removed."

Where to begin.....- Firstly, this game is the game that EA's Simcity should have been, except about 1000 times better. More buildings, more options, better gameplay mechanics and generally more everything!- Secondly, The gameplay and the customisation feature of this game are truely its strong point. With thousands of Workshop items, assets and vechicles created by a community of dedicated fans that are added to your game with a simple click. This adds a whole new level to a game which no other rival city builder can truely compare to. Did I mention that these Workshop add-ons are FREE???- Thirdly, The Developers ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE GAME. That is one thing that EA missed on with Simcity, EA just rode the current of their popularity river that the Sim series has created and as soon as the game was released, the game was mostly left to cough, splutter and die due to its lack of new features, AI problems and repetitiveness. Simcity did see a few updates but nothing compared to the love this game has recieved from the developers.This game has problems though, it has to be said. I have experienced problems during my play time, mainly around the stability on my PC, especially seeing as I am not running your typical /r/pcmasterrace beast machine. Asides from the occational lapse of framerate, crashes can occur. In the past, I have been left with a few hours of progress wiped because of foolishly not saving my progress. Collosial Order seem to have fixed this as crashes seem to happen less frequently then it used to but I do still see a occasional drop of FPS in my game, but again, I am not running an epic PC. Thinking of it, this game is so addicting that I have had to force myself to save or enable autosave.But that's really it, a lot of pros and a few tiny cons. Cities: Skylines is a must have for gamers who like Simulation games, City Builders, Moddable games and a whole lot of mircomanaging.EDIT (25/11/'16): I highly recommend buying the game with the extra DLCs. Although it will set you back a bit more, you will be supporting future development of the game and the extra features are mostly worth it. Think of it as a virtual highfive to the devs."

It's been over a year since then so I will be adding further detail.Cities: Skylines is a phenomenal game. The reason for this is simple, Mods. The mods for this game make it infinitly better than what Collsal Order has provided. Even then, CO has provided a solid platform to create whatever you want. I am now approaching 1000 mods installed in my game and the game takes 5+ mins to load a save. My FPS runs smoothly at 15 fps and 500,000 people in my city. The performace may not be perfect but I love the game too much to let that hinder my experience. When you first get the game, play it for a couple hours, figure out how everything works. Following that, go to the workshop and download whatever you think needs to be changed/enhanced in the game. There are so many options out there for you to download.PROS:- MODS- Map Size- Extensive road management especially with mods- Extensive traffic control with especially with mods.- Large community- Customizable Difficulty with Mods- Many free updates and not required paid DLC- Devs that communicateCONS:- (FIXED WITH MODS) Lack of bridge styles- (FIXED WITH MODS) Lack of building styles- (FIXED WITH MODS) Awkward park system; only way to make custom parks is via the asset editor- Money made almost always is greater than money used- No multiplayer- Poor performance with larger cities and more modsI would have to give the game a 10 now. The mods fix almost everything and what is not fixed is excusable.10/10 - June 23, 2016______________________________________________________________Tl;dr: I've played over 30 hours since it came out (5 days ago)So. I like my city builders. And although Simcity 2013 had its flaws, it had many good things. For example, city specialization are good and graphics are really nice (except for the intersections.) All in all, Simcity 2013 is a great game with two major downfalls, traffic and map size.On to Cities: Skylines. Traffic has been vastly improved on and map size is literally 9x that of Simcity; 25x with mods. Rather than paragraph form the good ♥♥♥♥ and bad ♥♥♥♥, here is a fancy list.PROS:- Map Size- Road System- Many building sizes- Better zoning system than Simcity.- Transit control- Difficulty. Getting a perfectly balanced city without issues is near impossible so lots of content.- As mentioned, lots of replay value.- Large community- Steam WorkshopCONS:- Lack of bridge styles- Lack of building styles- Awkward park system; only way to make custom parks is via the asset editor (I think that's what it is called.)- Money made almost always is greater than money used. - No multiplayer (as of writing this. Maybe they'll add it?)Overall, 9.8/10 - March 2015As what everyone else has said, it's the game Simcity 2013 should've been and more. Had a great community and a great developer. Also, its on steam."

There are a few aspects of SimCity I wish to see in CS. Some of that is recycling as being part of the game.  It shouldn't had been part of a Workshop mod to get this feature.  Its something that any larger city in the real world would have anyway.  Micromanaging the dumps and cemeteries is cumbersome and is too much for a game of this size.  When you have large cities, this is something you shouldn't have to go back and empty them out.  Either it should had been automatic or should had never been a thing. Otherwise the game is amazing!  I can't recommend it enough."
1824,Maxu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheCatOfWar/,4,,1,145.6,March,"27,",259,0,1,"Truly great; What SimCity should have been.While in essence it's a similar game, it is far superior for many reasons, such as the fact it's a city building game, not a village building game. While at first you only have 1 area to build in (still far lager than SC5's) as you get more residents you will gain an option to buy one or two more tiles, then when you reach another population milestone you can purchase more etc. While we're on the topic of purchasing, there are no microtransactions (after all, the game wasn't made by EA) and FULL MODDING SUPPORT, allowing those amazing modders to spread their wings rather than punishing them for being creative like SC5 by closing off the game. There is no multiplayer, but it's not exactly a core feature of a city builder after all. I wouldn't be suprised if a large percentage of SC5 players played on private worlds anyway.Zoning, finances, services etc all seem to work almost identically to SC5 (but better obviously) which isn't at all a bad thing, as it's familiar to all yet still bringing greater detail to the table.For public transport you have to manually assign routes which effectively means your roads are now no longer going to be clogged up with busses because of some dumbass AI that decided to send everything that way. Assuming you did it right, of course. If you've ever played Cities In Motion it will be familiar, which seems logical seeing as the same devs made it. It's not the hardest of city builders but it's got quite some depth. It lacks disasters, which can only be a good thing even if they were disable-able, because I feel that how your city does and whether you fail or not should depend on YOUR actions, not random luck. This is a stratergy game, after all.I must confess I originally pirated this game to see if it was worth the purchase as I already own SC5, however their anti-piracy tactic of making pirates WANT to buy the game rather than trying to FORCE them to via DRM (which would be circumvented eventually anyway) persuaded me to buy it within a day or two, especially due to the SW mod support in the steam version. So if the devs ever read this, they will know that giving the buyers a better experience is the best anti piracy tactic and intrusive DRM is stupid.TL:DR:This game is better than simcity in pretty much every way, has amazing mods on steam workshop and is definately worth your money and time."

1840,EPIC FAIL,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075122351/,10,4,0,87.0,August,"27,",58,0,1,"Absolutely infuriating game. NOT the kind of game you can just relax and enjoy, which is odd since this game should fit right into that category, given its theme.Right off the bat, you'll have a problem: Your first task (can't do anything else) is to build a road. They give you  road, and it's the wrong type. You are expected to connect it to two one-way 3-lane highway streets (you know, the kind you can't actually build in this game?). Pretty much no choice but to connect them together with the little 2-way 2-lane road you were given and connect a road to each side of it so that at least your newly placed road can look and function like a proper road in some regard, minus the fact the way to/from the highway has 3 lanes and each one-way, all stopping at your little road at once. These highway roads are also close to each other, which will haunt your traffic later.The second thing you must do (trial and error will let you know this) is find a body of water, which on all 4 maps I've seen so far, are all placed at the literal opposite end of your map. This means once you place it, you need to build both power lines and a water pipe  the way to the roads you laid, since that is where you will be allowed to place houses and such, and they'll immediately need water and electricity.You'll quickly see a garbage icon on each house. Whoops, now you need a drainage pipe to clean the water, which if placed in the wrong place will cause the same problem it's designed to fix. Then you have the power plant, which causes high pollution. That needs those power lines to connect (more or less) to the plant so all those lines have power. Not too long after you place these things, you'll be down to like $5k and you'll be losing money very fast. This leads us to the budget. Minimize both the power and water budget. With nearly no buildings yet you won't have need to fund these places yet.Then you paint areas a color that represents what you want to build. Green = Housing, Blue = Commerce, and Yellow = Industry. Demand for housing is at max by default, so build houses. Like lots of houses. This is when the game breaks.You will very quickly need to adjust your budget since now there are a lot of buildings draining power/water. You will also be losing money rapidly so you better have your roads, power lines and water pipes sorted for now. You won't be able to afford to build more soon.At this point your only option is to slowly (quickly...) go into debt and watch the population grow. You'll need a certain number of people living there to get your first milestone, which offers more options (problems) and a completely necessary $20k bonus. Get ready to watch that vanish in vain.Next comes the ever hated and comically broken Garbage system. If you find that you want to refund this game, the garbage trucks will probably be why. Right off the bat everyone's garbage will pile up. You gotta build a landfill, which gives 2 garbage trucks each and costs $4k. It also causes Stank which looms in a large area around the landfill. This means you don't want to place houses anywhere near it. Sounds simple until you see the demand for housing go through the roof.Now you have crime, fires and sick people. Everyone expects you to build a fire station, police station, a clinic, and of course power lines and water pipes. Once you've placed your landfill, a definite  priority, you'll be okay for a short period of time, until you start losing money again (you are almost always losing money). Time to adjust budgets. Click the electric or water options as if you were gonna place lines and the amount of availability of both will be shown. If you have my luck, people will not have electricity, so you need to carefully adjust the power budget to reach minimal acceptability. Any extra will always cost you dearly. Speaking of extra power...Wind turbines. Do not, I repeat, do NOT ever use these. Oh sure, people will love the ""green energy"", but remember what a wind turbines uses to generate power. You will now be reliant on wind to power homes, which fluctuates greatly all the time. When the wind picks up, you suddenly get a monstrous amount of electricity. Sounds great, right? HELL NO it's not. It's not like real life when these turbines generate power and now you have power charged up real good for everyone and the turbine pays for itself. No, the moment you get all that added electricity, you suddenly  money. The game acts like you have your budget set way too high, which is programmed to then charge you money for being wasteful. This means you must check electricity availability at all times and babysit it hard. Fail to adjust in time and your money is as good as gone.That garbage though... here is where I get PTSD. You have a landfill right... you have houses outside of its Stank range and roads will lead right from the landfill to the houses. Well, be ready to watch garbage trucks pass right by them with their middle fingers up, cuz that garbage isn't going anywhere. No doubt you adjusted the budget for garbage as soon as you built the landfill, and now that too will wildly fluctuate. In the game I recently abandoned out of hopelessness, I had  landfills in a single-area map, pretty much surrounding the map with loads and loads of houses, all demanding garbage pick up. I had the garbage budget set to 110% and it was costing me more than my whole city's electric, yet people kept abandoning homes from dereliction of duty from the overpaid lazy scrub garbage men.Remember, you only make money when all needs are met, and those require very expensive buildings and constant budget management. This makes it extremely easy to go into debt, and in this game, debt can't be reversed if people demand another building you badly need and you have nowhere near enough money to buy it. If you don't buy it, you will keep losing money, so you now have a problem that can't be solved. There's even a Bailout option for when you inevitably go into debt, that gives $50k, but turns off achievements and milestones, so no more building types will ever be unlocked. Trust me, you'll need those new types of buildings badly.So, the game has a high chance of a checkmate on your city. It's very easy to lose too much money from things beyond your control and have no way out, especially the garbage trucks ignoring their jobs even when they're being paid like doctors."

To better explain the idea, you can pay to play the dlc when it releases or wait let's say 2 years for it to become free and by that I mean all dlc that released that year.

Start small, base game + Mass Transit + Industries, and expand later if you like it.The game has really changed and added a lot since the original release, but in my opinion, it was the best city building game right from the start (and still is!).

The TLDR? This game just isn't as fun or rewarding of an experience as SC4 was, and isn't that what really matters?Let me explain. My first impressions of the game were very good, and I thought this game was exactly what I had been looking for. It had all of the features SC4 had with some major improvements, like the graphics (obviously), much better road and city layout tools, vastly improved ""sims"", and more city functions to take care of (I.e. cemetaries and districts). Features-wise, this game is great, and a huge step up from SC4. So you're probably asking what else I could possibly want from a city simulator right? Well above all else I want the game to be fun to play. This is where the game falls short; not in the feature department, but in the core game mechanics. This game is great if you're the kind of person that just wants to build a beautiful city, sit back, and watch your citizens live in the utopia you've built. However, in my opinion, C:S has little to offer beyond this, which is a big dissappointment for the best predecessor to SC4 in 15 years. In general, it feels like there's a lack of things to manage in this game. Once you get your city off the ground in C:S you will have more money than you can possibly spend, eliminating most of the challenge. Whats more, the  thrill aof watching a giant skyscraper with hundreds of jobs/residents go up in your city is gone. Skyscrapers hold about 50 people, are limited to 4x4 plots, and lack diversity, ensuring that all (non plopable) buildings in your skyline are underwhelming. Poverty/wealth is gone. Buildings start out good, and get slightly better as they level up, when certain criteria are met, but never really amount to anything special. Planning nice areas near water, atop cliffs, and around parks doesn't feel rewarding as your citizens will largely treat these areas the same as anywhere else in your city. The graphics are beautiful, but don't really give you that ""big city"" feel, with no concrete, fences, or allyways between buildings, just grass in any squares that aren't covered by buildings. Sidewalks look weirdly underpopulated and devoid of ""city energy"". This does lead me to the game mechanics that I do really like, like the fact that every single ""sim"" in C:S is simulated, they all walk/drive to work, factories actually transport goods to stores/export etc. Very cool, but is it fun? Considering most of my gripes come from the limitations that this mechanic presents, I don't know if I like it. Since each citizen's life is seperately simulated, it would be nice for this to be improved on a bit, like citizens gathering in the streets for protests, police dealing with hostage situations, etc. But isntead they just go about their boring lives and get stuck in traffic jams. Which leads me to the one mechanic that I really don't have anything negative to talk about: Traffic management is superb in this game. Since traffic management was my favorite thing in SC4 I thought this game would still be fun for me, but it turns out it is not. I often feel like I'm playing traffic simulator rather than a full blown city simulator. What I want from a city sim that this game just doesn't deliver: I want cities to be unique, and have their own challenges and style. I want to chose between working towards clean energy, or becoming a dirty financial power house. I want to have to deal with growing pains as my city expands and/or becomes more dense. I want poverty stricken cities riddled with crime. I want to MANAGE a city and not just BUILD a city. And for that reason, I would not recommend City Skylines to fans of Sim City 4."

The latest SimCity game didn't give you what you wanted?Look no further, Cities: Skylines is there to sate your needs.- Plenty of ways to build and manage your city- Good variety of city customization options- Compelling and refreshing gameplay- ""Easy to learn, hard to master""- Extensive modding support and toolsThis game hasn't been out for a long time at the time of this review but already I dare say this is the best citybuilding game in years. In Cities: Skylines you are responsible to build and manage a city (obviously) and you are given the tools, many tools, to help you in your adventure.Created by the team behind the Cities in Motion games, this game is made by people knowing the genre and this isn't hard to notice. Cities: Skylines features a solid range of tools to make the city you desire, in my opinion far outmatching other games in the genre such as SimCity 5/2013 (given this title was quite horrible to begin with).You build, manage and expand an ever demanding city, capable of surviving on its own. In Cities: Skylines, you are given plenty of options and ways to customize your own city to your heart's desire. With the ability to create districts you can name certain regions of the city as you please and furthermore, even add policies to that specific district or to the entire city. For example, you can ban heavy traffic passing through a peaceful suburban community, making your citizens happier or assign specified industrial areas to promote farming, improving your income from that district.The ability to customize the city goes in depth, if you want you can even rename your city's inhabitants, houses or even cars, if you're into that.As for the core citybuilding itself, it offers solid mechanics and an appealing visual style that should interest every gamer liking the citybuilding genre. Cities: Skylines offers a reasonably sized area to begin with, which seems to be larger than certain other games in the same genre, but when it comes to size this isn't the most impressive: As your city grows, you become able to buy new zones adjecent to your current area, expanding the city. In total, you can create a city nine times the size of the starting map.Not only the size of the map is a big feat of the fame, its mechanics regarding transportation, water and electricity supplies, education, law enforcement and others is well laid out and the city will change for better or worse depending on your urban planning skills. If you want, you can even build a dam to supply your city with the power it needs to flourish. (Though beware, you don't want to have your city upstream of where the dam will be, the reason why should be obvious.)The last thing I'll discuss is one of the best additions to the game, in my honest opinion at least, is the modding support.Cities: Skylines offers great in-game tools to customize the base game to your own desires. With the in-game tools you can not only design your own maps but you can easily design your own buildings, parks or road areas using either existing in-game props or by converting images into the game. If you can't be bothered making your own assets or ""mods"", feel free to browse the Steam Workshop, barely two weeks after launch and this game already features a massive amount of player-made content including several cool and beautiful assets as well as entirely custom made maps (In this case I refer to the GTA: V map 'mod', which displays the game's map remarkably accurate.)All in all, there is nothing that I would critize about this game, it's a solid citybuilder with extensive customization tools, Cities: Skylines is my personal favourite citybuilding game of the last decade."

However, ever since Paradox decided to upgrade the Launcher, it's been a MAJOR pain to even start it.I migrated from Windows 10 to Linux because I tried everything to fix the sudden freeze to no avail. After researching online and seeing the scores of people having to troubleshoot the Paradox Launcher alone, why bother? Why even have that in the way? Propriety maybe? Fine, but makes no sense to start a game to start a game. No other games in my library are affected, they work fine on both OS's.Makes me sad to not play this game anymore because I'm just bummed out tired of having to waste time fixing things that shouldn't need fixing. I'm convinced it's an integrated error at this point on Paradox's behalf, who knows if on purpose.EDIT* So I gave it another go, and found a patch that sort of disables the Paradox Launcher (I'm activating the game through my Steam Library/Account, not by its own icon on my desktop app list) and so far it's working again. Cloud Saves still there, anything else I had is gone, but that's due to the OS change. The patch could potentially get disabled if the Paradox Launcher gets another update to eliminate it. I truly hope they don't and just let it start up like any other game. We shall see. I'll recommend the game as long as they don't screw this up any further.

Without mods its quite boring, and you fell like you don't have much to see here after 2 hours. Devs are lazy and greedy, releasing DLCs that costs a lot of money but don't change much, and they are basically relying on modders work. Every new DLC makes mods ""out of date"", and no longer usable.This is ridiculous - making life harder for people who actually make your product worth using.Don't get me wrong though - this is a very good game, but unmodified CS is far from perfect.Full story:Pros:+ great graphics;+ quite well optimised;+ unlimited replayability;+ making basic roads is fairly comfortable;+- water physics (acts weird sometimes, but overall works fine).Cons:- without mods allowing prop placement (such as More Beautification) your cities feel lifeless, and spaces between homes / businesses are empty, making them look ugly;- if you want your roads to look realistic, its nearly impossible to build them without such tools as Move it!, Precision Engineering and Road Anarchy;- without mod like IPT, controlling public transport is very basic, and thus not fun at all;- limited graphics configuration options;I keep saying mods, mods, mods... but just think about it - some VERY BASIC things in the game has to be improved by modders, just to operate ""smoothly"". For example, why don't we have an option in game menu to:1. Disable Chirper;2. To disable clouds / fog (especially important for lower end PCs);3. Building demoliton mechanic feels like its designed for tablet / smartphone game. Why do I have to demolish every burned or bankrupt building? They could just implement tickbox ""automatic demoliton"" in base game, if you like to move around your vast city and click like maniac, its your call;4. Placing props while playing, like in ingame object editor;5. Disable ugly pollution texture;I may sound rude, but in my personal opinion, modders make better job at keeping this game fun to play than devs. The game itself seems to be just a frame, designed to be improved by community with no effort of the company that made it."

1873,iToaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itoaster/,4,,1,156.3,March,"17,",768,0,1,"If you're one of those people whom, like me, was let down by the release of SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you're one of those people whom was pleased with SimCity 2013, this game is for you.If you enjoy city builders, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.Let's begin.First, why is this game for those of us let down by simcity 2013? This game harnesses what made the older simcity games great and adds on to it the way I expect a sequel should have added on to the previous major installment, SimCity 4. There is no online DRM whatsoever, the map sizes are initially restricted to a 2x2 km square like SC 2013 but can be expanded up to 6x6 in any arrangement, or modded to 10x10 km (25 plots of 2x2 land). That's a lot. That even matches up with the ""huge"" cities XL franchise, and I feel like it may even surpass it at times as ALL maps are capable of reaching this size.This game brings back features that some may like, some may not - power lines, water pipes, some of the busywork we found ourselves doing in older simcity games. Despite having no in-game terraforming, the game does have a map editor that uses easy-to-use terraforming-style tools you would use in simcity games, as well as supporting heightmap importing and exporting allowing you to easily create real world locations to build in, or make your own and export them to the steam workshop for others to enjoy. An asset editor, much like the old urban renewal kits, allows you to modify buildings or add new ones, as well as upload them to the steam workshop again or download ones others have made.As far as straight up gameplay features, you will be happy to see the return of mass transit on a large scale that SimCity 2013 removed most of. You'll have trains, boats, planes, buses, subways, and highways to manage, as well as being able to create lines for each that add to the realism and also control of the game rather than plopping stops and letting the mass transit roam free. You'll also find that while there is no regional play, you instead have cities within cities - districts, you can say. Each can have their own ordinances/policies, their own tax rates, and be specialized differently than other districts or the rest of the city. Zones find the addition of a new type of zone, Offices, which act as a form of clean industrial zone. You'll also find yourself now dealing with the dead, and having cemeteries and crematoriums to send them to.Why is this game for those of you that LIKED simcity 2013?  (repeats a bit)First of all, the graphics in SimCity 2013 were without doubt the greatest a city builder has ever seen. This game matches, and in some ways, surpasses what SimCity 2013 was capable of in the graphical department. You keep the tilt-shift effect which appears to have been improved, and texture work is beyond amazing.Now, you won't be finding any multiplayer or regional play in this game. However, what you WILL find is mods. A lot of mods. Hundreds of mods, maps, and addons on the steam workshop already at the time of this review. They're easy to obtain, and you can turn them on or off within the game itself. You'll also notice map sizes are far bigger, which means you have so much room you can effectivelly still do your regional play - cities the size of that in SimCity 2013 were 2x2 km in size, and this game allows you to get 9 such plots by default, 25 plots with a mod. That's 25 spaces that could be used however you want, all linked to one another not by a preset highway, but by you and how you want them to be connected. It's also likely that anyone who's played SimCity 2013 has played a previous simcity, and you will find every feature of those old games - minus the regional play and neighbor deals as a direct result - in here. You will also still find city specialization in a different style than that of SC2013. Rather than placing individual buildings, you will instead create districts (cities within cities, each having their own taxes and ordinances/policies) and specialize them to agriculture, oil drilling, ore mining, or forestry. The industrial zones you place within these districts will then switch to utilize your chosen specialization, replacing their buildings with ones suited for what you want. This allows you to create far bigger specialized areas, and far quicker and with more ease. In the event you require resources that would otherwise be extracted from these specializations, such as to run coal or oil power plants, they will be automatically imported through trains, boats, planes, or simple road at no extra cost to you - just keep the traffic flowing so the delivery trucks can reach their destination.If this sounds easy, it's not. This game can bite you alive several hours in. You will find it far more challenging than simcity 2013 or cities XL ever has been, and that's without activating the built-in hard mode mod. At first, it will be easy - that's due to you building in a small area of land with limited building availability. It's when everything is unlocked and you're sitting there with 100,000 fully simulated citizens running around their daily lives that all hell crumbles down on you.Do you enjoy city builders? You play tropico, or cities XL, etc? Play this.I'm going to skip the basic stuff and say it straight forward. Anything you can do in Cities XL or Tropico (in regards to city building, I'm aware tropico has dictator stuff going on that you won't find here), you are more than capable of doing here in a much easier way. You have more control over customization, more control over the city, and all taking place in a game that looks better and has one of the best developers and publishers out there at your back for support with the steam workshop throwing hundreds at the time of this review, THOUSANDS in the near future, of mods, maps, and addons in your direction to play with as well as letting you make your OWN with ease. That is all.I grew up playing SimCity, and soon found myself playing other city builders in the form of Tropico and City Life. Cities XL was a game I tried to like and just couldn't due to how unplayable it was, and tropico is re-releasing a similar game every year with little effort to innovate anymore like PopTop used to back in the day. SimCity 2013 looked promising in trailers, but upon its' release I tried my hardest to like it with 130 hours of game time but I could not make myself like it. It was simply too small scale and too easy, and I just missed everything you could do with the older simcity games. Modding was so easy for SimCity 4, and the cities were so much more fun to make, that upon going back I wondered why I had ever tried to like SimCity 2013 in the first place. I even dug up my old SimCity 2000 and 3000 discs and got those running, and since I'm not old enough to have experienced SimCity for the SNES when it initially came out, even got myself a cartridge for that off of amazon and gave it a whirl. Each gave me hours and hours of enjoyment that 2013's verison never could. Cities Skylines I was rather worried about actually, as I thought they would focus too much on fixing the city sizes and offline to actually add anything worthwhile or fun beyond that and this game would end up along the lines of Cities XL for production value. I have never been more wrong and I am really, REALLY pleased to say that. I owe an absolutely massive thank you to Colossal and Paradox for making this game in such a fantastic state. They have managed to bring a childhood game back for many of us in a fantastic way.This is the greatest city builder in over a decade to be released. Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive have stated that more content and updates are going to be on our way for years to come, so we can only expect it to get better from here. Also, did you notice the game is only $30? Why are you still reading this...GO AND BUY THE GAME ALREADY!Recommend: YES. YES. YES. SO MUCH YES."

1878,Detective Mekova™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mekova/,13,,0,191.7,March,"7,",421,0,1,"The summation of my feelings for this game is akin to the feelings that were felt when (spoilers) Frodo fails to throw the ring into Mount Doom, and the face Sam makes afterward. You go through this wonderful journey of playing one of the best city simulator games since Sim City 4, but the more you go, the more corrupt they get. Eventually, you realize you've lost them forever.This game is honestly one of my favorites. I do not own any of the DLC that runs at about 15 bucks on average, and even then it's still a fairly competent game.However, as you play the base game you realize that many of the quality of life features aren't available, and your options are limited greatly. A lack of proper infrastructure options or settings, the lack of public transport options, entertainment options besides a couple parks and a basketball court... It's all missing or very limited. That's due to the DLC that's been dropping. Transportation options are locked behind a 13 dollar paywall, and it doesn't even contain most of the transportation options that could be available. You have to buy three DLCs in order to get Trams, decent train architecture, Taxi's, and Ferries. Those are all under the umbrella of transportation, but nah. Separate DLC.It wouldn't be a big deal, but the base game is 30 dollars, and the DLC that matters all cost over 10. That's about a hundred bucks for the whole game. While it goes on sale often, the DLC only generally drops 40%, which means it is still around 8 bucks to buy each one.As a result, I cannot support the game, or Paradox in general. I love their games, and I even purchased their latest DLC of Crusaders II because it did add interesting features. However, the only time I recommend buying anything from them is if it's on sale for 50% or more.As a whole, the game really is great. I just prefer having a complete puzzle set from the getgo, rather than buying each piece à la carte."

1883,Behbo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/behbo/,3,,1,550.6,November,"27,",18,2,1,"Cities Skylines is an exceptionally great game, especially if you're playing it with custom mods and assets.After over 400 hours of playing this game, It's constantly proven to me that it would appeal to any building and/or creativity enthusiasts. You can technically build anything, from a vibrant and beautifully realistic city (which I've been trying to do), to a total joke of a city with curved dirt roads but highrises. Also, it's nice how a seemingly gigantic game with tons of things going on to only take up 30-40 gigabytes of your space, with mods included.The game has given you all the necessities to become a fun city-builder game that will keep you intrigued in its base gameplay, allowing you to control your city's services and build roads the way you want to in any direction. The infinite money and unlock all milestones vanilla options that the game's official developers have already given you, which, when combined with the community's Workshop submissions, create the ultimate sandbox experience. Playing this game has a strangely relaxing/meditating feeling as you lay out roads and plop down buildings, detailing every last bit of a village. The mods in this game are a very significant part of Cities: Skylines. Other than just having a group of in-game screenshotters on the subreddit and community discord, this game's got an perplexing modding community. The best part is that it's all free and up to you of what mods you decide to download, so you have that freedom - just try not to download 4000 assets.A few mods and assets that I would like to grant a mention (and for all new players to get!) are LinuxFan's Traffic Manager: President Edition, Lazarus*Man's Network Extensions 2, Boogieman Sam's Fine Road Tool, Fine Road Anarchy, Advanced Vehicle Options AND Find It!, Alterran's Prop Line Tool, Boformer's Building Themes, Quboid's Move It!, AJ3D's Ploppable RICO, Quad Rioters' Buildings, NinjaNoobSlayer's Vehicles, BoldlyBuilding's American Eclectic Theme, Senfkorn's Public Service Assets, MrMaison's trees, KingLeno's Modular Shopping Center, Ronyx69's Relight, Zenya's Difficulty Tuning, Klyte45's Touch This! Tool, Overhatted's Remove Need For Pipes and Remove Need For Power Lines, extra bad's Mod Achievement Enabler, Precision Engineering, BloodyPenguin's Prop & Tree Anarchy, 81 Tiles and Unlimited Outside Connections. There's definitely more, but it's impossible to name all the mods and creators because there's so many community content creators. You'd probably be better spending $10 on a Steam sale and an extra $1500 dollars building a PC to experience the fun with mods than spending $40 on the console version. Around half of your fun building in Cities: Skylines would be because of them in this game. If you're tired of anything in the base game, they can solve nearly all of your problems. Examples:-Zoning is an amazing feature, as you don't have to plop all objects on the ground. However, if you don't want to zone (and to plop things more accurately), Ploppable RICO and Find It! combined with Plop the Growables has got you covered.-Something that just doesn't seem like it's in the right place? Utilize the Move It mod to move any and every single prop, building or road!-A road anarchy will allow you to create higher bridges and disable road clipping. -If detailing is your focus, then download some props (and a prop anarchy mod) .You can spend up to 5 hours fine-polishing a small shopping center or a quiet neighborhood. -You can technically build anywhere inside an 81x81 KM map, with the 81 Tiles mod. -Install Relight, PostProcessFX with some extra LUTs and Theme Mixer 2, to switch between all your different ambience settings and make the atmosphere fit your city. -Building Themes can make your city look American on one end, and European on the other.Remember - these are just examples; you can do much more than just these!This is what SimCity 5 should've been with creativity, graphics, realism, and an incredible modding community. Even though Paradox's business practices are a bit shady it's not created by a company like EA, so in no way would such a game like Cities try to rob your wallet.As much as people will try to criticize Paradox for what it is, the unlimited modding support in Cities: Skylines proves it as a generous company, oriented and supportive to their community's creativity to make free addons to the game instead of banning third-party game modifications and forcing paid DLCs and other blatant forms of greed. There are DLCs in Cities, but they actually append worthwhile features to the base game, and some are content creator packs supporting modders. However, the traffic AI is not top-notch, and loading times take quite long. FPS rates are pretty low usually, and you need quite a beefy PC to run it modded. It feels like some mods should be in the base game already. You may need to spend hours after hours decorating a little neighborhood to make it look realistic (though I do find doing this an addicting part of the game). Not to mention that useless ""launcher"" that is luckily bypassable with the help of a guide.Besides that, this is and will be the ultimate masterpiece of a citybuilder for years to come. It's a 9.9/10 for me, because it feels like nothing will ever make me bored of this game, mostly because of the sheer  replayablility value of this game! The bottom line - Cities: Skylines is not only my favorite sandbox game, but my favorite game, and it will probably still be for another few years."
1884,baddoggs,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020979772/,3,,1,388.6,April,"29,",118,0,1,"Ok, 50 hours in game and i am ready to make some comments.Firstly, I am not new to citybuilders. I have played most from SimCity series to the ceaser/roman series so i have some experiencewith this style of game. Firstly, I Must say, for a game that is supposed to enjoy mod support,Mods cause MOST of the problems that i have encounterd in my 50or so hours. Some would say, forget mods, play the vanilla. Fair comment, except You kind of need them to adress some of the major issues/bugs in the game. Ok, Your first problem is going to be ""how to get utility vehicles towork properly?"" Short answer, You just can't. Ther are many mods that claim they can but most have been abandoned by there creatorand not updated so... They WILL crash your game of cause Gfx issues.You can almost never tell witch ones will work so you will have to resortto the ""suck it and see"" method. To be fair, there are MANY cerative souls who have blessed us with literally thousands of player made assets,IE buildingstrain stations, All sorts of stuff to make your city look great. Sadly as with the mods, many go un updated and will crash your game*. So Mod at your own risk.Second strike, Taxes are your ONLY source of income. Most games of this typeusually have some buildings to generate extra income. Not this one. I thinkyou get something for transit, bus, train etc but from what im told and seen myself you rarely break even let alone generate profit.Third strike, Vehicle AI is abysmal. On a 6 lane h/way ALL the traffic will convergeinto 1 lane totally ignoring the outher 5. Including service vehicles such as garbagepolice, fire and EMS.Fourth, Road building. If you like nice crisp grids then Ha ha ha Good luck.It is hard and requires a lot of practice to get any good at it. so try ""random"" placings.Your first few citys will look like you did anyway.. Lol. You can only zone 4 tiny squares off ANY roads except h/ways witch you can't zone off at all.Fifth, If you want to use mods, Male sure you have a really good computer.It takes at least 4GB RAM just to launch a vanilla map... Don't even try witha single/dual core CPU or a GPU less than a GTX9something or less than 8GB Ram. Whilst you may get it to run, it will lag and get very choppy as your FPS drops off the scale.There are many outher issues to numerous and too small to mention hereso we will end the negitive part of the review.So, What i like about the game. With the right system, It runs very well and is easely the best looking game of this type i have ever played. For me it actually runs really smooth andyour citys look great, especially at night. You CAN use mods, with the right system and there are some terriffic mods/assets/maps made by playersin the steam workshop. Modding through the workshop is smooth andreally easy. Creating your own custom maps/assets is simple too with theeditors provided. Some major improvements over games like simcity.first, free zoning, Great night/day cycle, and much better visually and the editors. there aretoo many outhers to list here.The 2 best things i LOVE about CS is continued dev support in the formof patches,updates and cool new DLC's. The community so far though is the best feature. As a new player i was on the forums, asking the dumb newbie questions we noobs ask and... No rude comments, no trolling/baitingNo real badwill at all. Just helpful advice and encouragement. No stupid questions, just helpful advice. Thanks to all who replied to my posts BTW.Do i recommend this game.. Well.. To a gamer who has experience withthis style of game or any game that requires TONS of micromanagementthen an Emphatic YES.. Buy it now, you will love it.To anyone else who want's a more casual gaming experiance, probablynot. to those (you know who you are) with the attention span of a goldfish(or do you remember He he he) Stay right away. You will hate it.I can see myself enjoying this game for a long time Bugs regardless.I payed full price with no regrets.EDIT: After 150+ hrs now i can finish this review.Firstly The free patch relesed with the mass transit DLC has gone a long waytowards fixing most of the issues i have had so far. Most of the gfx issues are fixed,The load speed is a little better And road bulding is much more precice.So, Most of the upgrades were inspired by the major mods in the game,This shows the dev's take notice and care what is happening in game andrespond to it. This has not negated the use of mosd but has made the vanillagame a lot more playable for the more casual player.Another plus is ALL the major mods have been updated since the free patch so..WOOHOO....In short, this has gone from being a good playable game to an exellent example of what a citybuilder can be if the dev team care enough. It is pretty clear that they do.As stated in my original review, the community is still the best part of this game.This is now on my HIGHLY recommended list.Disclamer: This review is MY personal opinion only.NOTE: I like the fact all content inspired by playermade mod's was in thefree patch. I dig the integrity."

This game is definitely a step up from the SimCity series. I found that the game was more complex that SimCity 2013 and the traffic A.I. is better. I love how the game manages to densely pack the buildings close together, something SimCity 2013 wasn't able to do. I also like the bigger city size, though with all 25 tiles, it might as well be a reigion. The water physics is also a nice touch, as was the map editor.Something I don't like about the game would be the lack of disasters. In SimCity 2013, the disasters added a challenge to the game. In Cities Skylines, the most difficult challenge would be solving any traffic problems your city has. Really, the worst that can happen is a death wave due to disease or the flooding of a low lying areas. Another thing I don't like is the fact that we can't change what the suspension bridge looks like. Also, the game doesn't really have a good amount of different buildings, meaning that there is often the same building side-by-side. Also, I found that the game suffers from some game glitches due to mods (i.e. Road tools disappearing in the map editor).Overall, I would definitely recommend this game!"

Yes, its developer is different but they really got this game done right for a city builder. Huge amount of space to build on and if you run out, expand and buy more land. Full modding support so you'll expect some pretty cool stuff to download. The game still has some flaws such as no day/night cycle as of the time of this quick review, but the pros still outweight the cons found in this game.  If you enjoyed Simcity 4 or any city builder/simulator, get it. I was surprised this game is worth $30 USD. It's so well worth that price tag."

Since then, they've made posts regarding the reasons for said launcher, all which are irrelevant and against the mass player base's wishes. They claim they are not ""collecting your data"" just collecting ""telemetry"". And then have the nerve to pretty much call all of their players out for ""overreacting"" (Their words, not mine).They used to be the one company I didn't mind buying all the DLC's, which quite frankly, are usually just features that the modding community already implemented in one form or another; because they used to seem like they cared about their player base. But even regardless of the fact that they tried to hide a launcher that you cannot opt out of to collect your data, (*ahem.. I mean, ""telemetry""); just the way they handled everyone's concerns alone, I can say that I will never support them again.The launcher is NOT needed. All the supposed 'features' that they are ""currently allowed to tell us about"" (again, their words..), are already available from the Steam homepage.. and again within their newsletters.. and again when you launch the game itself.. and again on the game's website.. and again on their publisher's website.. and again on their Twitter feed.. and again on their Facebook page. But apparently, they need to offer these same features on a Launcher as well. Never mind the fact that even if they weren't going to use it for nefarious reasons (because who doesn't trust corporate publishers to do 'the right thing'??), it still just creates another security vulnerability that others could potentially exploit, and uses up space/processing power (no matter how small), that simply IS NOT NEEDED.Am I ""overreacting""? Maybe. But in the end, it's my wallet."

Well no matter what you do there are almost always problems; traffic, housing, industry, schooling, poor people, and much much more. These problems are so enticing to solve, the more you play the more you become invested in your city. You can go back to your first road, first, neighboorhood and that one horrible glob of roads that you want to call an intersection. Being able to look back on the small roots of where your city started from and how its blossomed into a thriving metropolis after grueling hours of planning and hard work, is amazing and gives an awesome feeling of real progress that is hard to find in games.Why is it off-putting? Because there is always the urge to start a new, there is always that burning feeling in the back of your mind that you could do it better if you only started off better. This is not really the fault of the game developers but its more of a result of the game itself. A small warning to anyone thinking about purchasing you will restart countless times in pursuit of perfection just keep building on what you have it's not worth starting over.Paradox are greedy bastards, I paid 30 dollars for this and I don't regret it at all but with all the DLC that is out now for the game some of it seems almost essential to run an efficient and ""good city"".

I've tried to pick this up several times, but fall off hard a few hours into a city.Fake social media is one of my least favorites things in games. No one has ever implemented it in a way that makes it more useful, and less annoying. Usually it provides zero insight, or when it does, I feel it would be better served by viewing charts or heat-map data. Instead, I get about 10 tweets a minute right in the middle of my screen about showering with bottled water or leaving their key under the mat. Useless and cluttered.The initial city planning is a lot of fun. Dividing districts, building zones and balancing services is what I love. But this game quickly becomes a transportation management sim, rather than focusing on city building. And that's just not what I'm here for.The absurd amount of DLC (most with fairly minimal content) is par for the course in a Paradox game, so it bothers me only slightly. But I would still consider it a negative."

When you first look at it without knowing the facts... Yeah, Kinda. Is this a good way to waste a few hours... Yes (updated Nov 2019, see end)The base game seems ok at first, then you start to realise how much is missing when compared to other sim city games of the last 30yrs... Want a few disasters to entertain you and murder some civs... PAY EXTRA... want to experience winter... PAY EXTRA... Want to expoerience night time in your city... PAY EXTRA.. want to have a single extra building.. PAY EXTRA... and so forth.When I say PAY EXTRA. We're not talking about a few pennies or pounds/dollars here and there,. here in the UK, we are talking a MINIMUM of £10 for each of the following Winter/Disasters/After Dark and even more for the newest Green Cities, and if you want some extra buildings, PAY EXTRA AGAIN AND AGAIN.I think you get the idea. The base game is just a stripped down, not as good as the sim city games of the last 30yrs. Every decent idea was removed so they could sell it for extra cash to those who blindly empty their wallets..There are some decent mods available from the steam workshop. Many of these are incompatible with updates to the game or require certain DLC's to function at all. So you are left with a game that frequently crashes because you don't have something a mod relies on... Not a good way to play so you end up removing virtually all community mods to stop the random crashes.So... IS IT VALUE FOR MONEY. NO!!! In fact, F*CK NO!!!  You'd have to spend hundreds to get the full game.. and then get screwed again and again as they add new stuff down the road.  They didn't even do the decent thing and release a season pass that gets you all new DLC as it's released... Because they know they can screw you more by charging you for EVERY LITTLE TINY EXTRA.Unless you can pick this game up including all of the DLC for less than £15-20 (30 USD) then DO NOT buy it.The devs are simply screwing over their customers, constantly releasing overpriced DLC, Instead, keep your wallet/purse in your pocket/bag and save it until such a time as everything is greatly reduced.Update: Nov 2019I'd not played this in a long time,  but I recently came across a youtube video by a chap called Biffa, a lovely bloke from Yorkshire who loves to drink tea and fix other peoples broken cities.Over the next few weeks, I watched quite a few of his vids and subscribed to his channel. I checked out what mods he was using and installed them. I couldn't install everything as it involved some DLC that I don;t own.But it prompted me to return to the game and put into practice some of the things I'd picked up... and using some of the mods allowed for far greater control. The traffic management mod is worth it alone... auto roundabouts... brilliant... parallel road building.. amazing.I messed around with a few cities, eventually screwing up and binning them,  but learning something new each time.Then I noticed that some of the DLC was on sale.. so I bought it... I picked up 3 new things for about £5 each... just a little less than half price... I grabbed snowfall, green cities and parklife... I didn't grab industries of campus or anything else.It's revived the game a little more., and I've probably thrown about 40-50hrs into it recently.I still think the DLC is vastly overpriced, and you should only ever buy them if at least 50% off.. preferably more. But I'm now split 50/50 on whether to give this a positive rating or leave it as negative.... Oh for a 'meh' option.So the game has had new life breathed into it, but not enough to offset the cost of the DLC and it's arguably the steam workshop mods and upgrades that made the game better rather than the new content.If the campus, industries and other new DLC get reduced to 50% or more in the Xmas sale.. I'll probably grab them too... I've not paid full price for anything on this game and have no intention of rewarding greed... and what I think of the prices they charge for the so called 'radio stations' isn't printable. Just give us the option to link to our music folders on our computers like other games do.So buy it reduced and mod the crap out of it using stuff from the workshop, and check out 'Biffa Plays Indie Games' on youtube for some funny, informative and enjoyable guides on how to fix broken cities, and how to plan new ones and how to best use the new DLC content. He's got a great list of mods he recommends and some assets he's created or uses... But also be aware that he has either purchased (or been gifted) everything currently available for the game as far as I can tell. So a lot of the stuff he talks about may not be appropriate to your build."
1946,Nipples N Cream™,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079354418/,2,,1,143.4,July,"3,",685,0,1,This game is by far the best city building sim out there right now. The support of the modding community greatly enhances the what you can build and adds great features to help diversify and alter your city. People may have some issues with the fact they are parting some game features that should already be in the game as DLC but really you dont need any of them to have the true enjoyment of the game. If anything they are just bonuses to what you can do if you really care to have them.
1947,Ashwee,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198438809303/,8,1,1,767.3,May,"16,",33,0,1,"Figured I would update my review to be more detailed, less comedic, & more informal so here it is. This game can be quite time consuming but it's very fun for people like myself who like to take lots of time and detail into their builds. The workshop has thousands of unique styles to work with including vehicles from the early 80's and buildings which are from futuristic games and movies. Building isn't the only thing you can do in this game though. You can also play the arcade city builder that the game is originally based around by managing traffic, industries, population control, citizen health, education, & more. I only really see two downsides to this game which is it's high demand on your CPU (Core Processing Unit). This is probably due to the thousands of probable calculations with the AI traffic and citizens. This usually doesn't become much of an issue unless you surpass 20,000 people in your city which is about the point where my game starts to lag. The second disadvantage to this game is the price of the DLC (or Downloaded Content). Most of the games potential is locked behind the different DCL costing about $15 American for the major ones and about $4-$5 for content creator packs. Other than that, the game is really stable and supported by a great community from all the different things you can do in this game. Thanks for reading out this extended review and I hope it helps you."
1948,Blackadar,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007300752/,4,,1,456.1,March,"24,",501,0,1,"The city builder everyone has been waiting for since SC4 is here. Thank goodness.The original SimCity wasn't called a game by Will Wright, it's designer. It was called a software toy. That's because there was no winning or losing beyond some pretty basic functions (like not losing money) but was  a matter of how you wanted to create your city. How do you want your citizens to get to work? Do you want to create a city where most everyone walks through parks and forests? Do you want to create an ultra-dense metropolis? A suburban community? Now Maxis built on that formula and ultimately created the very complex and enjoyable SC4. It wasn't really a software toy any more though. It was a simulation.Skylines takes it back a bit towards the original SimCity. Whatever your dream is, you can pretty much create it in Skylines. This is the type of game where you can spend 30 minutes just building one intersection or do it in 5 second. You can spend hours crafting that new walking path or add 50,000 people to your city in that amount of time. They've added a host of options - road types, pathways, zones, policies which allow you to create most anything you can imagine. It's a ton of fun and harkens back to that Software Toy designation.Now it's not perfect. At times the game isn't challenging enough. You'll find yourself making tons of money and no real problems in your city (besides traffic). Traffic remains a stubborn problem sometimes no matter what you do. Since traffic impedes city services like fire, garbage and so forth it's not always an easy fix. But beyond that there's little challenge. In SC4 it was very easy to mess up the balance of a neighborhood and watch it crumble into decay. Skylines is much more forgiving and the lack of challenge is probably the biggest flaw.At the same time, you play a game like this simply create and have fun. You can create a small town or a massive metropolis. And unlike the Cities XL series, this one has personality. It's cool just following a vehicle around your city. The day/night cycle is interesting. I find the art style cute and the music charming. But what I like most of all is that you can really tailor the game to your goals and then drive forward towards those goals. And when you want to do something different, the game gives you the tools to pursue those new goals. I'm not just plopping down another generic neighborhood. I'm crafting a new development complete with walking trails around a pond. Or I'm crafting the majestic entrance off the freeway to my stunning metropolis. Or I'm crafing a self-sustainable logging community in the foothills, isolated away from the rest of the world. The choice is yours.The Steam Workshop integration helps too. You have many mods, buldings and other options to choose from and that kind of community involvement gave long legs to SC4. Thus Skylines is perfect for all ages and something that most gamers will greatly enjoy."

Even now, so soon after launch, there are more than enough assets and mods, but I look forward to what the community will make in the future."

Doesn't make me the happiest, I'd rather not have login on the launcher at all, but this is a compromise that satisfies. As a result, I am changing my review to ""Recommend"" due to this change.Original Review:Here's the rub, I want to recommend this but I will not.In terms of the game itself, it's great. Paradox did everything right and dethroned (in my opinion) the SimCity series as the quintessential city building game. Is there a ton of DLC? Yes, but you do not need to purchase them to experience the game and there are equivalent mods that implement certain features of them as well though not as well.Why am I not recommending this?Put simply, the launcher. Granted I do not need to create an account, and clicking a few times is not a hardship. However, the launcher's own capabilities were ALREADY IMPLEMENTED IN THE MENU! If I don't want to get notifications of upcoming DLC or of sales, I will simply ask Steam to not send me emails regarding that. I do not want, or need, to be forced to see it. Whoever Paradox has in marketing seeking to increase view count of their in-game and online storefront advertisements and announcements may have thought this was a great idea, but this is just the company fooling itself into thinking this method will get people to pay more attention. The more companies (including Paradox) as a whole try to force launchers on their players without asking them in the first place if they even like having advertisements pushed on them, the greater the likelihood they will actively sabotage their own fanbase."

1967,Zydrate,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zydrateacademy/,2,,1,88.0,March,"29,",657,0,1,"I first reviewed Cities: Skylines on March 28, 2015. That’s just over two weeks after the game was initially released and as a result, my initial review was fairly short at a rather pathetic ~380 or so words. Come now, I can do so much better. More than two years later there’s a whole host of DLC and encounters I can talk about.I will reiterate a few things so bear with me. I’ve never actually been any good at Simulation games as a genre. I don’t like the “Sims” franchise because I do enough working and peeing on my own, I don’t need to watch pixellated lemmings do the same on my behalf. I also generally find they require too much patience to actually get anything done. As far as city builders go, I’ve dabbled in the Sims City franchise for a game or two but most of my memory is loading up pre-built or template cities for starting newbies, and then just nuking them with on-demand disasters. It was a lot of fun back then, but at my age I demand something a bit more concrete and satisfying.The great news is that Cities: Skylines is fairly friendly to new players. A lot of features are population-locked. In the sense that, there’s a lot of services you don’t even need to worry about. In a simple example, you don’t typically need a police station until you get a few hundred people. You also don’t really need a university until a few thousand. That kind of thing. It does a good job of making sure you just get some basic roads down, zone some residential and commercial and then you’ll slowly begin to see a variety of “Crime rate is high!” and “Need more educated workers” blips pop up over your buildings, and you can adjust accordingly. If I was obligated to find a complaint, it lies solely on the vanilla version of the game and it is immediately alleviated by the the wide availability of the workshop, which I’ll get to shortly. Basically, after a few hours you’ll find yourself more or less looking at the same few types of buildings with the same boring plots to build towards efficiency and making sure your people don’t suffocate to death from your nearby industrial zones.Even this got a little better as I became more experienced with the game. I stopped being afraid of flowing, uneven areas. I let my roads bend and flow with the land around them and started to give my cities a more natural flow. I started formulating my industry towards the land it was around. I focused on farmland and forestry, two types of industry that don’t pollute my areas nearly as much.A second complaint I find myself having, is partly self imposed but is still ever present in usual gameplay. There is typically a lot of busywork that doesn’t feel as satisfying. In two ways, you need to make sure power and water are making it to every inch of your zones. Now, I typically play with the unlimited money modification (which is in the vanilla game and not modded in) because I have city-shape ideas I want to get to immediately. I want a circular modular city. I want that beautiful beachfront and I want to get there now, rather than having my ugly little hamlet in a corner while I build my way up to buying map zones. As a result, a lot of my first hour of gameplay is just plopping pipes everywhere I plan on building and making sure powerlines connect to some pre-prepared services so they function once my population explodes. It’s an irritating obstacle I have to get through but once I’m done with all of that, I can reap the benefits and enjoy the parts of the game that really come alive.There is, of course, the steam workshop. The game has tools that allow you to make your own maps, building assets, and road intersections where you can plug-and-play at your own leisure. Most of the best have been updated for After Dark (which we’ll get to shortly) so even downloaded assets will light up right along everything else.The first DLC that was released was After Dark. It quickly became apparent that the developers and otherwise had a really great idea and it became the foundation for further released. Every DLC from this one onwards came with a sort of “free” set of bonuses for all players, even those with the base game. If you’re a more economically challenged gamer, you’d still find your game constantly evolving over time. I won’t list everything that free players get for every DLC, but I was very happy to learn that you didn’t even need to buy After Dark to get the day/night cycle. Everyone got it, and it was glorious.Alongside that, After Dark rehauled night life and commercial zoning. As night falls over your city, so do higher crime rates. It also introduced a prison building you can plop somewhere, much to the spam of unhappiness from your citizens if you place it too close to a residential area. I typically add it to my industrial area and then name that district “Gotham”. Because of course. Alongside this update was allowing you to adjust budgets for both day and night cycles, as some services are not as important on certain hours of the day. Tank your police budget a certain percentage for the day and spike it a bit at night to offset that. You’ll make a profit and your city will be more adequately protected. You’re a good mayor! But wait, there’s more! It also brought two new district types; tourism and leisure. Both had their ups and downs, as one type will give you more tax income but another will bring more noise pollution which your residents may not appreciate as much. It has never been easier to recreate New York City. Overall, this was essentially a commercial rehaul.After that came Snowfall, easily one of my favorites. I’ve always enjoyed the snow in real life, albeit the fact I don’t like being out in it for more than ten minutes as it gets really uncomfortable really quickly. Despite this, I’ve always loved the crunch beneath my shoes and the smell of pine in the area. There’s always been something about snow that made the air feel so pure.With great beauty comes greater challenges. This update introduces road maintenance, and not just for snowy maps. They’ll run around and collect snow and you’ll have to plop them in snow dumps akin to early game trash collection, though they obviously don’t pollute as much. There’s also some new water pipes you will have to consider; installing some geothermal plants and connect everyone to them so that they can stay heated or nobody will move into your town. This ties into my earlier mention of pace-killing busywork but it’s for a good cause when you can get great screenshots.It was at this point a few updates came and went, passing me by as other games maintained my attention more than Skylines did. However on a recent Halloween steam sale I was able to nab most of the rest on a discount, save for one. I will make a mention of the Mass Transit DLC. They were released in this order; Natural Disasters, Mass Transit, and Green Cities being the newest. I will avoid Mass Transit until the end of time. At best I tend to plop a few taxi depots around but ultimately the whole traffic mechanic is too beyond me. I am not a civil engineer and cannot for the life of me understand why my citizens only ever use one lane most of the time, when in real life people will go back and forth depending on what suits them. I’ve taken longer routes to get to my destination if there was some roadwork being done, or any number of things. People claim the AI is damn near perfect for this but it’s clearly not when the AI is designed around point A and B and nothing else.Full Review:"

1982,Disfatt Bidge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lifesatwitchthenyoudie/,7,,0,168.1,January,"2,",120,1,1,"I do believe I used to enjoy Cities Skylines. I've played a lot of it. I tried getting back into again recently and it just doesn't click.I think this game received the praise it did because it was emerging from the 'smoldering ashes' that was SimCity 2013. It was touted as the game that put the final nail in the coffin of that game. The top steam review from this game reinforces that idea with the statement that someone from Finland got sick and tired of the SimCity debacle and made a game that people actually wanted or what that game should have been. But SimCity was exactly what it wanted to be, a city builder, and gave you the ability to create a city, however small it might be, you could feel some what attached to, and I do believe it was quite good at it. I believe the game itself and not the mystic that was built around it is better than this game on it's face.I think that if Cities Skylines came out today, it wouldn't get the praise that it did in 2015. So I think my issue is I don't know if this game is actually fun or not. The vanilla game just seems so bland to me now coming back to it. It just seems like it has no soul, no real purpose or real difficulty, and you'll probably get bored with the vanilla game pretty soon because it devolves in what every city you'll ever start in this game becomes; a traffic manager. And if you don't fit into that niche it just isn't fun to combat the traffic that makes no sense. So you'll go to the Workshop and get some mods, including 'essential' ones like the Traffic Manager President Edition, whose goal is to combat the seemingly broken base game traffic AI and this is the problem I have with Cities Skylines. And I love mods, I love the people who make them and think it's a great thing that people who make mods for free out of the love of the game or love of the art of making them exist. I love mods that enhance a game and make it that much better. The issue I think I have with this game is that it feels like it needs mods, and it feels like you're battling the base game, like you're fighting against what it is and what you (and many others) think it should be. I look on youtube and I see people making these amazing cities and I think I want to do that too. Then I see the absolute truckload of mods you need to even get close to that, and then the whole traffic thing which you'll have to deal with (and it's never fun) and the mods you need to get to make a realistic looking and functioning city just seem to foster the notion that Cities Skylines on it's face is too simplistic and too thin to be very fun on it's own. I can see so much potential in a city building game that gives you freedom like the amazing mods of this game can give you, and the ability to make a beautiful, realistic city without the barrier to entry being so high and confusing like Cities Skylines. Sometimes I feel like I'm just not understanding the game or missing something perhaps, and the popularity  of it eludes me sometimes, but then I remember it's the mods that prop this game up. It's always the mods."

Building a city past 80,000 population is an exercise in masochism, since the game slows down significantly at that point, stalling growth to a point of ultimate frustration. Because of this, building a realistic high-population metropolis is pretty much impossible. The game's simulation engine (every pop exists in the game as pedestrians or vehicles and are active as they go to work etc) is cool but ruins the game as even a good PC struggles to keep up. Other frustrations with this game:[][]   Paradox's greedy DLC policy sells you absurdly overpriced content (ducking SNOW?)[][]   Can't control building levels, which means that no matter what you do your city will be 100% high luxury homes and condos after a certain period of time, which is painfully unrealistic (plus it looks ugly imo)[][]   97% of the game's challenge is dealing with traffic. You'll be pulling your hair out when you realize how broken and frustrating the public transportation system is in this game. [][]   Zoning demand is extremely unclear, contrary to older or more obscure city builders (like New City) where demand is broken up by density or other subtypes. Shoutout to the modding community in this game though, they make the game much better.Have a good day"

1999,Endyo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/endyo/,3,,1,14.7,June,"20,","1,581",0,1,"Cities: Skylines had the advantage of releasing after the debauchery that was SimCity.  Even though it was a full two years later, it delivered what everyone had been waiting for in a modern city builder.  Quality graphics, huge zones, exceptional detail, and of course stability.  Many of those were missing from the city building franchise that we had grown up with and loved.  Cities: Skylines was the saving grace that came seemingly out of nowhere.  Unlike Colossal Order’s previous explorations in to the city building genre, Skylines was more of a complete package offering the challenge of building a city from the ground up in a way that facilitates growth with limited budgets -  all while maintaining the standard array of issues like traffic, water, power, police/fire/medical coverage, garbage collection, and so on.  It didn’t so much expand on the standard mechanics as give them basic refinement and put them together in a way that felt like a real city rather than SimCity’s trend toward a more gamified experience.  Creating a city and then zooming out to look at it, could just as easily be on par with a satellite view of a town as much as it could be a unique work of art, which is one of the aspects of Cities: Skylines that is so appealing.  It allows a great deal of freedom to do what you enjoy.It also added in integration with Steam Workshop, which allowed many people to craft incredible additions to the base content that include all sorts of buildings, terrain, maps, vehicles, scenarios and more.  It even attracted a former developer from the SimCity franchise to create designs for the project, which seemed very fitting considering what happened with Maxis.The game does have a few issues.  The Unity engine has a history of not scaling particularly well, so with large cities on less-than-stellar computers you may see some framerate loss.  Generally, this won't be an issue for most at this point  though.  It also seems like it has a little less restrictive 'failure' state than some city builders, making it pretty easy to recover from dire situations with cash flow or resource management rather than having a city fall apart under those circumstances.   The challenge  is often focused around maintaining ever increasing traffic which can be frustrating at times with the requirement for zoning to attach to roads and different roads having different zone sizes, among other things.  The biggest issue, however,  is that the game has a quite a bit of DLC, which can be a turn off for a lot of people, but I think with the relatively low base price combined with some good sales, you can get most or all of it without cleaning out your savings account.  I do hope sometime in the near future they opt for a reasonably priced full edition with all of the DLC included.It would be hard not to recommend Cities: Skylines to absolutely any fan of the city building genre.  In particular, those disappointed with the ill-fated SimCity from some years ago.  But even people who have avoided city builders in the past, maybe for the price, or just not being in to the concept, should still at least check the base game out when it's on sale.   It has historically been below $10, and that's a fair price for a game that can generate many hours of entertainment.   It could very well be your new go-to game for a creative outlet or just relaxing.  If you'd like to see more of my reviews, check out my curator page here:"

Takes forever to load up.Way too expensive as main features are hidden behind dlc.You won't be able to do the roleplay that you can come up with in your head or have seen other people do on the internet without throwing money and mods at the problem. That's the short version.It's just about what real cities used to look like. Back in the day when everyone got a car to drive around and to everywhere. But only portraits certain parts of the world. Just grids and way too many cars and vehicles. Barely any fun activities for the little simulated people you can see walking around. Everything (buildings, facilities, stations,...) is sqaure or rectengular. You'll need anarchy mods to make something just have a somewhat realistic shape.Used another mod to make roads feel more natural, to curve them, to have nice paths and so on.Used one additional mod more to even have car-free zones. Used mods to have slow areas, just service vehicle areas, sensible lane layouts, somewhat intelligent pathing, more road types, turning lanes, enable crafting realistic roundabouts.Used mods to not get traffic jam.Used mods to have trains go where they should and not have them climb mountains in an unrealistic fashion.Shaping the land to the needs of a realistic railroad layout takes way too much time and money. There isn't even planning. No little excavating vehicles doing your bidding. You just terraform the map for hours or use a custom one you edited beforehand or download a map fit for trains. You can't even build custom platforms. Neither underground nor overground. No little village train stations. Just one size fits all, unless dlc or, again, mods.Trains and ships are likely clipping and overlapping, so be prepared to have your immersion broken.Building an import orietend city is a mess. Building a dam is a joke. You'll easily spend an hour setting it up. There is no nuclear waste. Everything green is dlc.Houses look the same once you got to know the few models. It really infuriated me after a while.Every city looks the same if you don't use heaps of mods and additional props/buildings/skins/themes.The inhabitants don't really have schedules, sensible paths, outside activities, a say in your city, nice models,...No artsy area of town, no graffiti, no street art, no comedy clubs, no culture anyting. Maybe one cinema, two types of malls? One big arts gallery or generic museum? But there's a dlc if you want to have a festival! And a dlc if you want a nice park! And another dlc if you like environment friendly anything. Or, you know, little or grand fireworks or (a bit bigger) natural disasters.There are no bars, hotels etc. in the base game. Seasons? Hell no, pay up!Almost everything quality of life improving is a mod. It's just a joke to me. Yes, you can see wonderful, impressive projects people sank hundreds of hours into.But you'll need a beast of a PC to get everything running, deep pockets to even pay half the dlc, heaps of mods to make it less of a pain to play.I sank some hours into it, yes, at minimum double the hours on record, had big plans, never finished a project as I just got bored or frustrated with finding mods to not have to buy more dlc, just to get even close to what I can up with in my head.Sometimes I've had my fair share of fun, naming everything, spending an hour getting a perfect road layout for just one little pathway. I did an impressive spaghetti junction with seven directions once. That nice little University campus. I'll remember the tiny fishing village and that lonely house atop a lovely hill. And many more little things and projects.But unfortunately fun was not the usual feeling. It was more like work.I never liked the progression of unlocking stuff. If you start with a vision of what you want to build you'll just end up building something completely different until you've unlocked the bulidungs and roads necessary. In the meantime a lot of time will pass. If your city is not that profitable you'd have to let the game run for hours, so it's easier to deactive money being an issue. Same with unlocking stuff. Just deactive progression to play around or even be able to come close to a vision in your head. The game won't let you build a community of eco-friendly people from the start. Not the base game at least. You can't imagine fighting climate change or saving the planet. You can't build an European or Asian medium sized city without hours of searching the workshop.It doesn't even come close to modern city planning. No community spaces. No shops in the same building as living spaces. No swimming, not on the beach and not inside. Not many sports courts. No skateparks. No ice cream shops, no coffee shops, no regional food or restaurants, no people meeting up for a cup of tea. No hunting cabin, deerstand, anything forestry related besides one standard building of a tree farm. Barely any runis, castles, medieval buildings, not even a mill. I could go on.It's just a game, not a very deep one, and not a simulation for sure. Not even close.The 8 tiles (area eligible to build in) limit of the base game is a joke. The maps aren't even that big and originally you are just allowed to build in a tiny part of it. You can't even start to build on the edge of the map unless you get or make yourself custom maps. So cutom stuff again. Custom maps, mods, props, buildings, tools, roads. Custom everything. After having paid at least triple the price of an usual game price to get the full experience.For a game that is no sim, that has no soul, at least imho, few key features without dlc, unacceptable mechanics and a meagre number of assets. A lot of issues are only to be handled with many dlc, mods and additional content. And paid dlc. Then you'll have way too many props and need to look for a search props mod to not loose your mind scrolling through everything that took you hour upon hours to find on the workshop. There are quite many nice mods and things to place, that's the best part of the whole thing. The dedicated modding community and their passion.For a six year old product, that has the most fun and role-play friendly features that got me excited about it in the first place boarded up behind a paywall of way too many dlc, it's just not worth the time and money for me. It's just meh. Mid would be an overstatement. It's underwhelming and even a bit disappointing. After a while at least. But for short time fun it's just too messy, hard to get your head around and expensive. Then it's easily a time sink, hence likely a money sink if you take the bait. Just this one prop, just this one additional mod. Wait, I need another dlc for this to work properly? Meh."

It largely succeeds where Sim City 5 fell flat.  And there's excellent content for it on the workshop.Unfortunately, the game has serious performance issues even when you're inside the minimum requirements.  My system falls within the recommended requirements, but performance goes to pot somewhere around the 100k population mark.  It gets exponentially worse the higher population climbs, to the point of running at about 12FPS at 180k with all graphics settings set to their lowest levels.  CS uses a version of Unity that is incapable of utilizing multi-core processors properly as well.  Multi-core setups have been the norm for quite a while now, making this problem awfully perplexing.I also experience a bizarre crash bug if I zoom in too closely to specialized industry buildings, namely Ore and Oil industry.  That makes it difficult to make traffic/mass transit changes to those areas.  Considering how important industry is when it comes to traffic, it's a huge problem.  I can find reports of this bug going back several years with no solutions found.Load times on large cities are quite long, even with an SSD.The minimum requirement of 4gb ram is laughable.  Even 8gb isn't enough, -especially- when you start adding DLC or workshop contentBasically, don't bother unless your PC is massively above the recommended requirements.  If your computer is -really- good, then heck yes buy this game.  You might even still want it if you dont mind putting up with poor performance.  But I simply cant endorse it the way it runs for me.  I've followed every performance boosting guide, culled unneccesary workshop items, installed optimization mods, and everything else under the sun to mitigate my problems and it just doesn't run at an acceptable level for me."

This game, thanks to active developers and full mod support, will have a very big lifespan and will continue to grow.Pros:Good graphics.Excellent ""realistic"" simulation.Intuitive and easy to grasp.Mods give it an outstanding replay value.Cons:Chirpie brings nothing to the game.Could use more standard buildings although mods fix that.Traffic is very hard to manage.Could use more ways to ""go green"".Overall i really recommend this game. In terms of city building i think it's the best offer available right now and you will not be disappointed.Want a value? I'll give it 85/100"

Playing...When  was announced last year I was super-hyped as it was from my favourite developer, , famous for Cities in Motion 1 & 2.  Furthermore, the sheer fact that it was a city builder and being aware how good Cities in Motion 2 was (350+ hrs I've put into it...) I was extremely excited but I guess you could say I was a bit aprehensive too.That apprehension is  gone.  , on par with the likes of SimCity 4.  Let me tell you why;There are obviously some minor hiccups here, nowhere near as bad as SimCity and no DRM or online nonsense either.  Day/Night cycles are gone and so are tunnels but the latter has already been planned as the first  DLC for Cities: Skylines.  Also, seeing as CO are a small team, the mod community are working tirelessly to work on the superb foundation CO have set for us - the vanila expereince is amazing but the sheer flexibility and moddability of this game will see this title have a life cycle similar to that of Sim City.  I can't wait to see what's next.Don't delay, you are getting unbelieveable value for money here for one of the best games in years to enter the genre."

I've had Cities XL (no relation by the way) for a while but never tried it. C:S came out early in 2015 and won much praise from critics and gamers, probably still hurting over the lackluster SimCity.Having played this for 25 hours, I can say that it is exactly what people needed - big maps, a lot of systems to manage, tiered unlockable features for having a high amount of citizens and more. The game itself is very streamlined and should appeal to veterans and newcomers alike.I feel that developing a city isn't too hard (although I did screw up on my first attempt, leaving me with no cash) but should prove entertaining enough to keep going. While it is possible that at some point the city will be come mostly self-sufficient and you will not need to do much to maintain it other than expanding.In addition, the game has an extensive modding community, adding much needed variety to pretty much every section of the game. I know of at least one former Maxis developer who makes mods for this game.With this game and its expansions, look no further for a city management game."

C:S is a great game with an amazing modding community that makes the game have a greater replay value and makes it an outstanding sim. I am obsessed with the game and have an excess of 200+ assets installed, which does make the game more detailed and awesome, but it uses around 8GB of RAM with medium graphics. Mods can change the most intricate details such as traffic light timing and speed limits. There is even a mod to convert your city to a Google Map! Some things though are quite frustrating like the limited, in my opinion, set of roads available without mods. Again, mods can basically solve most problems you could possibly have with the game.Cities Skylines is the best game to get to create an awesome city that you can customize to the most intricate detail. If you are invested in creating the perfect city, you can start and not realize that you have played for 11 hours straight."

It's more about sandbox play and letting the player do what they want, but again all that could change with DLC and continued support.

The many factors you must juggle are all well-described in the game, and the game does a good job of bringing all the information to your attention. Simply put, this is an incredibly deep game, that is not at all difficult to play.It gets even better for people who like complexity. Sliders exist to adjust everything from taxes of different kinds of zones, to adjusting budgets for individual services. Environment and Resource management, to providing enough schools for an educated population: there is a stat and way to adjust pretty much everything in this game. For those who find enjoyment when building things, this game is one that you cannot miss playing.8/10 ""Great"""

You can make zones which is either homes, comercial, industry or offices. The buildings that pop up have great diversity. You need to make public buildings, like police stations, hospitales, schools etc. These usually have two efficensy levels, where for example the big hospital cover a larger area. The citizens will get richer and happier if you give them these services, and the land will get more expencive if you make parks. You can make highways or regular roads. You need to plan out from the begining how to organize them, if you don't want to go broke fixing them. And in this game you actually earn mony from public transportation (but not any other public service for some reason). There are also many different buildings that can help you attract turists, and enhance your town. The wonders usually have really helpfull effects (but perhaps very unrealistic).One complaint I have, is that it is really easy. I never had any problem getting 1 mill ""currency"". That would be something like 10 billion in real dollars, and I can make whatever I want. I usually keep the tax rate at 3%, and can have it on over 10% without people leaving. Perhaps I have the difficulty on low, I don't know, have never seen any difficulty bar. Also, if you find a nice way to organize your road system, a great tactic is to just copy and paist it with a highway close to it. I have never gotten over 200 000 people, and I've heard you can have up to a million people. So, that will be my next challenge."

Building roads, housing, water, electricity, school, police, fire, trash, transportation etc. in such a beautiful sandbox is about as much fun as I've had on a PC in years.  Making your population happy and making money for expansion is surprisingly satisfying. Zoning, districts and council policies are all concepts which are introduced gradually without fuss or complication. The 3D game engine is spectacular, intuitive and gorgeous to look at.I had a two thousand citizen city after just a few hours and spent another couple with the game on 'pause' just admiring my creation.I'm months away from modding the game but already I can see huge replay-ability and value for money.Congratulations to development team - Cities Skylines is clearly a labour of love.I would recommend this game to everyone, especially town planners.

I always wanted to tryr out SimCity, but with all the bad reviews of the newest one, I strayed away and never looked back. After seeing some videos of Cities: Skylines I figured I'd try it. I'll say thing. Cities: Skylines is one of the best games I've played in quite a long time.As a newcomer to the genre, I found it easy enough to get a grasp on the basics fairly quickly. Don't mistake that for being easy though. After going for about 10 hours my city went into a chain reaction because my trash collection wasn't up to par. My citizens got sick, died, and then their homes were left abandoned, leading to lower property values for the rest of the homes. Within 30 minutes I went from a thriving and growing city of 60,000 citizens to a bankrupt city of 5000. It was a real reminder that the city you build is delicate, and can be destroyed past the point of no return with a single mistake.Overall, the game makes it easy to understand yet remains a challenge at the same time. The UI is easy to use and has never given me issues. The game also runs VERY smoothly, even when your city reaches large populations. Cities: Skylines is certainly worth a look whether you're a veteran SimCity player or new to the genre."

It's a pure sandbox game, so after you've built a mega-city and seen it all, there's not much left to do, other than restart and do it all again.There are scenarios which may fill the void for some people - they're specific missions such as ""fix the traffic"" and you get given a pre-built city with messed up roads, so you fix the traffic and you win. What the game needs is either some kind of weekly/daily challenge mode with leaderboards, or in-game goals given to you by your citizens to keep you playing (or both would be even better).Overall, it's a game I keep coming back to - I will spend a good 20 hours on this game in a week on a single city, but then I will be content with my city, and put the game down again until the next DLC, just do do it all over again.Edit: If you don't want to shell out on all of the DLC's, I highly recommend at least getting Mass Transit. Traffic was a huge problem for me until I got this DLC, which gives you the ability to micromanage each of your roads and reduce congestion. All the other DLC's are more for flavour than anything else.Tl;dr: Great sandbox game - emphasis on sandbox."

The entire city you manage is persistant and constantly evolving, meaning- people live, work, and commute to the same places in the same vehicle every day (you can click on cars and see who owns them!). and even eventually have familes and die. The game can be as simple, or as complex as you want, with the ability to create districts which allow you to set individual laws and regulations, turning industrial zones into farming areas with low taxes, residential into luxury apartments with high taxes, or specialized industy areas to gather resources like oil, coal, and wood (yes, forestry is a thing in this). Not to mention, EVERYTHING is renamable; Districts, people, and buildings.And buildings. You can't forget about the fact that you can MAKE and SHARE buildings, parks, and even maps with powerful, but easy to use in game asset editors. Its easy to go to the workshop, grab some maps, buildings, or lots you like and add them to your game!Placement of buildings is also important. A lot of buildings will create polution- but not just the regular type you would expect like smog and soil polution- many buildings will also create noise polution, and make people living near them very upset.It's like they took all the best features from the -old- simcity games (water pipes and power lines YAY!), re-engineered them, put their own twist on some things, and made a beautiful game out of it.

You can just go ahead and buy it or you can read my experience with Cities: Skylines first if that is your fancy.Game is all around pretty great, satisfactory, balanced and it has a relaxed atmosphere. In this game there is no arsonists or disproportionate crime rate (I am looking at you SimCity!), everything is balanced maybe aside from everyone starting to die at the same time. You can just focus on building a very well designed city while keeping an eye on what your citizens need. Game itself is also constantly updated for balance or various fixes, and they release expansions in a true Paradox fashion by not making you feel like you have to buy it to access every feature on that DLC as they give you most substantial game mechanic updates for free with a patch, but of course for other optional features on that DLC, you are going to need to buy it. Now I will list some aspects of the game that I am enjoying the most;-Your space limitation basically depends on your hardware. For example, game allows you to have 9 tiles which are 2 square kilometers each and even a single tile is pretty big but if you so desire you can go beyond 9 tiles by using a mod to have all 25 tiles , however, if you do not own a powerful machine you will probably not be able to handle all 25 tiles that are filled with people and things.-Traffic. It is plain fun and pretty satisfactory to solve or at least alleviate traffic jams. I've been more focused on solving these problems than to collect garbage, dead people etc. Mainly because of that feeling of satisfaction after solving a traffic jam and seeing that intersection or interchange flowing... it fills me with pure joy just watching them. As I am writing this review I also am watching an interchange that has been flowing thanks to my awesome mayoring skills.-Mods and modding community. Since Colossal Order is not a huge company, naturally they could not fit every little detail they may have wanted to put in the game because they had to focus on more core elements of the game and this is where our lovely modding community comes in. You want limitless money? Sure. What about everything unlocked from the start? You got it! There are also hundreds of assets, maps and game mechanics in the Workshop. Basically, if you want something in the game that had not been put in by the devs themselves it probably exists in the Workshop or you can just make it yourself since asset editor is pretty easy to use as long as you are not planning to make something from ground up, because then you'd need some experience with that kind of stuff.-Colossal Order had said they will be going forward with Paradox model in terms of dlc. So basically, when they are going to put out a DLC, they will give some key features of that DLC for free like Paradox has been doing for their games (CK2, EU4). This is a huge plus in my book. And it also means that they are going to support this game for a very long time and they will not just release a new game every few years.-Paradox Interactive. These guys are the publisher of the game and unlike EA or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, they are not going suck us dry. I've been enjoying their games for almost a decade now and they have never disappointed me.-Public transport. You can set up your very own subway, bus and regular train stops that are actually helping with the traffic instead of clogging it (I'm looking at you SimCity!). You can set up as many routes as you'd like if you are into that kind of stuff. -Policies and districts. You can set districts. This allows you to create a specialized industry and/or to implement some interesting policies like only high tech buildings, heavy traffic ban, raise taxes for only that specific distirct etc... You can implement policies for the whole region too.- You can flood your city with poop water and watch those miserable scumbags suffer. I sometimes do that to a region just for fun. If I hear someone complaining about garbage not being collected I just plop a landfill on top of that whiny wimp's house. It fills me with joy, try it out.Warnings: If you like the genre I can assure you that you are going to be addicted to this game so beware. It can bring out the dictator in you. Your mind will see things differently when you are outside. For example; yestarday I took the bus for going back home and there was a serious traffic jam. I got up from my seat and started to analyse the road network around me to figure out what the problem is and how to solve it. I am a translator but after having played this game I'm thinking of picking up civil engineering it seems fun however in real life you can't just bulldoze something that is in your way which is unfortunate.To sum up, It is a fantastic game all around. If you like the genre and/or disappointed by latest SimCity and Cities XXL, I recommend picking this game up you'll love it. Price tag is also great. Considering they sold ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for 60 dollars... I am pretty sure that I'm forgetting couple of things but alas, I have to go back and bulldoze houses of some whiny asshats. Anyways, thanks if you took the time to read my rather lenghty review. Also, Colossal Order, if you are reading this, THANK YOU! I give this game 1 GabeN (PRAISE HIM!) BUY THIS GAME IN THE NAME OF OUR HOLY SAVIOUR LORD GabeN!"

I almost reached to 100k people yet there is alot more to do. The achievement system, in my opinion, is great. For example, after increasing your population by, lets say 5000 people, new buildings unlock. These buildings help you build even a bigger city. To be honest though, it's slow and boring in the beginning. You can buy new square lands and increase the size of your city as your population is increasing. The economy isn't as hard as it is in SimCity so you can easily gain money. My only complaint is that you cannot buy all of these lands but fortunately there is a mod that can allow you to do that. Also, there aren't natural disasters but now they will soon add it as you can see from the DLC list! Can't wait for it!Enjoy and have fun building your own city!*Hint*: Use underground highway tunnels and roundabouts and connect them to another roundabout on the ground level so your traffic wont be so jammed. Also, dont make intersections so close to each other so there wont be frequent jams."

2169,DreamingCat,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198295816863/,3,,1,27.3,October,"28,",136,0,1,"A good game for city sim fans since the last playable SimCity was 2000 and then EA completely fubar'ed the title.I liked it for good graphics, enjoyable and fun gameplay and that unlike many other RTS, financial management is not overly complicated; default settings are good and you can start basic and only keep an eye on the spending/income difference to know that you're doing something wrong.What I didn't like:- Deathcare is somewhat unrealistic even for the arcadeish gameplay inherent in city management RTS; In reality you don't need to put half a dozen crematoria or cemeteries in every neighborhood, but in this game if you don't then ""dead person waiting for transport"" starts to be a major problem everywhere. Other public services are more balanced than this.- Good indication of traffic jams but no way of any meaningful diagnostic as to what causes it; you do pure guesswork. If you build a dedicated highway to access a major residential area, one lane will most definitely be crowded while others are virtually clear. Car's don't pick up new available routes right after I open them. There are no instruments to set route preference by road signs beyond basic ""make this road one-way"" or ""set road as primary"".- Unemployment are caused by the abundance of overeducated workers. I understand that a game is essentially a mathematical model, and as such it assumes certain simplifications compared to real life, but come on, agricultural industry? 16 positions for uneducated workers on a farm and most of them come educated and you complain? That never happens in real life.- Biggest problem for me was railroad construction. This is where good old TTD still beats this game. The problem was the construction of the curved junctions! Motorways logically prefer to do that in mostly perpendicular fashion to simplify vehicle turns. On the contrary, railroads tend to split or merge adjacent tracks at a very sharp angles because a train can't accelerate or brake as fast as a car, and also because of the train length and general absence of the crossroads. But this game seems to utilize the same algorithm to calculate curved junctions for motorways AND railroads, which leads to railroads being rather complicated, much more curvy/wavy/ugly than would be expected given the scenery.Nonetheless, I enjoyed every minute of the game and definitely recommend it!"

2197,TNZ,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970689498/,2,,1,242.5,July,"8,",131,0,1,"Long ago, 13th of March, I wrote a negative review about this game. Now I feel it's time for a re-review, since the game has seen some updates and expansions, as well as some mods.I would like to start writing about what is incredibly good about this game. A few things stand out, like the water physics in this game, which is very impressive and fun to play with. Another thing that I really enjoy is constructing roads and trying to solve congestions. It can be surprising how a small adjustment downtown can solve giant traffic congestions that affect the whole city. Visually the game has improved, mostly thanks to third party mods though, like 'Dynamic Resolution', that enables  'SSAA', which in short just improved anti-aliasing a lot, and 'Ambient Occlussion'. These are hardware intensive additions however, but I don't understand why these options aren't available in the default graphics menu.Other mods have also vastly improved the game, such as the Terraform Tool and the Traffic Manager. The modding community is definitely a strength which potential influence I greatly underestimated.What I still find underwhelming, however, is the economic simulation, the pattern at which buildings are erected and the transition from small town to metropolis.The industries actually work with a production chain from raw resources, that you can either harvest yourself, or automatically import into the city, to feed manufacturing plants (industry without raw resource designation), to exports. One issue is that this system is not even really obvious. It's something you discover if you pay attention, while it should be a core gameplay element in my opinion, that the whole city should be all about. Importing resources should cost more money, while harvesting them should cause more pollution, or something along those lines.The skyline in Cities Skylines tends to top off around a certain height. Eventually whole city quarters are filled with 30-story buildings, making it look really uninteresting. Why do all buildings max out to the same level? Maybe they should insert a mechanism that the more a building has leveled up, the more negative effects it spreads around it, making sure you can never get a topped off skyline, as the neighbors, under their shadow, will never rise to the same level. Then to raise a neighborhood you would need to provide even more services, but then again a few buildings will rise even taller, while others only rise a little, creating a visually much more dynamic skyline. Also the neighborhood policy to prevent highrises still allows pretty tall buildings in my opinion, defeating the point of it.The transition from small town to metropolis is way too rapid in this game. I was developing a small town, which is challenging and pleasing at the same time. Money is actually a factor and every building matters. Then, very suddenly, it all changes. Suddenly the money just comes in like water, disabling it as a game element altogether, and the whole town starts to look like a miniature New York; with a population of only 30,000. Traffic starts to replace money as the main gameplay element here, which is fine, but more something for a city of 300,000 than 30,000.So I have put down my criticism again, although I didn't mention waterpipes and other silly micromanagement yet, but I look forward to future expansions and mods that have a really positive influence on the game. I do wish that eventually the whole game will be as impressive as the water physics system, but for the current pricetag of under 30 euro, with sales putting it even lower, this is a fine game to pick up, especially if you are into this genre."
2198,Cheddar Goblin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emorphien/,3,,1,85.4,March,"15,",354,0,1,"I keep calling this game SimCity inadvertently.  No, not in reference to the misfire from 2013.  Instead this game brings me back to the kind of fun I had playing the SimCity games of the past.Five days in after buying the game and I'm st ill building my first city.  After spending 18 hours (eep) I've expanded its borders as far as it will go, I've built a couple of the big unlockables, and I see no reason to stop with this city for now.There are issues with the game but it's phenominally good fun, intuitive, pretty good looking (even if not as polished as SimCity '13) and most important of all: there are no gamebreaking issues.  This is the best citybuilder in over a decade, and it continues the genre in fine tradition.Back to the issues...It could use more anti aliasing and the tilt-shift effect isn't as good as SimCity '13s.  These are minor quibbles.Road traffic doesn't seem to effectively use all lanes but once you learn some tricks to laying out your roads you can mitigate some of the traffic issues.  In this regard it's still better than SimCity '13.Rail traffic seems to be the wonkiest thing I've encountered.  Trains keep getting jammed up and stopping without any clear indication of where they're trying to go.  I may have made mistakes in laying out the tracks and stations so I'm still trying to figure out if this is something I've caused but something just feels off.Dealing with dead bodies and trash takes some getting used to, traffic can hold up their removal (and police, ambulances and firetrucks).  Abandoned buildings are also a bit of a nuisance because you are encouraged to bulldoze them, but they also seem to take care of themselves if there's demand for growth (they'll get torn down and rebuilt automatically).  That said leaving them up if there's not demand reduces the happiness/land value of the immediate area so bulldozing is a good idea unless they turn around quickly.TLDR: This game is $30, awesome fun, works great, active and extensive modding community.

I was so physically weak from lack of food I could barely get out of my chair. 10/10 would be malnourished again.The game plays and feels like the city builders of the late '90s and early 2000s. As far as I've been able to tell, the city building genre died after SimCity 4. I've tried playing the XL series, SimCity Societies and 2013, and at best they feel dead and soulless; at worst they're broken, boring and a waste of time and money. This one feels fresh while relying on the classic mechanics, and ends up being the most fun I've had playing a city game since 2003.

2209,Diarrhea Cactus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986365521/,2,1,1,40.5,March,"20,",269,0,1,"Cities: Skylines is what the latest Sim City should have been.  A complete city simulation but be warned of the expansions as they do not yeild enough content to warrant the price!   Cities: Skylines in a brief description is a city simulation in which your ultimate goal is to design a city that meets your requirements.  There is no actual objective, no missions, just a pure sandbox play.  You start with a tiny town and slowly grow into a spawling city.  As you level up your city through population milestones you unlock more necessities of a large city.  Proper planning goes a long way when it comes to city and even town design.  You can quickly have a large traffic jam for miles if you don't engineer your roads correctly.  Even if you create a 6 lane highway to bypass traffic, the rules in this game will insist the that inhabitants of the area take the shortest route not the quickest route.  This must be considered when designing the road systems from the very beginning.  It is all too easy to get caught up in building out blocks and areas for your industry and commerce and totally forget about the road requirements.  An easy way to start off is to build a road then delete it, this opens up other roads that are not initally available for some reason.  As you progress you can make freeways, underground roads and suspended roads for more efficient travel.  It takes a civil engineer to make a good road system and I obviously need much to learn in this department despite my advances in understanding how to properly build a road system.  As you grow you zone your areas much like Sim City.  You have your basic residential and commercial and then as you grow you can get into the high density residential (skyscrapers) and high density commercial as well as office space.  Offices provide commerical output and don't generate noise like a typical commerical zone would.  Think an office versus a diner or gas station.  Day and night, rain and fog, as well as snow if you have the expansion are all weather effects.  The day and night were free additions to the game but the expansion for the nights adds other buildings as well.  You can adjust budgets per time of the day.  If you want, you can increase budget during the day hours and decrease the budget for the night hours since they have two independent sliders.  What I find interesting, is that school is also in session at night as well as a few other services that normally wouldn't run during that time.  Elementary at 2 am? Sure thing, get your ass to school.  There are mods out there and tons of add-on buildings that people have created using the asset and map editor.  There are so many mods that you could easily fill up a quarter of your harddrive if you went nuts about it.As I continue playing Cities: Ckylines, I find myself always coming back and wanting just 5 more minutes.  Sometimes I'll expand into a brand new district I have planned out and end up wanting to quit in 5 minutes but end up playing another 45.  This game can really take some time out of the day if you let it.  You can design a small town with sewage spilling into the river or expand enough to get water treatment plants and build dams.  If you don't want skyscrapers you can implement policies that limit how big the buildings can get, it is completely up to you.  For what it's worth, I haven't had this great of a time with a city simulation in quite some time.  Since the last Maxis Sim City now that I come to think of it.  With mods, you can easily fix some of the annoying problems like the traffic issue that I explained earlier in that they don't care if the highway is a parking lot, they would rather sit thre than take the new 6 lane bypass you built.  A few other things can get annoying too such as education and the industrial area not building to demographics.  It would have also been nice to deny education to certain schools for a more granular control process but there may also be a mod for that issue as well.A bunch of small issues that don't really get in the way of the big picture.  Build whatever you want, make it look awesome or turn it into North Korea.  Ultimately it is your choice and with a load of maps both official and custom, you won't get bored!"

It certainly has, but there are some shortcomings with the game.It is a lot more modern, which allows for some very interesting things. Take into account the Steam integration, the Workshop has plenty of new things to add to the game, from advanced traffic systems, to buildings, this game is as close to the “next generation” of city builders as you possibly can get.The game does push towards the DLCs a little too much for my liking, but I can see myself playing the base game in the future, due to it’s simplicity and modularity.Graphics are great, but that really should not be the focus of the title. The way the simulation of a city works does not seem to be as accurate as SimCity 3000 did, but I guess that is just an unpleasant fact when titles become modernized."

If I talk about negative points in this game or positive ones they can be fixed or enhanced with mods. If you do buy the game you should try them out. I love how the game provides you the freedom to do whatever you want. You need water,sewage power and roads and from that point you can start building districts and creating your own city without any restrictions. If you don't consider slope a restriction, it shouldn't be considered as one because you can terraform. I noticed while building my cities that I still didn't use all the buildings that are available in this game that's because there are so many options. The transport options in this game are also pretty elaborated. You can build airports, trainstations, harbors, tramstations and busstations. The game also provides a good dose of challenge if you are willing to expand your city a lot. Starting from 60000 population, which is a truck load of people and can't be done in a day, you unlock monuments. For each of these monuments you have to complete challenges to unlock the building itself. Some of these challenges really require you to screw up your city and survive, for example lower your taxes to 5 procent and survive for 5 years. If that isn't enough you have to get back to the point that you were at before the challenge and then save up around a million. If that isn't enough challenge I don't know what is to you.Although this a pretty good game there are some important downsides. Starting with traffic as the main issue. First off the highways leading to your city are way too small. It prevents you from fixing traffic without bulldozing as much of that highway as possible. They are very inefficient, if they were bigger they would be more useful. Another way how traffic clogs up is the bus system. In one city I made around 200 buslines, which is many but it was an experiment, half of my traffic was bus because each line had like 30-50 busses driving on it. I find it unrealistic and unnecessary to have that much busses on a line. I think setting a maximum to 10 per line, or even 5 per line, is definitly enough. Second we have the income system, not that it is something general it is more a visual issue to me than it may be to you. You see next to your money amount how much you earn per week but you gain money daily and I don't get why. It is way easier for the player to understand what is happening when it's either gaining money per week and seeing how much you earn per week than doing the two combined for some reason. Another thing I find unfortunate is the limitation. You start of with 1 plot of land and you can only expand 8 more plot, which is not a lot to me.Overall a good pickup to play once in a while with or without mods."

It's a great game because it has good free updates, awesome mod support, and polished mechanics. I think that it deserves to win The ""Just 5 More Minutes"" Award because it is really addictive when you are building a city. Just a few weeks ago, I couldn't stop myself from playing much longer than I should have because I just needed to place one more neighborhood or add one more road."
2258,Et3rnus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DamianX3/,8,,1,128.2,March,"15,",324,0,1,"This game is worth its money threefold. Remember SimCity 2013?Yeah you probably do because it was chockfull of bugs and annoyances, however you still enoyed it didn't you?I had the same. Some of those annoyances weren't small however. The maximum land size was one of them. A measly 2x2 KM block of land was ALL you could get in SimCity 2013. Now you might ask why do I bring up SimCity? Because, obviously, this game is a lot like SimCity (who would have guessed!) except it doesn't have its flaws. This game is, in my eyes, by far the best city builder since Simcity 4. One of the biggest issues with Simcity 2013 was the plot size. Well guess what, this game can be 8 times larger at the very least and 24 times larger with a simple mod! That's also part of the exquisite beauty of this game; mods. This game fully suppors modding if you didn't figure it out already. There's already several thousands mods on the Workshop, and that number is expanding by the hour! Another big issue in this game was traffic, even though traffic behaves mostly the same, from what I've seen/played/heard/read the traffic is much more manageable in here, simply because you can expand your cities, easily upgrade your roads and build intricate intersections, overpasses and so forth. Something new this game has is called 'Districts'. Districts carry a load of potential, as they can specialise your chosen area to a certain type of Industry, limit your density of Residential, Industry or Commercial Zones and put certain Policies per District. It is quite a bit slower than Simcity 2013 though, don't expect to hit 400.000 citizens within 5 or 6 hours, your city builds up slowly. One of the main complaints I've seen is that cities seem much more populated than the civ number, this is because the civ number shown is the actual number of simulated agents. The actual people you might see is probably quite a bit higher. I have no idea whether or not this review makes a lot of sense to you, but if it does, be sure to check this great and time-consuming game out because DAMN is it awesome."

Their specs layout of recommended and minimal also, is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. if those were the specs for recommended, i could run this game at at least 1080 60fps no matter the population, but instead, i'm stuck on low settings, little to no mods, and praying i get 25 fps even under 10,000 citizens. That is NOT optimized. That is NOT acceptable I bought your dlc thinking it was going to enhance my experience overall, but instead left me with a bogged CPU that isn't really bogged, the game just decides to lock one core up. IT'S 2019, people had dual, quad, even octo in 2010, what the actual ♥♥♥♥ is the excuse for this?"
2278,This user has no known aliases,https://steamcommunity.com/id/naldan/,19,2,0,190.8,May,"6,","1,005",3,1,"10 million minor DLCs instead of anything substantial. It was promising at first but they quickly dropped the ball. They're just one step away, if at all, from selling portraits... or skins... for buildings... or chirpies... or radio stations... Oh, wait. They already do that.If I'd known that they'd go the EU/CK/HoI route, I wouldn't have bought it. It's a really good game, best game in its genre to be exact. But those damn DLCs annoy me. There are bits in every DLC that attract me, yes. But there's tons of crap I don't care about. The bits that *do* interest me are way too expensive if I would buy those DLCs just for those good parts. And it depresses me with every release even more. Just make one expansion in the 30$ region with the content of two DLCs and I'd buy those happily, especially if the theme is in my taste. But like this, it feels like I'd buy something at a loss.Wait for hefty discounts. The base game is amazing, but they dangle a carrot in front of you that's covered in mold if you do so. And that depresses me severely. Also nothing cyberpunkish, nothing futuristic apart from the hipster utopia (read:dystopia).No, really. Those unsubstantial DLCs bother me extremely. I'd have bought CK and EU a long time ago if those wouldn't have these insane DLCs. I really didn't expect those in this title and wouldn't have bought it therefore.On top of that, the sound design is sub-par. From a technical standpoint as well as quality. The sirens are outlandish, probably based off of something in Scandinavia, which is fine. But please give us more variety, it feels alienating for everyone that tries to recreate their home city, which is inevitibaly everyone. The SoundFX pop in and out with varying degrees of volume, all randomly. That doesn't happen *all* the time, but it does happen occasionally and it gets really annoying. The traffic sound is random traffic noise, nothing with oomph or varying degrees of heaviness, as far as I remember - if it has then it's unsubstantial.If they really want to keep this game alive with 987432897432947823047239478239432978432897423974237498237498 DLCs per week, then they also should really work on its performance. It does perform really well, don't get me wrong. But only if you compare it to its non-existent competition. You really want bigger cities after a while and from 100k onwards, the performance tanks more and more - since release. That didn't change at all. I have a pretty good CPU, even for todays standards, but I can't imagine people nowadays even with the top-of-the-line-CPU could handle anything near a million citizens without their FPS slowing down to a crawl. But that's not even really possible without trickery beyond the game's usual limits. If they want to sell us microDLCs for years to come, then I'd expect them to make us able to recreate any city we like, like the entire Tokyo area for example. Yes, the entire thing. But like this, it's just like ""Build a city like this ///or/// like this ///or/// like this."" instead of having a megametropolis with an enormous amount of facettes... like real cities and stuff.You've got to deliver on technicalities, CO. You have automatically lost to modders when it comes down to gimmicky themes."

I was excited for all the neat looking features and cool city building.  Yet this thing is just way so much more than that.  It's so much more than any Sim City game.  It's incredibly complex to the point that you need to think of, plan for, and predict every little individual nuance.  You're far beyond a mayor, you're the whole team of city planners and every tiny decision can have long lasting and terrible repercussions in the future of your city, so far into the future that it becomes a massive expenditure to even attempt to change the aforementioned decision.The sheer amount of micromanaging that's required to get a city running even remotely ok is staggering.  The worst part is, the game and all its DLC don't even include all of the tools you'll need to properly do so in every area, for instance the traffic.  While it may seem, at first, to run well, the unfortunate fact is that, over time, it'll start running worse and worse, even if you've properly planned things out, all simply because the traffic AI in the game is notoriously insufficient to tackle the massive amount of traffic the game can so easily generate.If your goal is to play a fun, simple, and relaxing city builder then this is not the program for you.  If you're the type to want a city builder that you need to micromanage an intense amount of things and spend your time stressed over how every little decision will ruin your day later on then this is definitely the title for you.I was hoping for fun, more simplicity than present, and a relaxing time.  The game, however, had different plans."

With this there were tons and tons of possibilities, but I soon noticed that the XBox series was being neglected and wasn't really cared for by Paradox.So I got on to steam one day and went to the store and got it on sale along with some other DLC.Luckily C:S is not a DLC hog like EA, but there are some attributing factors to the game that DLC fulfills. Graphics are nice and installing shaders makes the game all the more better. In my opinion however some areas are very odd, mountains will sometimes have super dark spots where the sun hits, (maybe just my graphics card sucking idk?). Which kinda makes it hard to see and get good screenshots.The gameplay that goes along is very nice and realistic, you can't have a trash dump right next to residentials, and it makes it realistic and somewhat enjoyable.Installing mods for vehicles makes the game look 200% better since I can make an american city and not have a german fire engine and a french ambulance driving around.Sustaining population isn't too hard, and having the option to have unlimited money can give a nice touch and make a utopia all the more easier.Finally, I come to a bad section. Recently, there have been a lot of false or botted reviews that have driven this game into the dirt.The top one is by someone I will not mention that regards the C:S launcher. While the C:S launcher can be a tiny bit annoying it's perfectly safe. In fact I have had easier times getting into C:S and have not had the same amount of crashes that I used to have.All in all, I give this game, a 10/10."

Don't get me wrong I loved the game when it first came out and it superseded Sim City by miles!In the games first form it was very basic which was fine and dandy but it was missing day an night cycle something that should have been part of the base game and so the developers decided to charge us for something that should have been in the base game as a DLC. Okay there were some happy people and some annoyed people so it was a mixed bag.What really needs sorting is traffic and unfortunately that is still a massive issue even today. The developers rely quite a lot on the modding community which is fine but when a new DLC comes out, mods break and again the developers rely on the modding community to fix their mods and that gets very boring for the modders constantly updating something the developers break almost seems like a full time job except the community aren't getting paid. So there are amazing modders out there that no longer can be bothered to no fault of their own, to update their mods.Take traffic management mods, they should be in the base game or at least a free update but it seems the company are set on releasing DLC that seems very pointless and doesn't really add anything meaningful to the game and in my opinion money in their pockets. But lets not go there we all know the gaming world is only after your pennies. Now don't get me wrong again, the developers put a lot of time and effort into these DLC's, but are they what the game really needs.Since each DLC is released, the performance of my PC keeps dropping to the point where when I load a game it takes about 4 minutes. I run very few mods and I don't have additional assets. I try to play the game with as little mods a possible. My PC is quite a high spec PC Ryzen 7 1700 running a 2070 RTX with 32Gb of RAM with the game installed on an M.2 SSD running off a 27"" G-Sync Monitor. Even after reinstalling windows and starting fresh, the load times aren't great still - Yes I've bought a new SSD but still load times are slow. I'm not here for technical support.So I implore the developers to stop and think hard about what they really need to do, be that either optimise the game and add actual useful features or, release a new game.So as of this moment I can not recommend this game."

In fact, I've never built a building of any kind. I suspect, unless I've grossly misjudged the Steam community, neither have you. I'll even disclose that I do not have a degree in town planning or even have a degree at all, you in fact might... but I bet it's not town planning. All this means they'll never let me build, plan or even, to be honest, let me have the slightest involvement in any aspect of developing my local area. Given the now crystal clear understanding, set out above. You can imagine how overwhelmingly positive I felt, when I finally got the opportunity to put the world to rights. Cities: Skylines interface, makes city building a doddle, with a vast array of actions, buildings and challenges.  Effortlessly painting to denote what type of building an area should contain, makes the experience far less tedious than it's peers. Thus allowing you to focus on more important things.. like sectioning off your own island, which has a waste pipe feeding into the water supply of the richest areas, or making sure parks have motorway access and power station employees have only to walk next door each morning to reach their place of work. This is, to my mind, the most fun you can have... with a city building game... to date. Verdict: 8.0'If you build it, they will come... and Colossal Order built it alright, 44,492 current players'"

Larger maps, more buildings, deeper simulation, mod support. Having played and enjoyed Cities in Motion 1 & 2 I couldn't wait and I was not disappointed when Cities Skylines came along. Over the years DLCs have expanded the game greatly, modders have pushed the boundaries again and again and I have lost countless hours to this most addictive city builder. The game itself is very good (if rather resource hungry when you start adding mods). The developers are passionate and they have made a great product.So why would I not recommend this? Because Paradox decided to install a silly little launcher into this and other titles which provides absolutely no benefit to you as a player and serves only to further their marketing. Despite knowing the reaction of their players and loyal customers, they did this anyway which tells me Paradox do not care what their customers think any more and have lost their way as a publisher. Very sad. If you don't care about publisher politics or game launcher madness then a wonderful delight awaits for you (If you shell out for all the DLCs of course), otherwise, if you get mad about these things, avoid."

A very scummy move on their part. There's legitimately nothing about the game that has ever given me a big issue, and for what it's worth, Cities is an entertaining and complex, well detailed time waster. But tacking on a launcher, giving your users a bunch of BS reasons why it's a great idea to have a launcher, and then using said launcher to rip data from users is way too much. Avoid this game for now, money talks. Remember to vote with your wallets, people. If you abstain from buying into products like these, it's more likely that they'll go back on these absurd launchers and make better decisions. It's when you keep giving companies that pull off this kind of shtick monetary support that enables developers/publishers to further rip off their user bases and potential customers."

I mainly drop this on EA wanting to over-monetize and not able to grasp, that this kind of game is a one-sale and not a game-as-a-service ""product"".Cities Skylines focuses on 3 easy principles1. it has great gameplay, is very pretty, rich in details and you can easily get into it2. MODS (assets, new tools, graphical sets,....)3. The real challenge is not building a city, but: TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT!Layout a roadsystem, provide areas for Residential, Commerce & Industry, , provide services (police, fire, schools and leisure and public transport), and drop a public transport system to relieve traffic from the streets.Sounds easier than done. Small variation result in loss of citizens (not providing covering health or school access, missing leisure ares, like parks etc.).The game can be very easy and very difficult at once.In a whole itt  is very enjoyable and you can do a lot micromanagement, if you want to."

However, you also have the ability to get as detailed as creating bus routes (with individual stops), shipping, train routes, etc. It is highly flexible. This means you can simply lay down some roads, electricity and water then start playing or you can spend a week designing your city and still not be done. With the addition of the Steam workshop and community assets, the sky is the limit."

Unless you're already familiar with city sims like this, I can recommend Move The Mouse's tutorials up on YouTube, they're really helpful and walk you through every milestone achievable and gives you great tips. You can use those as a guideline to startup a city and then move from there.I myself love this kind of research, but if you just want to get straight into a game this wouldn't be a game for you (unless you'd be able to power through the research). Although the game does give some explanation about what tool does what, there is no proper tutorial that takes you through every single step of starting up a city. You get thrown in the deep end of the pool unless you do aforementioned research.Startup of a city is tough, but then it exponentially grows until you don't have to worry too much about money anyymore and can really think about how to satisfy your citizens. A few tips: get some parks in there, make sure health, fire safety, and police coverage is well-spread, this will increase the overall happiness and attract more people!Something that I don't think a lot of people realise, is that traffic is a BIG BIG deal in this game - you HAVE to have working roads that function well and have enough connections, because if your traffic flow is bad, no vehicles will be able to reach their destinations and cause massive traffic jams. These jams also mean that your (emergency) service vehicles won't be able to make it to their destinations. AKA, this can ruin your city.On the surface level if you watch a lets play of a youtuber who knows what they're doing this looks like a simple game, but when you really want to get into it and get a thriving city you have to do that research and learn the mechanics and learn what layout works for your city and roads.Overall I 100% recommend this game if you're into city sims and don't necessarily mind a challenge, this game gives it to you!"

You take a look at your cims, driving to work, going grocery shopping, clipping through cars, enjoying their lives. Lives that you provided them, in a world you designed for them, you smile at your creation. Before you know it their lives becomes your life. Where once you controlled your own world, it now controls you. ""I need to sleep, I got an early start tomorrow"" you think to yourself, but you decide that to remanage the plumbing network.

I played awhile without mods and it was pretty cool; after reading some very in-depth online guides about traffic management (a must) and how exactly some unskilled moron is supposed to build a functioning city (a double must), I installed a handful of extremely good mods which, coupled with a few of the better DLCs, made this game a very rewarding and challenging time-waster in which you can easily sink an entire weekend, and then spend the workweek thinking about how you can make your city just a little better when you get home.I liked the old Sim City games, but I never really understood how to make my city work. It simply and inevitably devolved into a gridlocked, crime-ridden mess until I used cheats to nuke/tornado/burn/flood destroy it. With this game--and as the result of a lot of outside reading (seriously, read the online guides), I feel like most of the problems which arise are manageable, understandable, and correctable. Even when things get completely out of control, it keeps drawing me back for more. Slap on a few new mass-transit options and arterial roads, and BAM, traffic flow restored. Sure, the little townspeople/drivers make some really stupid AI choices from time to time, but overall it seems like a pretty accurate simulator.It's nice to look at, seems to hold up fairly well as it ages, and the developer continues to roll out new support and hit/miss DLCs. Most of it seems pretty good, but the lemons are rather obvious. Read the reviews and make your own judgment. There are also some incredible mods, especially in the realm of efficient pre-made highway interchanges (a lifesaver if you're not a traffic engineer) and traffic flow monitor/managers. --- If it isn't clear, traffic is a pretty core component in this game...I've learned a lot about traffic; I've learned a lot about what works and what doesn't; I've learned that a lot of the real-life infrastructure in my hometown is poorly designed; and most interestingly, I've learned that in the game, as in my real-life hometown, when you add about 10,000 people to the existing infrastructure without any changes, the whole place turns into absolute garbage.Good game."

I have happily purchase each one, when I was able to. The latest DLC (Industries) revamps what zoning means in a city builder. It allows you to specifically setup supply chains within industry areas, while allowing the core mechanics of zoning to work around you.

Not every DLC is as fleshed out as it should be for the price, the game is 30$ and the after dark DLC is 7.49$. You'd think that add about 1/3rdish of new content to the game, but no it's not nearly enough.The games obsession with traffic managment can be outright frusturating for those who aren't master urban planners.The base game itself comes with a strong amount of content, but the majority of the sales were probably from people disappointed with the crash of Sim City 2013 and City Skylines offered an alternative. At this point with no competition with any other city builders Skylines is the best game on the market, but I doubt it will hold it's title long unless the developers seriously rethink how they are going to continue this game."

It's kinda like what simcity 5 should have been. It's mechanics and variety is great and the modding community for this game is absolutely amazing. The map designer and asset editor is fairly simple to use and allows almost anyone to make their own map.Now there's also alot of stuff that I find annoying about this game. The main point being the Traffic AI. All problems with this game evolve around this one thing that Paradox didn't take their time with. It seems as to they only missed the traffic bit adn thought ""well, lets just take a cheap AI and tweak it a bit"" and added it. The AI is absolutely horrible. Why? Merging. Merging lanes in this game is made in the stupid way that instead of keeping the speed of the cars steady and THEN merging  in to another lane to not slow down traffic, they brake until almost a full stop, sometimes TO a full stop. This causes traffic behind to stop for the car and make a huge traffic jam that completely messes up the entire thing. Even with mods like Traffic Manager this is inevitable to happen.Another thing that is really annoying is junctions. Even a simple T-Junction is a pain in the ass with the amount of traffic this games gives you. The problem here is not that there's alot of traffic, the problem is that if you want ANY chance of solving it, you need to be a master traffic technician and have the mod Traffic Manager. Without this mod, it's impossible. And even WITH this mod, it seems impossible at times.Another thing that I can find annoying at times is there's no ""auto complete public transport"". Any public transport line has to be made manually which is something I miss. I really  can't be bothered sitting for 30 minutes, clicking on every place I want a stop just for the busses to block the road. Ofcourse it's good that you can make it yourself but it CAN be really annoying. It should be optional.Overall I enjoy this game but sitting for hours and hours trying to solve traffic is a pain in the ass.Pros:- Great variation in content- Good mechanics (roads, zoning and emergencies)- Amazing modding community- Manual Public Transport LinesCons:- Terrible Traffic/Driving AI- No automatic public transportOverall opinion: Good game with some flaws that really can ruin your day occationally but most of the time can be solved with mods."

It might've missed some points but still, it is awesome! For this review, I will tend to leave out the DLCs and focus on the standard edition itself due to the fact that many people have covered Paradox Interactive's DLC practises.1st of all, the base game gives LOADS of game time itself. I would get addicted to it every single time and wouldn't realise I had been playing for more than an hour. Plus with the edition of mods, you can change up the whole game with more land, first person camera and more. Though, traffic in Cities: Skylines does have multiple issues but guess what, IT CAN BE FIXED WITH MODS!! :D lol2nd of all, this game isn't for people who expect Natural Disasters, Snowfall and more to be in a base game itself. Unlike SimCity, this game DOESN'T have some of stuff you would expect to have. Now, I'm not going to go into the DLCs practises but you can already tell, I am a bit disappointed with that.Last of all, this game unleashes your creativity in their Editor, Scenario Editor, Unlimited money mode and loads more content added too. You truly can't stop the action with the 25 areas mod too, letting you have ALL 25 tiles (UNLIKE SIMCITY!!). Though, it still doesn't stop there. The community is awesome and is ALWAYS realising new mods to make your game have a whole different feeling unlike SimCity's modding community.I would have to give this game a 9/10 due to the fact that this game fixed up most of SimCity's biggest issues. Already have recommended this to all my friends and you should too! :D"

It offers great city management and planning. It also includes multiple DLCs which are almost like separate games in themselves. One thing a enjoy very much about Cities: Skylines is that with each DLC release comes a smaller update to the main game featuring small amounts of the new DLC.A slight downside to the game is that it is very taxing on your computer. I don't have a problem with 30-15 fps but others might.If you enjoy simulators, I would give Cities: Skylines a go!"
2535,Veks,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198318565850/,2,,1,18.9,July,"15,",28,0,1,"This is a very deep city management game. It both looks excellent and works excellent.Graphics are extraordinarily good. The game has it's name for a reason! You can view skylines you developed yourself, during both day and night!One of the golden points here is the the traffic: it is really simulated, every car out there is coming from somewhere to somewhere. When somebody calls a police, the car has to make it to the scene before it is resolved. Meaning the better you design your roads, the more efficient your city is. And that means not only building more roads, it means minimizing intersections that accumulate traffic and placing your stuff so that people don't need to travel needlessly in the first place.You get only little of what to build at the start. Wider variety of stuff to do comes later. But in my opinion it mainly serves learning curve, by keeping advanced stuff out of reach until you need it.In terms of city size or population, population ages or such the game does not strive to be exactly realistic, gameplay is more important. But of course the principles are still the same as with all city sims. And when it comes to depth of simulation -More important in my opinion- probably nothing gets better right now.However, there is one shortcoming: The game lacks overall difficulty. There is budgeting, unless you turn it off from he options. But the main purpose there appears to be forcing you to make the city so it roughly works, not to keep you on your toes at all times. Even with a hard mode which comes with the game there are not any big worries about survival once you get a foothold in game.On the other hand, that's not a problem if you set your milestones yourself. The game is, again, so deep that it will definitely work fairly even when you're trying more than just keeping the balance positive.So, in summary: If you are looking for a good city sim, feel confident except if realism of the dull sort is your prime criteria."

The DLC´s are nice to have, and the mods from the workshop will make this game even more interesting to play, as it provides you with a wider and complexer gameplay compared to the vanila game. How close is this game to ther reality, I think it depends on how you play this game and which mods you installed. So far this is the best city building simulation game I´ve ever played. Maybe, if the devs could put in political aspects of a city into the game, it will complete the game even more."

Transportation, plumbing, city zones, electricity, noise controlling, all of these are problems you will face when planning your small town, or a big city if you can play it for dozens of hours. Plz note that the RAM requirement for this game is high. Only if you have at least 8G of RAM will you have a fairly good experience of the game. However, if you want to build a large city, 16G will be the minimum requirement, since you will certainly add some mods from the workshop.Hope you will enjoy yourself when palying this."

Soil, eventually I make a housing district around it and realise that I can make a bridge and tunnel straight through the mountain, because why not? I'm impressed by the engineers that made this dream possible for us all. These residents now have to make a detour through the highest mountain in the region to get to work, but they should thank me, atleast they aren't drowning. In the end it all fits together."

The difference is - the game *utterly relies* on these tropes. Gameplay isn't deeper than, say, Simcity 2013 or Simcity 4 or Simcity 3K. It's the same sorta ""Just plug things in and make the numbers go up"" game.You build police stations, crime goes down. You build schools, education goes up and people get richer and smarter. That's just the core gameplay loop. There's nothing deeper, no modeling of the trends and quirks of a city, no thought as to *why*  poor people are uneducated - it's just the Normal State of Things, unmoving as the borders of your city.The constant expansion packs - expanding things that nobody has actually asked for - really just punctuate this. There's still a lot of flaws in the basegame - there's still disappearing cars, there's still traffic problems (just look at all the photos of cars lined up in a single lane) - and none of those have been addressed. Conversely, the DLC has only added things that nobody wanted. I don't think there was a single suggestion for Blimps, or Helicopters, or Radio. Even the ones that were asked for are added in a very half-assed way - Donoteat did a great teardown of Industries.The game is decent at decorating, yeah, but performance during loading is ram-eating and horrific with a lot of mods. In addition, your modded city files are at constant risk of being bricked the moment C:O decides the game needs management of every individual toilet. Oh, and as a bit of a side-note - most content creators have mods which *actively disable* certain parts of the game - because it's so irritating otherwise.The Launcher Fiasco just punctuates this. The game didn't need a launcher. I don't think anyone ever asked for a launcher. But nobody asks for 99% of the stuff C:O adds on for a premium, while suggestions from the very beginning of the game's life cycle remain unaddressed. Where's a better traffic simulation? Where's mixed-use buildings? Where's a vanilla way to get around the idiotic road angle requirements? WHERE'S VANILLA ELEVATED TRAIN STATIONS???Of course, the response is ""Let modders do it"". But at a certain level, you gotta face facts and admit your game is ♥♥♥♥."

But after I see many repeating messages I started to completely ignore it.I wish that I could buy additional tiles after reaching last milestone. My guess is that land size is limited to prevent poor game performance but then one could make max number of tiles a configuration option or make additional land exponentially expensive for subsequent tiles to limit their number.It is sometimes completely not obvious what can I do to resolve some problem. E.g. in message panel someone complains about water quality but according to all metrics I see it's OK. Or a factory complaining ""not enough services"", showing in particular fire-fighters, while station is close to it.One can plant trees in this game but surprisingly they have no effect on the game in contrast to other objects one builds in the game. Since there are almost no ways to actively fight pollution except removing pollution sources it would be exteremely useful for trees to reduce at least slightly pollution/noise.My main complaint is about abandoned/burned down buildings. Older games of this kind (SimSity) have means to manually act on problems in city (e.g. dispatching a fire engine). Given scale of city in this game it is impossible to micromanage it without gameplay deteriorating into exhausting endless mouse clicking. So Cities Skylines is rightfully mostly about managing. And yet for some reason it constantly nags me to destroy abandoned or burned down buildings manually. There could be literally thousands of them. So, why? I suggest making buildings cleanup a part of policy or budget. For example: have policy to encourage businesses to re-use existing buildings, have automatic cleanup a part of budget so player can disable or boost it, make old building cleanup an optional responsibility of garbage trucks. Automatic cleanup can remove buildings starting with the ones that are neglected for longest time.There's also a problem with the way abandoned/burned down buildings are displayed. They are diplayed always on every map making it almost impossible to see where I have other problems. E.g. when I look at the water map the whole map is binking with these irrelevant icons hiding problem in visual noise. Moreover animated appearanc of these icons suggests that they do need some action while it's completely optional. I suggest displaying abandoned and burned buildings on land value map, display burder building on fire hazard map and hide them in all other views.The following ia my personal nice-to-have. City statistics is useful no understand what happens so it's reasonable to access it right from dashboard not from game menu."

With a team of less than a dozen people behind the helm, this game beats the behemoth creation from EA - hands down. The pure scale with which the game is imagined, the detail into the design - where do I even start? You don't need to read reviews whether to know if this game is good or not. Look at the screenshots, they tell the full story. Magnificent landscapes abounds. My favorite things about C:S are as follows:- When you zoom in to street level, the entire city looks like a tiny architectural model of a city. There are little cars, little walkways, dogs, pedestrians, trees. You can see the siding on the buildings, the delicate little railings on each and every apartment balcony. Homes have little satellite dishes and solar panels. The details are incredible. I love it. - Districts. Districts, districts, districts. The mark of a great city building game is the personality that your city displays as it comes to life. You bond with the city through its creation process, thinking about what the residents who live there will want, what their priorities are, how those priorities differ from the citizens in other parts. Now, with Cities: Skylines, you can map out the distinct areas of your city just as you envision them. I could rant for an age about this game, which turned out to be quite the gem. So much so that I invested about fourteen hours in one sitting. How's that for a recommendation?"

Following, when I exactly started playing the game, It extremely attracted me. As a matter of fact, once you go in, you are not able to desist from the game and you spend so much time without any awareness.First of all, You need to create new cities several times over and over till you learn the basics of the game. However, the process of learning is seriously enjoyable. After you do what you learn, it starts being more enjoyable. In the game, something like better instructor could have facilitated learning and you easier get used to and I think it shoulda been but unfortunately, They are inadequate at this point. Nonetheless, it is not the point needed to be cared about, since while you figure the game out by yourself the game is quite pleasent. As long as your city improves and expands, the game becomes more playable. That's going to be why you spend so much time in the game by saying ""I'm gonna close it but first let me do it"".My advice; Should you like playing games in the same type, absouletly buy this game, play and, get this played. It deserves to be played. You can ensure that it is not so behind the games sold more expensive than this game. I would strongly recommend."

So insanely good that I played almost every incarnation of the game for the next 20 years, except for the really horrible ""social"" versions, which were terribly dumbed down.Then after the great flood washed away the dinosaurs, and took with it the last of EA's great developers and designers, we few surviving life-long SimCity addicts were left playing SimCity 4: Rush Hour for long year after year, hoping for the light to shine down from the heavens and impart on us the great knowledge, wisdom and truth of a brilliant new version of SimCity. That's when EA shoveled on us the massing stinking pile of dinosaur dung that was the ""new"" SimCity (aka SimCity 5), and lo, it was dark, ominous, horrible, and shockingly tiny. And DRM-restricted. And generally awful to the point where we all agreed SimCity was forever dead, killed by a greed-driven troll in the dark mountain keep of Electronicus Artus.And then Cities: Skylines appeared. And there was much joy and celebration! And lo, it was not only good, it was GREAT, and instantly assumed the torch of being the true spiritual successor of SimCity 4. If there had been a real SimCity 5 in the spirit of its predecessors, then Cities: Skylines is that game.True, Skylines doesn't have all of the options that SC4:RH did, but clearly the developers are on the right path and doing the right things. Tunnels are now in, and I honestly feel that these folks ""get it"". I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a true spiritual successor to SimCity 4: Rush Hour. Stick with these guys, it feels like they're on the right path and could grow this game into something truly amazing in time."

But I have to say that I was blown away at this game and how well it runs.  This will sound weird - It has that ""feel"" and atmosphere about it that reminds me of the earlier Maxis offerings of simcity 2000 and simcity 3000 that I played as a boy. It doesn't feel like a cold calculated game. It feels like there was some fun and personality that was put into the game and that you pick this vibe up that they've really made a great effort into making the best game possible. There is that return to actually being vested in the little areas of your city.. your sorry when you have to destroy those buildings to make a bigger road, you enjoy seeing an area spring back to life after some minor changes and new parks etc. You can be as detailed as you want or alternatively take a more ""macro"" approach. The ability to jump between those two aspects is what makes this game come alive.And yes- large maps... do you hear me!!? large maps are in this game!Excellent transportation simulation and smooth gameplay its great to run and I haven't encountered a single bug or crash in the 2 days i've played so far.

Not just a mimic of Sim City 4, but a unique format, as others have put it Sim City is a City Building game with traffic, Cities: Skylines is a traffic strategy game with city building. The subtlety of the balance of the game is the best I've seen in a long time. When you first start out it isn't too hard to make a profit (unlike other games which are primarily based on the monetary mangement concept) but as the city gains size it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain growth as your services get drained and the requirements become more complicated.The same goes for traffic management, you start the game with your little roads thinking everything is hunky dory but as the traffic grows within your originally built infastructure it requires meticulous planning and investment to get a city running efficiently.I haven't even touched public transport as well as other things in the game and I can say I am already satisfied with the game. Great playability.The modding community has also been a huge success and has added some great features + assets to the game which compliment it perfectly, not just make it a cheating game breaking fest, which is a big plus for me.DOWNSIDE: You can't recraft the land, not a massive thing but sometimes you notice it is missing."

The unlocking of buildings/services/functions as your city progresses does not feel limiting but serves a vital role in ensuring less experienced/casual players find the game easier to play.90/100Only improvements I can think of would be;Adding a Region, allowing cities to interactAdding multiplayer region or easy way to exchange city tiles.I hope paradox will consider these improvements for the sequel, they are certainly on a distinguished road."

2697,Jguy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jguy1987/,2,,1,398.1,March,"23,",189,0,1,"This is a great game. Sim City 4 will still always hold a special place in my heart but this one comes very close, if not with the flaws of Sim City 4 balanced out with this game, it's the same.The game is fluid. I've had a city with almost 100k residents and no lag moving around the city and taking care of things. the game is a bit more challenging though...don't have the right balance of services and your city and you'll crap out. the flaws of this game:* As mentioned, if you don't have the right balance of things your city will fail, and fast. While laying new subway lines for my CBD my population went from around 15k to around 5k. Turns out that portion of my city randomly died, and fast. I then discovered that I had a minor traffic jam in which ambulances were waiting for a red light! One of the major flaws of the game: The emergancy services don't ignore the traffic lights when they're responding to calls - this makes major problems if you have a minor traffic jam, your ambulences are stuck waiting in it and your citizens die.* More onto the above point, if you have a well established public transportation system, 90% of the vehicles on your roadway are AMBULENCES! This is SO annoying. If you need to get precise, no matter where you zoom, you hear the sirens! EVERYONE in your city will call 911 if they have a bloody nose it seems! THIS IS SO ANNOYING.* The landfills have to be placed in the midst of your city, you can't just shove them off in one corner and have your garbage trucks carry the garbage all that way. This is a major problem as the landfills cause ground pollution. Probably not that badly as an incinerator, but with ground pollution near to your residents they'll get sick.* The onramps/offramps look a bit weird and are hard to manage, same with the curves of the roads. Not a game breaker though.All in all, I definitely recommend you get this game. It's fantastic, and with a HUGE modding community already going, it'll only get better."

2702,Bask,https://steamcommunity.com/id/basketro/,2,,1,142.9,March,"22,",253,1,1,"This is an amazing game. Following what SimCity 2013 brought of issues, terrible choices and problems, this game was released with a lot of similar ideas, but making pretty much all of them better. It is really fun building your city and placing your public services to offer power, police, education, and others. It is a great challenge to manage space for all of it. And for this I recommend playing this game without placing service buildings and roads over residences, commerce or industries. It makes a much better challenge that got me to enjoy the challenge much more. While really fun to build and plan your city, the variety of buildings makes me feel like there is slightly too few options and no modifications or customization to the buildings, but I really don't think this takes anything away from the game, it is more like something I'd like than something that is missing from the game. And when you know that a group of 13 people made all of this, it feels like it's not really missing anything. On the other side, the lack of expansible service buildings help you make better use of space if compared to EA's SimCity 2013.The best part of the game is probably the traffic management. Following the Cities in Motion games, that the focus was to manage traffic, many amazing ideas and features come from it. The way that you can manually build roads, railways and metro lines is amazing, giving space for a lot of different ideas and customization, you can build it the way you want it to be. I spent a lot of hours building and rebuilding roads, planning bus lines, bringing railways from far away to transport people and cargo from and to the city, and planning how my metro lines and stations would be placed.The traffic is not without it's flaws. Sometimes you can place a 6 lane road and for some reason all the vehicles will be using only one of them and making a huge line instead of spreading around and allowing the traffic to flow. In some cases it's possible to fix this situation, but not everytime.And one other thing that I really missed is any kind of negotiations with neighbor cities. I'm not talking about the multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from SimCity 2013, but something like how it was on Sim City 3000, that is a great game that had a nice feature that you could make agreements with neighbor towns, it was really nice.My final verdict is very positive, I think this game is great and if you're into city building, or even have a slight interest in it, you should buy this game. It is at a reasonable price, and offers a lot, it will probably take away dozens of hours of your time, but you will enjoy these hours.I'm really looking forward for what can be made better in this game and in a possible sequel, but am also afraid of the strategy from Paradox of selling 10 thousand DLC's per game. Hope it's not the case for this game, that the DLC's offer really good content for acceptable prices."

Or at least I know I'm not the only one who did. An addictive game that sucks the hours straight from your soul if you're not careful. It will take a try or two to get the hang of how to build your city, but once you do the mere size of what you can build is immense. It takes some effort to build a city to last, as it will get increasingly busy on the roads once it starts growing. You will probably spend hours on trying to make a traffic-network that isn't too clogged with all those unique people with their own schedule, car and life .. And somehow have a lot of fun doing it.A small downside to me was that, once you've build your immense city up to a certain size, you can get a bit lost on what to do next. There's only so many buildings to unlock and once the city runs, it runs itself. You could probably step away from the computer for an hour, come back and find that the only thing that has changed is how full your garbage dumps, cemetaries and wallet are (Might I add, that I find it hilarious that dead people and garbage have the same mechanic behind it?).The pathfinding for traffic still needs to be tweaked quite a bit too, but overall none of these things take away any of the fun you'll have if you enjoy city builders! Added bonus that, besides adressing the things mentioned above, the developpers have already announced so much shiny stuff they're working on for the future of the game.A hearty two thumbs way up.PS. I'm still convinced that they've added that gorgeous, gorgeous water engine just so that IGN would tell them they've got enough water."

Welp, Here I am, the guy that might actually make you get the game, so here is what I think.Firstly, the game runs INCREDIBLY smoothly, I have made a moderately large city in the short time I have played it, and it maintains a solid FPS no matter what view or task I am performing.The graphics are incredible, you can zoom right in and see little timmy running to school or his mom getting plowed by the mailman while dad is at work in the ice factoryTraffic is no longer a stagnant image, nor is it a randomly spawned graphic to make the game 'pretty', the cars and trucks and trains and planes and buses are there for a reason, and the people in them are there for a reason, if you follow Mr.X from his house, you will actually see him get on the bus, go to work at his job, come back and go home to the same house. Same applies to delivery trucks etc. Pretty awesome.The game has a pretty nice pace, you have only a select few abilities in the beginning, and as you progress you unlock more things such as hospitals, schools etc, so the learning curve is perfect, you get the hang in no time.Now, you might get in the game, select an environment to start Jakeisadipshitville and go ""WHAT!? The size of my area to build is TINY!"", Relax, you can actually purchase adjacent tiles of land repeatedly to expand your trailer park of a town, and it costs surprisingly low amounts.All in all, the game looks nice, runs nice, plays nice and it gets a solid 9.5/10 from me, there are tiny issues such as, no tunnels, no terraforming etc. That I simply prefer and of course the game is not catered for me personally anyway.Buy it, it is worth it!"

Ive extensively played every single Simcity that came out with at least 100 hours on each title. Up to 400 on SC2000 and about the same on SC4, except SC2013 which was, after playing 4 hours, so worthless that i ditched it.I have been playing quite alot now, mainly working on 1 city and changing/altering it and trying out new things inside it.It is a great city builder! It looks good, feels good and plays good. The interface is neat and intuitive.Some people whine about having to place electric cables and sewage/waterpipelines.... i love it! Finally its back, i have to build a network of pipelines and cables to make sure that electricity and water comes around properly. What SC2013 did was retarded, you lay down roads and automatically there power and water? give me a break. The only thing i kinda miss is some more depth in the economics, those feel a bit flat and shallow. The districtpolicies-system tries to adjust that but gives only few options and isnt satisfying enough (for me).Colossal Order does a great job already at bugfixing and is actively involved and interested in making their game even better. This is their 3rd title and also their biggest. A title that they claim is something theyve always dreamt of making so the support from them is expected to be big, especially with over 500.000 copies sold so far and rising.Other than that, this game comes right next to SC4 and thus becomes its only true heir. Job very well done by Colossal Order and Paradox.A must-have for any city-building afficionado, its pricing is excellent. Its alot of game for a very good price.

You'll probably need to install some of them to make it enjoyable (e.g. mods for traffic management).The possibilities seem endless - what if there was ""this or that thing"" to make it more realistic/enjoyable/complex? Well, Paradox thought of it too - so they present to you dozens of ""DLCs"" - you gotta pay fortune for all of them, some of them are totally unnecessary, but some of them are almost essential - any other publisher would put them in the base game, because without them, the game feels like a ""better demo"" (or early-access).

It may not be worth the full £22.99 for casual players however this product goes on sale quite frequently and you can pick it up at a price of under £5; an amazing price for the vast amount of content that is featured in this game.The gameplay of the game is difficult to describe since the early gameplay differs so much from the later gameplay. In the early stages of the game, it is filled with actions and decisions for you to take control of. From building roads and setting up zones to your first encounters with managing taxes and budgeting. At this stage the gameplay is fast paced and very exciting.In the later gameplay, the situation changes. Most of your time is going to be waiting for particullar zones to gain demand and then upgrading your city in terms of supplying water, electricity etc.In conclusion, this game is worth buying, however definitely aim for getting it while a sale is on as you will get so much more value, especially if you are a casual player like me."

Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but each DLC costs nearly as much as the game itself.Therefore unless you pick the game up on a SERIOUS sale and get **all of the DLC** with it, I cannot recommend it.

2786,Vivisector,https://steamcommunity.com/id/VivisectorGaming/,3,,1,85.8,March,"23,","1,672",0,1,Cities Skylines does an excellent job filling in the game that Sim City 2013 left. The potential city size is massive and the districts system allows you to specialize parts of your city- or just customize their appearance with the theme manager. With each piece of major DLC every user gets a bit of free content so even if you can only afford the base game you aren't bummed out by new content releases. Really if you love city-builders there's no reason not to pick up Cities Skylines.
2787,Milky,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itehime/,2,,1,239.9,March,"14,",30,0,1,"Cities: Skylines is a pretty incredible game that has a lot and i mean A LOT of downtime while playing it. It's a pretty intuitive system for citybuilding and micromanagement that seems daunting at first, but is easy to get used to. Its level of detail is staggering to the point of being detrimental once you are further into the game, where every single citizen, house, and car is named and each individual simulated piece has its own path and routine. I especially enjoy being able to toggle on certain services and being able to view each service vehicle on its way to doing its job. All the DLC has been very enjoyable although I wish it would add more than just a few details at a time; I want more scenarios, building styles, and especially parks and special buildings! The best DLC packs so far have been mass transit as it fixes a mirad of issues and actually adds a lot more new content, and green cities, although I wish it had come with more parks.The scenarios are the real way to play in my opinion; they give direction and purpose that sandboxing just completely lacks once you get past the first few achievements. The only thing is some of these scenarios are literally IMPOSSIBLE to complete without dedicating tens of hours of just letting the game run. I would like to be able to complete them but the game has a fatal flaw where at a certain point, demand and growth just stops. Many have turned to mods to fix this issue, but even with mods people have reported that it takes REAL LIFE MONTHS of time just to get a population to 250,000 to complete certain scenarios. And at this point, the processing power of your computer is so burdened with the afforementioned simulating of every individual piece of your city that the game runs at a glacial pace. This desperately needs to be fixed and is the least enjoyable aspect of this game, possibly even ruining it. I would like to be able to play a single city for more than a few hours before growth becomes impossible. Not to mention the monuments don't actually do their job, and truly just further stunt the growth of your city and stop all demand almost permanently. The base game itself also comes with no scenarios, which I find rather incredulous. More official scenarios, please! I recommend this game because of the enjoyment I've gotten from it, but i can't say it's the best of its genre or even a great game when it has such a game-ruining issue. It's very fun and engrossing for maybe an hour or two as you start your city, but then it's just a waiting game of sitting watching nothing happen, which is very frustrating. I'm still waiting for this game to fix its content issues that have been there from the very beginning and which almost all players have complained about! Just change the scenario win conditions from 250,000 to 100,000, please!"

I don't even know how long that is.I'll try and remain cogent(Edit: I wasn't). This is the undisputed king of the city builder genre. I have played nearly every rendition of SimCity over the last decade(longer, in fact), and years ago, even in it's vanilla state, this game dethroned it upon release. None of the classics could hold a candle to it, and I have a great appreciation for those old games.I've watched this game grow over the last few years, the community continually advance the creative possiblities, the developers continue to support it. And as of writing this review, it is now, by far, the most comprehensive sandbox experience you could have, short of programming your own game. You could place every individual trash can in your city, should you so wish. Every bench, building, bus/train/boat/taxi/tram spot, every single detail can be controlled. I've seen screenshots, even videos, that border upon making me rub my eyes in order to determine if I'm looking at a simulation or an aerial photograph/video. Building can be as simple or complex as you want it, you can spend hours creating a single city block of architectural marvel, or drop 500 houses down at the press of a button. The graphics are equally mallable. The difficulty can be non-existent, to remarkably tough. You could build a collection of tiny villages connected by rarely travelled country lanes, or a monstrous, tower-ridden sci-fi city, and pretty much everything inbetween. You can lock the season to autumn, spring, summer, winter, build in a desert, on a tropical island, in the alps. You can decide, mid game, if you want a mountain next to your park, or a lake by the highway. Basically, you can do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with this game.I saw a recent review complaining about optimization, the reviewer then made clear halfway through that his machine was below the minimum specs, or in other words, it's powered by a hamster in a wheel. Fear not, this game runs smoothly, and always has. That man is patently incorrect. But fair warning, if you want to run a lot of workshop content(several thousand custom assets), you will need a good machine. RAM can be particularly taxing, I have 16gb and that allows me to run around 4000 custom assets and mods. Speaking of which, I'd recommend looking up a video outlining the most essential mods to get(should you wish). There are so many great additions, I wouldn't want to list them in case I miss any. And another note; mod stability is unrivalled. Without mods, this game is still phenomenal, but I highly recommend them anyway.If you want a sandbox game, if you want a city builder, this is it. Without question. This game is almost flawless, the only real flaws I could highlight, are possibly the terrain system when it comes to hyper detailed, super complex builds, but even this can be worked around. And the traffic AI and how it chooses lanes. Otherwise, nothing comes to mind. If you were interested enough to read reviews and look at the store page, just buy this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. I've played more than enough to know that you won't be disappointed. I recommend this game and all of it's core DLC's.Most essential DLC's ranked in order of gameplay value:1. After Dark2. Snowfall3. Mass Transit4. Natural Disasters (bump this to number 2 if you value challenging gameplay)"

I've sunk many hours into this game since around the time it first released and it's honestly the best city builder I have ever played, but my biggest complaint about it is the fact that Cities: Skylines has very poor memory management. Before I upgraded the RAM on my PC, I was running on 8GB while essentially playing the game in vanilla, no mods or anything. That alone nearly prioritised all of my memory and made the game incredibly sluggish and choppy to play, even when I started a new city and haven't added anything in yet, which was really frustrating and inconvenient for me to deal with. After making a huge 32GB RAM upgrade, the game was finally playable with only a few mods installed, which was fine. But when I started installing a copious amount of mods and assets into the game I wanted to use, I ran into the same issue I had experienced while I was still running on 8GB RAM. The game was still very sluggish and choppy, even when starting a new city with nothing implemented yet alone, would freeze for half a minute whenever it autosaved, and I could never really browse on my PC outside the game when I alt-tab because everything was loading like molasses, almost borderline unplayable. It's ultimately discouraging to me because I want to create cities with eye catching aesthetics through the means of utilising mods, but it's nearly impossible when this game is redundantly eating up so much of my memory when I haven't even started on building a city yet, it kind of almost breaks my heart when I watch other creators online build amazing looking cities and get inspired by them, and I can't precede that inspiration because of how poor memory management is in Cities: Skylines. Unless the developers can be bothered to fix this problem, I can't recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone else who's looking to pour their creativity into making an aesthetically pleasing city outside of the vanilla aspect, especially if you're not running a very powerful computer that can handle the game's heavy usage of memory and whatnot."

It's very much inspired by the recent Sim City title (the UI is pretty much pulled directly from Sim City) but it makes some very important improvements. The cities are MUCH larger once your city grows and you can expand to additional squares. The game does a better job following individual citizens around the city. Also, the Steam Workshop support is great. There have already been a lot of neat mods and additional assets created and the game has only been out a few days. Also, the price point is better than Sim City's at launch, so that always helps too. If you were disappointed by EA/Maxis' title, check out this one instead.

The people in the game don't really 'travel' and the way traffic is formed is counter intuitive at best. No matter how hard I tried I could not solve the traffic problem completely.

That feeling of ""wow this is going to be great, a modern take on city building""? Do you remember the sheer disappointment that was experienced when you discovered that you not only had to queue for hours after purchasing the day, it was online only? EA at the time said it was because their Agenting System Glassbox was doing intricate calculations and that most PCs couldn't handle it. Of course, that turned out to be rubbish. Anyway, do you remember being locked down to your 2x2km area and wishing you didn't have to exit to the region and start a new city? With Cities: Skylines, Collosal draws upon those promises and excels. Building from their Transportation simulator, this game is the modern city builderthat you wanted. That isn't to say that it is perfect. There are stil some odd UI design choices and other input designs, but it does all those things that it was claimed SimCity couldn't do.  Today, I followed a citizen in a car. He was uneducated, and going home to his house in his district. He also had a dog. Then he went to work a convenience store. After work, he went back to the same address in the same car with the same dog. There is no slowdown in my experience, but I haven't built a huge city either. From what I can tell the game does provide a challenge and it also has that cool ""tilt-shift"" camera perspective that was used in SimCity. The game is gorgeous. Not only that but there is a terrain editor and an asset editor built in. For the money, you get a lot of value. Also there is still room for DLC! Special things no doubt which would only add to the game. Oh, did I mention that the game features left and right hand driving? I think there is also a multiplayer mode. With the asset editor you can build your own road configurations. So instead of just dragging out streets, You can just place predefined Streets. Want to build your own intersection? You can. Want to build your own park? You can do that as well! There is also SteamWorkshop from the start. You can download whatever you want. Built a cool map of London or Johannesburg? You can do that. Because while yes you are intiially restricted to 2x2km of building space, You can purchase more lots of land up to an official 6x6km map size. This is 3 times the size of SimCity Maps! The game contains so much more value than SimCities or Cities XL/XXL. You might think it would be very expensive, but the price is more than reasonable. In fact the devs could easily have charged twice, and I still would have gotten it.I am terrible at city builders, but needed to have an itch scratched. This game does juat that!

2822,Raskolnikov,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052023446/,2,,1,130.8,March,"31,",483,0,1,"SimCity 3000 was one of the first video games I ever played. I was terrible at it, but it instilled in me a lasting interest in city-building games. During my freshman year of high school, I bought a copy of SimCity 4 from Amazon. I probably spent over 100 hours playing that game before the installation of a new operating system rendered it inoperative. As such, I spent much of 2013 anxiously awaiting the release of SimCity. This anticipation quickly led to disappointment when the game received such negative reviews that my father, who has usually can't tell Terraria from Tetris, warned me not to buy it after reading about its flaws in The New York Times. Imagine my joy when I learned of Cities: Skylines, a game that claimed to be a successor to the classic city builders of the ‘90s and early 2000s without the flaws of the most recent SimCity.Cities: Skylines is a city-building game which sticks to the same general formula as the classic SimCity games while making significant modernizations to certain elements. The most obvious improvement is the ability to build curved roads – in SimCity 4, roads had to be constructed on a grid, while Cities: Skylines has tools which allow the construction of curved and even free-form roads. As this game is faithful to the SimCity formula, there is minimal resource management (unlike Banished), no combat (unlike Anno or Tropico), and a zoning system which divides properties into the Residential, Commercial, and Industrial classifications (RCI).Graphically, Cities: Skylines is quite impressive for a city-building game by a small independent developer. It even holds up surprisingly well at maximum zoom – one of my favorite pastimes in the game is to center the camera on an individual vehicle and tour my city at street level. The lighting effects are particularly impressive – large cities are beautiful at night. That is not to say that the game looks flawless when viewed under such a strong lens – it is sometimes possible to see vehicles clip through each other or buildings which have their entrances blocked by terrain – but these issues are understandable given the scale of the simulation. The graphical fidelity and large scale of the simulation do mean that the game is fairly performance intensive. The framerate stays above 40 on my Alienware Aurora at maximum settings, but my Dell XPS laptop, which is sufficient to run most games, struggles on larger cities.The default soundtrack is a soothing orchestral collection by noted Finnish composer Jonne Valtonen. While it is not the type of music I would likely spend money on independently, it functions adequately as a background for a relaxing session of city building. The soothing tone of the music fits the relaxing nature of the game perfectly. There are also a few other stations of varying qualities included in the default game. Some are complete with parodic advertisements for the in-game companies and a mock announcer. These elements are amusing at first, but the lack of variety eventually gets tiresome. Several DLCs add more radio stations, but I cannot comment on their quality, as I didn't see a point in purchasing them.One of the main selling points of the game over the earlier SimCity games was the traffic simulation. Unlike SimCity 3000 or SimCity 4, where traffic was estimated using an algorithm and the individual vehicles on the road existed solely for aesthetic purposes, Cities: Skylines simulates every vehicle and pedestrian. Each citizen has a home and a job and must commute back and forth. Furthermore, city service vehicles and trucks carrying goods and materials needed by shops and factories are also individually modeled. This makes constructing a good transportation network very important – indeed, most of the game’s difficulty comes not from keeping the city financially solvent, but from preventing the city’s road network from looking like the LA freeways at rush hour. If traffic backs up, shops and factories will become abandoned from a lack of deliveries and parts of the city will be cut off from fire, police, and medical services.Given the importance of having a functional transportation network, it is vital that the game provide a number of tools with which to do so. Fortunately, Cities: Skylines is up to the task. With all the DLC installed, there are dozens of different road types. There are also numerous types of public transportation, ranging from buses to subways to trams (trams were added in the Snowfall DLC). One advantage of Cities: Skylines over SimCity is the ability to assign stops to a line and control the order in which the buses or trams on that line visit those stops. This allows much greater control over public transportation, as opposed to SimCity 4, where every bus stop was effectively connected in one giant line. Citizens in Cities: Skylines are also much more willing to use public transport even when the nearest bus stop or subway station is a few blocks away.  I consider the ability to create a public transport network covering the entire city without having to build a bus stop every couple hundred feet to be a major positive.Cities: Skylines features several other differences from the SimCity franchise. The positive ones include the increased viability of clean energy (unlike in SimCity 4, wind turbines are a viable form of power and building a nuclear power plant isn't a recipe for scattering radioactive fallout over half your city when the plant decides to spontaneously explode), the introduction of water physics (including the ability to build dams and canals), and Steam Workshop support. The negative ones include the lack of a fleshed-out region surrounding the city (the ability to build multiple connected cities and to trade between them was one of my favorite parts of SimCity 4) and the removal of the explore your city by controlling an individual vehicle.No game is without faults and there are certainly a couple areas where Cities: Skylines could be improved. There is no way to determine what issue caused an abandoned building to be vacated which can make correcting the underlying problem more difficult. I've also sometimes had larger cities collapse due to a ""death spiral"" where unburied corpses cause more people become sick and die, resulting in a vicious cycle which can be hard to break. The traffic simulation also sometimes has problems with multi-lane roads, with vehicles pilling into one lane while neglecting the others. Maps in Cities: Skylines, while much larger than SimCity (2013) maps, also have a smaller buildable region than the largest maps in SimCity 4, and correspondingly smaller populations. To reiterate, my biggest disappointment with the game was the removal of the interactions between neighboring cities seen in the SimCity games. It is not possible to build connected cities on a region view map as in SimCity 4, nor is it possible to outfox other mayors into making terrible trade deals as in SimCity 3000. Given the monumental undertaking of creating a successor to such a beloved franchise, however, these complaints are relatively minor, and some of them are admittedly not so much faults in the game as symptoms of my nostalgia for SimCity 4.I doubt that Cities: Skylines will be remembered as fondly 20 years from now as SimCity 3000 is today. This is because SimCity pioneered the city-building genre, while Cities: Skylines merely improved upon an existing formula. That doesn’t mean that Cities: Skylines is any less fun to play than the games which inspired it, however. The classic formula is timeless and is no worse a basis for a game now than in 1989, and the incremental improvements and modernizations are so well-executed that in some respects the game feels better to play than the classics. As heretical as it sounds, I would rather play this game than SimCity 3000, with its improvements and smoother learning curve."

2825,Adreos,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adreos/,2,,1,"1,348.7",March,"4,",100,0,1,"==OVERVIEW==I had never played a city builder before this. But I have a personal grudge with EA so I refuse to buy anything from them so never tried any of the Simcity series.Then I learn of cities skylines and I find that lo and behold its on sale. As I wanted to try a city simulator I bought it to try out. That night instead of going to bed at midnight, I was up to 7 am when I finally went to sleep. It can be that addicting, I would of bought it at full price had I known.So this is a fantastic game, and approaching 300 hours on it I can say its been worth all of it. The game isn't flawless mind you, but its pros far outweigh its cons.==PROS==Ease of use - The game is very easy to pickup. There is an included tips bar for beginners but its pretty easy to intuit what you need to do without it. The interface is clearly labeled if you hover over any button. Not once did I feel i had to consult an online guide until I was trying new an crazy ideas.Sound - Sounds effects are generic and eh, sounds of traffic and the like. But the music is highly atmospheric and while simple its satisfying. Beyond the music there are various ""radio stations"" you can pick with some humorous radio hosts and decent songs, both original and licensed. Normally when building things I listen to my own music but for this game i tend to just listen to the game's sounds.Editors - Don't like how something looks? Need a specific type of road or park? The game includes many content editors build in. I have been making custom road types to fill in the gaps the developers left. And let's be fair to them, there is no way they could every type of road possible without disastrously cluttering up the UI. But you can also import your own models to add, really, whatever you want to the game. The terrain editor is easy to use for making your own maps. There are still editors I've yet to use but my outlook for them is hopeful.Workshop - Made something with the above editors? The steam workshop interface is fantastic and easy to get whatever you made available for others. And its easy to search to find what you are after, assuming of course someone has made it. From mods to buses it lets you expand your game considerably.Mods - I'm no modder so I can't talk about ease of modding the game but as for ease of using the mods, its one of the easiest I have encountered. Simply subscribe to the mod you want on the workshop and turn it on in the game's conent manager, in the main menu. No manipulating files, not confusing setups, just click and done. And the community mods generally fix most of the in game cons.==CONS==Traffic AI - Let's talk about easily the most frustrating part of this game, Traffic. While making the city is great and all but traffic is the lifeblood to make the city function. And the traffic has horrible AI. It picks the shortest route when it starts, and come hell or high water it will stick to the route if the player hasn't removed or changed the road in route. Which means if there is a problem in route it will just back up. You also can't control how lanes connect at interest ions which makes it very difficult to try to direct traffic. All you can do is place roads and pick if an interaction has a light, which sides have stop signs, or if its unregulated. Real life cars have access to traffic reports so they can talk alternative routes, it would be nice to see that in this game. Or if ""residential"" cars were more savvy as to the bad roads the ""new"" or ""tourist"" cars.Annoying Building Requirements - This is more a personal gripe then a real flaw. There are unique buildings you can make in the game, such as malls, telescopes, etc. But they all have some sort of building requirements. Not just space and cost but to unlock them you have to do some, odd tasks. The good news is these tasks carry across all maps so once you do it once you have the building for good. But making this happen... Some are simply, like have X amount of a type of building. Some require a certain event to happen. but the frustrating ones are when you have to have ""X condition for Y amount of time."" And example is to get the Lazert Plaza you have to bring your entire city to low average health, which is a  tall order in and of itself difficult without killing everyone, but you have to maintain it for several weeks which is hard as the population dies or leaves the number of remaining people is more healthy, so the average health rises.Chirpper - Chirpper is then in game messenger the citizens use and is an obvious parody of twitter. Sometimes this is useful as it lets you know about problems, like part of the city doesn't have running water. But the vast majority is flavor, like liking or not liking a zoning plan or decision you made. Its amusing to read once or twice, but it never stops. And there is no options for Chirpper other then the hat to give its interface.Mod-Limitation - While i love the modding, you are limited with how many mods it lets you run at once. Just let me run mods and its my fault if I put to many to run. This is compounded by several build in mods, like unlimited money and unlock everything are all separate mods and count as 1 each, so if you want them you cut down drastically on the number of community mods you can run.DLC Prices - While the game is good, the DLC prices can seem a bit obnoxious at times.==CONCLUSION==Yeah its got its flaws. But its a very fun experience which I would recommend to any city simulator fan, or someone wanting to try the genre out."

The single-player simulation game from Colossal Order and Paradox Interactive has the made road management key to building the base of cities with roads that have purpose and thought rather than just for a design. It becomes more than just roads as more needs like garbage, water, electricity, etc., will appear to create more need organization and layouts to create a booming city. Not to mention the ever-present threat of going under with the cities money. Taxes become an essential tool, especially with toll booths, to stay above the waves of income loss and steady profit from the growing city. The game is very addictive and great to help challenge individuals to become better at balancing multiple needs at the same time. The DLC's have also given more layers to this ever-changing game from After Dark to Sunset Harbor, with each making the game even more worthwhile. Every piece of additional content added creates a crucial thread to overcome in a functional city's ever-growing puzzle. Even modded content gives fantastic additions to the game in various ways, from simple recreations of real-life buildings of the Burj Khalifa to the Empire State Building and even simple mesh updates and even maps of real-life locations or video game maps. Even adding in an Imperial Star Destroyer or Godzilla or Gundam EX-16 Mobile Ship Albion could be plopped down onto the city for the fun of adding some different representations of well known fictional creations. 9.6/10 :D"

Here's my review anyway.Basically, a modern SimCity 4. If you loved that game, you will love this game too. However, there are some differences. So in comparison:-By difficulty, its a lot more forgiving than SC4. Therefore, its more enjoyable for first time players or those who want to relax, but may feel a little too easy for advanced players who expected challenge of super micro-managing and chances of immediate bankruptcy. But the growth of your city will definitely go much smoother than in SC4. And there will be a lot more factors to look out for.-By freedom... It's rather strict on what you can do... But its understandably strict. You unlock bigger buildings once you get more citizens, which makes sense. Or unlock some buildings by reaching specific goals. I feel like some requirements could been smaller to give you more freedom on how you want to shape your city. Just don't expect to be allowed to build a massive trade center skyscraper right next to small town you just started. Also, it seems like there's no ability to build own massive landscape and have multiple cities connect to each other, like in SC4.-By music and atmosphere, it feels kinda generic and it isn't so memorable. There are few radios you can choose from for music. Some have fake, comedic commercials, which are nice touch to city building and may be worth a chuckle. But I wish there was option to make custom radios and include own playlists of music (you already know what kind of playlist I would make).-By graphics, its obviously, far better. All in 3D and quite demanding on specs. It has actual lighting and landscape is pretty looking. Zooming into streets to look at details of living and breathing virtual urban space you just built, is sure amazing.Is the game worth its current price? Maybe... I would recommend getting it on sales. It feels kinda steep, but I'm not in place to judge that with current playtime. But it might just offer a lot more than what's expected."
2893,Jean-Marie Le Pen,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ainin/,2,,1,255.8,August,"17,",59,0,1,"tl;dr great game with active community and high replay value, but as a simulator it falls short-----As a game, Cities: Skylines is incredibly fun. It's a blank canvas where you can build the city of your dreams (or nightmares), with a massive library of mods, scenarios and maps for every conceivable need and desire. It's jam-packed with many well-conceived features and advanced functions, from road management to mass transit control to landscaping.Because of its open nature and big community, the game allows high replay value through many styles of gameplay -- building cities from scratch, taking over others' shared saves to try to fix their cities' problems, blowing up beautiful premade cities with asteroid showers followed by an EF5 tornado, etc.Of course, no game is perfect, and Cities: Skylines falls very short in the realism department.The game's zoning mechanic is stuck in 1965, while the traffic system is Robert Moses' wet dream. As it stands, the only real American cities that you could accurately build in Cities: Skylines are Los Angeles and Las Vegas, because it favors sprawling suburbs and isolated neighborhoods with single uses. Mixed-use development is non-existent in the game, and trying to integrate commercial, industrial and residential uses in a single area (like in most real, organic cities) yields very poor results because the traffic mechanism will overwhelm your roads with trucks.As a simulator of 1965 urban planners' dreams of rings of self-isolating suburbs surrounding a small central business district, all bisected by legions of freeways, it's great. Otherwise, it falls rather short, which is a real shame since its semi-predecessor Cities in Motion 2 nailed mixed use."

The management isn't thrilling, the early game budgeting process can be mundane and tiresome, and certain systems (especially deathcare!!!!) don't work very well or scale to large cities. The stock maps are also not very interesting re: terrain and other unique building challenges.However, the core of the game is creating a complex city, with systems that work together seamlessly and automatically. In that regard it is more of a puzzle game than a city builder. Expanding your city requires careful thought and planning around traffic management, zoning, road placement, utilities, services, and more. This challenge - the idea of building a self-sustaining network of roads and services - is what makes the game so satisfying to play, and what keeps me playing it until 2 or 3 in the morning on occasion.That's not even scratching the surface of the mod community, who have improved this game exponentially beyond its base capabilities.If you enjoy sim games where you create things moreso than manage them, Cities is for you.

2896,Marksman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Marksman176/,2,,1,"1,103.2",May,"4,",98,0,1,"Best city building game so far. But, to be honest, I wouldn't recommend the game if it didn't have such a good modding community. Mods give the game almost unlimited potential, you can build surprisingly realistic and well-detailed cities - only your creativity is the limit. Because of this, getting to understand the game with its full potential takes time, and effort not to mention. You have to understand the game mechanics and even better if you also happen to know some basics of the functionality of real cities (this at least in the case you're building a realistic city). This kind of gameplay is not for everyone though. Some people don't want to complicate it too much and play just to relax. That's what the vanilla game is good for. Pros: - Almost unlimited possibilities for building a city. - Well optimized base game - Amazingly well made DLCs - Good citizen and vehicle AI, which can be improved with mods.- Ok graphics in the vanilla game, but can be made amazingly good with mods. Cons: - Requires a really good computer when using a lot of mods and assets. Vanilla game doesn't need that good computer though, which is good. - Vanilla game is too simple, in my opinion. It gets boring really quickly. Some people like it though!"

I live in the U.S. where big cities are made up almost entirely of the tall OFFICE buildings, then smaller or perhaps similar sized (still tall) commerical buildings (but what is that really in a big city?), and somewhere mixed in all that are residential in those same buildings or different but still usually tall.In Midtown Manhattan, the tall buildings are offices. Uptown are short residential, On the BOTTOM of the office buildings are commerical spaces. Same building. Downton the buildings are shorter. Commercial space on bottom, residential on top. Or maybe and office or art stuido or whatever on top. But it's the same way in other cities around the country as well. Office buildings are BIG. Residentials are usually not as big or if they are, they are mixed office/res/commerical. Maybe we need mixed zones? A hybrid zone type? I guess I just don't like this concept that the offices, one of the 3 main zones in the game, are so short by default. This is just a different world from where I come from.I've played this game many many hours. But this nagging issue turns me off more and more over time as my cities get bigger.They look like cities, sure, but not ones I've ever seen. A bazzillion small office buildings all over the place with huge tall residential and commerical buildings in he middle. I don't know what I'm looking at and I lose interest."
2908,Althazar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackDragonAJ89/,3,,1,768.6,April,"7,",58,0,1,"Cities: Skylines and it's various expansion packs are the tale of an indie developer's dream to create a game that many would assume is impossible for a small group to work on. While it's a great game overall, it's not without it's faults.Many people often state that Cities: Skylines is the ""real city-builder"" to SimCity 2013... As some one who has played both games for a very long time, I honestly say they are two different games that show the ultimate problem of the city-building genre.But as for Skylines, let's just say that it is ultimately the ""City Painter"" of the two. This is not in a mocking tone; with the variety of assets you can create/find as well with a few mods, you can create whatever city you can dream of. There are so many features and means to this game, it's surprising to see how such a small dev-team can pull it off. The large amount of space on the maps means you can create much more realistic cities, or simply opt to create several smaller towns spread across the region (as I do myself). You could even, with a mod, take a ride in a car and see your city from a citizen's point of view... That's how artistic and crafty this game is.But it comes at a price... The overall depth really isn't there. While you do have some challenges and moments where the game does test you (Natural Disasters adds in some curve balls especially), there overall isn't going to be a lot that happens unless you get careless. There's no economic catastrophes, no global market where prices on oil can cause a crisis, and no real reward for educating citizens outside of cleaner factories... As far as ""classic city-builder"" goes, the game is just that, but if you want more depth and see the cause and effects of say, a casino opening up shop or what happens when housing is built down-wind from factories, the other city builder I mentioned does that better at the cost of content and some complexity. But alas, has there ever been a city-building game that truly focused on economic stability and social factors as opposed to growth and profit?Ultimately, as a contributor to the workshop and a fan of city-builders, I recommend this game in the end despite not truly going as in-depth as I want it to. Yes, it's a bit pricey, but if you really want to build the biggest city imaginable or take a spin down your own highway through your very own take on Blade Runner's Los Angeles, this game will deliver on those goods. The dev team is committed to this game, and it has a very active group of players who create a variety of stuff everyday."

You can try to create traffic efficient cities, traffic free cities, grid style cities, or cities without a straight line in them, cities with no education or crime prevention - not that I would personally - and it's a joy to see how different approaches achieve different results. You can go mad on detailing and really challenge your CPU by installing many custom assets, or create your own.

This game is a Gem, 10/10 from me and hats off to the devs, as they have really worked hard upon it.At first I was little doubtful, since, I never heard of this title(Though it's famous one, but wasn't marketized as much as it's other compititor), so nevertheless, I must say, I am not at all disappointed.So below are pros and cons after my 5 hours of gameplay.Pros.1. Eye for a detail - On this aspect kudos to dev team as they have really kept an eye for a detail. E.g. A very small but practicle thing, if you install a water purification pump next to the sewage pump in opposite of river flow direction, citizens of your city will start complaining about bad water taste. Amazing.2. Situation Adapting Music - This adds great potential to your gameplay. If your economy is doing well, you will hear the pleasant music on the other hand, in poor economy, a sad and warned music.3. Tiny but great Graphics - As this game is all about managing your city with resources and rise the popularity of it, The graphics level are astonishing.4. Build as if you were practicle mayor - All the functionality this game offers like instruments, architectural structures, even policies(Ban Smoking, Ban Heavy Vehicles etc.) are just like real life, which makes this game more intresting.5. Running out of money? Take loans from bank - Expand your city as you dream, but wait, are you short of money supplies? Take out loan from the banks but bear in mind, the longer time you will hold down the loan, the greater the amount of installment you will have to pay, including intrest.Cons.1. Frankly, I didn't find any flaws in the game.P.S. This is just my own opinion and I really loved this game. I end up spending 5 hours straight the same day I bought the game."

But sooner or later I was dissapointed by them.Either they were too linear or too limited.Then I heard about this little gem and was really sceptical. I watched several youtube videos and thought hard wether I should spend the money or not...and if I would be willing to buy a new pc for this game.In the end my curiosity won and it was not dissapointed! A great game and I especially love the community and their never-ending and great ideas!
2926,Gamma Lyrae,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gammalyrae/,3,,1,8.4,June,"4,",514,0,1,"A fantastic city building sim, built by a small team on a meager budget, they've produced a top notch title with a pro-consumer business model. The game is a budget title ($30 instead of $50+), and with each DLC, half or more of its content is effectively given to everyone for free, as many of the features that were developed to fit the theme of it are delivered by a patch that you don't have to pay for.Some may say that this means the DLC doesn't offer you much, but in a time when games stay in early access indefinitely and others have 'season passes' that ask you to pre-pay for unknown content of questionable value, i'd say that purchasing the DLC even if it's a little light on content at times would be a good way of showing the developers that a business model like this is worth continuing."

2936,soldyne,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998257334/,2,,1,474.0,December,"17,",200,0,1,"This is the next great king of city simulators.  I spent my first 100 hours of this game making new assets and even taught myself 3-D modeling just so I could have exactly the kinds of props and buildings I wanted in my city.  After making about 100 of my own assets, it then downloaded 400 more.  I was like a kid in a candy store!  I then proceeded to play the game for the first time after 100 hours of testing and planning and spent another 100 hours building my dream city on my own custom map with my own custom assets.  any game that allows you to spend just as much time out of game planning, preparing, learning and growing as you do in the game experimenting, testing, failing and succeeding is a great game indeed.Pros:  - Curved Roads:  The game allows for curved, free-form placed roads and grid snapping.  There are also tunnels and free-form bridges which make for many 3-d options for your cities transportation needs.- Transit:  Transportation has many forms; there are of course roads of various sizes (2, 4 and 6 lanes with 2way and 1 way options), highways with on-off ramps, rail for both passengers and freight, subway/metro, air travel and sea travel.  You can even set up your own bus lines and design your own mass transit hub.- Districts:  you can designate districts in your city to not only give different areas names but also to assign specific policies.  have no-smoking in one part of the city and set 'mary-jane' to recreational use in another!- Individually simulated people:  the ""cims"" of the game are individually simulated and tracked.  they have lives they live out in your city, being born, going to school, get a job, going to the park, going shopping, retiring and eventually dying.- sense of progression:  the game has milestones as your city grows which unlocks various services.  before the services are unlocked your city generally doesn't need them so you can stay small and not be punished.  The game also has in-game achievements in the form of monuments and unique buildings.  if your city meets the achievement requirements then a unique building with special abilities will unlock as a reward which gives you plenty of goals to shoot for while you build your dream city.- Lots of space: - the base game starts with a single 2km x 2km square to start you city.  it then gives you the opportunity to expand this to other squares in a 5x5 tile map.  in the base game you can only buy up to 9 of these 25 tiles, but, you can buy them in any contiguous configuration.  with mods, you buy all 25 tiles which will be more than enough room for any city.- Water physics:  the water on the map actually flows and can affect things like where water pollution ends up and where you can build a hydroelectric dam.  if you build the dam in a bad place or destroy a working dam it can flood your city which would be a disaster of your own making (and who doesn't like making disasters?)- MODs, MODs, MODs!  if you don't like the look of a park, you can change it.  if you need a building of certain size to fit in a tight spot, then make it.  if you want your house to appear in the game, you can do that too (with some 3d Modeling skills).  If you don't like the way the game works, there is probably already a mod to change it.- Active Dev support:  the developers are active on the official forums and respond regularly to many threads.  they also put out regular updates and have indeed fixed many of the bugs that were initially in the game.Cons:- Unrealistic Industry:  Lot sizes are limited to 4x4 on organically grown lots which is fine for most residential and commercial lots, but, realistic industrial lots are much larger than this.  While this game does not do industry realistically, no game does, so its just par for the course.- No Parking:  Another thing this game does not give justice to is parking.  As an American living in a suburban city I see shopping plazas with acres of parking lots at every major intersection.  in this game, all commercial lots must be placed right along the road side which is good for small town out-lots or big city high rises.  realistic suburban shopping centers require extra planning and the creation(or download) of custom assets and even then decent, realistic shopping centers are difficult to build at best.  but, like with industrial sectors, no city simulator has ever done parking right, so again, its on par with others of its kind- Death Spikes:  as mentioned in the Pros above, your cims will die at some point.  currently, all cims live the same length of time and if you build quickly then you will eventually have a spike in the amount of deaths your city will experience which can lead to lots of empty houses, and industry and commercial lots with no workers.  Plus the game has a new service which will dispose of the dead in cemeteries or crematoriums.  a death spike will overload this service and you could end up with a lot of abandoned buildings if you don't plan for it.- Water physics:  wait, wasn't this a pro?  the water may have its own physics but they aren't exactly realistic.  water can seem to flow in multiple directions on a river or can seem to flow uphill in some spots on certain maps.  Hydroelectric dams are extremely difficult to get working and sometimes may not work at all.  Once flooding starts it can take years of game time to clean it up which means your city is pretty much soggy toast.- MODs! again with the pros being cons.  since game modification is part of the vanilla game and is rather easy to do, everyone has submitted at least 1 asset to the workshop.  this means that the workshop literally has 10's of thousands of custom assets and mods and most of them are simplistic, useless, poor quality or unbalanced.  Trying to sift through the mass of mods to find the few that are actually worth getting can be a game all unto itself.  When you do find a set of assets for your game it could take several minuets (even with an SSD and 8+GB of RAM) before you can load even a new city.  as your city grows the load times get longer and longer.  Once the game loads it plays smooth, it just takes patience!- NVIDIA driver bugs - I use a GTX970 card with recent drivers which comes with a game ready setting specifically for Cities Skylines, however, I get constant crashes when viewing certain overlays like overall happiness, fire coverage, or land value.  this is of course handled by constant saving, but, needing to shut down and reload can be a pain."

Unlike many other games, Cities skyline does not confuse you with similar icons or different varieties of colour all over the screen.2) Game provides enough information for the user to keep everything under control and does not get lost. 3)Attractive design, good graphics and fun in-game Activities. Maybe by now, you think the game is a serious strategy game; which in fact it is to some degrees, but it does not lose its entertainment part. This game gives you so many small in-game activities and does not limit you to only designing your city. you can click on a random citizen or a car, get full information of them such as who owns the car, what is the type of car or where your citizen lives, works does or what is he doing. You can rename them to whatever you want and it does not get limited to cars and citizens, you can rename buildings, factories, shops, animals, parks and even streets. \4) I hardly can remember any bug or problem in game that bothered me ... good updates fixed everything*************************************************************************This game is everything that you need to build your dream cities. one of the most important parts of this game is its community. the game has a tool that allows you to create or edit an existing building (that includes parks, houses and such) or even a map. You can come up with crazy ideas and make them happen. Even better you have chance to share it with others via steam workshop and let others enjoy too. Infact I made alot of buildings that people use them right now.You can also get what others made and have fun with unique looking buildings************************************************************************************•	Your creativity and imagination are the only things that matter.  The game does not limit you with rules; in fact you are free to try different designs. With different tools you have option to create your city just as you like*************************************************************************************This game is a complete example of a good interface / well-designed game. It pretty much fulfils all expectations and meets all the principles of a good interface. It is impossible to think of a bad aspect in the game as everyone is satisfied by this game. Even if you have no experience with games; you can start Cities skyline with no fear of getting lost in the game and you can enjoy having a good time playing this gameHighly recommended"

It was one of my favorite games until SimCity 4 with Rush Hour came out. I spent hours making my own terrain and connecting the different cities. I was happy but I had 1 major wish: curved roads that buildings would attach to.SimCity Societies was a dull useless game that I gave up on quick.Then came Cities XL with its multiplayer pitch and the ability to make curve roads that buildings attached to. I dare say they did pretty good job but the game was riddle with memory leaks and bugs. It started as an MMO but that didnt catch on. I tried Cities XL 2011 and 2012 and was suckered into Cities XXL. None much better than the last. I wish I had seen the video for Cities: Skylines BEFORE I got Cities XXL.Before the last Cities XXL, there was one called SimCity 2013. Me and a few friends bought and loved it ... for a short while. The huge problem was the limit on the size of your city. After that, I had no intentions to returning to the game especially since it was incomplete. That was on purpose, so EA could sell parts of the game as DLCs. No thank you.Skylines puts all of the previous city building games to shame. It is the best I have ever played and I believe it will be the best ever.

Interestingly enough, C:S's massive learning curve is probably one of the best and worst things about the game.  If you make a mistake, you're punished, yet learning from those mistakes and not making them again is extremely rewarding.  Also, C:S is really quite beautiful and the various mechanics of the game like pollution, happiness, and health (there are many others) function extremely well.  C:S is also hugely customizable, allowing you to rename pretty much every unit in the game, even districts, your town, etc.  If you want to make a road that goes in a spiral or ties itself in a knot, you probably can.

Reaching out to tech is helpless because you're going to get the same run of the mill answers, put on hold, or talk to a bot. Ive read countless online fourms, watched hours of youtube tutorials, on what to do about this issue, and tried just about every possible solution. Nothing and I mean nothing has helped, except for one thing.... Wiping out my entire PC, Resetting everything wiping the whole PC clean and starting new. Ive even gone as far as deleting all of my mods and assest to see if that helped and nothing, just the PC reset is the only solution. Ive reset my PC 3 times to get let down trying to run this trash game. At this point, I am done giving this game my time, or money for DLCs until this issue is addressed and fixed. Im not the only person experiencing this issue. Im done playing a game, investing time building something only to have my game crash unexpectedly then start over from scratch because i cant even get the game itself to launch without an error code. like no main menu, nothing just (sorry error contact steam click here) nooo im done thanks steam..

But is it somehow extraordinary in some kind of way? Well, let's find out.Firstly, I would like to get to the game itself. For me personally, I was always excited about the city-building games so I have searched Steam and found this – and I just bought it expecting... something. At first, I didn't really care about it because I was fascinated with option to build a city as I would like to, but then I started to get into the game and obviously found its advantages and disadvanteges. Advantages – The game has everything what a sandbox city-building game needs to have. The traffic, building options, even the income management. Moreover, you won't get bored anytime soon because of the constant problems your city will suffer with. But the very biggest advantage of Cities:Skylines is its ability to modding. There are thousands of various mods scalling from maps, style themes, traffic, buildings, parks and even incomes – the modding ability allows to improve Cities:Skylines in a major way. Disadvanatages – As we all know, there must be some bad stuff in every game and Cities:Skylines is no exception. Traffic is a bit cringe in some moments (when there's a turning line, the cars will turn into the turning line right before the traffic lights –> this makes a junction). The major problem for me in this game is it's DLCs. I fell dissapointed that you have to spend an extra 7,5 euro on a DLC which will add a night or a winter to your game.But all in all, Cities:Skylines is the best game in its genre. The various modding abilities do change the game itself 100% and the gaming experience and joy will never run out of you!"
2985,Sean the Sheep,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sheeplesteeple/,13,11,0,26.1,May,"8,",272,6,1,"It's the perfect contemporary city sim, the  replacement for the recent spate of disappointing Sim City games; with beautiful visuals, an in-depth traffic system, citizens who live fully autonomous lives, and a great user content creation system. But the absolute BEST thing about the game is having to pay upwards of $10 for the most basic features of a city simulator game which aren't even very spectacular or exciting. For $15, you get night time!! Woah! Cough up another $15 and you get... imagine this... natural disasters! Who would have thought? You couldn't ask for a better deal! If you're really itching for it, you can pay $14 each for features like... snow...... some cool looking blimps and trains and stuff............ some parks..................... some more eco-friendly.. things.. (this one also includes some new hats for your twitter bird that you probably already modded out of the game, wow!) There's also DLC for, um, radio stations, and ""concerts"" with ""music and images"" provided from 3 licensed musicians but you can only place one concert building in your city anyway and the citizens just kinda stand around like bored drones, like they don't really wanna be here but maybe they're getting paid to attend to add some atmosphere and culture to the city, or something. It only has one concert venue, after all. Maybe it's totally tokenistic? Maybe your city is just a colony for people who aren't really into music? That would explain why there's a grand total of 3 musicians that keep bothering to perform there. Maybe you can imagine while you're playing that they're pod people and your city is actually the ground zero for that movie . They've probably already taken over Paradox Interactive."

This game is very easy, build any common-sense city and you will be rolling in tax income with no budgetary, social, or infrastructure problems whatsoever. The buildings and vehicles are cartoony and look like candy. Certain mechanics are poorly thought-out, such as the optional day-night cycle disabling solar power plants and the ridiculous six-lane roads causing more problems than they solve. The DLC packs add one or two useful features, usually transportation-related, but are padded with otherwise useless content. Public saunas, really? This is not stuff real city governments are concerned with.Still, it's an impressive engine with some surprisingly intricate modeling, such as the waterworks and traffic simulation. But if you were expecting the next-generation SimCity 4 with countless hours of challenges, urban intrigue, and entertainment, prepare to be disappointed. It's a mildly interesting antfarm that happens to be the only city-building game on the market right now."

Plan first, but need creativity at the end.So far :Pros :- Beautifull graphic, especially water simulation.- Too detail. I could see my ""sims"" walking around the town, so do the vehicles.- Nice feature (district, making power line, need pipe for sewer and water)- Easy for moding- Can create our own map!- The trafic flows perfectly- The budget is usefull in this gameCons :- There are some annoying bug (my pipe drain couldn't work although there is power. Need to replace it until it works)- The game pace is too fast. I could get new land at although my city is still small. - The price for buying new land is too cheap. How can new land is cheaper than my drain pipe.- Some traffic's flow is annoying. The decision for choosing side of road by driver is just for the direction for next intersection.- Stll lack of variety of model. Especially, when building is high level.So far it is great city builder game in market. You could design your own city freely. Tools of making road is userfriendly and the UI is so minimalize so you could get all information fast. And then, i played a lot of Paradox games and they give their sincere for their game, in which you will get e new expansion for every 2-4 month!My life is in danger now. I rather play this game than eat :( Luckily, i am in distance relationship, so there is no other bussiness which could hold me to play this game. THANK YOU CO! Paradox!"

I love this game because you can play it just how you want it. Whether you like to focus on a pristine roads network or enjoy to micro-manage the exact composition of the roadside foliage, it is your choice! Growing and expanding your city stays fun and interesting. The whole process of constant adjustments and design also feels really organic, it is like your city is a living organism that keeps on evolving into something better (or not, in case you mess something up which is bound to happen every now and then)Save early, save often, and make sure to keep several saves in case you find out you messed something up a long time ago. Look at how real cities manage their traffic infrastructure because traffic jams can really paralyze your economy. Same goes for the location of your city's service buildings, no one likes to live next to a junkyard but everyone wants their trash gone. No real problems encountered, there has been a crash every few months but I suspect that was triggered by my pc and not by the game itself.Being a frugal Dutch lady, I would have loved to see that the DLC's were a bit more affordable.

There is so much to love with this game, not because of, but despite of Paradox's awful money grabbing DLC. The DLC is still too shallow and expensive. I would say, buy this game with the parks and some of the older DLC in a sale but stop there, the newer DLC is not worth it at all.I want to reccomend this game but I can't because of the F*CKING DLC. Stop it Paradox, look at 7 days to die, they add double the content in an update and you ask 15 euro's for half. I'm sick of this, look at the description of the after dark dlc: We added bikes, bus stations that can hold more than one line and a harbor that has a train station built in. I expect that IN AN UPDATE, NOT FOR 15 EUROS thank you very much. I will buy the DLC if it is three times as much and has some interesting things"

Options are still in game and grayed-out so that you know what you are missing, and some of them are features critical to the core gameplay. The same story with Planet Zoo and Stellaris, two other Paradox games. This company, Paradox, really needs to re-evaluate their DLC structure. At least other games that did this in the past were subscription-based, so you knew what you were getting into. The pattern is that this company releases a bare-bones game with a lot of potential, then releases updates that completely change the way that the game works, then keep adding expensive DLC to utilize the core changes in gameplay that they have implemented through updates. This means that when the game updates, you are suddenly faced with scenarios and are put in situations that would necessitate the new features, which are behind paywalls that they constantly advertise to you in-game. And this happens over and over again, year after year, for nearly all of their games."

It may take 2 hours to build an ~1000 household community that's one fraction of a district of the entire city, but the process and results are really enjoyable and an excellent way to spend large chunks of free time on. Needless to say with large amounts of DLCs, assets and mods the loading time means that this isn't exactly a game you can launch, play for half an hour and just leave, but if you need something to spend your entire afternoons on, this is the game.The mod community is one of the main reasons to get this game on Steam. They really compliment and enhance this game to something much better, with ever-so-fine controls over every aspect of your city, making it look better and work better, providing a more realistic experience and/or taking away your concerns when building a city one way or another. If you really want to spend the time, this can become Cities: Alleyways or even Cities: Road Signs, as people find more and more ways to adjust the details of their city.

Also with every update, I have to go search the mods I use (for basic functions you need a DLC for) again because the game kicks them out(?). With the new DLC out (which I do not own) I also lost all savefiles.Loading times are very long and the playable maps delivered with the main game are very few.If you consider buying City Skylines, keep in mind that you will propably need to spend a LOT more money for having fun and variety then just what the main game costs."

(I know SC5 is CRAP)I get it, everyone is angry at EA because of the major crap SC5 was, and if you compare both games, yes, definately Cities: Skylines is a better option.Still, I found that there is not reason of why you should play this game instead of Sim City 4 for example.There is no challenge at all in Cities: Skylines, to me it has been a sit and wait game, sometimes I have to pause, sometimes I have to fast forward and that's pretty much it. There is no other interaction with the city other than building roads and managing zones, there are TONS of features that are missing.To me, it feels like a basic or rip version of Sim City 4 with updated graphics, wich are fine but could also be better.I feel like this game is getting a lot of good reviews because of the failure SC5 was, and not because of how amazing it is."

It's eerily similar to Payday 2, where they had a great game and then milked it to no end for every last penny. Snowfall? Natural Disasters? After Dark? These should either be a part of the vanilla game or a singular expansion, not individual ~$15 DLC items. As for the Stadium and Content Creator DLCs, those are just ridiculous, it's like the Sims with endless ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC that's expensive and shouldn't be standalone.

Bought this last december during the sale and only touched it this week, and it's a great game.Since there's too many things to say, I'll just say it in bullet formatTHE GOOD-Runs decent on my system, it can handle HUGE cities and has no problems whatsoever, it's about time we use that 64bit architecture. although I would say the performance could do a lot more better.-The city/traffic/civilian simulation is realistic. The cars and the people aren't just eyecandy, they actually do something. Everyone has a name, you can see where they live, see that they go to school/work, they buy their stuff and go to malls, etc. They could own a car or use public transport, you can actually follow them and see them do their daily affairs.-Traffic simulation is the best I've seen in ANY game. same with the civilians, there is an economy system and every car in the game has purpose, may it be delivering goods from industrial buildings to commercial buildings, or providing raw materials to industrial, or civilians going to school, work, garbage collectors, etc. -Public Transport is also the best, you can actually setup bus/train/metro lines or setup taxi services, ship lines and airlines, and see them in action and actually serving the civilians who are realistic as well as mentioned above.-The road placement is very flexible and allows you to build roads of all shapes and sizes, you can even adjust the height, up to the underground level. Because of this, Interchanges are in the game(and it's actually useful, because of realistic traffic simulation) and you can also make your own or get pre-made ones from the workshop.-♥♥♥♥ the grid system, you can design cities that have curvy roads, and it's as easy as doing grids, although I personally like doing grid system cities, a lot of people look for this specific feature-lastly, MODS, THOUSANDS OF MODS, are in the game, and If you've played Elder Scrolls, and Half-Life, you'd know how mods vastly improve the gameplay experience, this is one of those games where it's super mod friendly and allows for countless mods for various purposes to be made. Examples are pre-made road designs, new structures, cars, camera tweaks, maps, skins, even ones that make the game more realistic.THE BAD-the only bad thing for me is that it's hard to learn the basics, thankfully we have Steam Guides so I was able to learn the mechanics of the game quickly. Although I would say it's hard because it's that realistic, if you want a good road system you'd have to take a look at real life road systems. so you're not just learning the game mechanics, you're also learning how city traffic and roads work in real life as well.10/10 The best city building game I've played so far, ok the bullet format isn't much of a help, I still wrote a lot of things"
3140,tchelabinsk,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073705206/,7,,0,8.7,July,"26,",62,0,1,"I began playing Cities: Skylines around a couple of years ago in console due to the lack of recent city builders set in the modern era since SImCity, and I remember playing it when it was still being developped I thought the game was going to get better with time, much better, here's the thing it didn't and after a bit I said why not buy it on PC to play around with mods, I'm sorry to be brutal with my wording but even on PC this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I will mostly be judging the game from a vanilla standpoint as mods are made by the independent community and the developpers at Paradox deserve no praise for them, although their efforts to push forward community efforts is admirable, the fact that the community does 90% of the game's development is truly telling.The graphics, even by 2015 standards, are BAD, like really bad. The base game has blurry textures, some other textures clip through terrain, zooming in on anything shows stretched and blurred textures to the point where I would recommend that you play only with a graphics mod. Even much smaller studios have developped games such as Ostriv where graphics are very well done, Paradox meanwhile thought they could leave all the work to the community.The gameplay is average at best and bad at worst, traffic is broken and the game overall is shallow without mods. In the base game there are 10 buildings max for each category with very little variety in what to build every city ends up with commercial, industrial and residential zones accompagnied by a couple of service buildings that look the exact same. Initially the game seemed to be a promising development path but now, in typical Paradox fashion may I add, every single new feature has been locked behind expensive DLC. 90% of the game's DLC are features you would expect to have in most vanilla games such as radio stations and transport buildings. It also doesn't help that the DLCs are very expensive and there are many, just today I saw that the full game DLC cost around 225 euros which is unreasonable and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke.Overall Cities: Skylines reflects many of Paradox's previous titles, lazy developpers who rely entirely on the community to do their job, bland and shallow gameplay and hundreds of dollars/euros worth of DLC that without the game is an empty shell. I can't recommend this game unless you either have a good PC with which you can mod a lot with or want to spend 200 (maybe 300 in the future) euros worth of DLC for."

The modding comunity is great because there are many great mods such as the first person camera mod. The only problem I have had is that not all mods come up in the cotent manager but I was able to resolve it by going into the files of the game. It is slightly annoying but it is still definatley worth it. Also, I shouldn't be able to run this game but I can still run it fine whilst the graphics still looks great. I have a 2.5 ghz processor and intel HD 4600 graphics with 112mb graphics. I can't garantee it will run if you have similar performance specs but it did for me! Anyway I would definatley recomend this to anyone who likes building or managing anything.If you aren't sure if you'd like to get this game I would recomend getting the Simcity 5 demo on origin and try that out. If you like that in the slightest you should like this game even more since cities skylines in my opinion is better that Simcity 5!I thinks it's better than simcity 5 because, this has bigger plots, more of the people are actually simulated in game plus I like the modding comunity for Cities: Skylines!"

Love just coming from the start having terrible cities and traffic to today which they may not look the prettiest but understanding how traffic works and growing a city is so entertaining. Hours escape me every time I play this. Also the community is very entitled expecting a new Cities Skyline 2 any day. I love the DLC now not every single one is needed but over the years seeing the labor of love it gets and the new implementations is always something to look forward to even if if I'm the only one in the community excited.

Everything is more about ""city designing"" if you wish. You end up with cities that are always perfectly planned (the imperfections are only the ones you yourself put in). After you know how the mechanics work there will be little or even nothing to ""suprise"" you during game play. The game ends up being more about aestethics than it is about city management.I'd like so much for the cities to have a more realistic growth feeling.On the other hand, the pros are just way too long to list. It's good, it's beautiful, it's fun to design a city even if managing it is a bit lackluster. And the devs are pretty cool. The workshop and the modding community are phenomenal. Defo a worth buy.The DLCs, though... Not so much. They're ok, but mostly insanely overpriced for what you get."

Overall, if you're looking for a city builder in 2020, this is really your best bet. However, do be aware that this is a 5 year old game that - in all due honesty (I love this game dearly), needs to stop getting DLC updates and just get a sequel. While that may just be a trope of Paradox games, after so many DLC packs of mixed quality, it becomes a bit ridiculous that you have to pay as much as you do to fully experience the game. Like I said, if you're absolutely  for a city builder, go ahead. I'd recommend. If you can wait, I'd hold it out till a sequel. If you ARE going to get this game, I would say that the community workshop mods/assets for this game are AWESOME and it is genuinely difficult to play this game without them. While Colossal has made many quality of life improvements over the years, and the vanilla base game isn't quite as bad as it started out with  traffic management, the mods available are great and when put to use can help you make some really awesome cities. Additionally, I'd recommend the following DLC: After Dark, Mass Transit, and any one of the post-Parklife DLC's that helped freshen up those aspects of the game (Campus and Industries being the other two). The others really are just aesthetic and are fine, but don't add too much to the game. Keep in mind, me not recommending this game is not me saying it's a bad game. It isn't. I just feel, at this point, you're gonna be better off waiting for ""Cities Skylines 2"" which is certainly bound to happen eventually. I think Colossal and Paradox have made a great community and game overall, and I do commend for that. Just, there's far too much of a premium of entry at this point for me to warrant a recommendation."

I can say this is incredibly fun and satisfying, with active and helpful devs. There are a few minor annoyances, like the AI seems to have stupid pathing on highways (sitting in the middle lane until merging at the last second to get off their exit is a particularly annoying bit). However, this could be due to my faulty city design. The building is great, being able to switch from ""snap"" mode (great at making hard angles or straight roads) to ""fluid"" mode, where you can build free-form. Also, building styles are varied enough that your city looks diverse, yet not too diverse that it seems out of place.

A day and night cycle could just be part of the game from start.But also without any dlc the game is great and has a nice modding community, where you get a lot of things to add.

If you look at my profile, you can see screenshots of my early cities in 2016 and realize I had literally 0 idea how to play this game. Once I picked up the game again, I studied the mechanics and had an absolute blast building my city! There is so much to think about when building a city: Traffic management, leisure, public services, how aesthetically pleasing it looks, and that's only the tip of the iceberg! With a wealth of diverse maps to build your city on, you can build nice types of cities every playthrough, from a snowy small town to a coastal metropolis. The game also has great DLC support and adds so much more to an already deep experience. Below I'll rank and give a brief explanation of whether or not you should buy the DLC in question. DLC Rankings:S-*Industries: Absolute must buy. Completely reworks your industrial areas allowing you to level up and progress your various industries (oil, ore, farming, and lumber), as well as make your industrial zones look a lot better.*Park Life: Another incredible DLC adding tons of assets to make your blank spaces look better. The ability to create custom parks ranging from basic city parks to amusement parks and level them up almost feels like a mini-management sim in its own right.A-*Mass Transit: A great DLC that adds really cool modes of transportation to your city, helping further reduce traffic and spice up your city.*Campus: Another DLC that adds a level-upable district to your city in the same vein as Parklife and Industries. A great expansion that's near and dear to my heart.B-*Green Cities: Personally one of my favorites because all the new bio-buildings/alternatives look amazing, but slightly lacking in the game-changing content that other DLC provide*After Dark: Day/Night is cool, but I usually disable it, adds leisure and tourist areas which are pretty neat and can make beach-fronts and other touristy locations look great C-*Snowfall: I really only like it for the trams, the winter maps are also pretty cool, but the added heating system isn't really that deep, kind of just plays out like water piping.???-*Natural Disasters: I don't really see the appeal of your city being randomly destroyed so I have not purchased natural disasters*Sunset Harbor: Doesn't seem to offer a lot for the price, so I have not purchased (I will update when/if I end up purchasing Sunset Harbor)Overall, I highly recommend Cities Skylines as it offers a deep city building experience currently unmatched in the market.8/10 without DLC9.5/10 with DLC"
3255,Cylun,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cylun/,No,,1,394.2,May,"11,",86,0,1,"C:SL has an awesome modding community, great concept and game logic, it could be such an awesome game.Unfortunetely, they made the same mistake as the developers of Cities XXL, they used a bottlenecked engine (Unity). No matter which mods I choose or how low my resolution and LUD is, the game has so low fps (~ 15 with a small citiy) that I can not really enjoy it even on my specced out PC. It's always one thread that maxes out one vcore, while GPU and the remaining cores are barely utilized.Another thing, I would like to point out is the updating strategy. With every DLC, they published updates that not only affected the DLC buyers but also existing mods and save games, making them oftentimes completely unusable, just because of some tiny changes. If you have such a great modding community, you might better communicate with them. If you have existing mods that do everything right, that fix things everyone expected from the game in the first place, you might prefer to integrate the mod into the game instead of publishing an own DLC. The Mass Transit DLC was simply incomplete, so that you still had to add various traffic mods in the end.I would pay for a DLC that only changes the engine or multi-threading issues but I don't expect it. I assume changing the engine is too much of an effort. But maybe a Unity update and a logic overhaul would compensate for the largest parts. Unity meanwhile has various APIs that could be used to optimize the drawcall amount of dynamic workshop content."

So I will just put this into my own perspective. I really, really, really like this game.I have been playing city simulators since the first SimCity was released. The genre has come a long way since those early games. I have played pretty much every SimCity (including spinoff games such as SimCopter) excpet for simCity 2013, lets be honest it's not the greatest entry in the series, and modern takes like Cities XL. So right away I felt at home with Cities: Skylines. What I really like about this game is it's deceiving simplicity. To start with the game is easy enough to get even new players to the genre building with ease. And for veteran players the interface all looks similar enough to what we have been using to settle in very quickly. The city population milestones means new services and enhanced buildings are brought in steadily. However it soon becomes more challenging to manage larger cities as the populous need more attention to keep happy. But that challenge never seems over the top or unfair. It is managable but you have to be on your toes. I would really reccomend this game to anyone familiar with or new to this genre."

I replaced my previous computer just to play this game better.  On 1/22/2020 I started the game to find one of the worst quality and unasked for launchers installed without my permission that had degraded my ability to play the game so severely, that I would not currently recommend anyone ever purchase a product from Paradox for now.To illustrate:Previously, I could start the game with one button in under 2 minutes and enjoy hours of play without a single crash.  I use many mods/props/assets using ~61GB of ram for Cities: SkylinesNow, I have only successfully played the game for 30min one time.  This was in the last 2 days with at least 15 attempts.  90%+ of the time, the new super duper launcher won't even complete startup.  When it does, 80% of the time, the game itself crashes my entire video and pc before I can even get my game loading screen to show up.  On the two occasions I've made it actually to a fully loaded saved game, one crashed after 30 min and the other crashed within 1 min.This was my favorite game, I played every day.  I've purchased every DLC.  The launcher is touted as being a great benefit for me an will let Paradox know about my gameplay stats more accurately.  Well, since your launcher doesn't work and wrecked the gameplay....I'll update you on my stats:  I no longer play Paradox games.If they ever remove the launcher requirement, then this is a five start must buy awesome game!  If they fix the launcher, then it will likely still be worth buying even with a useless launcher that really is just to monetize you for Paradox.  But for now, I would not, under any circumstances, ever, recommend this game to someone on pc.A very remorseful and formerly very supportive both financially and via gameplay time Paradox customer.  I'm hopeful they will see the light and unbreak their cash cow Cities: Skylines....and Instead put their developer resources into a Cities: Skylines 2.

How would I like to design your city? How should it look like?

Design your city before you build it. Leave some spaces for Schools, Police HQ and clinics.- By making Grids, Your Police Cars and FireTrucks will be able to reach their destination in time and take out the fire.- Keep Industrial Zones close to the Highways so your Citizens and Commercial Areas don't get polluted.- Place Fire Departments a little close to the Industrial Areas because they have more chances of Getting on Fire. - Land Value is highest in the Coastal regions or Areas on the bank of the River.- If you ever see a lot of buildings with the same problem, Search for its solution on Steam Guides or elsewhere. They are really helpful. For eg.- Not enough goods to sell?=Traffic Jam hinds the Trucks to export and Commercial buildings to import. - If you Find oil in your region, Place an American flag from Workshop. Other than that, make use of your district tool and specialize it for Oil/Ore/Forest/Agriculture. - You should have Taxes maximum at 12%-13%.

It doesn't need any more positive reviews than it already has. Is it better than cities XL? Absolutely. Sim City? Absolutely. But that's more a comment on the state of city management games than the quality of this game. So on to the criticism, since it's all I ever do.It's basically a traffic simulator, and does it extremely poorly. Road selections are terrible and citizens are extraordinarily simplistic. There is no lane control. There is only a 2 lane 1-way and a 6 lane 1-way (which I have never witnessed in existence once in my life and isn't even utilized by the games AI)... Mods GREATLY improve this, at the risk of added instability to an already poorly optimized game. Which seems to be this games development model, let the community fix it. I have bought a bunch of the expansions on sale recently and even the best ones feel half baked and low risk. I am scared for Paradox signing up for a second game with this company. While Paradox does put out some janky games, at least they progress greatly over time. This game hasn't moved an inch by the developers hand since release.And again, what was release was extremely lacking:Why there isn't a blueprint mode before you lay stuff down given the horrendous terraforming and janky snapping is beyond me. Money is only a problem in the very early game, making many financial choices arbitrary. Water is extraordinarily quirky and feels like a gimic. Building models between different sized buildings feel completely out of scale and certainly have very strange population capacities (again, can be fixed by a mod but mod user beware). The UI is very confusing, often unexplained and for some aspects of the game, like subways, a complete nightmare. God forbid you move a single stop in the entire game or be prepared to redo every single line hitting it.I played through maybe 2 cities my first run with the game, then didn't touch it for another 6 years.

Paradox has done a great job on this guy and continues to support it with DLC and new features. If you like city builders this game will ruin evey other one for you by setting the new gold standard, What few beefs I have with the game are easily remedied by mods which the creators fully endorse and a slew of mod authors with materials, for example not being able to unlock every tile on the map, not sure why they restricted that, performace maybe, but there is a mod for that. With the exceptioon of multi player (not a feature I look for in city builders) I can't think of a single feature missing at this point assuming you have all the DLC.Graphically it is pretty good, not going to win awards but still one of the if not the best looking city builder I have played. Able to controll traffic routs above and below ground if you wish. I honestly cannot think of too many bad things to say about this game, If I was to bring up one point of contention I do think the crime is unrealistically low, but it hasn't annoyed me to the point of finding a mod to fix it.

With all the mods that the community provides it is the best city building game I've ever seen. It has all the things a city-building game should have. The only downside for me right now is how ram dependent it is if you want to play the game modded, or play in a heavily populated city.Unless you have at least 12gb+ it is likely you will have to stick with about 10-15 mods. Anymore than that could make your game takes a decade to load or crash completely when loading into a city.Players might be put off by how many DLCs there are, but trust me they are worth it compared to many other games. There is a lot of efforts put into these DLCs and they are only sold for around $15 each, and frequently goes on sales. One DLC could add a whole lot more depth to your gameplay. Where as... *cough* sims *cough* i mean other games, charge you for way higher prices with little or no new gameplay depth.Overall, it is an extremely great game for your creativity to shine and build your own dream city!

There is no need for a second launcher or a second account. This was not part of the deal and we should be able to refund on these grounds. Frankly Steam shouldn't even allow games that come with additional ""launchers"" and if one is added as an update that update should be rejected and rolled back automatically. It was a huge mistake to ever allow this on Ubisoft or EA games in the past and here we are now. Any dev that gets greedy can now ruin their own product retroactively, long after paying customers lose their right to refund.

Community Management is bad and I have stopped playing since they recently implemented a Launcher, that forces you to create a Paradox-Account (and allowing the broadscale tracking, sale and usage of your personalized (or personalisable data) otherwise you can't play it.I PAYED OVER 30€ FOR THIS GAME (and about the same amount in DLC's) AND CAN'T PLAY IT ANYMORE UNLESS I AGREE TO THE DATA-LEAKAGE-BLACKMAIL-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?! NOPE!About the game itself:PROs:- Clearly a thumbs up. Game is nice, I love it. - Nice Graphics- High complexity. I was finding myself in random RL moments (like grocery shopping) thinking about more efficient ways to structure my city, planning new districts and projects. Games rarely do that with me, and I enjoyed it while it lasted.- Very active Modder-Community with more Mods and additional Assets than even NASA-Computers can handle (Only after installing certain mods this game will unveil it's true gaming potential. Highly recommend to install Traffic Manager Mod, Roundabout Builder, Undo Button and more)- I don't remember to have experienced serious bugs and haven't had a single total crash (Played via Steam-OS on Linux)MEHs:- Music gets boring with timeCONs:- Terrible Data-Infrastructure (e.g. it'll fully load ALL assets [thousands] regardless if you use them or not. That results in long loading times and minimum 5 Gig of RAM Usage for having an empty map in front of you. - Paradox is infested with the nowadays so common greed for every penny they can get out of the people that are the very reason of their continued existence in the first place. I have stopped playing this game and will not purchase any other Paradox-Product until there's a change towards more customer-oriented business-handling.- The DLC-Prices!The DLC's are just way too overpriced and many stuff feels more like it should've been in the Vanilla game in the first place. Also: You pay 12 Bucks for the Mass Transit DLC, install it and wonder ""Wait, where are the Taxis and the Trams?!"" ... yeah right... Taxis are in another full priced DLC and Trams are contained in a third full priced DLC. So if you want real Mass Transit in your City, calculate with another 30 Bucks on top.Again: Be aware that the publisher will try to squeeze every penny out of you, even if that means leaving the road of common sense!Be aware that this game before all other things is a traffic manager. If you can't find joy in thinking about new ways to flow the traffic through your city, tearing down and rebuilding new roads again and again and making the traffic system your backbone of the city you'll get disappointed quite quickly. On the other hand if you love to dive down that complex pond of transportation of goods and people, this could be a game for you!All in all it's a good game in the hand of the wrong people. On the long run I was getting more frustration and disappointment than joy from it (Mainly due to Paradox as company itself) and therefore said Goodbye to it.Conclusion: If you don't care about having another data-bloodsucker on your computing device, being screwed frequently in ways that you didn't expect, have either the money for just buying overpriced DLC's or the patience to wait for deepsales, get this game, Paradox will itch that masochistic spot of yours quite well.Otherwise: Gift your precious attention to games that are more worth it and to publishers that are more aware and grateful for you playing their piece of work.I will change my review, when the game is normally playable again (without that Paradox-Account-Bullcrap)*edit: Typos*edit²: When I was playing C:S it felt like this would be my first four digit playing hours game... Maybe it's better this way!"

Never have I ever seen people stick to the right lane until the END OF TIME blocking every exit. Usually (With actual irl traffic), people separate themselves out into each lane EVENLY until they need to get to their exit. 90% of my time in this game is making sure traffic is behaving instead of actually playing the game! Its so frustrating! Even on BUSY highways, as long as traffic is MOVING people separate themselves out into the lanes they need to be in just fine. Why is it SO HARD for your AI to change lanes without cutting people off?I've found that trucks LOVE to cut across 2 lanes of traffic, stopped, waiting for their exit to be free. Instead of just taking the exit maybe 1 mile down the road that I have for them, or changing lanes like a normal human being staying at the speed of traffic. It seems like if the AI doesn't have any room to merge into a lane, they just stop. They don't slow down, or even speed up to get to a better part to merge. They just ""I'm merging/changing lanes now, ♥♥♥♥ you, and ♥♥♥♥ whoever's behind you."" And there could be a 6 lane highway with 5 of the lanes being free, no, everyone wants to use the right second to last lane for the entirety of the highway, even if its backed up 40 miles down. They don't just switch lanes to get into faster moving traffic. Its so ridiculously annoying how much you have to micro manage *traffic*. Mayors don't sit in their offices like an RTS clicking their citizens to go in the right direction Paradox. Fix your f****** traffic AI.Don't even get me STARTED on the half-assed DLC's that add ""FEatUrEs"" that should just be included in the game. The industry DLC doesn't even tie in with the industry that comes with the base game, entirely separate entities that don't interact whatsoever. Just feels like they took a fat rip off the biggest crackpipe they had and put together the most half-assed glued-together traffic simulator I have seen since Sim City 5.While I'll acknowledge that traffic gets bad in my city sometimes, never is a highway backed up by 70 miles. People attempt to pass each other all the time and cars eventually move. And its normally caused by ACCIDENTS not just because Karen needs to be in the right lane so she stops in the middle with her blinker on, halfway out into the other lane waiting for the cars who are trying to pass her to go by. No, they continue going the speed of traffic, turn on their blinker, and move over. ITS NOT HARD."

Without mods, I wouldn't have gotten the 67 hours I have logged on it as of time of writing. There's mods for basically everything. You can install mods so you'll have lots more of building varieties, you can add landmarks to your city, you can have a gigantic statue of a hamster if you want, there's mods to change the color of your roads or even Americanize them if you want.. As of recently, you can even mod VEHICLES: I can now see DeLoreans driving my city.And you can install a mod... with one click. You don't need any dragging & dropping folders, etc. like for other games like GTA IV.The developers are very great as well.

3408,Hanazuki,https://steamcommunity.com/id/starrymia/,2,,0,253.6,July,"8,",195,2,1,"Writing a new review for this after like a billion or so hours of playing it. Not as much as some whales out there, but enough.Before anyone goes nuts, I don't think everyone will dislike this game. In fact I think most people will like it. But for a certain kind of person, I don't recommend it. One of my favorite things about older Sim City games was how they had advisors helping you out, and other aspects to help you enjoy the game better, and this riff on Maxis' old titles comes up short in the ""Human Element"" (tm).In the Super Nintendo/Famicom version, the mayor ran around telling you exactly what he thought of what was happening, with pages of flavor text, and theme music for disasters and higher population levels. It emotionally accentuated what was happening on the screen, giving a feeling of vigor or fear depending on what was going on. It turned the incredibly dry PC game into something filled with heart, much like how Sim Ant for that system turned a PC simulator with ugly sprites into a cute Choose Your Own Adventure sandbox RPG.In the 2000 version for PC, Sim Copter and Streets of Sim City added the ability to fly and drive in your cities, to see the normally 2D graphics visualized in 3D, and to generally just see a bit of life tossing around in what was once a sterile map. The add-ons had missions which allowed you to live out various plots and circumstances in the city that *you* created.Other games have come along, like Metropolismania, My Life as a King, and My Sims, which took a city builder and forced a plot with characters around it, bringing the genre closer to games like Animal Crossing. I hoped that eventually, people would look at history and try to build on those games, making more ""humanistic"" titles, ones that made you feel more like a *mayor* instead of a forensic analyst. Even later Sim City games had things like advisors, tracking your populace, and news tickers, which made things feel more ""real"".While Cities: Skylines has some of these features, tracking what people are doing isn't very detailed and involved, and the Chirper news feed isn't very good - much like Twitter, it feels more like people ranting aimlessly about barely-relevant subjects, instead of being a fruitful and varied description of how the world sees *your* unique city. It's a downgrade from previous games in this series (the Cities In Motion games) because those gave much more feedback about people's moods and wishes.So while CS has tons of detail, beautiful graphics (with mods), an amazingly detailed traffic system (with mods), astonishing fluid dynamics/water simulations, and can let you build almost anything (other than cities with multiple vertical levels like Midgar in FF7, which I thought would be cool to try :[ ), if you're someone like me who's interested in actually *living* in your city (either personally or by watching people go on with their lives), this might be ""too much simulator, not enough game"" for you.tl;dr: CS pretty much forsakes the personal/emotional touch that I think these games need, and modders don't care about adding it in, so it's hard to personally get invested in my creations, other than the addiction to getting things perfect once I know what I'd like to make.If your virtual citizens thanking you for a job well done is part of the satisfaction you've gotten in other city building games, I don't think this is worth the money for you. It's a different philosophy of what makes a city game good (high amount of planning details and basically nothing else), and I don't like it as much.It's a very European game to me, in the way that lots of European simulators (bus, train ones, etc) focus on getting the mechanics right, while American and Japanese games are willing to fudge them a little if it means creating a more intense sensation in the audience.Skylines just doesn't do much to simulate your people, and they're what makes a city become more than just concrete and metal in the first place."

Sure, I got a good 15 hours or so of fun out of it. But there's no late game and no challenge to it.Once you get past the first time fun of building a city, solving a few traffic problems, waiting for enough cash to expand your power generation or industrial zones, it's boring. A couple hours into a city and you will basically have infinite money and no more challenges to overcome. The worst part is that these challenges pretty much stay the same across playthroughs. I thought I would have more fun by starting over with a bunch of mods, but I got bored almost immediately.So if you're looking for something to entertain you for a weekend, sure. But unless you're really into building traffic patterns or designing cities I don't think you'll get more than 15-20 hours out of it.EDIT:Idk, 5 years later I pretty much come back and put 20-30 hours in a frantic binge session every few years. Definitely still the best city builder. Still not a strategy game, though."

I love this game and I want to recommend it to those looking for an extremely in-depth experience with a city builder like Cities: Skylines; however, one thing prevents me from giving it a full recommendation in my book:Paradox Interactive's business practicesLike most other games developed or published (CS is published by Paradox), you aren't going to get much out of the core ""vanilla"" experience. Features that should be commonplace within a game like Cities: Skylines or to help alleviate commonsensical things like traffic are locked behind a paywall. This is apparent for Paradox's other games like Crusader Kings II where if you want to have an enjoyable experience, you are either going to need to mod your game extensively (which may or may not be always easy or coherently understandable) or pay quite a bit for what would be considered ideal and/or a complete experience with features that should not have been cut from the base game. I'm all for supporting this game and the developer; however, I have an issue when an experience is intentionally muddied by inherent greed or milking players out of their hard-earned monies.Again, don't take this review has me hating the game. I love Cities: Skylines. It's a nostalgia trip for me as I grew up playing a lot of city builders and poured way more hours into them than I should have. The game has tons of replayability, has an extensive modding community, and is extremely visually appealing; however, what holds this review back for me is the less-than-ideal business practice that seeped its way into the game. A few DLCs here and there are fine if you are wanting to add more content for the player; we overstep that boundary when some of the DLCs are essentially mandatory to have an enjoyable and not as frustrating experience as they have content or features that should have been placed into the base game. My recommendation for anyone looking to get into Cities: Skylines is that you should wait until the game and some of its content goes on sale. It may not be as expensive as some games on Steam; however, you are still going to be paying in quite a bit for the full experience at full price."

But I doubt it would be anywhere near the number of hours I've spent in SimCity.My advice: find a better game like ""Workers & Resources Soviet Republic"" which is updated with new buildings, vehicles and mechanics on a very regular basis. And those updates won't cost you a penny.I don't want to sound bitter, I still play old Paradox games a lot and I love them, but the current bunch are lacklustre in the extreme and are more about parting Joe Public from his or her money.

Other than that the gameplay is solid, but in a longer session it can get tough. Sometimes the city has problems that you won‘t understand or don‘t make sense. You can loose people and money without changing anything but that can be part of the realism that this game offers and you have to solve them.I can definitely recommend this game because it is a really good game to play when you wanna relax, are unsure what to play or you have to wait for friends."

It's fun to keep building/expanding sections of the city and then leaning back to appreciate the shining metropolis that you have created. What makes this game so replayable is that you can keep expanding your dream city until it's reached its limits and inevitably dies. After that, you learn from your previous city's mistakes and make an even better one on a different map. This game is a nice ""change of pace"" for me and I would definitely reccomend it."

Then they provide a very basic form of those mechanics through paid DLC, which they then rely on modders to make truly great. Then they pocket money off the hard work of those modders.Every one of their games follows this formula and yet I keep buying them. They're just that good (with mods).""Then along came their most recent update which pushes an unnecessary launcher on a five year old game and requires agreement to new TOS that states they are taking and selling gameplay data if you want to keep playing.  Then they have the nerve to say it's a false rumor that they're taking anything more than ""basic telemetry"".  Interesting when it's their own terms of service that started this rumor.Here's the thing.  I don't care about my personal data for the most part.  Unless they're stealing my passwords or something, they aren't going to find anything especially embarrassing or important on this computer.  Really my data and my eyes on advertisements is the price I pay to access the websites and free games I enjoy.  I would rather pay in those than real money any day of the week.What I do care about is this trend of companies changing the terms of service to access games years after they came out.  Civ 6 did it and it probably killed that franchise.  Now Paradox has decided they're interested in blowing up a decade of consumer goodwill over a couple extra data points.  I already paid for this game and now, years after, they want to keep making money off me as the price to continue accessing something they already took my money for.No what bothers me isn't the data, it's knowing that eventually they're going to do this for something that does matter.  That I'll happily be playing a game and without warning it'll be locked behind a paywall or they'll require me to watch advertisements during gameplay.  Businesses push boundaries of what's acceptable or reasonable in order to push profits.  The only way to get them to stop is to make it not worthwhile.I'm probably tilting against the windmills here but this game has lost my endorsement and both Colossal and Paradox have lost my future business."

While it certainly does not offer the depth and detail that the older Sim City games did, and Paradox's DLC model is rather bothersome at times, it still offers a great sandbox experience that is only enhanced with the countless mods and assets that the community keeps on making.Mechanics are not as detailed as some older titles of the same genre, but they offer just enough depth to create a balanced ""illusion"" of a more complex management system. Most complaints here would fall onto the traffic simulations and industry demands, which some players would call poorly realised and imbalanced.Visually, the game is a treat to look at. The graphics are somewhat outdated by now and the older core game assets are a bit blurry at close distances, but the art direction manages to hide those flaws pretty well.The only big negative I could think of is the amount of CPU resources that the game tends to eat up in the later stages of the a city, after reaching a certain population size. Then the time slows down to a craw and there's also a noticeable FPS drop. This can cause a less than satisfactory experience on older or bottlenecked machines."

I adore city-builders so much I knowingly make bad choices with some other styled games. *cough*tropico*cough* but with Sim City, I was so very very confident that everything would be great, and I would see everything i loved again.Then, it came out, and looked like little more than another sequel in Sierras religion series (Caesar and Pharaoh were both god-kings and Zeus is an actual god) that should have been named ""Dollar"" to reference the modern era. I. Was. So. Disappointed.Then they gave me a free game I've never played to appologize for the screw-ups, and told us the only way to make the cities ""bigger"" was to build UPWARDS.The shame I felt for my once-loved developer was the highest I have ever felt.A while back I saw a youtube video (Lazy Game Reviews) about Cities: Skylines, and bought the game before the ten minute mark.Once you figure out the nuances of the roads and their unlocking stages, there is only one thought to have; ""THIS IS WHAT SIM CITY WAS MEANT TO BE!""The map creator is so powerful I have trouble figuring out how it behaves. Rivers are unbelievable, bottlenecks and extra sources need to be very very carefully planned so that river beds don't run dry, and city centers don't flood. Mountains can be sculpted as basic or detailed as you like. Want to make the Appalachia Hills? No problem. Want to make my home and back yard of the Rocky Mountains? You should probably start with a heightmap, but otherwise it's so doable. Heck, you could even recreate some of the iconic interstate system! (Though it might not be till summer 2015 when you can actually build the Eisenhower Tunnel....)I don't think the type of tree influences actual gameplay (Though I wish it would. I'd love to have an industry that specializes in Oak furniture. ""That's not natural...."" Heh.) but it can control quite a bit of beauty. Aside from careful resource placement, all I can suggest for map making is get the workshop item (or make your own version it's not hard) of 2 parallel highways in opposite directions. Placing road intelligently without doing this in the map editor is quite the challenge.That out of the way, the graphics are great, the game flows great, the speed is great. Everything is great.Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'm going to go name one of my forest businesses ""Buttes Enterprises"""

For players that prefer simplicity or are new to the game the vanilla version is very entertaining and can addict you with ease. The price is worth it for sure however I suggest that you should buy any DLC during a sale. In my opinion Mass transit and After Dark add the most to the game and will make the game more fun for Public transport maniacs like myself. Once you feel bored of the game you can easily download a vast array of mods, assets etc. to better customize and manage your city and enhance the experience. This modding availabilty is what really sets this game leagues above its competitors such as SimCIty 2013. Personally i would not recommend playing with complicated mods unless you are prepared to spend time troubleshooting when something goes wrong because it sure will sooner or later. Also larger cities with multiple mods and assets require good rigs to run well so if you have a wood PC this game may not be for you...In conclusion it is an amazing game for fans of the genre and highly addictive for newbies and pros alike with very flexible mod support from the community workshop. Depending on the mods you subscribe to the game can be completly different. The vanilla version is great for beginners but leaves more to be desired so if you like the game alot you WILL buy DLC. As a vanilla game I rate it 6.5/10 but with mods and/or DLC it's a solid 8.5/10."

I would advise you to add mods little by little and heed instructions in the descriptions of the items/collections. You can easily end up crippling your game, ie. it crashes on startup; at the very least those load times will jump significantly.It kinda runs like ♥♥♥♥♥ (i7 4.0ghz,gtx970,16gb ram) but that's not a dealbreaker. The game looks pretty good to me despite the lowish frame rate(30-45 frequently). I haven't played any of the other recent city sims but they mostly sound like underacheivers. I've played Civ's IV & V like a champ and my childhood included what I'll call teh golden age of sims in the late 90s into the aughts with Sim City, Roller Coaster Tycoon, Theme Park, Theme Hospital, The Sims, MS Flight Sim, Sim Ant(?!), etc.This game is dope as far as the gameplay goes and the depth of city planning that you can get into. At the time of this writing I have around 14 hours but this could easily be a 100hr game for me if I'm not careful. On top of the basic infrastructure and zoning you build you can delineate districts. Setting districts is cool because it allows you to not only set specific policies and perks, but to also apply modded themes to each district to give each area it's own unique aesthetic.What makes this game work is that in the end it's really not that complicated and it's hard to get yourself into weird situations you can't build or terraform your way out of like I've found in previous sims. There was no moment of, ""WHY isn't the water flowing to this part of the city?? It's connected!!"" like I recall saying to myself in other games. Roads especially are easy to work with and with mods you can really jazz the shizznizzle out of your metropolis. The After Dark DLC is pretty cool looking too. Kinda pricey but ♥♥♥♥ it if you can get it on steam sale especially I'd say do it. I'm still waiting on the Snowfall DLC to be on sale though.There is a built-in mod for unlimited cash.

The level of detail and freedom of creative customization, in everything from individual pedestrian routes to entire neighborhoods and expressways, make Cities: Skylines a realization of everything that SimCity could have been and wasn't.The positives of this game, compared to other city simulation games, include highly intracate traffic patterns and traffic flow (as the computer plots a unique route for every citizen in your city), the ability to freely place roads (unconstrained from 90-degree grids like older SimCity games), and even the ability to set different laws and regulations for different neighborhoods or suburbs. In addition to there being plenty of DLC (much of it paid, unfortunately), the Cities: Skylines Steam workshop is one of the most expansive collection of free mods and assets that I've ever seen for any Steam game, with over hundreds of thousands of workshop items available.The negatives of this game include Paradox's paid DLC model, requiring users to pay to unlock things like trams, disasters, monorails, and winter weather. The game code is also poorly optimized with regards to memory allottment (especially if a huge number of Steam Workshop assets have been downloaded), and due to the game plotting individual paths for each citizen, users with older processors or RAM sticks may find that the game moves very slowly once their city reaches a high population.Overall, I must recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who has ever been interested in city simulation games. While I disagree with the concept of the paid DLC model, I have to make a reluctant exception in the case of Cities: Skylines. I am certainly not wealthy, and rarely spend any actual money on games, but Cities: Skylines is the ultimate city building game that I have waited for ever since I was a child playing SimCity 3000. So far, I have spent almost 2000 hours thoroughly enjoying every detail of Cities: Skylines, which is the only game I have ever spent more than 500 hours on, so it personally feels worth the money I've spent. If you are also planning to spend hundreds of hours on this game, the additional play abilities found in the DLC will probably be worth it. However, casual or occasional gamers may wish to skip the paid DLC and focus on the free Steam Workshop assets, which feature everything from unique skyscrapers to unique car models, buildable airports, a realistic overhaul of the metro system, and more. Cities: Skylines is probably my favorite game right now, with one of the best modding communities around, and I sincerely hope more and more people around the world come to enjoy this game."

You are starting with 2x2 km piece of land, but reaching some points with number of citizens, you can buy aditional pieces. In the end you can control 6x6 km.+ Easy zone structure. Build road - get place for buildings, 4 squeres in both sides. Buildings can be from 1x1 to 4x4, not so much, but game is mod-opened, so lets wait a bit. 6 types of zone for living, working and shopping.+ Large variety of city services - polices, clinics, schools and so on in differnt ways.+ Many ways to get resources for production- import from other cities using port, railway or highway, or just produce by yourself.+ Amazing traffic sim - all road can easily stuck becouse one truck unloading goods to factory.+ Use dams to change level of water.+ Upgrade of buildings connected with many parameters.+ Create our own stuff using in-game tools.+ Good public transport realisation - you need to plan everything in your lines to decrease amount of cars on road.+ Citizens  have own homes, cars and works, not just a picture on a screen.+ Draw districts with own policy.+ Chirpers - citizens will say you true!Minuses:- No terraforming.- Not so big variety of buildings.- Productions chains existm but its no so clear how it works.- After all hours I played, I dont know what profit turism gives to you. Very weak. =(- No day/night cycle.- No random events.- Annoying chirper- citizens will spam you!and its only a small part of pluses and minuses, but main of them, in my mind.And the game is still on of the best - developers planned all existing stuff wery good. But some important thing doesnt exist - its imposimble to create a city with own spirit, like it was possible in Tropico. But as I already told, game is opened for modding, and I heard that developers will not stop supporting project - they will add more content with patches and mods. If you fan of city simulators and some calm strategies, or just wanna to relax - its a good choice.So, I gonna mark in like 8/10 now, and for sure it gona be 9/10 very soon. Have a nice play!"

The best way to describe it, without giving the basics (its a city builder/sim), is that I believe this game is the logical continuation of the ENTIRE genre of city builders. What I mean by this is that Cities: Skylines fills the hole left behind after the release of the last major city builder.... Sim City 4. If you grew up on city building, and love the idea of a slightly more technical approach, this game will satisfy. That said, gamers new to the genre, or gamers looking for a city builder with little learning curve, Cities: Skylines can also be a good fit. All in all, a very well made city builder, which runs smooth and with good graphics and technical gameplay, and is also not too hard to learn."

The 'Cities' can be made to look like a city, instead of a square town. The graphics are impressive, they may not have the same amount of detail as SimCity but who cares, graphics are not everything, yes they are nice to have in a game, however they are not needed, for example MineSweeper's graphics are not the best but the game is fun and annoying. What I'm trying to get at, is that this game is perfect, even the graphics IMO. The only thing that does get annoying is traffic. That is part of the fun of Cities Skyline, trying to figure out how to sort the problem.

It has all the same management features and more.This game is extremely challenging.  It will not hold your hand through anything at all.  The only ""tutorial"" is in the form of occaisional pop-up windows describing what certain buttons are for.  It doesn't tell you anything else about how these features will function in your city.  You have to figure everything out as you go, which hasn't bothered me too much.I can see why I read a lot of reviews complaining about this difficulty.  I personally had to restart the game about five times before I was able to establish a city that wasn't tanking (which meant you could no longer build and everything came to a permanent halt.)  You won't really have an idea how quickly you'll burn through money or how little to build from the get-go.  It's all trial-and-error.  Extremely basic functions are locked to you until you progress past certain populations.  That doesn't make the game broken, just not good for anyone impatient.  I eventually wandered over to Youtube to get tips and ideas on how to shape my roads while staying in-budget.There is a built-in sandbox mode where you can specify options like infinite money, all features unlocked, and such. It's a very nice feature to use for practice when you haven't quite gotten a good grasp on city management.I really love how true it is to its sandbox nature.  You can do whatever you want and play as recklessly or as organized as whatever suits your own style.  You can even have custom street names.  As you progress, you can choose more adjacent land to purchase and which square you pick is all up to you.  Lots of really great features that are very user-friendly, just be ready for a heavy learning curve in the beginning."

At the start, you can shape your city at your desire. With addition of Steam Workshop support, I am able to shape the city in high detail by using custom assets, mods that supports placement of assets and other gems that are available on the Workshop. Eventually the game evolves in a large city where you have to pay great attention to traffic management. Otherwise you will have problems. With the addition of the DLC's, more buildings, functionalities and public transport features got added so that you can enrich your city into a nice, vibrant place. Throughout the years, the developers have added a lot DLC's. Some are good, others aren't. Yet the game manages to bring fun and chill back when I want to play it again. By this, I keep the game installed on my gaming computer so that when I am in mood, I just launch the game and play it.Good:+ Steam Workshop. Some mod authors have done incredible work with some mods that enrich the game more.+ Barely limitation in the way of how you shape your city+ Replayability: each time I come with different cities+ Chirper+ Developers are still maintaining it and bringing new content, five years after its release.Bad:- The game is created by Unity Engine and has its limitations. The engine starts to struggle when you are managing a city with a big population eventually.- DLC pricing policy: A lot interesting content are available as DLC's yet the pricing policy is something I do not like at all. The prices are often high than what the content offers. Because of this policy, the game will have more depth only if you get the majority of the DLC's like ""After Dark"", ""Green Cities"", ""Industries"", ""Parklife"" and ""Campus"" (need to get ""Sunset Harbor"" yet...). The others are more useful additions. Still .......- Traffic AI is problematic unless you use a workshop mod to ""resolve it""."

That is not inherently bad, but my goal was to build a city and experience the problems that come with it. The only big problem is traffic and first hurdle when you create a new city. After that the cycle is: get over the new game hurdle -> become rich over time with no difficulty -> expand -> and then keep mindlessly expanding for the fun of it. There are mods, but the mods cant really add new mechanics into the game that will refresh the gameplay. All mods are either quality of life, new buildings, or something else. Using mods you can make good looking cities, but it becomes painfully repetitive.Overall, if you want a City Painter, get this game and download some mods.

I bought it the day I bought my first laptop, and it has spurred my love of gaming since then.  I am not a person who will avidly say ""One thing or one event changed my outlook on something"", but this game has.  It is not only a game that represents itself well, it is a game that represents PC gaming as a whole well.  The beginning of the game is tough to get into, but it can be learned very quickly with enough determination and effort.  You will develop your own formula for building cities, and grow upon it.  Your first world will be disastrous, and will ultimatly result in and untimely demise, but that is not the game as a whole, and to leave it there would be unwise, as you can't really play the game until you've slogged through that part of it.  Playing this game does not require skill; it requires patience, practice, curiosity, and ingenuity.  You cannot play this game once and keep it in your inventory.This game would be nothing without it's community.  Countless mods, assets, buildings, and props have come out of this game, and countless more are yet to come.  The workshop is a mayor's best friend, and will always have the perfect thing for that corner in the suburbs which is a little lame.  While unmodded this game is still enjoyable, it is nothing compared to modded gameplay.  No mod that I have come across to date is difficult to install, or meddlesome to use.  As well, they do not change the game, merely add a layer to it.  If you are planning to play this game in vanilla for the entirety of your usage, you can and will miss out.The one complaint I would have about this game is the DLC's.  Well, not a complaint.  The DLC's do add lots of good content, and are certainly useful.  The more expensive ones add options and concepts which feel like not only additions, but like part of the game that has always been there.  You are not missing out however, and this game is in no way fragmented in any sense.  When you buy the game, that's what you get: the game.  That being said, the DLC's can be a little overpriced, and some can be rather useless.  You have to use your best judgement on what you think would be a good addition to your playing experience, and stick with your decision.  Despite only having 80 hours in this game, it has been a factor in my life in ways I cannot describe, and will continue to be a large part of it.If you do buy this game, spend your time in it.  Create, manage, share.  I can reccomend this game, but you will only know the game in full if you play it."

What that means is unlike Cities XL/XXL the cars and people aren't some visual, your people travel around the city to their jobs, go to places to relax, so on, and need to deal with the issues in between, like traffic. As for unrestrained building, with a bit of button presing and switch flipping you can tailor the game to however you want to play it. Even mod it if its not there already, Cities: Skylines does have a big modding scene.Now in game, you can set up your roads, bridges, tunnels, in anyway you want, make it crazy looking to fix traffic, or just see what you can do for fun, set up building next to it, you got low/high residental, low/high commercial, industrial, a good amount of city planning is involved.You can plan for tourism, traffic fluidity, making everyone happy, typical mainstays of the city builder, long story short, Cities: Skylines is by far the best city builder to have come out recently, I fully recommend it and its expansions."

Once you get the hang of things, it's a breeze and a blast. YouTube tutorials are really helpful.Plus - what other game lets you make a poop volcano? 9/10 - Best city-sim on the market. Best city-sim of the decade."

The design shows a passion and love for what makes city-building games great, and the execution is near flawless. The road building tool is absolutely amazing. It is powerful enough to let you solve traffic issues logically, rather than figuring out work-arounds, or just suffering through traffic. That's not to say it's easy, it does constantly present thought provoking puzzles. But each issue with traffic has a HUGE number of solutions, and each one is fun to implement since the tool is so well designed. In fact, just designing interchanges is a blast.The new district feature is the best thing to come to city building games since map creation (also included btw). The control it gives you over your city allows you to build the city you want.The dynamic water adds some incredible life to the maps, which changes as your city grows and you make changes.City expansion makes planning much more complex and fluid than previous city building games. You will find that old strategies have to be rethought in a more realistic way.You can legalize drugs.There are a few bugs, but none are even close to game breaking. No need to wait for a patch, or servers. In it's current state it is the best city-sim I have ever played.

3706,jono_ninety9,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jono_ninety9/,16,3,0,172.5,April,"22,",82,7,1,"This game functions well as a city builder, but is not nearly as enjoyable as a game like SimCity 2013. This game feels more like a road-building or public transport game. The bulk of the game is just building roads and zoning them. The game then forces you to micromanage public transport, with you having to click every single stop, and wastes your time with you manually having to build water pipes and power lines. The game lacks depth. Contrast this to SimCity, where there is in-depth specialisation. You can build landmarks, stadiums, amusement parks, casinos, mines, refineries, etc. and you can expand them, choosing what rides, or gambling rooms, or processing lines are in an amusement park, casino, or industrial building respectively. The Skylines specialisation adds 5 seconds of gameplay, literally, involving simply clicking a district to assign it to leisure or farming (etc.). And the leisure specialisation is only available through a $20 DLC. Contrast this with SimCity specialisation which adds hours of content for every city (and SimCity DLC where the only DLC that costs more than $5 is effectively a Sci-Fi city builder, with features you would never expect to be in the base game). Yes, Skylines has bigger cities and a much better road system (although the AI is still very questionable), but I don't need extra space if there is nothing interesting to do with it. The expansion of services in Skylines is done by moving a slider, which arbitrarily increases the capacity of the service. I prefer a module based system, where an extra module ads a specific number of extra vehicles or additional capacity to the building's capability (such as in SimCity).The game is also quite expensive. The base game is $30. For the same price you can get the Complete Edition of SimCity, which includes The Cities of Tomorrow expansion pack and all other SimCity DLCs. Cities: Skylines’ DLCs cost $15 for after dark, $15 for natural disasters (both of which mostly contain feature’s present in the SimCity base game), $13 for snowfall and whatever they will charge for Mass Transit. There is also $20 for other minor DLCs. After Mass Transit comes out, the total cost of the game will almost certainly be more than $100 for a game with less depth then a $30 competitor.In conclusion, while Cities: Skylines benefits from huge cities, road and transport flexibility and extensive modding ability, it fails to offer the in-depth city specialisation options that games such as SimCity 2013 offer, and which add hours of content to every single city. The game feels more like a public transport simulator that has good road building aspect then a good city builder. While it is a good game, if you are looking for a good city builder, I don't recommend it, especially due to the monstrous price tag it has compared to competitors."

3749,BTZ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bravo-two-zero/,8,,0,86.8,November,"14,",279,3,1,"It would be good if I could give neutral review.This game is like minecraft type of thing, where Sim City even 2013, for rough example, more like of a civilization type. First of all you will need couples of  DLC's to play this game and not get bored for the very soon, and get some amount of replay  ability.  Almost ""must have"" are Industries,  Mass Transit, Green Cities and if you have an extra money, Park Life. Here the bad parts of the game, which I found during playing:Optimisation, it was ""brilliant"" idea to use Unity  game engine (with automatic memory allocation and garbage collection) to perform such massive simulations, bad pathfinding AI, and Agent simulations  taking majority of calculation resources (don't bother yourself purchasing this game, if you have less than 12-16 Gb. of RAM),  which  results in, that  the game left without any deep simulations in other areas. Commerce, industry, are here just for fun, the do not matter almost at all, you need  just some education for the jobs.It is very hard to fail your city, it's almost impossible, no challenges at all, even Production Chains in new Industries, assets are looks cool, farms, factories,etc, but that all, you build them just to unlock next level, and add some additional credits to the balance, and nothing more. Because this game has such shallow simulation between industry and commerce zones, nothing changes, or affects each other, no challenges, no commercial zone specialization or global market, or global logistics, you unable even to prioritize your production chains. Residents dont even need to go to buy some goods, they almost always happy.  There is no consequences in your bad design ideas,  no even changeable wind direction (which SC2013 had) , so all of your oil or ore industries won't harm your city,  in SC2013 if build too polluted area it will spread the pollution to the neighbor cities with the wind direction, which will reduce land cost and make citizens unhappy. Other stupid area is the grid size for buildings, it's too ridiculous that casual one floor wooden house take exact same amount of space as a skyscraper and after a while that small house turn in to the skyscraper, and all your area becomes filled with the ugly nail looking skyscrapers (yes, are you able to restrict rise of the building in area with a policy, and Green City also brings new variations to building looking). Also, for example, only 16 citizen occupy the whole skyscraper, and 150 meter height office building has max of 20 jobs.You will have to build a lot of roads, just to remedy AI issues. And good advice to start the city of your dream is to start without stupid milestones, so you'll able to plan and build roundabouts from the very beginning, and not destroy some part of your city later on, when the first traffic collapses arrives and not to wait when you access more advance road types, and more important when you start to get performance hit due to high Population, so you just able to  start planing and building your dream city in the beginning. But again the whole trafficking is also illusion because all roads in this game lack one fundamental, core thing, safety, yes there are no car accidents, no traffic jams because of it, so why would you need all that traffic lights, lane management, road signs? I removed them all, and I get rid of ll traffic issues, my roads turned from red to green, but I like Public Transport management in this game, and I think it is very sophisticated.Other things like art, lighting, music in this game are also shallow, I mean, come on developers, why it was so hard to implement different color emission texture? So the building windows light with the different tints during nighttime, and not just yellow, blue, white etc? They are looking so horrible during the night, when all windows that building has, emits one color light from all it's windows. Run SC 2013, for example, you will blown away away with all kind of such details, buildings emits different tints or even color from its window, you filling that your city actually is organism which living and breathing and you watching how it's grow, opposite to skylines, when the buildings are grown in seconds. Or even when night is coming in SC2013, it all different all the time, every house, every apartment will turn off the light in different time, and will turn them back on early in morning, when the whole city is to about begin it's new day, there are no such details in skylines :(.The whole Day night cycle in Skylines is a joke, really, even civilization 6 doing better day night cycle, even it is not core thing for this game. Lighting system is also horrible out of the box, you'll have to experiment with a lot of LUT's and color corrections. Weather effects, just turn them off they also terrible.Sound and music, just turn your iTunes on iPhone or iPod, or anything else, I'm not joking, really, you will not loose anything, moreover you will be not annoyed with default skylines music and sound. Again forget how it was in SC 2013, where even info details layers, like wastes, garbage, water, electricity has it's own set of sounds, when you able just from listening get to know, that your have electrical shortages or wastes blockages. But the bad thing, which ruins this game for me is that this game will never be ever optimised, there is no miracles, for the good optimisation and smooth running, they need ""in house"" developed game engine.They will continue to publish new DLCs, which will be just an assets, without any additional core gameplay features, and this why I'm giving negative review for this game."

Don't be ashamed if you can only build grid based cities because then you will have traffic issues that need resolving later down the line and how you solve them out is entirely up to you. Whether that be through intensive installation of the various public transport or just demolishing whole blocks to pave way for a new highway the choice is yours. So yeah there are a few bugs here and there but lets face it most games nowadays have them and they can be ironed out with mods. After being left highly dissapointed by the last simcity from what 2015 was it?

Then I saw this, as in Astonner it was something not that straight forward pointing out, I'm collecting your data of where you live, what's your email, what your phone number is. As we all know, address and name we can give that to the public, but not to marketing companies, because they make lots of profits by selling all your data. TBH, I still think beginning of Skyline was a great start when it first came out. Unfortunately, they ended there. I really want to like this game. I honestly want to. but I can't, because I want to protect my private personal information, though I'm just a gamer, nothing to hide, and yet, I do like my privacy. I can't like a $30+ bare bone game. with huge amount of DLC cost over $150 dollars each and every are just missing pieces of the original game.  some may say, that you are missing the fun just a click a way.well, it you get scam and spam calls everyday because of that one click you made.

With a building area of 6x6km (Sim City 2015 2x2km) and a building area of 10x10 if you you use mods, the game shows heavy superiority to other city builders.The game feels dynamic and the interface is extremly intuitive. If you give this game your son, your wife or your drunken friends, they will understand and learn it easily.On the other hand it has an extremly complicated road management system, that is hard to understand for most people. Cars behave, like they behave in reallife. Like idiots, that all want to go through the same main road to save 2 minutes. Building one way streets and other ways to guide the traffic is around 70% of the management you will do in the late game. Even changing a single street can destroy your whole city. That is frustrating, but extremly exciting.As a guy, that started building games with Sim City 2000, I can tell: This game is so far superior than other building games, Sim City and Anno should start to keep up or go home!Of course there are downsides, that mostly  come from the balance between being a lower budget game, high quality simulation and low quality engine.- The game is far too easy to ""beat"" (I managed get a city from 0 to 100k citizens [all unlocks] in 4 hours, by just building  a huge grid of road squares- even if your industry is only connected to your highways with one street and all traffic is collapsing, your city still wont go down. Actually it was still growing, even if 30% of the population was ill and 70% of the industry was broken down- it is nearly impossible to kill of your city with bad traffic, bad healthcare or crime- build 1 school, clinic, police station,... into the middle of your town and then just add industry/commercial/residential area and watch your city growing from 1 to about 50-100k, while missing out essential infrastructure, they will demand, but in the end dont care- at 100k citizens my computer starts running slower, most other people cant even play anymore at this point- at 150k to 200k the engine starts breaking down, cars despawn, trains despawn, your industry will suddendly completly die out in an instant from missing transports- there is a limit to everything, from buildings over streets, even trees- beside being a nice simulation with over 75000 active ""agents"" (individuals, with daily routine...how insane is that), getting beyond the point of 75000 people will start causing above said problemsIf you want to build cool looking citys, you can watch growing and living, I mean actually living, because your little citizens actually go to work and live their lifes, with going shopping, dying of old age and getting buried (you actually can see all that), give this game a try!If you want a challenging game, that will punish you for wasting taxes or missing out that terrible fire at the habor, this game will be way too easy for you."

After that the launcher fails to launch again. Since this game is about a 6GB download, that's not something I'm willing to do every time I want to play.Update: I found that the version of the launcher installed by Steam works. The first time I run it, the launcher downloads an update of itself. That update doesn't work. So as a workaround I can uninstall and reinstall just the launcher every time I want to play, but this is still ridiculous.

Also this DLC flooded garbage gets boring really fast. If you play this game properly and nothing is really happening in your city and you have so much money, but nothing to spend it on anymore, you will just end up looking on the monitor while doing absolutely nothing on a maximum game speed. Also the roads are completely retarded, on par with SimCity if not worse. You can't really build them as you want and if your city gets bigger and you want to connect more roads to your city, you can, but no one will drive there, so it's just this one default road having non-stop traffic jams and you can't do anything about it, because F you. Why would I wanted to take a shorter and an empty road to the city when I can just get stuck here alongside with all these stupid idiots ?SimCity is better and way more fun to play, 3/10."

But I saw this and everyone saying how good it was so I gave it a shot. It was the best $30 I have ever spent. Well worth it.Some of the features I love are how you can rename not only the buildings, but the people themselves. If you have a problem with saving money, you can either fix that in the economy panel or you can turn off a building. The people rarely complain about taxes up until about 15%, which is lovely as well. Some problems with the game that I have are the traffic (which can be fixed with mods I assume) and theres no weather system yet, which I hope Colossal Order and Paradox can bring in the future. Otherwise, do buy this game. You will not be disappointed."

This is what that game should have been.  Now, like the modern Civ games, C:Sky's base game is merely ok, and it needs DLCs to come into its own.  I've read the complaints about DLCs, and shrug - thats the state of PC games today, just dont buy anything that isnt on sale, DLCs included.  As both a fan of SimCity since the first game, and a professional geographer, this is one of the best citybuilding games I've played in a long time.  It has all the useful tools of earlier SimCity games, like traffic routing, but with finer control and a better simulation, and its economics arent stupid - SimCity4, I'm looking at you.  Its vastly more bug-free and user friendly than professional programs like ArcGIS - all you users whining about bugs havent seen anything till you've spent a day trying to figure out why Arc's batchfile processor dies unexpectedly with large runs (it overflows and crashes past 256 files).  Dont get me started on how comparitivly user-unfriendly is GRASS.Though C:Sky lacks the character and humor of SimCity, it makes up for it in detail, and the more DLCs, the more detail.  Do I spend my limited funds on a radio tower or do I upgrade Main Street to have bus routes?  Hey, I built my expensive radio tower without checking the detailed topography layer - and built the damn thing in a valley like a noob.It is an uphill climb for the new user - if you dont have experience with citybuilders, the learning curve can be steep.  There's a fair amout of microeconomics, loan management, etc. which will kill the game for twich players (what are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ about?  Go play Overwatch.  Seriously.  That game rules.)  But if you really like town management, and think laying out roadways and greenspace is actually fun - I do - buy this game.  Sure, wait for a sale, but buy it when that happens."

I can't get past (In my mind) all of the things I could do that I don't have the money for anymore. So, I've basically hit a wall on wanting to do anything further with this game among lot of other games and things.I finally bought all of the expansions for crusader kings 2 a couple months before 3 ended up coming out. I ultimately feel like I've wasted my money. By the time the game was finished, I had already spent enough time with it (thousands of hours) to where I'm not really interested in playing anymore, which turned into chasing this idea in my mind of what could possibly happen as opposed to what I'm really paying for. I basically became addicted to spending the money to feel like I have a complete game. It seems that this cycle will continue with all future paradox titles until this gets enough attention.I love the ck series and yet ck3 is marginally boring because of the lack of content that is hopefully coming someday with a full game price tag or more after all the expansions it's going to take to get there.I'm not a huge mod person, but maybe that will bring me back to some of these games sometime in the future.. probably after I get done checking out all of the vanilla features of the other games I already have -that have been ignored for the sake of my love of sandbox games like this. Unfortunately, I can no longer blindly support Paradox for the idea of what I hope that they will do, because it turns out they are really like every other big business company doing what they do for money.I have come to realize something is likely inherently wrong with human culture to have let the value of money waste everything that could be awesome."

Cities Skylines is like a game but based ion real life where you have to build houses for sims to live in but then you must build places for them to work etc. In my many hours of trial and error i have found that correctly using roads becomes a big thing later on in the game when you aim to have mega cities as if these aren't right then your city will start to cripple under pressure as you try and work out whats wrong.In playing Cities Skylines i have found that there are a couple mods in particular that really help your city to thrive but you can do just as well in vanilla game play but they greatly help.Overall i would rate this game highly with a 10/10 for its realism and challenges that you face when starting out.

There's a lot more I could say about this game but I'm excitted to go create my custom map, Don't buy this in the sale, the devs do NOT deserve that, buy it at full price! 9/10 - Close to being a Masterpiece, I look forward to seeing what they do with it in the future!"

Game cost about $120.00 , and that is only going to go up as they add more DLC. On top of that the game is overloaded and does not run well if you buy all the DLC. A lot of the current DLC should of been in one pack on not mutiple DLC. That said there should of been a season pass to get the DLC at a discount , but there was no season pass so you have to pay full price for all the little million DLC drops that come out over time. Price point is really the only major con other than the DLC kind of overloads the game engine. If you like city building games it is worth the price point. The DLC on the other hand maybe not worth buying it unless it goes on sale 50% or more off. The DLC is kind of tiny they might as well be MODs that you have to pay for ...... another words the DLC feels like a MOD from the workshop or the nexus not a DLC put out by the gaming company."

The traffic mechanic is really well optimised although the flaw that i have found in the algorithm is that the cars are programmed to take the WIDEST road and not the most direct road, eg. If i have an industrial estate with 3 entrances, one a 2 lane 2 way road and the other is a 6 lane 2 way road, all the cars (or at least 90% of them) will take the 6 lane road as the cars think that taking the wider road is the better option as you can fit more cars onto them but when all the cars think that then they soon build up and you have to rethink all your roads... But thats what i enjoy, finding problems in my roads and then spending the time to fic, fix and fix again to make to they work as best the can! Also i have found that more entrances and exits DO NOT make the traffic smoother as more roads mean more junctions with more traffic lights, slow the cars down so 1 entrance is more effective than 17.  I hope you enjoyed my little chat about this game but for the price, I highly reccomend this game to everyone!"

So the focus is transport and you can build the city as you want because the game is almost to easy.

Anyway no metter how many problem the city does have is almost inpossible that your citizen become unahppy; and because criminality is linked to happyness police is not really necessaty. I suggest to give a try to the vanilla game before installing any mod/mapModsThe mod can already totally reshape the game experience: you can download tons of additional buildings both ploppable or growable, you can change the point of view to street level, alter the colur scheme and resolution, alter the interface (tranforming Chirpy in a scroll text just like the one on SC4), alter games rules to increase or decrease the challenge.Maps are also great: usign the site terrain.party you can download a map from your favourite location in the world, and since the map in the game is preaty big you can recreate a small city and its sourrounding. The water simulation express its true potential when you try to add a river in your custom map.TL:DRA great Game, maybe non perfect and not particularry challenging, but surely a great platform with a lot of potential for modding or expansion"

3887,thecrazyscotsman,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecrazyscotsman/,2,,1,108.0,August,"21,",292,0,1,"My mayoral skills were impressive. In a short time I'd grown my little hamlet from just a few hundred residents into a gleaming city of 70,000 people. But suddenly, it all fell apart. My garbage collection services ran into a problem: the roads leading to my district of landfills and incinerators couldn't handle the vast amount of garbage trucks coming and going from all corners of the city. An enormous traffic jam started - unnoticed at first - eventually cascading into every corner of the city, completely locking down the road system. Fires raged through the down town high-rises because the fire fighters couldn't make it past the traffic. Sick people started dying in their homes because ambulances couldn't get to their door. As the bodies piled up and the buildings burned down, complaints rolled in and people started abandoning the city as quickly as they could.Where Skylines truly shines is in its focus on transportation management. As my story at the beginning showed, poorly planned roads can destroy your city once it outgrows the infrastructure. Fortunately, you have scads of options to manage your transportation. You can build underground or elevated roads, low or high volume streets (including one-way streets!), bus stations, subways, trains, and more. Mass transit becomes incredibly important as you quickly realize you want to get as many cars off the streets as possible, and you'll find yourself building pedestrian pathways to make it easy for your citizens to walk everywhere. You can easily spend the majority of your time fiddling to find the most optimal traffic solution if you want to - and sometimes you'll need to, as the game will harshly punish you if your traffic infrastructure can't handle your people.The game also introduces the concept of ""districts"". In the Sim City games you were able to enact laws and policies that effected the city as a whole, but in Skylines you can create individual districts and then enact policies on a district level if you don't want them to impact the entire city. This allows you to build a booming business sector with tax breaks for commercial zoning and free public transport while banning truck traffic and high rises in a quiet residential neighborhood.I unabashedly adore Cities: Skylines.  Despite that, there are still some issues I have with the game - issues which, granted, have been addressed by mods, but still need to be added as official features. Pedestrian pathways were very exciting to me as a long-time Sim City player. The transportation options haven't ever allowed you to build a ""walkable"" city. In Skylines, while you can build them to allow your people to walk everywhere, you can't place buildings or zones off pedestrian pathways, which means that citizens have to use the path to walk to a road to go to a building. They essentially just allow you to place shortcuts connecting roads and don't let you create any sort of walkable city area. You also don't have any fine-tuned control over your intersections. Given how essential a proper road layout is, you'd expect to be able to designate turn lanes, cross-walk locations, and whether your want an intersection to have traffic signals or not. As it is, intersections are automatically created and you have no control over what exactly they look like. This can be very frustrating if you're trying to optimize your traffic flow. Planting trees is also a pain, as you can only place individual trees - there's no way to place mass amounts with a brush, and it's sorely needed. None of those problems have lessened by enjoyment with the game, and indeed, most of them arose only after spending many hours playing. ."

Due to the fact that those workarounds dont work; it seems that this is something the developer themselves need to address.Apart from that, this game is solid. To those coming from Sim City 5:Its not as visually appealing as Sim City 5 in regards to the lack of night cycle. Not to mention the info-graphics arent as nice. Some UI buttons could use a touching up as well.Also, time moves quite fast in comparison to whats actually happening on the ground (eg. A car takes a full day to drive a rather short distance).---EDIT:I no longer have tearing in DX11. The issue was that i tend to turn off Windows Aero theme and run Windows 7 Basic theme, while gaming. By proxy, my vertical sync wasnt kicking in due to this. Tbh, ive never come across a game with such a requirement (for v-sync).Alternatively:Turns out you can force DX9 which may alleviate some/all of the tearing.

EDIT: BUT... read the end of the review.To be frank, I was skeptical if this wasn't just overhyped in the wake of the SC13 and CXL debacles, but from what I could gather in the 5 hours it has glued me to the screen tonight, Cities Skylines might be the SC4 successor we have been waiting for. The game is easy in the beginning, but not overly so and traffic and garbage can be a challenge even with 8k residents (although not an unfair one). The simulation is responsive and detailed. The interface is confusing at first but you get used to it quickly enough. They reduced SC4's diagram bloat but sadly some useful ones fell victim as well.Soundtrack is nice but rather repetitive, and the modding community will need to figure out if we can make this as pretty and diverse as SC4 was eventually. I didn't like Skylines' art style from the previews, but playing the game it grows on you. The visual fidelity in the lowest zoom levels is lacking, but you have the reassurance that what you are seeing is actually simulated, unlike SC13. You can see individual citizens, but I sort of miss the traffic flow maps from buildings in SC4RH.Variety is enough to keep me going for a couple dozen hours. I'll update this review once Skylines has passed the test of time ;)EDIT: So, I have played for 25 hours now, and thats it for now. Sorry, but the lack of gameplay depth and seeing the same building 10 times next to the others really won't keep me coming back.

Instead you'll have little helpful popup balloons if something requires your direct attention. You can otherwise tell what your citizens need by little speech bubbles above their houses.Laying down zones is functionally different from SimCity also. You need to manually lay down the road instead of clicking and dragging with the zoning tool and it creating road for you.

That's right, you can expand out by purchasing plots of land around your city. No not with real world money, but with in game currency. It is a sad thing when that has to be said because of today's gaming market being riddled with micro transactions. When placing roads, construction tiles (this is what I am going to call them) appear beside them. This allows the player to create zones for building. The zones are residential (low or high density), commercial (Low or High), industrial and office Zones . What the city needs is broken down in to 3 colors, green for residential, blue for commercial and orange for industry. The higher the need the more the bar will rise to the top. The electric grid is maintained by having buildings semi close to one another, if this is not possible the player can close the gap with power lines. To maintain the city water pipes, pumping stations and water drain pipes need to be put into place. One thing to either remember or adjust is, if you want to take advantage of natural resources in the area (farm land, oil, ore etc) make sure to create a district and assign the correct resource for the area. If you do not the game will just create a generic industry on top of the resources you want to use. In most cases this will ruin said resources. Buildings will upgrade themselves depending on the influences in the area. The maximum level varies from building type. Placed structures have no levels to gain. They merely influence the zones around them. So placing a hospital will increase the happiness in a certain region, while placing a stadium will increase the happiness in a certain area outer area of influence, but residential  zones to close will suffer from noise pollution. The game is not without its flaws. For more details click the video below!

Having played both franchises, I will be the first to concede that Cities: Skylines is a feature rich and immersive city-builder that personally dethrones the likes of SimCity. The game itself is hardly the object of my scorn. Rather, my ire falls upon the game's developer for intentionally injecting parasitic bloat into a gaming experience; one that already suffers from long loading times by virtue of its genre. As of this review, the developer has introduced a launcher for Cites: Skylines, a game that has thrived without one since its release in 2015. Amidst reports of longer loading times, launching woes, and save issues, the developer has seemingly stood by a sixfold justification for introducing Paradox Launcher. In a post by a community developer on 22 January, the following six reasons have been employed verbatim in defense of the launcher's rollout:- Looking for a sale for some expansions but you hate social media? (Or don't follow us, which makes us sad) Now you'll be able to see big sales straight from the launcher- It enables us to share exciting community announcements, news, updates, etc. with much more ease. Especially if you give us marketing permissions so we can send you an occasional cool email- In the future we'll be able to manage giveaways ;) more on that later- It facilitates account creations, which helps us understand our players better. Meaning, we can make the game better!- A bunch of other planned features that are all about making things better for you- And for full transparency, there is some important data that we get out of this. Like better tracking on how many people are playing. Which means our Community team gets more money, which we then get to spend on giveaways, contests, supporting modders and YouTubers and Streamers, and other great stuff that I can't spoil the surprise for ;)I speak for myself and nobody else when I say that none of these things interest me in the slightest. Yet I doubt I am alone in this sentiment. I have no interest in sales. I purchase expansions as and when I please, and in no way want a proprietary launcher to push those sales to me when the developers could just as easily do so on Steam. I have no interest in game news, as I have Steam for that. I have no interest in giveaways, for they offer nothing of consequence to me in improving my city-building experience. I have no interest in creating an account for a game I never needed one for. I have no interest in ""planned features,"" as I am fairly confident that the gameplay features (assuming that's what the developers are even getting at) necessitate no proprietary launcher to introduce. Lastly, I have absolutely no interest in whatever nebulous telemetry the new launcher purports to track. None of the developer's reasons serve to improve my personal gaming experience; they serve only to harm it. As I type this, there are some workarounds to using Paradox Launcher. I care little. This is a regrettable move by the developers that cheapens and betrays the overall experience. Even though the developers may be economically and legally justified to introduce a launcher, I can never entertain it. Cities: Skylines is my first game from Colossal Order and from Paradox Interactive. It will likely be my last."

Everything from wind and water movement to pollution and goods transportation is included in this game. Not only are you building a city, but you are managing the logistical need to move people and goods in and out of that city. You can adjust the growth of your city with districts and specialized industry/business areas. And your citizens will adjust their lives based on what is available. Many of the options are watered down or simplified, but the scale on which you can build these networks and grow is awesome. Compared to Sim City, this game is overwhelmingly better in almost every category. But for 2 reasons, I cannot recommend that a person spend the money for it. Reason 1: It's buggy as all hell. Don't even bother with that steam workshop. The moment you add in custom assets or mods, the game starts falling apart and @*$%ing all over itself. Re-loading saved games is like an olympic test of performance on any computer. Even without mods enabled, the game likes to crash and freeze constantly. After 3 years and numerous DLC, no patches have seemed to improve the stability of the game itself. Reason 2: It's bland. Don't get me wrong, the building can be fun, but after one map in the American theme, every other city is going to look the same. Sure, you can deal with snow, or you can have fun with the broad-reaching ""European"" theme. But Collosal Order has opted to focus on other areas, leaving the same buildings, the same streets, and the same look every game. The re-playability has gone down as there are nothing new to look at or enjoy, just the same factories and stores and the same suburbs. (To piggyback off of item 2, The problems hurled at you during the game are mild and not very creative. I mean great, you can be hit by an asteroid. What city in history has been devistated by a meteor or something like that lately? But why not have a bugetary crisis or recession? What about the financial crisis that led to the crime waves in NYC in the 1980s? There's no real-world hurdles to grapple with, just build your deep space radar and try to get people to ride a bus instead of cloging Aspen Street all hours of the day.)"

However, if you want to get serious, you need to use mods and add-ins. I have a small city of 18000+ and I cannot scale without utilizing mods to fix the annoying road placement mechanics among other things.In the past city-planning games will typically notify you of problems, however this one will notify you of problems that don't exist (stupid tweets) and then you'll just come across an entire devastated area, or traffic jams that shut down city services and you find out only when the whole city is falling apart.It's worth about tree-fiddy (5 bucks tops) for the main game, I'd pay upwards of forty for the whole expansion stack.

So much time can be spent perfecting things, wrestling with traffic and spaghetti junctions, but in the end you can end up with sprawling cities that you know YOU put together.The map and theme editors are a nice introduction into level/environment design, and the ability to import heightmaps, either using real world data found on websites, or procedurally generated maps using software like WorldMachine or Houdini, you can create detailed terrain to structure cities around, from realistic facsimile to completely bonkers fantasies.Lastly, there exists a community of players who are generally supportive of players, offering advice or feedback when asked, that will make it easier to figure out complexities you might get caught up by. There is also so much amazing work done that its easy to find inspiration in the gargantuan creations some people have made."

Gives much more possibilities than SimCity 4 used to have (this was my last such game). I really like it for the possibility to make such things like custom highway junctions, bus and railway lines, and so on. Combining this with the asset editor and workshop availability it makes it possible to create the city the way you like to, with very little limitations. The only thing that may frustrate in this game is the traffic that needs to be managed in the proper way to avoid long jams which as result makes it impossible for city services to do their job. I still don't excel in it, though."

4059,mafia97,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mafia97/,3,,1,10.5,January,"29,","3,856",0,1,"Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have an unexpected hit on their hands, with Cities: skyliness garnering over 1 millio sales. The game was labelled as one of the best city-building experiences to date, and the debut trailer certainly made the game look gorgeous, massive and entertaining. I questioned whether Cities: skyliness could succeed where SimCity ultimately failed, and the question is answered with a resounding yes. Where SimCity faltered in terms of map size, controversial always-online requirements and a lack of mod support, Cities: skyliness allows gamers to have a much larger map, no online requirement, and works with the Steam Workshop to allow players to create their own assets, visuals and mods within the game(Los Santos map is amazing). As soon as players enter the game, they’ll see an interface that will be familiar to all city simulator fans: roads, power lines, pipeworks, zoning types and specialized city buildings are immediately available to select. Though users can only place zoning 3 blocks wide along each road, as opposed to filling whole sections of area, it’s easy to adjust to the tighter spacing and design ethics this decision brings. As the population of a town grows, users will unlock new zoning types, city service buildings and unique structures – or, of course, they can just go full-on sandbox and enable the game’s own in-game money and unlock cheats, a handy tool for those just looking to create the most beautiful city they can.Speaking of, this is the absolute highlight of Cities: skyliness – creating huge, gorgeous cities on a scope never before seen in a city builder. The game eclipses all other city builders in sheer land mass, allowing gamers to create a cities that looks about twenty times as large as SimCity Cities. Gamers can even download a modification to go beyond this limit, with the only functional downside being they might have some framerate issues.Exploring cities is easy, and players will likely find themselves in awe watching commuters go about as firetrucks struggle with six lanes of traffic during a high-rise fire.The game also adds new elements to mix, like one of my favorite new features that allows users to designate certain areas of the map into ‘Districts’ and subject them to special rules. This feature makes it easier for players to put more tax on a wealthy subdivision, pay to hand out smoke alarms and reduce the change of fires, or even designate that a certain industrial area ignore safety concerns to increase productivity. The Districts feature adds a unique element to areas of the city that might have been somewhat repetitive otherwise, and being able to label neighborhoods helps add to the personality of each city.There’s also new city services which must be considered. All city simulators have healthcare, but skyliness introduces deathcare. Cities must have allocated graveyards, but those fill up, which prompts he use of crematoriums to service the city. The same goes for garbage collection, where landfill areas have limited space, but the pollution-pumping incinerators will help finally get rid of the garbage. For a price, mayors can use the district tool to enable a better focus on health or recycling, which help out and keep the game interesting with more areas to focus on and ensure the city has good coverage.One of the only downsides to Cities: skyliness is that it ultimately fails to provide much of a challenge in just about anything. The hardest portion of the game is waiting for citizens to move in and keeping areas well patrolled in terms of city services like police, healthcare, deathcare, and fire control. Within about 9 or 10 hours of playing, I'd reached the end-game status with a city raking in millions of cash with low crime, high health and a happy populace. That said, the gameplay was consistently fun the entire time, and Cities: skyliness delivered an unexpectedly smooth and wonderful experience from start to finish.The game also includes an Asset Editor, so players can start creating their own building designs and easily add them to their gameplay experience. The tools are relatively straightforward, and the Steam Workshop is already full of hundreds of pieces of user-made content. Custom maps can also be designed, so players can start planning their cities from the terrain up. From our own experience, topographically-extreme maps deliver the most fantastic, albeit challenging design experience. Though the gameplay itself features no online component, gamers likely won’t notice the absence of neighboring towns as they expand their own borders over and over.Conclusion :In short, Cities: skyliness is everything that a city builder should be. Coming in with the affordable price of $29.99, HGunified recommends Cities skylines to every gamer who loves city building simulation games. Cities skylines is best city builder available in market.

Not anymore, you can change absolutely everything to suit your preferences and gameplay style. Once you get taken into your citizen’s messages via chirper it is unbelievably easy to lose time whilst playing this game.

The graphics are top-notch and the attention to detail is fantastic, it's so satisfying to watch your city come to life. The level of realism in the simulations is also outstanding, from traffic management to dealing with natural disasters, it's all so realistic and engaging. The modding community is also incredibly active, which means there's always new content to discover.

I've just taken a short break and I decided that I might as well write a review so that I can help spread the word about the greatness that is this game. The fun thing about simcity (not this game obviously) was that I could build chains and make profit that way. Since I haven't seen that specific feature in this game and if my information is correct it isn't in this game at all, I thought that it might decrease my enjoyment of this game.That is not true. In fact, I had intended to wait until the game would go into a sale  and then I would purchase it, but I was watching a let's play and I was thinking several times through the let's play episode, man I could do better then this guy. Then I thought, why not go and prove it? If only to myself.I still had some money on my steam wallet from my birthday in februari and I decided -after watching a few more video's just to be sure- that yes, this game is worth the purchase.So I bought the game, downloaded and installed it and like I said in the beginning of my review. I haven't stoppe playing since.I'm going to update this review when I have more hours under my belt and since no game can be perfect, I'm going to be updating this review with what negative points I can find.That said, so far I definetly recommend purchasing this game because you won't regret it for a moment. But if you have any doubts then just watch a couple of let's plays or look for a live stream so you can ask things there to show specific things and specific times.KingdarkEdit: 15/03/2015I realize that this edit is VERY near the time  I originally posted the review, but I feel it's worth it. I'm amazed just how EASY it is to make money. Once you get going and get a feel for the system, I had just over a million credits which takes me LOTS longer when I play simcit. Hell, I always go bankrupt with simcity. Seriously.I finally decided I had to take a break because the way I built the city was bad. It is / was my first game and I'm reluctant to just scrap it. My savegame is up for grabs, if you like to try yourself. Anyway, my opinion has not changed and I am of the firm opinion that the game is still worth it and I'm sure that this will not change anytime soon.The only bad thing is that the mods should be monitored more carefully because one of the mods is in turkish or a langauge that is not english or in a scrip I recognize and it should be properly marked.Kingdark"

4140,MarchinBunny,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarchinBunny/,2,,1,27.6,December,"7,",480,0,1,"Let me first go over what I dislike about this game but why I still recommend it.1. The best features are all locked behind DLC which to me is absolutly absurd. We give ♥♥♥♥ to EA all the time about stuff like this, but at least their DLC for Simcity included things you felt were not meant to be part of the base game. It felt like an expansion rather than randomly added features. There is no good reason why natural disasters needs to be locked behind a DLC.2. This is a great city builder. Yes, that is actually one of the reasons I dislike it because it's too much city builder and too little sim. Despite all the crap SimCity had gotten, it was actually a lot more fun to me to play it, till you got to the game breaking bugs of course.3. This can sort of go along with number 2. Progression sucks because there really isn't any. Your progression takes the form of milestones but it just feels very arbitrary.  Liek if you had it all unlocked in the beginning it honestly would make no difference. SimCity also did this pretty well. You could upgrade your buildings, and unlock different specializations. I also loved the concept of making different cities that accomplished seperate tasks. Cities Skylines largely lacks this sort of thing.4. It's not very unique and I would argue is actually quite bland. Nearly every city feels and looks the same. It just gets very boring after a while.5. It's way too damned easy. This goes back to number 2 as well. It's too much of a builder and too little of a sim. It's nearly impossible to fail in this game.So why do I recommend the game still? Well, if you can get over the above issues, it's actually a pretty great game either way. I havn't played any of the DLC yet, so some of those may circumvent some of those issues. It's a pretty game. If you liek building cities, you will like this game no doubt.I do think the game is overreated though. I think SimCity failed so badly that what happened is the bar was set very low so this game seems amazing in comparison. The whole DLC thing is also a let down. It's expensive as ♥♥♥♥ if you want all the DLC. It's nearly as bad as the sims games."

I was curious as to whether a credible rival was out there and bought ""Cities: Skylines"" (CS) to see if it came close.  It did.  Before my first session was over, which only stopped because I needed to get some sleep, I was hooked.  Even though there are many things in common between CS and SC, I felt that CS had moved above and beyond what SC had to offer.  It provided an experience I found relaxing and stimulating at the same time.  I found myself planning countless things I could not do in SC.The city in SC is not expandable.  After reaching various population landmarks in CS, you can expand.  I found that I could plan ahead for my next land purchase and work out how I wanted my city to develop.There are no highways in SC.  There are highways in CS.  Building them and adding interchanges is easy and challenging in order to control traffic flow effectively.There are no underground trains in SC.  In SC, an underground train network can be built and different lines defined.With buses and trains, you can set specific routes in CS and not just expect that a network will be effective just because there are plenty of bus stops there, which is all SC offered.Although there are pedestrians in SC, you are able to give them footpaths and footbridges in CS to ease in their getting about the city.The biggest gamechanger has been that of mods.  In CS, there are new mods in every form being created every day.  Ranging from a make of car, a type of house, a new park to even seeing things from a first person perspective following vehicles or individuals around, I am constantly amazed and impressed with what there is.  I've even dabbled and created my own custom objects.  It's that easy.I am very impressed with this game and I look forward to seeing what the ""After Dark"" expansion pack has to offer and I hope that there are more of them to come."

Because it allows a player to build the city they want to while still maintaining things like pollution, garbage pickup, corpse transport and many industrial industries to dabble in and with the focus shifted towards city building rather than trying to please everyone it makes for a much more pleasant experience although easier experience.If you are a fan of titles like Sim City 4 or Cities XL/XXL then this game is most likely not going to be for you as it doesn't focus on completing mundane tasks that in the real world wouldn't really be asked of a mayor.The downside to Cities: Skylines is the AI. Unfortunately the AI in the game is lacking at best vehicles tend to stick to turning lanes even if they are not turning until the end of the street, this causes players to need to manipulate the games AI into doing what is most efficient by building roads in an ugly way so the AI will use lanes that otherwise wouldn't be used. Of course this could be seen as a feature but it's most likely a development oversight that has yet to be fixed even with the first xPac out."

They look like they came out of the bad part of the 70s.2) No challenge. No strategy. This is basically a sandbox game and a simple one at that. Once you get past 5000 people, it's practically impossible to lose.3) Brings nothing new to the genre except modding...4) ...Yet many of the mods are broken because Paradox has a policy that says every time they update the game it breaks almost all existing mods.5) Have fun spending 3 hours subscribing to buildings in the workshop only to find out most are missing assets and broken. No thanks. Too much work.6) You can't even easily tell which buildings are low wealth vs high wealth. In Simcity, it was very obvious from the art style. In this game, most of the high wealth buildings look just as dated and ugly as the low wealth.7) Where are the victorians, the colonial mansions, the Philly rowhouses, the art deco styled buildings (the last is a paid expansion)? It seems the classic architectural styles were ignored and the artists decided to make the buildings look as generic as possible. Gee, that mansion looks like a parking garage. Great, let's include it in the game!8) Too much paid DLC just like all other Paradox games.9) The only reason this game gets good reviews is because city building fans were desperate after the failure of Simcity 5. Cities Skylines doesn't do anything well it just doesn't do anything horribly."

And for these guys it was a huge success considering it's low expectations.However, would this game have succeeded given the expectations of an actual Sim City game? By far, no.If you had liked the last 2 SimCity game's I would not recommend buying this game, because the learning curve is so strong and stiff and the fact that the game actually overcomplicates itself at points, you would be better off sticking to the original SimCity games.Is this game worth $30?No. I would pay between $5-25.If SimCity and this game were combined, then SimCity: Skylines would have been a HUGE success, given what SimCity did well on, Cities: Skylines drastically regressed on.SimCity took me a little over 30 minutes to get the hang of. Cities: Skylines, basically the same game, I'm still learning after a little over 2 hours.It's not that good of a transition. What SimCity did well on, is either limited or removed in this game leaving it at nothing but a City simulator.However;The fact that you have almost unlimited room and multiple options for zones leaves the opportunities endless for a fun experience and actually at points more challenging than SimCity has ever been. Lets do a rundown of what I think of some of the basic tools:1)Zoning. Zoning was better in SimCity. You had just 3 types and they upgraded themselves. Here you have 6 types and they dont upgrade themselves meaning that you basically have to merge 4 cities together to make one. There is no zone upgrade as far as I've seen which is a huge problem that hopefully will be addressed. 2)Roads/Traffic. I loved this aspect. This is a HUGE improvement from SimCity. You can upgrade any road to any type and that is SO helpful! And you can even add decorations to improve happiness. This was well done.3) Serivces. Services had a big regression from SimCity. You can't upgrade them and there are many problems with them at this point in time. Sometimes my fire trucks won't go to a burning building in their vicinity when they are idle. Power won't cross rivers so you have to make entirely new plants or turbines on the other side. And sometimes crime is rampant with tons of Police stations.4) Specializations. Specializations was a huge speciality of SimCity and I enjoyed that aspect of the game. Here it is a little overcomplicated as I can't figure out how to use any of my oil and ore zones or how to zone them. And there is no ingame tutorial for them either.So all in all. For it's expectations, it is a good game. But not anything deserving of a 9/10 on a AAA title scale.Score: 6.8/10Worth: $13.If you have SimCity 4 or the latest SimCity I would stick to those games. If you don't have either, I would recommend this game as a starting point.FOR IDIOTS: THIS IS MY OPINION ONLY. I am not biased, nor was this a paid review. This is a simple review of 'What I think'. You have your opinion and I have mine, we are both entitled to our own. Keep the comments clean. I am open to CONSTRUCTIVE criticism. Thanks for reading,Tacticus.I actually do recommend this game for people who havent played any SimCity games. If you have played and liked SimCity this won't be smooth transition and will be frustrating at points. Best of luck if you buy it."

The good old Sim City 2000/3000 feel is there, and made much better by a variety of enhancements (simple overlays for indicators, area of effect on buildings before you place them, accurate visual cues, etc.). Conceptually, the game is a bliss. Most things are inherently understood by the player or well summarized by their popup explanations. Still, an advanced in-game tutorial for certain things would have been appreciated (albeit you can see the wiki from the main menu). Most importantly, none of the BS from the more recent iteration of Sim City is to be found. Example: instead of paid DLC for nicer looking structures (and feeling as if you were shortchanged with an incomplete game to start with), they come free of charge. And if you ever felt there weren't enough models, you can either make them yourself or find some on the Workshop. It also looks like tons of people like to share their models on Workshop. Despite certain shortcomings (the Tweeter feed isn't always very useful, the soundtrack could be expanded somewhat, rivers and water in general is somewhat lackluster), this game made me believe in the city sim genre once again.

4230,marinertheraccoon,https://steamcommunity.com/id/marinertheraccoon/,1,,1,"1,005.9",January,15,284,0,1,"After the sad and slow collapse of Maxis and their final Sim City release, I worried that the modern era city builder was dead.  There were a few lackluster options out there, like Cities XL, but nothing that ever scratched that Sim City 4 itch.  Then out of nowhere, on the day of its release, I saw a video review for Cities: Skylines.  Without hesitation I bought and have been playing ever since. The base game with no mods is perfectly fine as it is, but you do find yourself wanting ways to tidy up your work that aren't so laborious.  After getting a few mods to move things around easier, or plant trees in a brush stroke, you start to wonder what other mods are out there and before you know it you're installing other mods to keep the memory footprint manageable.  For me the value in Cities isn't directly the gameplay, which is fine enough, but the ""model train set"" aspect of seeing your creations play out with insane detail.  You feel like you're witnessing an actual city go through its daily cycle as pedestrians dump out onto the sidewalks when a train makes a stop, or a huddled mass waits for the next bus to come on a rainy night.  There has been more than plenty enough DLC to keep things more interesting, though I can't comment on the latest few packs just yet... they're all decent but worth the wait for a sale.  While I love the Snowfall expansion as a way to create wintry maps around the holidays, a time when this displaced northerner has a longing for snow, I do hope if there's ever a Cities: Skylines 2 that a proper weather cycle is there from the start."

The music is okay and the overall mechanics are rather simple but satisfying. It's nice to see the city flourish. Later in the game you may be confronted with some issues e.g. shortages of goods, heavy traffic loads and insane public facilities vehicles driving to the end of the map instead of helping locals. Additionally you may face some glitches, especially in the ships traffic. And don't dare to raise taxes above 12% no matter which section or landvalue.There is a bunch of DLCs on the market. The industrial upgrade brings in new game mechanics and looks nice. However they all seem to be highly overpriced and I wouldn't consider buying them.The game has a promising future but really needs a successor, instead of new DLCs. Hope for it to come soon."

I strongly feel as though Cities:Skylines is the best city builder on Steam.The base game itself is great and has plenty of depth, although some of the DLC available almost seems vital to the game. The DLCs can be picked up on sale for greater replay value and significantly impact the game; The Mass Transit  DLC is almost a must have. The game is simple and relaxing but does have depth, which is significantly enhance by some of the available DLCs.Tons of replay value across different maps and designs. Cities can really seem alive, citizens go about their day, sit in the terrible traffic that you've helped create, and go to buildings you've zoned or built.The community surrounding Cities:Skylines is undisputedly one of the best, there are tons of mods and assets to design your city in the way you want. The workshop is fantastic and loaded thanks to the many great creators in the community.With all of this said, I am very disappointed by the launcher update and potential data harvesting going on. I am sick of being a part of these massive databases and there needs to be a serious conversation about customer rights and more opting out abilities. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes city builders. You likely won't find a better one than Cities:Skylines currently."

Not only allows players to develop their personal creative ability, but also test the player's care and patience.Of course, the shortcomings can not be ignored: 1. The game's memory and graphics card requirements are actually very high, if you want to experience the game effect on the network video, my suggestion is that you have a very high configuration computer. 2. The game compatibility is very poor. The mods of many creative workshops produced by the players are not very compatible. I don't know if the game itself is designed or the loopholes. I hope all the good mods are compatible, and the front mods are compatible. It is too much, I hope that when the game is updated, I can try to put the mod into the game content. 3. The game needs to buy a lot of Dlc, if you can't buy it, you can't experience a lot of game content. This is actually a change to the price of the game, and I think the effect of the update is actually very small."

Steam overlay and Steam screenshots no longer work (no Shift +Tab, no F12).When you launch the game there is no indication that the EULA for the game has changed and there are no warning dialog boxes. YOU MUST SIGN UP FOR A PARADOX ACCOUNT. Due to how the game works, Cities Skylines can sometimes take 10 minutes to launch even on an M.2 NVMe SSD if several DLC and mods are installed. The launcher adds up to an additional 10 minutes to the launch time. Many players have experienced a drop in CPU performance with the launcher running and others have reported the it is also eating up system memory. Other more technically minded players have found that the launcher is sending telemetry data to some remote server which includes personal information.On the day of changes, throwaway accounts flooded the store page to leave positive reviews, which violates the Steam TOS. (Review manipulation)I thought Paradox Int. was good, this changed my mind.The dev also called someone an SJW.

I will still recommend it.

There are limitless hours of fun to be had in Cities: Skylines, with the ability to create your own maps and play on them or to use the default maps and mod them. The community is really helpful in case you need help learning how to play, although it doesn't take long to get a grip of the reigns on this one.The only critisism I would have for Cities: Skylines is that the DLC (to which there are many) are pretty expensive. Even on sale, some of them are upwards of £8. However, DLC is not a must-have in the game, which makes up for this issue.I would highly recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who enjoys creating something worth being proud of in a game."

Mods just push this over the top ranging from graphical overhauls to customized placement of props to superior traffic AI.  To get the most out of the game you really need to play with mods, but they're free!  Being a very amateurish city builder myself, I sometimes just watch in awe how others have built their cities and utilize the free-roaming camera to spectate them from all sorts of different angles, gaining inspiration along the way.  This is a deeply rewarding and relaxing game.  My one word of warning is that you need a powerful CPU to have a large-population game run smoothly, and lots of RAM if you want to get into heavy modding which isn't hard to do given the vast quantity of mods that are available for free through Steam Workshop."

It improves on about everything of the old city builders. The only issue that i have is the amount of DLC, varying a lot in content and price. Sometimes a DLC without new mechanics and only consisting of new assets should be free, and the price of 'bigger' DLC is too high. Maybe it's because of Para 'i love dlc' dox, but in my opinion it hurts the game.Having that out of the way i can only say good things about Cities: Skylines, also the mod community breath new air to a game that's still relevant years after it's initial release"

Cities: Skylines provides several hours of game play in one world session. Whether you want to make your own city or get an already contructed one. Go ahead both are accessible options. Either start your own new world, choose from diffrent map kinds or choose one you made on your own. You can also get premade worlds from the community workshop. Even without DLC's this game is loads of fun and a requires you to actively look everywhere and make the right decisions. If you don't your City might end up in debt and then you're not capable of running it anymore. For people who are used to simple city simulator mobile games this game is gonna be very difficult to understand as its not like those. This game has real life taxes and control options which goverments use to keep their town in perfect balance. I personally do not posses any of the Cities: Skylines DLC. But all of them seem like to have a good purpose and add cool functions to the game. To make your city experience even more realistic or more destructive.Short summary, If you're up to the task of making decisions and managing your own city. GO ahead and buy this game. If you're not up for difficult city games. I wouldn't advice it.  Even without the taxes and other control features, the natural problems that occur can be really frustrating. You dont need to use the extra control features such as taxes and what not. But if you know how to use them right im sure your city will be the best."

I would say this is a great game, especially if you love the city building frachaise especially since it includes lots of things people wished for in Sim City 4 (tunnels, real water effects etc)However one word of warning...the game needs optimising badly!What is great is the amount of DLC and Workshop support, mods, buildings etc, however owning a powerful PC is a must for this game, even if you are WELL above the recommended specifications. So what I would personally like to see is the developers actually spending time optimising the game back to recommended system specifications as I personally feel (even myself owning a powerful PC) that the game is very sluggish at times and yes sometimes doesn't work as intended. Yes it most likely is to do with the amount of workshop items I may have downloaded, however if you are wanting to make a city which is more vibrant than having standard buildings...this is a must.Uninstalled for now till it gets optimised, which is a real shame because like I say, it's a really good game!"

I experience no slowdown in cities with 200,000+ population, even with graphics maxed @2560x1440 (1080 GTX, 16 GB RAM, i5).Cons: Some of this game's DLC is useless (Concerts I'm looking at you), but purchase at least the Mass Transit DLC and After Dark to round this game out. Mass Transit really adds to the experience and is worth the price, After Dark arguably should've been included in the base game, but it's still worth paying for. After those 2, probably grab Snowfall and maybe Natural Distasters, but the rest of the DLCs are basically just paying a donation to the devs and some community modders."

The visuals and soundtrack to this game gives it it's relaxing vibe, the former being detailed and sharp, most of all doing justice to both the man-made and natural environment that will contrast on your screen, creating beautiful vistas that won't disappoint.

Cities: Skylines is a game built on the same concepts, but with graphics and performance that have raised the bar to a whole new level when it comes to city-building simulators.This game sports a lovely, well-performing game engine delivering all the fun (work?) of zoning land, designing power/water infrastructure, roads and transportation, coverage of education, law enforcement, fire fighting, parks and recreation, trash and corpse management, etc..Without a doubt, Cities: Skylines is the best city building simulator I've ever seen.

And that was before the after dark expansion. Now take what I just said and X100000 with a day/night cycle. The city comes alive with beautiful night time lights, sunsets/sunrises and how the city behaves at different times of the day. I got the expansion pack with the added buildings, bike lanes and transit options, I say it's well worth the money they're asking. What I would like to see in future expansion packs, TRAMS, HOV lanes, elevated subways, bus/metro/train hub stations, and a giant train hub station (union station).

I am still happily playing this thing! The After Dark add-on is my next purchase. For those considering it, if all you want is day-night cycles, you get that for free from the developer. Most of the previous annoying true bugs and limitations (world holes, low polygon limit, drivers lining up in one lane) have been patched now. I want to buy the DLC for the added commercial district specialization (not too excited about prisons, as crime management is not that difficult).Note on the drivers only using one lane: if you're still getting this, it's your road design,not the game.

Spent so many nights up late trying to fix traffic, expanding my city, adding new areas, new roads etc. I also love the hilarious ""ads"" that play on the radio stations, something that reminded me of listening to the radio in GTA. It was a small but welcomed touch to the game environment. People will whine about the DLC being too expensive, but for the most part they all add something fun and unique to the base game. The modding community is fantastic, and the realism is really great. The game may have a tough time telling you why some people are dying or why certain parts of your city may struggle, but IMO I enjoy that. Really makes you try to constantly improve your city design.Overall, this is my most played game in my steam library. It is a must own for strategy and city building lovers, and has an awesome community of mods and DLC behind it. Cities Skylines is one of those ""I meant to play this for only 30 minutes and 4 hours later I'm still playing"" kinds of games."

The game is straightfoward to learn, but challenging to master. The core game is flexibile enough so both grid fanatics and organic designers can build their dream cities with ease. The game fully embraces modding, including a built in asset editor so any player can tweak and tinker away. Within a few weeks the community has built dozens of mods and thousands of assets, and it makes the game practically limitless. For balance, a couple negatives. First, the game is currently tilted in balance towards the early expansion and small city. Once you start getting into the 85k range, the available facilites strain. Once you're at 100K+, the game demands high levels of efficiency in design in order to function, but even then technical limits can crop up that break the simulation. Second, the graphics are very good, but it takes a few mods to fully realize the potenital here and make breath taking Skylines. Paradox has promised robust, long term support for the game of both the free and paid variety. They have so far been active in bug patching and talking to the community. I trust as this game matures, it will move past these growning pains.If you are a fan of city builders or you have always wanted to try one, do NOT hesitate to pick up Cities: Skylines!"

Reminds me of the promises from the first concept art we saw from Sim City (2013) that Maxis' team was unable (or unwilling) to bring to fruition.  Collosal Order, you guys are rock stars!  I'm beholden to your talent, and I hope we will get some future expansions to this game from you.  I also can't wait to see what the modding community will surprise us with.Also, I love the art style of this game.  It looks like a photorealistic miniature toy train set, especially with the tilt-shift effect.  The freedom I have to place roads, bridges, and pathways is amazing, and they always join naturally and fluidly.  Also, you can place objects very close together, so the result is tidy and compact, and very natural looking."

Skilines, mechanically, it is a very sound game and probably one of the better modern city builder games on the market. However, I cannot recommend it due to the abhorrent business model being used to market and sell it. For anyone familiar with most Paradox games, this is no different. The publuisher punishes the consumer by restricting most content behind DLC pay-walls. What would normally be a 40-50$ game has now ballooned to over 100$ and continues to expand. This game is not worth 100$. If you got money to burn and are in absolute dire need of a city building game than have-at-it. For me, it will never be worth the asking price. I originally bought the base game soon after its release, both being a bit ignorant of Paradox's business model and uninformed that this was a Paradox game. This is my fault, I didn't do my research. For the first while I enjoyed the game, it felt a bit simple and overall there was really no way to lose, but still a good game overall. But then came the constant release of one DLC after another, and it quickly became apparent that Skylines was intentionally released as a partial game so that the publisher could force additional DLC money later. The truth of this has only gotten more solidified as time goes on. Mechanical features that are in almost all city building games to add challange and depth are in Skylines but are forced behind the DLC paywall. So your options as a consumer are either pay normal price for an incomplete and shallow game, or pay exponentially more for the full experience. Again, for me, this is not a game worth $100+, and the base game alone does not have the depth of content that makes it worth while to play stand alone."
4519,MetaRift,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MetaRift/,20,2,0,69.0,July,"15,",117,0,1,"I rate this game around 5/10. I'm giving it a thumbs down because I think it's over-hyped. My main conclusion is C:S has a very high aesthetic appeal (for those who like to look at and engineer pretty things), but in terms of a city managment game it's lacking.The first couple hours involve trying to understand and get to grips with UI. There is no real tutorial to speak of, but it's fairly straight forward if you have played any similar games. I started making zones and developing services. So far, so good.After a couple of hours I did run into some funding issues (to be expected), and at this stage I was trying to find out ways to most effectively run my city and where to invest my resources. Here things get a little bit disappointing. For instance, I found out that . After I dealt with these problems and started expanding again the money just rolled in. From here on out things just got boring. Money can be thrown at any issue that arises. For example, . After 10 hours, the game played more like a traffic simulator - with no real consequences when ripping down big strips of buildings to put in bigger roads (which don't even get effectively used.) Moreover, the road building function is clunky, especially for curved roads and upgrading smaller roads. Here is where I missed the little side projects available in SC4 and attention to detail in game mechanics. For me, there are not enough in-game choices and decisions to make in terms of management. I gave the whole city free public transport and education boosts - and every other possible positive policy - and still had tons of cash to spare. As a result, the achievements (monuments) did not really feel like a reward for mastery of the game, rather a token for hours played. Further, there are very few options and types of buildings in developing differing services - and why aren't most transport options available immediately?  That said, there are some pluses to the game- I really like the district function (although I did like the regional interaction of SC4 which is not present here)- The mod community seem to be very active. I do like that the devs encourage this, but this shouldn't come the expense of the basic game- The graphics- I actually do think there are some management mechanics happening - particularly around factory zoning - but this is lost on the user, and because the money is flowing in from other sectors it's not even worth exploring All in all, a disappointing experience. I do believe this game has potential, and I'll most likely pick it up again in a couple of months to see if anything has changed. I just wish the devs would pay more attention to the subtleties and nuances of city management rather than making a pure building experience. Probably not worth $30 even if you like building things, and barely worth $15 if you are looking for a management style game."

Additionally, there are services like a working police force to keep the crime rate low, fire departments to lower the fire hazard and hospitals to take care of sick citizens.During the last phases of the game it is possible to unlock so called monuments – large buildings that have unique and very powerful properties and will spice up your city considerably.As someone who never played a city builder like this before, I was surprised how much I enjoyed my time with the game.Very relaxing and super addictive - perfectly hits the “once-i-get-this-residental-area-setup-i-can-hit-the-next-milestone-and-start-working-on-my-awesome-new-cargo-train-network-and-then-expand-into-the-bay-area-and-make-an-awesome-looking-tourism-sector-oh-no-it’s-3am-again”-nerve.Also: Trains are the best!"

Huge cities are possible and a very nice sense of a living community (especially if you slow things down with one of the mods already out there).  With the exception of some weak AA and ambient sounds varying between dull and infurating (those accursed sirens!!!), well worth the $30 price tag, especially knowing that patches and mods will make it even better.Update:  After a few weeks playing, I see a growing number of simulation purists starting to beat on the game.  I can respect that if they are seeking pure sim engine.  But for me, opening the game up with no budget restrictions and logical (if not mind-bending challenges) means I can at last build a MY cities.  Actually DESIGN them and while my errors are clear if I screw up, I can work it out and fix it without the sense of fighting the game and losing to a mistake I made hours before.  This is just a plain fun and good-looking game with the best ""alive"" feeling I have seen.  Mods can make the graphics look really nice and I for one can say this is the best $30 I have spent in a very long time.PS: I am still finding myself grinning like a kid at some things and saying ""now that's great!""  Have you clicked on a seagul and flown it?  Buy the game, stuff it full of mods, and build a beautiful city where God doesn't hate you, people live their lives happily, cops don't shoot people, and folks aren't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and rioting on you evey five minutes.What would I change?  The ambient sound.  It's repetitive and the sirens are very aggrevating.  But I am sure that we be moddable, soon enough."

Need i say anymore? I will though. Like a lot of reviews I've read I re-started the game many times as i messed up with roads mainly and ran out of money. My current game I got into debt at the start but was helped out with a £30000 giveaway and pulled it around. After a little tinkering I finally got the hang of things and i now have a city with a 30000 population. I've managed to publish my first ever workshop items through this. It makes it so easy to do, if I was an artist i may have even considered doing my own art/graphics but alas I'm not. The one issue with workshop content, they disable Achievements. While I can understand this for mods why do it for assets(plots/houses etc.)? I know you can set the parameter's of a lot(Entertainment/water use/Elec use etc.) which i am guessing is the main reason but is there not a way around that somehow?There are a few thing's i would like to see added/tweaked but overall its one hell of a game. I would recomend this game big style to anyone who likes simcity and city building games in general. Keep up the good work devs and i'll look forward to more polish/tweaks/updates & expansions/dlc."
4578,Gemoron,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gemoron/,1,,1,17.8,March,"15,",573,0,1,"TL;DR: Bye bys Sim City. Cities Skylines has come to claim the throne of citybuilders, with success but not without (small) flaws.As the name suggests and as I have already said, Cities Skylines is a citybuilder. You start as a mayor of an empty plot of land next to a highway with lush green meadows, hills and rivers. You don't have a task, but you can build the city of your dreams. You build streets, organize public transportations and city services and designate zones for residential, commerce and industry next to streets.So far, so standard. but other games like Sim City or Cities XXL does the same. It doesn't take long to discover the first thing which makes this game special. You don't start with a full tech tree. Instead you start pretty limited and expand as the city grows in size. In addition to just building your city, you can also designate districts where special policies can be applied like modifying tax rates or issue water saving orders. These zones are especially important for industrial zones because you can assign farmland, timber industry or exhaustible resources like oil and ores. That means you don't build special buildings for these ores, just tax private industries, a clear improvement to Sim City.As the city grows, traffic starts to become a problem. Luckily, you have more than enough tools to deal with that problem. Instead of just building two way roads, you can also build one way roads and highways as well as public transportations. You can also expand your territory from Sim City size of 4km³ up to 36km³, with mods even 100km³. The graphics aren't especially beautiful, but it makes fun zooming in to watch how your city grows from a few houses at a gravel road to a busy metropolis full of skyscrapers.Sadly there is one thing that pisses me off. Colossal Order added a feature they call chirper. citizens of regularly send you messages via this in-game twitter ripoff to tell you how much they like the city or tell you if a house is missing a city service. This might be a good idea, but it gets annoying, and worst of all, you can't turn it off. Please CO, make an option to turn that fat blue bird off.Even if chirper is annoying, the game itself is great for a more than reasonable price of less than 30 Euro for the standard edition. I clearly recommend this this game for all city builder fans and strategy enthusiasts, all everyone who got disappointed by EA's Sim City 2013"

As far as city building games go SimCity 4 is probably the pinnacle of the genre and until now no game has ever come close to it. People are already enthiuastically playing it, posting screenshots, uploading videos and building mods even on day one. In my time playing it I lost track of the time and really enjoyed watching my first city grow and I could see myself easily losing hundreds of hours to this game.My only real complaints about it so there is no day-night cycle and the scale of some of the buildings are kind of off-putting such as; factories using up the same amount of space as a single family home or pump stations being a magnitude larger than houses (the windows on the pump station are the size of a house), sometimes the traffic will clip into each other or pile on top of each other, the depth-of-field filter seems too aggressive (so far I haven't been able to figure out how to adjust it or turn it off).All of these issues are purely cosmetic problems though and the underlying gameplay is solid so I would definately recommend picking up this game if you've been looking for a great follow up to SimCity 4.I really feel this is a solid title, some of the problems will be fixed in time and this game is a great foundation for future sequels. I haven't felt this excited about a game in a long time!"

Modding community is great as well -- tons of workshop items available to modify gameplay to your liking. If you are considering getting this game - do it. No hesitation. Hands down an excellent city simulator. Ignore many of the faults I have about this game because you likely won't greatly encounter them until you are well into the game experience. Also apologies, this will be a bit lengthy. Many of the faults this game has can be fixed through quality-of-life mods, but it would be nice if some of the mods were incorporated into the game in one way or another to make gameplay smoother and reduce mod conflicts.At this point in the game's life, it is in need of a game engine rewrite to take advantage of better computer specs. As a community, I think we are used to slow frame rates being the norm with this game and the scale of the city at best rivaling a small city in the US.

I'm spending hundreds of hours with this one. Small suburb? Villages connected to each other? Huge grid-based city with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ traffic? All are possible here. If you are a fan of city-building engineering sims, this one's for you.The good: Plenty of expansion and zoning possibilities even with vanilla (no mods/assets) to create beautiful cities. Especially with the After Dark DLC, this creates some very scenic views. Can easily spend hours just admiring the view of your city. Lots of freedoms to build/zone as you please. The vanilla mechanics make sense so long as you are aware of the problems with junctions and coordinate your service radii. A learning curve, but a good one. Although it would be nice for the developers to provide us with the specifics of how things happen/work, it's frustratingly nice to have a game where we have to figure it out for ourselves. And deathcare is featured. A city sim that models lifespan including dead bodies - hello?The bad: Many mechanics issues with the game (traffic AI, excessive service building/vehicle requirements) but all can be overcome with mods/assets from the workshop on Steam. I personally do not use the mods that affect traffic, prefering to figure it out myself, and I avoid any mods that are intrusive (change/modify game mechanics, can corrput save game files). I also analyze all assets to ensure they are not OP  (no 10k entertainment radii - I'm looking at you kiis-lu. with your equestrian stables and your city zoo - I get the concept, but radius affects traffic). Is it worth it? If you are a fan of city-building simulations, then the answer is, ""Duh."" Even at twice the price it would be a great value. As for the expansion, a lot of people are asking, ""Is ""After Dark"" worth the price?"" Well, it's $15.00 - that would be one person at a movie theatre with popcorn and a drink, for 1.5 hours of a movie. The AD expansion has provided me a helluva lot more than 1.5 hours of joy, so I'd say that ""After Dark"" is well worth the entertainment dollar value.Caveat - My ""hours played"" are, at this point, inaccurate. I've left the game running over-night or while I was at work on several occasions. So, in the interest of objectivity, shave about 1/3rd of the hours off of my playtime."

Essential DLC:  Parklife (more fun than I was expecting, and it allows odd-shaped parcels of ground to be put to good use), Mass Transit (if only for the monorail) and Snowfall (for the trams)Essential mods:  MoveIt and TrafficManager (but there are quite a few worth getting)Helpful YouTubers:  Sam Bur and Biffa (among many)"

My only pet peeve is that the tweets can get pretty annoying after a while, like the one complaining that I allocated an industrial zone to farmland. Like, I get it, you don't like farms, but whining about it won't make me change it. That being said, I actually do like that there are people complaining about stuff. For the next game, I hope they go deeper on this topic so that I also have to do more to please my constituents than build parks ever 50 squares and make sure they have water and electricity.  Maybe I haven't gotten deep enough into the game, but a single-tweet isn't going to be enough to get my greedy hands off that dirty oil money."

For years I have seen titles in the Cities franchise and I steered clear of them. Then in early 2018, a random conversation lead to a stranger reccomending that I try Cities: Skylines. After a few days, I bit the bullet and picked up the game. Now, many months later, it remains my go-to game on my days off. The level of detail and customiozation vs. any of the SimCity games is astounding. Sure, there's some things I'd love to see added (a casinos expansion for example) but even the few things this game lacks are more than made up for by the shear amount of content avaiable. And the mods, while they can be messy on the rare occasion, are an excellent edition and keep the game fresh between the frequent DLC releases. This game is aging well with continued support from the dev and the community. If you like the SimCity series, you will love this game. Buy it, you won't regret it."

I haven't playes a Sim city game in a long time, admittedly, but Cities: Skylines really brings the genre to the forefront.The logic to this game is very good, where every peice of traffic or people actually has something to do, rather than just being cosmetic. This does make things a bit trickier, but overall that is much more fun. Similarly, the mechanics of district zoning is something I hadn't expected, but turns out to be really useful.Things do tend to get a bit hectic when you end up with a large population [>100,000], but that may just be due to my own lack of experience.The audio graphical design to this game are really good. It makes it a joy to just sink in to playing for hours. From a wide angle view of the environment, right down to the models of buildings and vehicles it all looks and sounds great. The interface isn't overly complex or cluttered, and it is easy to learn. The modding community to this game is amazing as well, with loads of great content. The devs are even taking hints from various popular mods and integrating relevant additions into the game itself, which is always nice to see. That, and the few gripes I do have about the game [like no tree brushes] can easily be fixed by a mod. They install easily, and I haven't had any game breakages from them.This game is definitely worth buyng if you like city builders, or simulator games of any kind."

A few things it does better than it's rival:1) Zoning is easier as you can only construct along roadsides meaning it's very difficult to leave areas without road access2) Upgrading roads when the city becomes bigger is done with the click of a button3) You can plan bus routes and place stops along roads 4) The money system requires less time and vigilance WITHOUT being easy. Things happen faster than in SimCity and this game is a little more forgiving when it comes to fixing areas of concern and avoiding going bankrupt5) Ifrastructure is unlocked as your city grows in population, I liked this aspect.  6) The game looks good, lots of little people walking around, cars, HGVs, buses, all fill the roads convincingly Look forward to many more hours"

Getting straight to the point, Cities Skylines takes the new SimCity back to basics, and nails those basics spot on. This includes huge maps, a terrain editor, lots of transportation options and competant graphics. In doing this, it has also taken steps back.This game comes with the same flaws that the older games had: you would lay some roads, zone an area, and place one of each service in the centre of that area. You would repeat this over and over again. Whereas in SC 2013, they added modular buildings and specialisations to mix up the gameplay (such as adding casinos with different room types for wealth levels), this new game is purely zoning and placing the same buildings over and over. Even the specialisations are actually reskins of the industrial zones, and are zoned with the same tools. They offer little difference to the gameplay.If you want huge maps, and are simply interested in designing a city for the sakes of it, then I can recommend to you this game very easily! It has plenty of tools to make your perfect city ""look"" like a perfect city. But, if you want a simulation that does not rely on your imagination, has more content and is less repetitive, then SimCity is your best bet. For example, in Cities: Skylines you can pretend to have a tourist area, whereas in SimCity you actually see tourists being simulated and affecting your economy based on the wealth levels of the attractions you have built (Cities: Skylines has no wealth levels either)."

However before that you'r city will stop working due to the 65 000 agent limit, meaning when your city reached a population of between 200-400 000 necessary city services will not spawn and cars, citizens etc... will not make it's way into your beloved city due to to many agent's already being active.

Its just a road simulator. Production chains and industrial buildings all feel the same, some produce pollution so make more money others dont so make less. This is 100x better than sim city and is its spiritual sucessor but after you built a couple cities its repetative. Also the privacy policy changed, id like my money back but thats not how steam works. I paid for this years ago why do you all the sudden get to change your policy and block me from playing because i dont want you to turn around and sell my information? (Can play in offline mode to avoid this)The control you get is amazing though, everything from controlling maintance sliders to passing laws to making super highways with 20 exits. If you want to make something pretty i would def gurantee this but from a gameplay value this game is meh unless you just want to kill time in a chill casual environment.IMO the best city builders arent road builder simulators but are games like stronghold crusader, tropico, rise to ruin,rimworld, factorio, oxygen not included etc. actually have an economy that requires you to do stuff not just be successful by plopping down the first building in a supply chain.Need mods just to get over 75 000 pop or else your city gets blocked up and you die. kinda sad that they dont fix it in the vanilla game."

It is a great deal of fun if you like city building games.Make sure to google graphic settings, otherwise you'll see a bunch of blurry graphics.

While some may not like Paradox's DLC model (and let's be honest, it can be a bit intimidating for new players), CSL offers loads of awesome content out of the box for a very affordable price. Micro-managers will love the ability to fine tune almost every aspect of their cities, from the names of city districts all the way down to following a single citizen around throughout his day. While there is a bit of a learning curve and the in-game tutorial is rather lacking (a hallmark of Paradox games) there are many youtubers and an official wiki that can help get you up to speed.

Just one glance at the 500+ negative reviews posted in the last week easily disproves this claim. Also interesting to note the sudden influx of positive reviews by accounts with only one or two games and less than 10 hours in Cities: Skylines. Seems like Paradox is buying positive reviews to keep their review score up.As of January 22, 2020, Paradox has decided to implement their own launcher to the game under the guise of ""improving the player experience"" and providing services to the community that they were already providing through Steam. This is a crock of ♥♥♥♥, and makes them one in a chain of game developers adding useless bloatware to their games that provides no benefit to players, and allows the developer to harvest players data and push advertisements in our faces.

This game does what the new SimCity (on Origin) SHOULD have done, and tried (but miserably failed) to do.  For me, Cities: Skylines takes the cake as the best city-builder.Cities: Skylines allows the player to start from nothing, and grow one tiny neighborhood into an ultimately sprawling, fully integrated and interconnected network of high density cities and lower density towns.  You start with one (farily large) square of territory, then build up a nice bustling village, and gradually expand your city by purchasing other, directly-connected squares of territory with new resources and topographic features, until you have a realistic-feeling region.  (This feature contrasts greatly with the new SimCity, which only technically allows you to expand into a ""region,"" since it really only allows you to focus on one square of territory at any one time.  Cities: Skylines gives you a full view of your expanded territory, you can build in any part of your territory at any time, and you can see that your various smaller cities are all a part of a larger interrelated region.)  This ability to gradually expand into a true, interconnected megalopolis, and the additionalability to create smaller districts (neighborhoods), and set policies that are specific to each one, are some of the game's best features.  The game allows you to have real control over what happens in each area of your region.  The road and transportation system is also quite intuitive, and generally allows for easy manipulation and changes.  Transportation systems are easy to set up and change (unlike in SimCity), and I feel like there is a good amount of freedom in setting up roads.  I only wish you could easily change a two-lane road into a one-way road, which it doesn't seem to allow you to do.  But that's a minor critique of an otherwise STELLAR game.  I will say that the game sometimes runs a little choppily on my crappy (but new) Acer laptop, and the graphics are a little fuzzy, but I am positive that this is the result of my aforementioned crappy machine, and not the result of any programming flaws.  Also, the imperfection of the graphics on my machine does not lessen the value of the game for me.  In my opinion, this game satisfies all the requirements for a perfect, ever-engaging city-builder.  The replay value is amazing.  I have put in 45 hours of playtime in about two weeks (by starting and expanding three different cities), and I know I've still  barely scratched the surface.  I can't wait to see how my cities progress!!  If you enjoy the city-building genre, then BUY THIS GAME NOW!!!  Take it from someone who's played just about every city-building game that's been released in the past 25 years - Cities: Skylines will make a worthy addition to your collection.  10/10; 5 Stars; A+++"

If you wait, DLC goes on sale regularly or (if you can afford it) buy the expansion packs in order of release. You dont have to buy in order but it makes more sense in game. The learning curve is simple to extreme. Anyone can make a city right out of the gate that works well enough to break even. It takes time, dedication, and an artists soul to make a visually stunning city that flows. Lastly, you don't need graphic mods to make it better but they can make it sparkle.

I'm one of the biggest players in the Simcity series back then and to be honest, after I tried City Skylines and I realized that CSL completely killed Simcity in every aspect. The Engine and game settings in Simcity, which limits in various aspects, and overall it limits the high degree of freedom of building/creating. However, City Skylines does a fantastic job to improve this issue, by creating a high degree of freedom tradition of custom mods for players, the developers have given players a high degree of freedom to define their own mods at will, and they can also facilitate commonality through the community(steam, CSL websites, etc) which makes this game at least inherit the legacy of the Simcity series in concept. Anything you can think of, even modules you can't think of, can be found and implemented in Workshops, and this really extends the life of City Skylines. Moreover, CSL also provides many systems that players in Simcity dream of, including a highly free road network planning system, and a complex and flexible highway planning system, which makes it no longer a dream for players to restore the road network of a real city.However, there are still some lacks that's been discussed since CSL was released, for example, the graphic/filter of CSL looks unreal, and the painting style is too fresh and cute, in my humble opinion, I think this type of game should look more realistic in graphics/filters. Also, the UI setting in CSL is UGLY, and there are no kinds of mods that can help improve the UI structure. Last but not least, the traffic system in CSL is a tragedy, the AI didn't function well and it makes the car go crazy on the roads, for instance, the cars are only using one lane on a four-way road, and it's super easy to crash the whole traffic lines(the mod ""TMPE"" can fix this issue completely)."

The biggest Pro's from this game is the fact that you can purchase other regions within the same city, unlike Simcity (2014). Cities: Skylines takes simple city building games and makes the player truly feel immersed in every aspect of managing a city. Although the Con's for me include having to buy DLC in order to actually manage aspects of your city such as Industries I still wouldn't shy away from recommending this game to other city builders such as myself. You can decide on playing the standard version with no DLC or take on a harsher punishment by diving deep into managing stocks (essentially). I have played this game on the PS4/PS5, Switch and finally caved and bought it for PC. I would rate this game 9/10 and only due to the purchasing of DLC to have a more complete experience. Maybe include the DLC into the game and give players the option to turn them on/off."

4770,Zaty,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zatygold/,1,,1,54.2,March,7,93,0,1,"9/10City Skylines is a highly addictive city-building game that has captivated players with its complex game play mechanics and engaging graphics. Here are three positive aspects and three negative aspects of the game:Positive Aspects:1) Massive Scope: City Skylines allows players to build huge, sprawling cities with a wide variety of buildings, roads, and services. The scale of the game is impressive, and players can spend hours upon hours building and managing their cities.2) Realistic Simulation: The game simulates many aspects of running a city, including traffic management, pollution, and crime. This makes the game play highly immersive and adds to the challenge and complexity of the game.3) Vibrant Modding Community: The game has a thriving modding community that has created countless user-made mods, maps, and assets. This adds even more variety and customization to the game, making it highly re-playable.Negative Aspects:1) Limited Customization Options: Despite the extensive scope of the game, players may find that the customization options are limited in some areas. This can lead to a lack of creativity and diversity in the cities that players create.2) Steep Difficulty Curve: The game can be quite challenging for newcomers, with many complex gameplay mechanics that may take some time to master. This can be frustrating for players who want to jump right into building their cities.3) Limited Late-Game Content: Once players have built their cities to a certain level of development, there may be a lack of engaging content to keep them interested. This can lead to a feeling of stagnation and boredom, especially for players who have invested a lot of time into their cities.Overall, City Skylines is an impressive and highly addictive city-building game that offers a wide range of features and challenges. While the limited customization options, steep difficulty curve, and limited late-game content can be frustrating, the massive scope, realistic simulation, and vibrant modding community make it a must-play for fans of the genre."

You need the DLCs to combat this, although the DLCs are very expensive for what they are. Therefore, I would recommend buying the DLCs on sale only.Apart from that, the game is great and definitely recommended to everyone."

The DLC policy, launcher, and the publisher also don't help. It has a bit of complexity, but it lacks the charm of other big city builders (SimCity 4/Societies, Tropico, for example). Its also a bit of a pain to need to build a city up from ground zero, as the building coverage isn't always that great ( why cant my firetruck of a city under 7,000 not drive a little out of its range to put out a fire? Why not just put a penalty for it?). Overall there are a few aspects missing from vanilla, and most people I hear talk about this game use mods to fill/fix some of the holes. Overall If you are ok with relying on the mod scene, and just want to build replica cities, then its an alright game. Overall: decent modern take on the city building genre, and although there are aspects I believe it could improve, it is one of the few modern beacons for the genre."

The game that can turn even the most laid-back person into a stressed-out, traffic-managing maniac. Don't get me wrong, it's an amazing game with a lot to offer. But let's be real, it's not all sunshine and rainbows.Sure, on the surface, it seems like your typical city-building game. You start with a small patch of land, build some roads and infrastructure, zone some areas for residential, commercial, and industrial use, and watch your city grow. But then, the traffic hits. And boy, does it hit hard.Before you know it, you're spending more time managing traffic than actually building your city. You're building highways, bridges, and public transportation systems just to keep your citizens from rioting in the streets (okay, maybe not that extreme, but you get the idea).And don't even get me started on the finances. It's like a never-ending game of whack-a-mole. You're trying to balance your budget, but then your citizens start complaining about the lack of healthcare or education, so you need to build more hospitals and schools. But that costs money, which means you need to raise taxes, which makes your citizens unhappy, and the cycle continues.But hey, at least you have mods, right? The modding community for Cities Skylines is amazing, and they've created some truly incredible content for the game. Custom buildings, vehicles, gameplay mechanics - you name it, they've probably made it. And the best part? Most mods are free to download and use.Of course, there's a downside to mods too. Installing too many can slow down your game or even cause it to crash. And trying to find the right combination of mods that work well together can be a real headache. It's like trying to put together a jigsaw puzzle, but all the pieces are from different puzzles and half of them are missing.But despite all the challenges, Cities Skylines is still a fun game. There's something incredibly satisfying about watching your city grow and evolve over time, even if it means dealing with the occasional traffic jam or budget crisis.So, if you're looking for a game that will test your skills as a city planner and management guru, Cities Skylines is definitely worth checking out. Just be prepared for a few sleepless nights as you try to figure out how to keep your citizens happy and your city running smoothly. And maybe stock up on some coffee, because you're going to need it."

Developed by Colossal Order and published by Paradox Interactive, this game provides players with a realistic experience of managing and building their own cities. Released in 2015, Cities: Skylines has grown to become one of the most beloved city-building games out there.The game is a true gem for city-building enthusiasts, as it offers an incredibly vast range of tools and options for players to create their own cities. One of the best things about the game is the ability to add mods that can enhance and improve the gameplay experience. The game’s community is full of talented modders who have created an amazing array of mods that add new buildings, improve gameplay mechanics, and more. The game also offers a plethora of downloadable content (DLC) that adds new features and items for players to use in their cities.The modding community has really been the backbone of this game’s success. With mods like Traffic Manager: President Edition, Move It!, and Network Extensions 2, players can customize and fine-tune every aspect of their city to make it unique. The talented modders behind these mods have put in countless hours to keep them running, and their work has not gone unnoticed. It’s amazing to see the level of dedication and creativity in this community, and it’s clear that they are a huge part of what makes Cities: Skylines such a great game.Another thing that sets Cities: Skylines apart from other city-building games is its DLC. Paradox Interactive has released a wide range of DLC that adds new buildings, game mechanics, and features to the game. From industries to parks and sports arenas, the DLCs offer a lot of variety and give players more options to make their cities unique. While some may argue that the game is incomplete without the DLC, it’s important to note that they are completely optional, and players can still enjoy the game without them.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic city-building game that offers a ton of gameplay options and an active modding community. With the addition of DLC, players can expand their gameplay experience even further. The game’s community is welcoming and helpful, making it a great game for both experienced city-builders and newcomers to the genre. If you’re a fan of simulation games, this is definitely a must-play title."

And good thing too - they've done an excellent job. Skylines quickly took its place as the best city builder in the market, and hasn't let go of their top spot since. For people who have played city builders in the past, the basics are fairly easy to pick up. The difficulty ramps up in an appealing way, forcing you to find creative solutions to traffic and aesthetic problems.The inclusion of the steam workshop is great, and offers tons of free, high quality content for all skill levels. This also makes it so that you don't really need any of the DLC to get new items - unless there's a specific new mechanic you fancy, I don't recommend the DLC. Personally I'd only recommend considering the DLC at all after you have the basics down. For me this was after the first ~200 hours of game, at which point I felt it's more than fair to throw in a new mechanic to spice things up.The endgame is a combination of traffic management, redeveloping and aesthetics."

4819,XonYx,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044974009/,1,,1,57.1,February,8,138,0,1,"My all-time favourite city buiding game was (it kinda still is), without a doubt, SimCity 3000.It was a awesome piece of game history, and even for a 1999 game, it had a certain je ne se quais that certain games of today dont have.Maybe it was its complex simplicity, its colour palet and models, its sounds...its soundtrack was for sure, but there was something else...let´s call it essence.That very essence started with the very first SimCity up until 3000 and then it was lost, in my opinion, on the next iterations of the franchise and its clones.I tried quite a few of titles like Cities XL and Cities in Motion (also from Colossal Order) and even the new SimCity´s and they didn´t quite clicked with me, dont know why, they just didn´t.Its kinda weird being writing a review for a 2015 game, but the truth is that only recently i tried Cities Skylines for the first time.And what can i say? Did it clicked? Ohhh...you have no idea.In my opinion, Colossal Order did a better job catching, moulding and revitalizing that essence of city building games, that je ne se quais i mentioned earlier, than Maxis or other game studios ever did after 3000.They grabbed a concept that was loved by many and gave it their twist and touch, and it worked. Sure there are A LOT of sinergy games around, where you mix complex city building aspects with RTS and Turn Based elements but the endgame is other than just building.This is a game where you build for the sake of building, it is somewhat gratifying when you visualize one thing, and the proceed to put it in motion and it turns out better than expected.To those that love the city building genre, Skylines is a gem. The endgame is exactly what the theme implies...build, expand, improve.There are no wars, factions or nations here, your ""enemy"" is the traffic, excessive polution, crime, fire and the most grievous of all, ignoring your citizens needs.Of course, you cant expect a game to perfectly emulate the intricacies of Civil and Municipal management like in real life, the game uses its own rules if somewhat in some cases close to reality and on others, wishful thinking.But at the end of the day, there are no right or wrong ways to do things, there is only your way, and with it, the consequences or benefits of your choices.Graphically speaking, Cities Skylines its quite pleasing to play and experience, but since its a Unity based game be sure to expect some frame drops when you have a big city with lots of buildings and movement.Let´s be clear on one thing, when you start a map you may get 50-60 fps with day/night cycle, when things get lets say ""crowded"" you may drop as low as 20-30 fps with day/night cycle. But its completly playable and enjoyable nontheless.Even with the engine limitations, Skylines is a blast, and for those with older but still powerful rigs, instead of DX11, just force the game to run on good old DX9.The 60Up Frames per Second Elites arguments dont apply here, this is not a Shoot´em Up. Period.And to sum it all up, you can add some mods like FPS Booster and LoadScreen Mod to squeeze some more frames or, like in my case, Dynamic Resolution and PostProcessFX to improve the visuals if jagged edges and blurs annoy you too.On the sound department, and on this genre is of the utmost importance since it help with the immersion, Colossal Order did a satisfying job with the ambient sounds, that change from zone type without too much overlaping and the intensity is affected by distance and height (from your POV) as it should be.One can only expect that all the sounds and noises that a real city have can get dull and exausting after a while right? Well, you can expect a wide variety of ambient sounds ranging from heavy traffic to nature and all you can think of in the between. The result is the everyday cacophony you hear on a modern day metropolis that blends perfectly and evolves along with your city.There are quite a lot of radio stations to choose from (and many more through DLC´s) that i think satisfies most of the players, but in my case, i tend to switch stations a lot because, although there are a fair amount of stations the number of tracks is somewhat limited. But, once again, that can easily be solved with mods and create your own station.Picture this, playing Cities Skylines with Simcity 3000 soundtrack...if you are a fan of SC3000 you know what im talking about, well, i do it and its awesome. Gameplay wise there some pros and cons. Right of the bat when you start, you have to get acquainted with some factors that will ultimately dictate the success or ruin of your city on the long run, natural resources, distances, disposition, direction of expansion etc, and for that fact it would have been good to have the Councillor system like in SC3000 where you are advised on what could be or not be a good move. But if you use your common sense and take some conscient risks you are good to go all the same.Another example is the road placement system. Sometimes its a pain on the backside to get the right positioning and angle, the right shape to a intersection and so on. But once again, mods are your friend.The mechanics of being a virtual ""Mayor"" may look overwhelming at first when you see lots of icons popping out of the blue around the city and most of the times you may end up scratching your head trying to figure out what is going on, for example, why some residents are always sick when theres a clinic right next to them? Can it be too much noise? pollution? untreated water? Thats where the infographs come in. They basically are your go to tool to measure the pulse of your city. Life saving i tell you.There are 2 major aspects you expect on a game nowdays, Multiplayer and Mod support. Skylines fails on the Multiplayer part (understandably) but by God it delivers on Mod support. The Steam Workshop is filled with them, from QoL mods like MoveIt and TrafficManager to Assets and LUT´s and of course Maps.Be warned that there is a trade-off to this though, the more the mods the more the loading times and system taxing which may result in fps drops, since there are more assets to load and code and scripts to run. If you balance what you want with what you really need ingame, you wont have to worry about any of this.The vanilla game already has a lot of content to create the metropolis you envisioned, but along the years, Colossal Order has been releasing DLC´s and Content Creator Packs that further enhance the experience of what you can do and what you can build, like for exemple new policies, buildings, mechanics, districts specializations etc.One last thing to point out is that this title comes with a Editor built into it which means you have the freedom to edit existing game assets or create your own, and this applies to game maps aswell, just choose a theme and you are ready to work.All in all, Cities Skylines is a solid game from 2015 but keeps on ticking as of today with a impressive player base and mod community.Its not perfect but it sure gets close to it, after all, it ""cured"" my nostalgia."

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you"

The game-play is intuitive and easy to pick up, yet challenging enough to keep you engaged for hours on end.One of the standout features of Cities: Skylines is the vast amount of customisation available.

The game also has a robust transportation system, allowing you to build and manage your own public transit networks.The graphics in Cities: Skylines are beautiful and the attention to detail is impressive. The day and night cycles, as well as the changing seasons, add to the realism of the game. The soundtrack is also excellent and adds to the overall immersion of the game.Cities: Skylines also has a strong modding community, which has created a plethora of custom content and mods that you can use to further customise your city. This adds even more replay value to the game and allows you to create unique and diverse cities.Overall, Cities: Skylines is a must-play for fans of city-building simulation games.

I probably have thousands of hours, I'll have to go check. This game is a masterpiece of freewill. Screw your micromanagement, do you know what you can do in this game? You can build a residential block, give it business, work, infrastructure, public transport, water, electricity, heat, garbage, police, fire coverage, health coverage, even down to the city benches and garbage bins. Then you can select some random guy, and watch his commute, where he works, where his kids go to school, where his mother shops, what car he drives, etc etc. You don't build cities, you build lives. You build the mundane you see everyday, from the buses you commute on to the water you drink. You can imagine yourself living in your city, and it wouldn't be far fetched. You can watch as tsunamis rip your coastal region apart, and only the hollow echoes of the air raid horn remain above the rubble. You can watch a 747 land, and see where the tourists go. You can simulate class warfare, or enforce socialist tax policy and egalitarian land value. There isn't anything you can't do. Buy this game.

For DLCs, I recommend getting the Natural Disasters and the Parklife DLCs (when they go on sale), because those are the best ones and are worth it. The only thing I don't like about this game is the overpriced DLC, it's asinine that you have to pay extra to get more content, while some are worth it, it's just plain stupid that you have to pay more money to get more content into your game.

Once you get the hang of it, a small land turns in to a large city with so much going on and it's hard to believe you once started it with small roads with nothing much. The community has built MODs that are way helpful than you think and it makes the game even more enjoyable.Yes, it means you need to understand how the system works so you won't run in to traffic problems but honestly that's the only thing that bothers most players. Once you understand if from a YouTube video or a friend, you're able to build larger cities with less traffic problems in your next try.Just one advice, always start small. Don't try to grab the whole land using MODs and start building large roads thinking it's going to turn out great because it'll only burn you out faster. You'll be left with empty spaces in your city and a dead motivation in you to turn the game on again. Admit that you need to know a little before you can do better. Peace~"

Adding seasonal change in one game would be nice.I kindly wish to raise your awareness to people trying to cheat you out of your steam points: The following comment is copy and paste from a lot of reviews on steam. People do that to trick you into giving you steam points (the steam currency) by posting something to appeal to your human compassionate aspect thereby ripping you off because it is all bullsh*t, lies and deceipt.""I am a 52 year old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father to my son, who is now 16. My son recently started Cities: Skylines and in less than a week, he had already played for over 20 hours. This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."""

Barrier to entry - it runs on an ancient version of Unity, requires several mods to run in the way your standard youtube videos show, and has the Paradox 800 DLC pack issues. The game needs a sequel to clean up some ideas. I'd happily pay full price for a CK 3 version of this game's CK 2, for example2. Performance is bad. You can run it on lower-spec machines, but it is just inefficient. This might not bother you, and once you're in-game it is OK, but it has a lot of crash bugs due to just memory, DLC, and mod management3. Badly needs a full rework (IE: likely sequel) to fix weird interactions and limitations (districts, bike/taxis, max tile count, etc)If you have this game, you probably have a good product. But at the moment I can't recommend it to a new player, which is what this review is for.TL;DR - game is good, but not worth the cost as a NEW player. If you do buy this, you will probably eventually like it, but be warned that you may give up long before you get there."

Came out as a rival to SimCity (which was a failure) gave people a lot more freedom, large maps, more modding options and took a place in a market which was there for the taking, HOWEVER, this game with its DLC's being sold full of bugs and an extremely heavy RAM requirement at times have began to wear thin on some of us. There is a huge opportunity for them to bring out a sequel that would truly rival anything that has come before. I give this a positive review as I have enjoyed this game, the DLC's released have at times been very buggy and felt botched together and thrown out rather than refined. I also cannot and will not justify the obscene amount they are charging for the DLC's.It is about time they began developing a Sequel to this, if they learnt lessons from both SimCity and this game it could be amazing.Overall 7.5/10 for base game but a lowly 3/10 for the DLC's based on price and quality"

The DLCs do make the game better generally and so are worth it, although they tend to be a little over priced. There are a multitude of weird glitches however, such as garbage trucks and corps collectors sending out only one or two cars each while your city is littered with trash and the dead.

I would recommend it ten times over if it was possible.I played it intensly when it came out and now I come back to it whenever I need a break from regular gaming and I will probably come back for the rest of my life (or at least until Cities Skylines 2 (hopefully) releases)This game is fun, it's relaxation, it's meditation and it's absolutely beautiful.(even more so with the wonderful community of modders)Even if you're not actively playing the game it's still fun just click follow on a car or pedestrian to watch where they're heading while leaning back in the gaming chair. I do have a few negatives though...The DLCs are many but few brings worthy stuff to the game (some do don't read me wrong here) and the price-tag is kinda steep if u want all of them. Should all of them have brought moneys worth then sure I wouldn't mind the cost but it feels like most of these things should already have been in the base game.Also... there's no multiplayer. I know most citybuilders don't have multiplayer so why should I complain on CS right? Well... building cities with friends is way more fun than building on your own... playing games in general is usually more fun with friends. I know CSM was working flawless up until... uhm I dunno a couple of months, 6 months, a year ago? (my memory is severely damaged after 10 concussions so don't hate on me for not remembering when it was). Now it's not working at all and I don't think it's because of modders but rather has something to do with the game but what do I know... I'm just a casual gamer.

Once you've gotten to grips with the basic tools, the game introduces levels of complexity gradually as your population grows, which in the mid-game can become overwhelming for some. But patience and trying different maps and combinations bears fruit in the long run. Fans have created some great modding/workshop material to give you more variety to explore.

While I love the Concept and the groundwork Paradox has created this game is propped up on its modding community, Those guys building assets and mods in the workshop is truly what makes this game great.*IMPORTANT*This game is will require heavy modding as you go deeper and try to build more complex non basic cities.

You caninvest a few hours in a small city with the standard game, or you can play with DLCsand mods. Then it's more like a couple hundred hours.The DLCs are in my opinion quite well thought out and if you really want to seriouslybuild cities, they should be worth the money to you. (My favorites are Natural Disasters,Mass Transit and Industries, the others I bought in a sale).In terms of modding and community, Cities: Skylines couldn't be more distinctive.The Steam Workshop is full of buildings, mods, shaders, scenarios, props and much more,so it can take hours to put together a nice collection. However, it should be notedthat modding goes on the RAM. With 300-500 props (which you can sometimes have in it to build beautiful) 16 GB can quickly buckle in the loading screen.The difficulty level definitely increases with larger cities. Especially when it comes to traffic,Cities: Skylines has a very ""interesting"" system where, for example, a car likes to switch to the right-turn lane 5 kilometers before the intersection. You can spend hours trying to solve the huge traffic jams that can form anywhere.The graphics don't leave much to be desired either, even though the game is now over 7 years old, you can still marvel at the huge cities and skylines and if that'snot enough, there are various shaders that make the whole thing a bit more beautiful.Overall, the game is for me one of the best construction games currently available onthe gaming market. I have spent hours with this game and will continue to do so.It's definitely worth it!Thanks for reading, leave a thumbs up or a price if you liked it or if it was helpful :D"

Not a huge fan of DLC system; in my opinion there are too many of them, some of which are a bit too side-tracking.  Limitless possibilities make me spend hours upon hours in a row.  Game allows to build your city in a variety of ways -- some districts can focus on efficiency, others on aesthetics, and some can even be a nice mix of both.

Out of all the ""good"" city-builder games out there, Skylines is one of the best.But...I feel a real disconnect between the base gameplay and the creativity that this game has to offer. Cities: Skylines has an enormous amount of potential creativity that the player can take advantage of, but in the case of some of the buildings, and especially for the HUGE amount of DLC this game has, it's hard to effectively use that creativity in making a beautiful city.For example: Imagine you have 200,000 ""money"" from taxes or whatnot. You could, theoretically, use that amount of cash to build a subway system, which'll only make you, say, 2,000 ""money"" a week. On the other hand, you could use up those 200,000 bills to build an office block, which'll make you 20,000 ""money"" a week.It's much more efficient and financially stable to just keep building houses and businesses around your city than to go ham and release your creativity by making something more challenging or abstract. Why build airports, bus stops, harbors, or other buildings that spice up your city, when you could be making cash-over-hand by using that money elsewhere? Hell, there's really nothing stopping you from making the entire map an enormous megalopolis of the basic bread-and-butter house and workplace, and outside of the vague ""happiness meter"" in the bottom right, there's really nothing that'll force you to make a beautiful city instead of a bunch of squared-in buildings and apartment blocks.Cities: Skylines is fun. It's fun because of the creativity it offers to the player. But because there's really more incentive to -not- be creative, and just build the bare minimum, it's difficult to find a balance between enjoying yourself, and doing what's pragmatic.Maybe it's just me. Any tips?"

The first third of my play time was vanilla without mods and DLC; just the base game itself is great. The second third I finally got some quality life DLCs, they add great assets that IMO should be included into the base game at this point. The final third of play time I have added mods and the game is at its best for me. My main complaint and it seems to be a popular complaint is the vehicles don't use the lanes properly. So be prepared to get frustrated with that. (hence the need for some mods). This game also is very trial by fire and has a need to rely on the community to help get past learning curves.

And was overwhelmed by the massive lag it has because of my old computer after that I uninstalled. Then I started playing again on 2018 after i got my new Laptop. Soon after that, got bored and left the game again. And finally on 2022 I came back, loved the game ever since. Back then I was using crack to play because I don't have money, I don't want to buy games. Now that I am in University able to have my own income I can buy anything I want, including this game. I have been planning to create airports like gigantic Airports since the first release of this game. But there was no any, and finally with the new DLC comes out it motivates me to create beautiful looking city. This game keeps improving overtime even though it has been 7 years of age. Supported by the modding community and the general community. Honestly Cities Skylines has one of the best communities I have ever interacted with. It's different from other games. In here 90% chance of someone that you met in the community it's either a Genius or VERY Genius. The knowledge and theory that they have is not just Game Theory. It's basically applied in the real world. Like for example, of how buildings cannot be put directly in a shore because of low soil, and how an airstrip could impact the planes, and you can't put high/skyscraper buildings within radius of 20km close to Airport. In reality those theories doesn't apply in the game because the game just follow according to the programming. But if you prefer on realism you can do so.Really reccomended game!"

For a game with as many purchasable downloads as this game you would think they would improve the game over time with updates and release a new version after 5 years.Unfortunately this is not the case. I would happily pay $50 for an updated version 2 of this game that improves upon the original but I can't fault anyone that wants to spend $30 or less on this game and see if you like it. I liked it. Then I downloaded mods to make it better.Then I realized I am putting up with issues they should have fixed a long time ago.Coming to a game years and years after the fact, for a game as loved by a community as this one is, you would think it would be a smooth experience, but it is not.  It is also not a bad game.  This is a difficult review because it has great bones and my frustration is that it isn't better and they don't have a better game to buy.  So I stopped playing and I will wait till they launch a proper version 2. Other sim games will get my money here and there until they launch the version 2, because I think version 2 will be great, but this one just has too many issues the deeper you get involved in playing it.You can either put up with all those issues like some do, or you can just be thankful for the time you spent for as long as you did.I am grateful for the time I spent. Also, this game in many ways can become more of a traffic simulator than a city simulator, and that is a large part of the issue of them not updating the game over time, despite mods being able to help with that aspect of the game.I am not knocking on the traffic mods, or the people that enjoy designing around traffic.  I am saying that it should be easier to manipulate those things out of the box.  You should have the better controls without the need for the mods. The traffic can be a fun part of the game but it shouldn't become such a mountain having to download mods that give you specific capabilities like easy on and off ramp configurations, or even just building straight roads and such.   Or the madness with needing a mod to make turning lanes so the AI of the cars makes the traffic flow better.I also see in youtube content this refference to lane geometry or lane math, where you have to downgrade a 3 lane road to 2 lanes before an on ramp, so the on ramp is that ""third lane"" and everyone merges automatically.  If you do this then your road likes like a hot mess cause the two lane section is narrower for a section of this main highway or road.  It should have a merging section.  It should go from 3 lanes to 3 lanes plus a merge section.  Then back down to 3 lanes after enough merge section.  The road should be temporarily WIDER, not more narrow. This is the type of absurdity you need to get to for traffic to not have bad AI jams, and yet 7 years after launch and this isn't fixed, nor is a new version 2 game with better traffic and road options on the market. Unfortunate."

5393,Ghoes,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199242417992/,1,,1,92.7,March,"12,",28,0,1,"City Skylines is a building simulation game that focuses on area zoning, road and path placements, public services, public transportation, taxes, and policies. City Skylines encourages players to plan out their cities and meticulously build roads and buildings. Players will have to control the demand for residential, commercial, and industrial zones as this will grow your city.  Residents will require essential services such as electricity, clean flowing water, sewage treatment, and trash collection. Players will also need to provide a police department, a fire department, healthcare, education, leisure, and public transportation. With a limited budget to spend growing the city you will have to provide these services and ensure that they are effective. Players can choose and construct their own industrial areas such as crop and forestry harvesting, and ore and oil extraction. Players can also build different parks like zoos, aquariums, and theme parks (with the parks DLC). The most difficult part of this game is to control the increases in population and the increase in traffic as cities grow. Players will need to construct new highways, complex intersections, and junctions to ensure traffic flows smoothly throughout their cities. Public transportation will also play a vital role in reducing traffic and congestion on roads. There are buses, metro, monorail, train, boat, and airplane facilities available for players to create transportation routes. If public transport routes are efficient, vehicle traffic can be reduced significantly. City Skylines is a and is a well-rounded game and I can see that developers put effort into this project. I can advocate and say many remarkable things about this game but there are a few issues I need to address\The only thing I can say is that I used to love this game, it's a relaxing city sim but there is a problem with all the add-ons for the game. Old features got removed and placed into new DLCs which they want you now to buy for a total of just over $250. The add-ons are what make this game incredible, but for the price, some can argue that it is not worth it. Overall, this game is an amazing way to spend your free time as 6 hours can feel like 30 minutes when you play the game. However, you will have to consider the expensive add-ons to experience this game fully."

Anyone with the knowledge of programming can make a mod and this is the strong point for this game. Since it's a simulation game. Mods, assets, etc. Second, in respect to the first, is the workshop. There are many modders and creators that improve the gaming experience. There are mods that change the game into an engineering software. Third, this is for rich and poor at the same time. You kind of need a powerful device with a powerful CPU. In the other hand, this game downloads 20 MB of update and patches 5 GB of the game. I mean, pros and cons! There are some disadvantages that can be ignored for the reasons I'll tell. This game has no optimization. The graphics, the original graphics of the game, doesn't require a powerful GPU. Yet, you are gonna need a good CPU 'cause of the amount of particles. This can be ignored since there is a very good mod called FPS Booster that'll do the job.You are gonna need to but the dlcs, many many dlcs. This can't be ignored but you can buy the DLCs at sales. And they are kinda cheap. So, thank you publisher!I've spent many hours. Using my creativity and imagination to design a city. Used my brain to solve the problems you WILL encounter."

It is far superior to Sim City which I played for years. I enjoyed it a lot at first and renewed expectations with each new release, but I became increasingly frustrated with it until I at last gave it up. There was a gap of several years until I discovered CS. To some extent I am having the same experience with CS. The difference is I enjoy it a lot more and the mod and asset makers make it a much better experience. I'm still frustrated with it but at a much lower level. I wish they could improve the way traffic chooses routes and lanes. They could make the responses to service calls more practical. There are a few other things. But it is still a lot of fun. There is no end to its creative possibilities. It is by far my favorite computer pastime. Four point nine stars."

The standard of official DLC has been strong throughout the life of the game, though the Airports DLC does seem to make cargo airports a very poor second in comparison with passenger airports, as you have to build a top level passenger airport before getting access to the cargo airport. This is the only disappointment I have experienced with the game, but there is a wealth of cargo airport lots and props that have been created by players prior to Airports that can be built and function without that DLC. The range and amount of player created content is vast, and there are some extremely talented mod creators out there who have taken the game to levels I wouldn't have believed possible before exploring the workshop. A brilliant game and massively supported by the player community. Five Stars all the way for me."

My son got this game for Christmas in 2022 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories."

Somtimes I do not know how to figure it out and many times I have all school but yet many store or other workplace demand higher education. I often stumble on I lack on resource to my factory so my store suffer with it. I wish there was a mod in game that allowed to choose if you need more trucks and solve traffick jams. Like auto reset so the game solve my isse or give me a hint what to solve. If it need to place a road here or there if not just reset the cars/trucks. Im aware there is mods but somtimes there are things that should exist in games and might be some players dont know or cant download mods."

But this game made me love every aspect of managing a city. You really end up building more of a region or area with several towns, and it's been a blast setting up districts and taxing each differently. Absolutely recommend if you love city sims.The DLCs only make this game better, but I would wait for a good sale as they're usually 50% off. Skip all the content creator packs (unless you make content), and just grab the main ones such as Industries, Mass Transit, Green Cities, & After Hours. Campuses, Concerts, & Snowfall are just fun to mix things up every once and awhile."

I used to use Sim City 4 Deluxe edition to fill that city-builder itch, but this definitely surpasses that by far. If you are into city planning/road design this game can leave you playing for a long while. Unfortunately, it is one of the common paradox cases of, you need some of the DLC for the game to really be good, and there are also a lot of mods that feel almost necessary after you start to recognize the flaws in the game. My four absolutely necessary mods would be TMPE, which you can configure to have vehicles use more than a SINGLE lane on a  2+ lane road, real time, which changes the Civilian AI to actually run on a realistic schedule rather than spending two weeks in traffic,  and then road anarchy + move it, so you have better control of your road placement."

After quickly gripping the basics of the game I became addicted. I loved the experience on the xbox platform for pc but I looked at some content creators and kept wondering why they had more features than I did on the gamepass version. Mods and dlcs. So naturally I went over to  and got myself the game for steam and a bunch of dlcs for a very cheap price, way better than on steam, and never looked back. The experience is much better on steam and since I have poured my hours into crafting beautiful cities. I played the old SimCity's when I was little and even spent quite a bit of time on SimCity 2013 despite its shortcomings, but this game just takes all the negatives of that game and improves in just about every way.

5695,Edd McMuffin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eddmcmuffin/,1,,1,470.8,October,"21,",187,0,1,"City builder games just kind of work for me. I don't like fiction. I find it to be very disturbing. If you ask me, characters are for bad characters. I don't do characters. I thought that Microsoft Flight Simulator would've worked for me, but I'd rather get a private pilot certificate and actually fly than play that game. I liked SimCity 3000 and 4 when I was younger, but Cities: Skylines hits the right notes for me with its focus on community and modding. I do feel as though it has run its course, though. Colossal Order, the developer of Cities: Skylines, has a new project in the works. Only time will what it is. Colossal Order has made a sensible public statement that it will not update the engine to Cities: Skylines. From what I've seen, the Unity that existed when this game was in development and the Unity that now exists are very different. Also, Cities: Skylines had a low budget. It was publicly stated that the budget of the later expansions were the budget of the base game prior to launch. Colossal Order is now at nearly 30 employees and I can't wait to see what it'll come up with next.If you're like me, then you want all the mods and all the assets for Cities: Skylines. Your game won't work that way, though. Be selective in what you subscribe to and respect your system's hardware configuration.I like the game, but I feel that it could be so much more. A mod was being worked on 5 or 6 years ago to expand the 4x4 zoning implementation. That mod was never released. Colossal Order has hired modders who worked on this game, including the modder who was working on the mod to expand the 4x4 zoning implementation.I have mixed feelings about this game. For me, this is the game that keeps on giving because people keep churning out great content for it. It was riding SimCity 2013's coattails, though. It's a blatant copy of SimCity 2013. Was legal action ever threatened? I have no idea.Ultimately, I like this game. I want to see what the next one is, though."

I re downloaded Cities Skylines on the 23rd and guess what, still the same unplayable mess. However I have learnt the actual issue.I recently found out that each DLC requires an extra gigabyte of RAM ontop of the minimum 8 gigabytes required to run the base game. How does Paradox expect people to play their games and buy their DLC's if they can't optimise their games properly. Yet they still charge full price for their poorly made DLC's, it's unbelievable. When Cities Skylines came out, it was a masterpiece. Closing in on 8 years later, Paradox is a victim to the same situation every gaming company ends up. They are literally the new EA and Ubisoft, releasing 5 DLC every year, even if the content should be base game, it's DLC.F*** Paradox Interactive.[Original Review, 5th of October 2021]One of my most favourite games on steam. Unfortunately the game cannot handle much assets from the workshop.It took me 10 minute just for the game to load to the menu because the game would be unresponsive. THEN! I would create a new game, the loading for a save is probably the most tedious and slow thing I've ever experienced. For a game that I spent 60 Dollars on I expect to run properly. I don't have that much mods, but the game can barely run 5 of them AT ONCE!It's extremely disappointing considering I have a beast of a computer. It seems I can't have much assets either, or else the loading time will take 6 hours and will most likely crash within 5 minutes :/I may have 129 hours on this game, but that was when it ran like a normal game. All this began around the middle of 2020. Then I just gave up, logged back on in July 2021, still the same, and now I'm back. Guess what? STILL THE SAME!!!I cannot even fathom or describe how angry I am when it doesn't work. I know it's not my computer, so get that out your head. I have enough RAM, I have 1200 gigs of storage. What's the problem Paradox? Because it's hella annoying having to put up with this. I even purchased a couple DLC's for A LOT of money in 2019. I literally saved for ages.Oh and by the way. No I cannot refund the game, games cannot be refunded if you've played a certain amount of it.All I can say is, I don't recommend this game, but I also do."

The game includes easy to use modding tools that allow anyone to create and upload their own content to the Steam Workshop.The options available to the player allow for realistic cities with well-developed infrastructure or functional monstrosities that are more about efficiency than aesthetics. There's something very innovative about hydroelectric facilities powered by human waste. Some players also like to create highly detailed dioramas of areas or scenes, while others re-create real-life intersections that they upload to the workshop for players to use in their cities.I'd recommend Cities Skylines to anyone looking for an interesting city builder without any pressure or particular difficulty, especially at the price it can drop to during sales. There are 9 main DLCs which add interesting features and allow systems in the base game to be expanded, but they certainly aren't necessary. The base game alone does feel complete. I would suggest starting with the base game to learn the basic mechanics before adding extra features and systems with DLC.Performance-wise, the game runs well on my aging PC (i7 4790k, GTX 970 & 16GB DDR3 RAM) with all 9 DLCs and around 600 mods/assets. I used to have only 8GB of RAM, and the upgrade to 16GB had an immediate and significant impact on performance."

5799,zblox164,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zblox164/,2,,1,270.9,August,"26,",79,0,1,"OVERVIEWCities Skylines is one of my favorite games of all time. The depth in which the game delivers makes it feel as if you're actually designing a city in the real world. The game is somewhat complex to start off, however once you learn how to play, everything is second nature. I have designed many cities, and each time, I will end up learning how to manage something a bit better whether that is traffic flow or something else. Sometimes, you can tell the traffic isn't as accurate as it could be, but for the most part it's pretty good. This is one of the only things I can think of that I personally don't like about the game (although this can easily be fixed with a mod). I never find myself becoming bored/burnt out by the game and can spend hours at one time working on one city (assuming I have the time to).MODS/ASSETSOne of the main reasons I still am playing this game is because of the massive library of mods and custom assets. This allows for even more diverse cities to be created within this game. I use hundreds of custom assets and dozens of mods to make my cities more customised to my liking. The only down side to using a large amount of custom assets/mods is you need a fast PC to run them all. Although if you have a decent PC, you can add a lot of content without spending money on DLC (although you cannot add extra game play this way just adds assets and mods).DLCI have almost every DLC pack and can say I do not regret any of them. The only one I would not recommend as much is sunset harbor. To me it doesn't add as much as it could've for what you pay for but it still isn't bad. By far, my personal favorite DLC pack is mass transit. I enjoy fixing traffic on roads and enjoy making it easier for citizens to get around my cities in other various ways. Mass transit expands that game play even further than already given in the base game.  The other notable packs I have enjoyed the most are green cities and the campus pack but every other DLC pack are still worth getting in my opinion.Overall, great game - best city builder of all time in my opinion."

I am still giving it a positive review, because I can appreciate that it is the pinnacle of its subgenre, well executed and polished to a high shine, but for a genre I do not seem like.I like city building games like the old Sierra titles, where goals are pretty concrete, and there are eventually pretty clear ways to optimize a city. I like learning curves, I like tinkering, I like complex systems, but I also like eventually solving problems. In Cities: Skylines you never really solve problems for good, you just improve things here and there, and as the city grows those problems resurface. There is no one way to optimize, just many small ways to improve. You may have goals when you start a map, but ultimately its not really about a campaign, its about making the city that is the ""best"" it can be on the constraints of the map you have.What I am trying to say is that I like puzzles, and Cities: Skylines is a sandbox. Its a very good sandbox, a very pretty, complex, well integrated sandbox, but I simply lack the motivation to properly finish any map. I want to solve the problem of the map and move on and this is just not that sort of game. You return again and again to the same city, to the same map, growing it and improving it over many play sessions. If you are like me, you will not enjoy this game. However, if you like a sandbox and think growing a city is its own reward, and that sort of things interests you, Cities: Skylines is the best of its kind."

Honestly, there are so many factors that play in making your city functional and keeping your civilians content. I was also really suprised at the amount of detail that went into this game. If you zoom in really far, you can see people walking around and cars driving around, but each building has a unique style and a different name. I've been playing this game for quite a while now and haven't experienced any bugs that affected the gameplay."

No other game of this kind can compete with it.  It is extremely detailed! Basically every logical thing was thought of and added by the developers.  The graphics are pretty good. It's not very important for this kind of game; but still, it looks nice. Map size is huge! You can spend over a hundred hours easily to build a single city. With mods, it's even bigger! It comes included with a map, asset, theme, and scenario editor allowing you to easily create your own custom content.  Modding support is simply the best! There are 10's of thousands of mods to pick from, allowing you to completely customize your city however you want, as well as adding new ways to play.  The developers are continuing to support the game even after 6 years. The music is great and there is a good selection to choose from and listen to while you build your dream city. Plus, radio station DLC's can be purchased adding even more great music to the game.  The game does require a beefy system to maintain playability. The larger your city becomes, the worse it gets. For myself, Playing with an RTX 3080, Ryzen 7 5800x and 32Gb of RAM, I get around 30fps in my city with 100k population. Optimization could definitely be better.  There is a small amount of tutorials in game. Given it's great detail, it can take awhile for new players to learn how everything works.  DLC's have gotten out of hand over the years. There are so many DLC's, that for new players it's hard to know which is even worth buying. Some of them are great and worth your consideration, others are just nearly useless and a waste of money. Not to mention, you can download mods that make some DLC content pointless.Overall, it's simply the best city building/city simulation game currently on the market. Given the nearly endless amount of mods, there is always ways to build your city better, bigger and more detailed. If you love these kind of games, this one tops them all. I highly recommend the game!! Your money will be well spent."

I was a Sim City Puritan, even when they released their last Sim City (which was pleasing to look at, nice to play for most part but very limited in capacity tbh). It took me few years after released of this game to get into it, with all the DLCs, Content Creator packs (Which is a great initiative, kudos to Paradox for introducing and allowing this) and I am blown away with how wonderful this game is, and how difficult and challenging it can be too. I love the dynamics of the game with everything that we do down to the granule decisions and implication that comes with it. I have no complain tbh, I wish for more contents though. More is good!I really was thinking if would be great if yall could come up with some political systems to this game.. that would be groundbreaking. Socialism, Capitalism, etc. and see how it affects city building and the people's reactions."

This game is great if you love creation and city planning. The base game with no mods is eh, but with DLC and mods it's 100% worth putting time into. From figuring out traffic problems to zoning commercial and residential areas, this is a great city planning game. I tell people who are interested that basically you need a few DLCs from the start. I purchased the game and quickly discovered the workshop and DLCs. Paradox has not failed on DLC content, it's worth it every time and they deserve full price for them. The workshop is fantastic with user created content and a constant addition of new workshop mods. My entire game is not stock at all, almost every DLC and thousands of mods installed. Of course with that brings lag. I completely understand the lag and don't blame the game at all. I have a Intel i5-9600k and a RTX2070 and it is a struggle as you build on. Overall great game and I always look towards to new content from Paradox."

Now, I have a 4 year old PC and I can even still run this game at almost max settings so it is good for almost any PC to play. 50 hours in but if it has counted what I've watched as well the number would be in the hundreds.If you are playing this game without the Paradox hell of DLC, make sure you get mods! Mods are some of the only ways to fix traffic which will almost always be a headache. Just recently I have been able to get DLC and the game is just so much better. Would definitely recommend the park DLC!This game definitely deserves a 10/10 especially after I went and read some other reviews. The workshop content is amazing and if you look hard enough online, the DLC really isnt too expensive.Can't wait to get back to my 16% traffic hellhole!"

But having owned base DLC's on Origin store I was unsuccessful in transferring them over to my steam base copy game.. Over $100 of DLC, gone in cyber space. When I reached out to EA they were of no help, and when I reached out to Paradox - they told me since Steam didn't get their cut of the sale made to EA Origin for the DLC's I would be unable to transfer them over. I was told to ""wait for a sale"" . There's where I draw the line. REFUND. I will wait for Cities Skylines 2 - if there is one within the next 5 years. Everything about this game is great, but the one thing they are lacking that SimCity got it right is the multiplayer.. Yes, in SimCity, you used to be able to sell neighboring players cities your excess utilities.. You could also buy utilities from your neighbor if say you didn't want to build landfills and deal with all the polution that's involved. This essentially created an online economy, and it was addictive. CS completely lacks that. Tens of millions of dollars and 6 years later, there is still no multiplayer. However, every DLC you could probably think of that you would need and most you wouldn't need - are there. My advice is to wait for sale with this game. There are rumors that a CS 2 is in the works and will be announced soon. Lastly, shame on you paradox for not linking my Origin DLC's to my paradox account when I logged in to CS in 2019 and then telling me to ""wait for a sale"" just to rebuy them all over again."

Robert Oppenheimer,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199006011831/,1,,1,14.6,April,"23,",64,0,1,"This game saved my life.I am 76.My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand... the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with... The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 minutes to this game, long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as."
6059,Xes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bazooka101/,1,,1,208.5,April,"23,",917,0,1,"If you loved any of the older city builders such as Sim City 2000 or Sim City 4, you will absolutely adore this game. Colossal Order did something that EA could not; recreate the joy of it's ancestors. With a well-designed base-game and amazing mod-support (including workshop) that allows you to add functionality, depth and visual design to your city at will. Hell, you can even design your own buildings and assets with the Asset Creator.However, it is not without it's flaws. The main downside to playing this game is how... ""empty"" the base game is. Granted, for only $20, the game is more than worth it's price; but in order to have access to a lot of the more in-depth (IMO more fun) aspects of the game, you have to shell out a good bit to get access the main DLC. However, they are well worth it if you find yourself enjoying the vanilla experience. Which leads onto my next talking-point: Mods.Mods are absolutely a godsend for this game. The unmodded experience has a lot of little peeves you'll find that can make the game feel restricted and/or rather annoying to play. Sometimes snapping curved roads to each other can be troublesome, or you accessing city info is a little tedious to do, or perhaps you don't want to have to manually destroy abandoned buildings. And they're all super easy to install since it all goes through the workshop. Subscribe to what you want, enable it in-game with the Content Manager and you're all set. My all time recommended mods would be TM:PE (which you can better control traffic issues), Move It! (move things however you want), and Loading Screen Mod (which improves load times and helps find errors in mods). I recommend watching videos or reading some ""Best Mod"" articles to find out some very helpful mods to create a better experience for you.Gameplay is a lot like many city builders so I won't elaborate too much. You start out in a empty city with nothing more than a connection to a highway. You'll start building the framework of your city with roads, securing a water source and creating electricity. Once that has been established, you'll zone for citizens, shops and industrial areas to bring people in. As you begin growing, you start unlocking new city services and expand upon existing services. The main goal is to make a city that people want to join and expand while keeping them happy while they're here.Graphics is not the greatest by far, but you can find mods that can enhance color and lighting that can make the game look gorgeous despite the limitations of the engine, Assets can also go far into creating a stylized look for your city. Once again, I would recommend watching some videos to find some that'll cater to you.Overall, if you loved any of the Sim City and/or City Building games, I would HIGHLY recommend this game as it is the epitome of city building games at the moment. Give it a try with the vanilla game (only $20) and I doubt you'll be disappointed."

Maximum 9 tiles - each tile is around 2 km long - or 25 or 81 tiles with mods, which you may not fill - especially with 81 tiles active - in full due to a game limit on the number of road and buildings.- Some performance and stability issues, even on empty maps.- Mod management tool is poor. Mods are activated globally instead of a per map basis, and you cannot see which mods are in use in any specific save.- Very poor transit management tools.Summary: If you are looking for city management game this is the best of the market, not that there is much competition besides the venerable but old and 2D SimCity 4. Rating: 9/10."

Opening the game brings you to a user-friendly map selection screen, followed by a well designed interface for actually playing it. As a new player, I can remember being a little daunted at how many icons there are to play with, but the game does a great job of building up the complexity little by little to help you learn the all ins and outs. The aim of the game is very simple - to build a megalopolis city. Getting there, however, can be quite the creative challenge!The music feels well designed to keep the player's attention focused, swelling and fading in a way that really helps me feel like I've built something to be proud of. The sound effects also are well themed, even if the Chirper (sort of like Twitter for the sims that live in the city) can get annoying. Thankfully, you can turn Chirper's auto-open off... just remember to check it from time to time because this is where sims will alert you to things like water/sewage or electricity shortages before they become major problems!The base game itself has countless hours of replay value, even without all the many DLCs that Paradox have released. I own many of them, but not all, deciding to tailor my game playing experience to my own interests. This chopping and choosing has not led to any faults in the running of the game at all, but it does occasionally mean I don't have certain public transport systems or road types. First world problems, much. In addition to several DLCs, there is a huge modding community here on Steam that have worked tirelessly to produce different kinds of junctions, building assets, and construction tools that really do let you do whatever you want. It's kind of intoxicating, really. Basically, if you want a relaxing game to lose yourself in and flex your creativity, this game is for you! There's no combat or major competition with the AI (unless you count controlling crazy lane changing as combat... I wouldn't blame you if you did) and there are some scenarios with certain win conditions if sandbox mode isn't your thing. Cannot recommend this  game enough!"

Read the entire review if you want to hear the full story.Pros- •Great simulation as far as demand for different zones, economics, etc.•Graphics for this game are actually pretty impressive considering the release date for this game. In my opinion, the  graphics can still look very good even when considering modern games.•Runs pretty decently on most hardware if you are not building ridiculously large or complex cities.•Awesome water physics: playing around with the water physics is fun.•Some of the DLCs add some pretty neat stuff (I will mention the DLCs in the Cons.)•I got this game for about 8 dollars and you can get good deals pretty often for this game (more about pricing in the cons.)Cons-• This game should cost less because of the DLCs. The additional content for this game makes up most of this game and it does not really make sense to pay $30 for the game just to have to pay $209.75 to get all of the DLC. If I did not know this game was published by paradox I would think that it was published by EA.I hope this helps anybody reading this.Edit- this game has some decent mods. Just do not expect the mods to be able to replace the DLCs."

The base game alone has so much content it's staggering and that is before you even venture to the Steam Workshop and check out the incredible work modders have done. Between mods and the base game the potential time suck here is infinite, it really is a must have for any city sim fan and I have seen this on sale for next to nothing.

Serviceable city builder with some limitations which may be fixable with mods, but you really shouldn't have to mod to solve fundamental annoyances.  For one, the lack of detailed, easily-accessible information is annoying once your cities grow large.  My revenues fluctuate wildly once my city gets big-- going from losing funds one minute to making $60k+ the next with no logical explanation.  The economics of the game need some work.  At one point, my commercial demand could not be satisfied for some reason.  It was just wonky.There are some things that are just out of whack and it is very difficult to determine what is going on.  Would like to see very detailed data by district to include granular economic details.Also, the garbage and dead people collection gets stupid.  Instead of having ""dumps"" as buildings, it should be an area similar to Sim City that can be covered, or have an option to export trash to another city.  You simply cannot keep up."

I bought the DLCs, and a lot of people are complaining about it because it's like making the game ""pay-to-play"" but with thousands of mods available in the workshop, the DLCs are optional. The only difference is that sometimes, when you have to download some mods, you have to download a whole pack because one doesn't function without the others.The game will always keep you busy with a lot of things to manage. It's a more complex but realistic city building game than SimCity or CityVille because of the traffic, electricity, water, garbage, employment, and education systems. There is so much room for creativity when it comes to city design and theme. However, I wouldn't say it's worth $15, or in my currency, Php750. Wait for the sale, and I'd say around Php180 or $4 should be the ceiling price"

I've been playing it for 500h now and this is my opinion on it.Let me start with the positive aspects of Cities Skylines.The game is very addictive and fun without any modifications that you have to add. The Developers are constantly interacting with the community and posting new videos about user made content. It has a large variety of DLCs to chose from that add new features and options to improve your city. The best part of this game and the main reason that made me play it for so long is the awesome modding community that puts out new content every single day. The installation of these addons is extremely easy. You just go to the workshop, select the mod you want and click subscribe. All of these modifications are freeware.Unlike the freeware mods that the community creates, Paradox's DLCs are mostly payware with 2 exceptions and the only thing they add is basic features that the game should have in the first place. I recommend Cities Skylines mostly because I adore the modding community and the different content they put out every single day. Paradox on the other hand doesn't know how to make good and useful content in form of DLCs that is worth the money."

Without mods or DLC, the game allows you to construct a functional cities that have logical demands with straight forward solutions. The workshop has a large number of mods that can further this playing experience, allowing for new settings or infrastructure to be built in your city. I've never bought any of the official DLC but it looks pretty cool, and they usually provide a free update when releasing new DLC, which adds some features in-line with the DLC release, which I've found to be pretty neat.There can be some annoying problems that crop up in cities that become annoying to solve (death waves, not enough workers, etc.), although these can be solvable. I find that when the city reaches the max size limit, the game becomes a bit boring. You can always try to unlock all the monuments (or whatever they're called), but I've never found the motivation to do so.9/10 Highly recommend"

There is a lot to learn here about how people imagine cities and sociotechnical systems. The traffic simulator in this game is truly top notch. Saying that one might enjoy managing traffic for fun sounds weird when you say it out loud, but the core of one's experience here is a control fantasy. I have used this in a teaching context without much success except when I find a student readily willing to sink 30 hours into the game. You won't learn much in the first few hours, and you learn by making a lot of mistakes. But it's meditative to learn how to roll with the punches provided in random disaster simulation, and accept that there are lots of things about your city that you can't reasonably control."

It is very satisfying to keep expanding more and more and manage the several tasks from sewage, road traffic and demand for certain zone types just to name a few. You always got something to do and there is not an immediate danger if you mess up things, so you can usually always recover from bad decisions with time. The game is highly customizable letting you have a lot of freedom building the city the way you see its most efficient as well as the little details such as renaming buildings, roads and so on. Not to mention the mod support in the steam workshop, letting you build all sorts of themes for you cities.For me most of the fun is in the beginning when you're managing a somewhat small city. when I get a big one I feel lazy and lose a bit of interest, But that depends from person to person.Overall I like this game and would recommend, its nice to try to build your own version of your home city."

I step back and try other games but nothing tops the functionality and dare I say ""simplicity"" of this game. Compared to something like Simcity and other building games, this one definitely takes the cake with the way you're able to expand. They incorporated all the best parts of city building without making super realistic with politics and whatnot. A need to try for anyone that likes city building or even just basic management.p.s it's pretty much a road building simulator XD"

Reminds me of the old Rush Hour pack in Sim City 4 which I loved and it's expanded so far beyond it.  This game is much closer to the Sim City 5 that I was hoping for instead of the one that we got.  The only suggestion I have for developers is that they consider increasing some of the building limits for people with systems that can support it.  My very first major city that I started and I actually hit both the building limit and the node (Streets) limit.  Granted, the city was huge, but it limited it on adding a new building or adding a new sidewalk/path to my already huge city.  I understand the reason for the limits, but I think now that the game is several years old and computer CPU and GPU have advanced even further, it's time to expand on those limits a little more.  But all in all, I absolutely love this game."

Design a city with only straight roads, or make one that is all curved roads. This game can be geared to either keeping the city small with a more rural feel, or one can urbanize the entire map.All that said, a few things:- This game at times devolves into Traffic Simulator: Skylines.- Got a hospital right next to a building or house with a sick person? No problem! We will send an ambulance from the hospital across the map!Strongly recommend mods if one plans to play."

I don't have much to say that other reviews haven't said bu here is my full Review; When I heard of this game on youtube I was very intrigued by it, but i was worried that my s**t laptop wouldn't be able to run it, my laptop didn't even meet minimum requirements which was very disappointing. However, I took a leap of faith with my money and bought it. To my surprise it ran decently. I played for hours with no DLC before it got somewhat boring, so i bought Mass Transit DLC (Best DLC for beginners). The only negative thing i have to say about the game is that sometimes when I started the game up it would crash, it also takes an eternity to load and exit your city. In conclusion, I would definitely buy this game, as long as you are ready to spend more money for DLC, and if you don't have a PC from the 90's."

6428,? yes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/timzkii/,1,,1,144.4,October,"19,",21,0,1,"Awesome game. Your city is developing all the time, which requires you to find creative new ways to regulate the traffic and other services. It's a real challenge to build your 'perfect city', with a smooth traffic network, residential areas, parks, public services (healthcare, schools) and emergency services (police, firefighters). There are many options with building infrastructure. You can choose the amount of lanes, whether your road features grass or trees, one way or two way road, etc.The maps in the game have become 'unlimited' by the additional workshop maps, so you can develop a new area every time. Tip: If you start building your dream city, don't start building too big. The expenses will become too high and your city won't be profitable and therefore a failure."

6464,Kinetic1110,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198313377681/,1,,1,155.2,September,"19,",77,0,1,"I grew up playing SimCity4 on my iPad, and was obsessed with city-builders, but couldn't find a good one after I was done with SC4. But when I started watching Cities Skylines play-throughs it really peaked my interest. I'm going to be honest, I pirated this game at first. But after playing it for a few weeks, I was hooked and had to buy it.    This game can be a little demanding, but it's beautiful. I remember spending hours just going through the lighting and shading settings. I have no clue how they can make that game run on a GTX960 2GB at 60fps (this was at 1440p btw). But this game isn't just pretty to look at, it's very engaging on a mechanical level.   The amount of control you have over your city is almost overwhelming. You could spend hours just setting up bus routes or developing industrial zones. When I first started getting into the game, I was hit with a rush of excitement seeing everything that I could unlock, develop, and tweak. I would get lost in it for hours and during one busy weekend I played for about 16 hours. And if you ever get bored of the base game, the expansions are affordable and most of them are very much worth it.   Some of them I would consider necessary to enjoy the game. Examples are Industries, After Dark, and Mass Transit. I also really enjoyed Park-Life. This game is also a really great value. I bought it with 4 or 5 expansions for only $35 during a sale. That's easily a $60 experience for about half the price. This game was made by a small group of devs, so buying it supports a very dedicated indie-team. If you like sandbox games, you should look into it, and if you enjoy city-builders, you probably already own it.  To sum it all up, this is a wonderful game with a large community and passionate developers. Buy it."

Things I like about this game are:-Seeing the population move around-Modding the game to add more unique looking buildings-Adding DLC that allowed for natural disasters and snow!-I loved messing around with the public travel options!-You can create such chaos by removing random parts of the city.Things that I don't like:-The budget at times can disappear way too quickly (simple solution: have no budget)-Locking some of the buildings feels kinda counterproductive to the growth of the city (Again you can unlock everything in the settings)-I do feel that parts of the game aren't as polished as they could be. E.g. Planes can fly through buildings, why can't people go and sunbathe on the beach or swim in the sea? Overall however I do believe that this game is worth what you pay and more!

Finally a modern city builder that doesn't give a super tiny plot of land (Simcity 2013). Paradox took everything Simcity should have been and added even more to it. User created buildings on the workshop, expanded plots and mods allowing an entire region map to be access able to the player. The road options and road system design is super fun to play with giving more to roads than just a place to put buildings. Also the amount of customization of names is epic! You an rename all roads, buildings, cars, pedestrians, and even a seagull that you see flying around every once in a while! That's not all, the game allows you to zone and name your own districts and set individual policies for each. My only qualm with the game is the DLC prices. Obviously the developers are not our slaves and deserve compensation for their hard work, however when put together DLCs cost way more than the actual game. I can't complain too much as I only payed $29.99 for this game however the expansions cost $204 put together (last time I checked). But I'm just whining about the price. Cities Skylines is a very captivating game for me and has only grown more captivating through each DLC I have been gradually accumulating. Highly Recommend for someone looking for a good city builder or someone to use as a design template for a fictional city to be used in the next DC Superhero-type franchise."

There's a good deal of depth to the infrastructure but not too much - micromanagement of buildings isn't really necessary.The same doesn't apply to traffic though. Once your population reaches about 8,000, the game becomes a traffic management task, as vehicles and pedestrians vie for access to the public highways. A single snarl-up on one side of town can mean a city that's crippled until you get to the bottom of it. Quite often it's something as simple as two stopped buses causing queues (as cars and trucks irritatingly fail to overtake them), but other times it's more systemic. It's a great game, with continual developer and community activity going on. But bear in mind that traffic management ends up being your number one concern quite quickly as the rest of the city fends for itself. If that's not your scene, avoid it. Otherwise, you'll love the puzzle-solving behind every intersection."

Once you get into the getting a lot of workshop material, you start to see the game slow down until it's almost unplayable. This game along with its assets leaks memory as if it was a barrel shot by a sawed-off shotgun. At this rate, I recommend upgrading your RAM to 16gb or 32gb.The game's pretty intuitive, just build a road and grow your city and deal with its problems. Simulation isn't perfect and you would see a lot of questionable things go on in your city, but the developers' willingness to use agents mean that you can see every single individual, their work and their problems.

Mods may be a good help to keep you entertained without dlcWorkshop is awesome and there are tons of additional tools/mods/maps/IRL monuments to help you precisely build; I'd reccomend at least the Expanded map mod which lets you buy all 25 squares rather than just 9. Also maybe Auto bulldoze to prevent you having to manually delete buildings constantly(Serious sanity sanver), also good ones to check out are the extended road upgrade mod, Extra landscaping tools ,precision engineering and the tree brush.

However, the game is somewhat bland out of the box and does not have enough good tools to make the game playable. This is where mods come in, and for the most part, works wonderfully. However, even the best mods dont seem to want to work with eachother and i have dealt with so much frustration between trying to strike a balance between working mods and playability its honestly ridiculous. I have spent so much time wasted on either making mods work, or feeling like they work only to put hours into a city and have it crash.7/10 would recommend as a city builder out of the box3/10 would not recommend as a city builder with mods.

I literally recreated the city I live in right down to the skins for the actual bus network. It looks great it plays great my only gripe would be to say that once your city gets pretty large the fps will tank. I have a fairly decent specced system. R5 2600x 32gb Ram 1660ti and SSDs and it still starts to tank. Worst place for this is at the bus and train stations where I think the CPU struggles to cope with the sheer amount of people as unlike another city builder I wont mention every person in your city has a unique life you can watch them go shopping or to work or school then drive or take public transport home etc.  The good thing is that having a 20-30 fps average doesnt really affect the gameplay on these sorts of games.

Apart from minor lag (bigger city = more lag), it's pretty in-depth. The population might seem a bit low for a big city, but don't worry, it's not a glitch. The population is low because the game simulates every person and vehicle, so if there was a realistic population, your computer would kill itself. You might see the same building over and over again, and if you don't like that you can visit the Steam Workshop to download more assets (vehicles and buildings) or mods (changes the gameplay. Anyways, hope you enjoy your C:S adventure!"
6788,Tarkus,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026930200/,1,,1,308.1,April,"26,",45,0,1,"Since Sim City 4, There has been no better city building game. This game does things that most city sim players thought to be improbable just a decade ago, such as full 3D landscapes and buildings, curved roads, and agent agent based simulation. All of this possible on average consumer grade hardware. The game is well optimized and runs as well as you would expect on the given hardware of every machine I've played it on. Overall the game is pretty CPU and RAM intensive, my current i7-3700@4.2 GHz with 20 GB of ram is noticeably snappier in game and more stable with large amounts of mods compared to my older rigs with only 12 GB. If you like making cool looking cities this is the sim for you.  The modding support from the community has added many attractive assets from different building styles and numerous famous landmarks, and the game renders them with aplomb. At higher internal rendering resolutions (provided again by mods) the game really shines, and works as a great replacement for traditional model making for people without the space or funds to participate in such activities.The simulation part of the game leaves a bit to be desired in terms of depth. Schools and hospitals have a hard limited range that their effects work within, and the traffic simulation makes some agents take the longest paths to work, but this can, once again be fixed with mods. One thing that cant be fixed is the lack of schedule the sims seem to have. This may be a misconception on my part but everything seems to always be open, and no matter how long it takes people to get to work if they get there they get there.Also, I wish the data views were more flexible in terms of what you can use while building, I find the conspicuous lack of charts and graphs hampering to optimization, and the soundtrack is a bit ""meh"" especially compared to the perfection of the Sim City 4 OST. Overall, a solid 8.5/10. The somewhat shallow simulation aspects are more than made up for by the endless design ideas afforded by the massive amount of community created content, made possible by a solid foundation provided by the developers.In a follow-up, I hope to see more time focused on making the simulation part of the game really work on it's own, more charts, graphs, and data to view, less restrictions and more natural looking outcomes when it comes to zoning on uneven terrain, curved roads, and angled intersections, as well as a more powerful road building tool more in line with the Cities in Motion games, and overall more content in general for the experienced city sim player. Lastly, hire Jerry Martin to do the soundtrack, please and thank you :)"

I love the new airports. I cant express how much).The list goes on and on.I recommend checking out my essential mod collection here: With those you'll have a very different - and i hope much more fun - experience with the game.My opinion of the game remains extremely positive.

""Ill just hop on for an hour"" quickly turns into a 6 hour session. This game is extremely realistic (almost to a fault at times) and insanely beautiful. This game is a more realistic version of Sim City. I've logged almost 700 hours so far over a couple years and have loved (almost) every second so far.THINGS YOU MIGHT WANT TO WORRY ABOUT- The vanilla version of the game is a bit bland. DLCs are a must if you want a true city simulation. You also almost have to download mods to be fully emerged in the game, however the mods for this game are REALLY cool and in-depth, so that really isn't an issue .- The FPS for this game is TERRIBLE. Unless you spend thousands of dollars on a gaming PC, you're probably going to be dealing with around 10-30 FPS  at all times depending on the size of your city. (with a 100k population, my game averages around 17). I'm 90% sure that it has to do with how the game is written and not with your computer, because I've had the same performance on a 5 year old PC as I'm now having on a brand new $2,500 computer. On the plus side, there are a couple mods out there that try to help with this, and turning the graphics down help a lot, too. Overall if you don't mind a little lag at times, this doesn't seem to ruin the game. (although it can get extremely annoying)._If you want a traffic sim game, run away. The only unrealistic part of this game is the traffic. Unless it's a New Jersey driver sim, then the AI is extremely stupid. Cars are never in the right lanes and buses never use the bus lanes right which causes massive unnecessary traffic jams and long lines on highway exits because they can't merge right. With that being said, if you have the time, there a re a couple great mods that allow you to switch lane arrows, adjust intersections lights/yields, and force certain lanes of traffic to stay in a certain lane.Overall I LOVE this game, and it kills every other City Sim out there."

No matter how many hospitals, graveyards, misc. healthcare buildings in place, or how well prepared knowing this outbreak will happen, I still end up bankrupt with a negative cash flow and everyone getting sick...  I once had over 5 hospitals plus a dozen clinics spaced in easy access locations throughout the city pre-outbreak and it did nothing.My guess is that I'm missing something, but this is just frustrating and I'm glad I didn't buy it.

Anyway, I think the game is near perfect but I'm sure that's debatable. My main issue is the service vehicles path finding. I really think this needs to be patched. I've tested this in vanilla and with mods (TMPE) with the same results both times. The main issue is that the service vehicles (trash, police, fire, hearses, hospital) seem to go wherever they please. They will even pass buildings that need their help that are right next to them to drive all the way across town to respond to another issue! I see the issue happening once you have around 30k population with multiple pieces of land unlocked. Like as I type this review, I'm following a police car that belongs to the department up North, yet it's patrolling all the way down south at the very beginning of my city. It should stay in it's zone which I was always under the assumption that it was the green circle when you drop a service showing coverage. I would be really appreciated if this got fixed soon. Here's some ideas:-Service vehicles should stay in there zone shown by the green circle when spawned-Make the zones a bit bigger for more coverage rather than have us plop 3 of the same service buildings for a smaller zone-Create checks for the AI: If zone 1 = all vehicles busy then Zone 2 (nearby) respond and so on and so forth. -Path finding for the service vehicles should be updated to take the fastest route rather than taking the shortest or vice versa-When nearing their final destination make it a priority that they get in the right lane so they can quickly pull in and fix the issue and leaveI just find it odd that I have over 50 Police cars, 80 trash trucks, 100 ambulances, and more hearses that I want to count and still have huge spikes of their respecting issues. My city currently goes between 85 and 90% (vanilla, mods about 94%) traffic flow with major road and public transportation networks. Yes, I have schools and no, none of my residential is built on polluted land and no policies are in act that would create a stir up. I get that my city is big (nearing 120k) but the response time of the service vehicles seem sluggish or just non existent. I know I'm not the only one with this issue due to the numerous amounts of threads if you google service vehicle behavior in this game. I really hope one of you devs read this and thank you in advance!"

The tutorial was frustratingly lacking. I didn't know what any of the buttons did, there was no information panel if you hovered over any of them. If you made your way to the electric and water components, they tell you why it's needed, but not how to set anything up. As far as I can tell, there was no undo or delete button, and it said there was a ""customize"" button, but I never found it.

Yes, the base game is pretty good, but the mods this game has thanks to its awesome community is what lifts this game to greater heights. Besides adding extra content like roads or buildings, the best it does, in my opinion, is adding so much customization, that there is almost no city you cannot build.I really recommend this game, but I do have to note the one thing I don't like.What I don't like is the performance (also without mods). Yes it's a simulation game, but the frames could be better. Without mods there really isn't much to write a complaint about but it's not quite the best either, which means if you start adding tonnes of mods the fps can drop quite a bit.But if you really like to customize a lot, but don't mind playing below 60fps, do give it a try!"

Then I heard that there was going to be a board game version and it rekindled my interest. Since then I've played another 70 or 80 hours, bought multiple new expansions and have found where the fun is for me: enjoying the little things rather than the big picture. I was originally more interested in the grand design but this eventually lost its lustre. Now I'm having a lot of fun focusing on small details. I have multiple expansions and mods because as I find myself digging down deeper into the game I also find myself wishing for things that aren't possible in the base game. So now I can build my own parks, have tourism areas, lots more transport possibilities like trams, blimps and monorails, improve the traffic system by toggling traffic lights and designating lanes, create specialised residential/commercial/leisure areas...Basically, if you're happy to buy lots of extra content then you'll find that you can accomplish virtually anything in this game. Planning out a big city is great fun but, for me at least, it's now about creating the opportunity to plan out everything in detail i.e. the little things. I'm having an awesome time on my own custom island map at the moment and cannot recommend Cities: Skylines highly enough."

Unless you use mods.It's pretty obvious that this game is build upon a transport tycoon like management game. Because the city building aspect is lacking in many ways. You can pretty much skip half of the content, you city will still thrive. There is no real challenge on the bigger level and all you do is put down more of the same effects, even if your neighborhoods are maxed out already. I have maxed out my residental zones without placing a single park or similar object.Pollution is meaningless, unless you really build stuff next door to industry. There is no pollution that spreads with wind or ecologic impact on farms etc.It's all very very static and uninspired, except the streets and transport systems.It has a lot of content, yes, and that's nice to build, just for the fun of it, but the content is really redundent.Industries DLC does the same as the basic industries, just in a different way. This goes for basically any content added. Never do they implement a new system, but they just copy something existing, spice it up, and basically make it ""replace"" the older thing. Same with Park DLC, or Campus DLC. So you just build it all, without much things to take into account or consider. What remains, is staring at traffic and trying to fix the traffic jams, and managing public transport lines.....and trying out some of the many mods.So is it a good game? Yeah.Is it a city simulation? More like a transport agents simulation."

Despite the negative reaction of its playerbase, Paradox has not backtracked and it looks like the launcher is here to stay.I don't recommend buying this game based on the behaviour of Paradox and the chance that they may continue to push updates such as these.Update: I still love this game, but the Paradox Launcher still sucks.

Screw this, I'm not going to play this game ever again, nor buy anything from Paradox, untill you remove this malicious software for good. Thank you, and goodbye."

It'd be nice to build in expandable (Sim City doesn't expand), server saved (so you can play on YOUR time and not the ""hosts"" time) ""regions"".This way you can sell/lend services (power, sewer, fire, police, medical, trash, etc.), visit (to get ideas or admire) or give a loan/monetary gift."

7134,Frith Ra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/frithra/,1,,1,73.0,January,"7,",275,0,1,"I first heard about this game from watching Clint of LGR's video review and as someone who dabbled in SimCity games from time to time I knew I wanted this one. But what was really a shame was that I sat on it for a good while not really getting far enough into the game to grow beyond a fairly small town with basic facilities. I had of course been mostly familiar with SimCity 3000 and SimCity 4 which made up the bulk of my city management sim experience but jumping into Cities: Skylines felt like a whole new world to me. So many functions and details were changed in comparison and it kinda seemed like I was gonna have to relearn everything. Boy was I right about that!I recently picked it back up and finally gave the game a real honest try after watching some tutorial videos to help me grasp some of the fundamentals a bit better. It still felt confusing at times but as I kept progressing from milestone to milestone using some of the basic tips and being mindful of the limitations of my budget I managed to find a good balance between providing essential services to my city as well as gradually expanding it piece by piece to allow for positive growth. By the time I finally got into being able to do high density and office zoning I felt like I was really starting to get the hang of things!Then the traffic problems began and made me realize I still have much to learn.See something I didn't fully understand nor appreciate at the time was that Cities: Skylines actually goes into a level of immersive detail in how it presents a functional, living city that honestly the SimCity games didn't come close to. This was something I almost immediately realized when I went back to play those games after playing this one. Not only is the amount of detailed information you can get about your city absolutely massive and easier to read right down to exact numbers but the people in your city behave in vastly different ways. Traffic patterns aren't just an RNG thing they have a certain flow to them and depending on how vehicles end up pathing to get to the busier parts of the city that will show you what areas actually have sufficient flow or if they might need to be improved. Things like traffic lights, roads that are too narrow for the amount of traffic on them, a lack of adequate alternative public transportation routes all play a role here. And going beyond traffic you also have to consider the various needs of different zones in order to make the people who live and work in those areas happy thus enabling higher level structures to be built which ultimately brings more money to your city. It's a chaotic, stressful, and yet amazingly satisfying balancing act challenge that I rarely experience in most simulation games. In fact it doesn't take long for a small design flaw to become a noticeable problem as your population grows which basically reinforces the need to continue to learn and adapt as you play.Make no mistake. Cities: Skylines will not handhold you all the way to becoming a Megalopolis. As you city grows and more elements of the game come into play it will challenge you and try to break you if you lack understanding. But it does give you the tools you need to figure things out if you're observant and patient enough. You will have to work at it and continue to improve your management skills. But the reward of building a successful city makes it worth it time and time again.Before I close this out though I will point out one thing that I do feel is something of an issue. Certain aspects of this game that I feel deserve to be part of the core experience are locked behind certain DLCs. So you effectively have a cost to entry for the full experience. But that being said there is nothing wrong with just playing the base game itself and getting the feel of it. While the expansions do add some often useful and interesting mechanics to the game I wouldn't say they're completely necessary to be able to enjoy it. But you do kind of end up feeling like there are some missing pieces without them. So you will have to decide for yourself if it's ultimately worth your time and money to get them."

In true Paradox style the game has almost onion layers of depth... Yet, with the depth comes the typical Paradox style bugs. AI becomes problematic when cities get too big, you'll find yourself balancing traffic, health of your citizens, power and water, just to name a few things you'll face.These things can be avoided by keeping a watchful eye on your city and careful foresight and pre-planning. Try to envision your city before you lay brick to mortar. This game is not for the fleet-minded. Make one wrong set up in the early game and your city will fail before you get the chance to begin.8.7/10 - A well thought out and executed city builder that suffers from too many bugs that can only be mitigated by mods.

I don't mind paying for extra content as long as the DLC is thoroughly tested by the developer before releasing it and that it isn't bloated gameware contrived to constantly nag you till you buy the five new recolored EA clothing or weapon 'skins' while breaking the base-game at the same time. I have never had any issues with stuff that Colossal Order makes and have played this game extensively. With that said, I highly recommend you check out Cities Skylines as it is a well-polished work of art, purely a bliss to play."

Of course, the modding community is excellent.My two problems with this game is the performance with mods and Mac OS X Catalina compatability.

I can say that this game is well made and pretty fun. Everything from the intricate agent system and fantastic simulation it looks, sounds and feels just right.While I'd like the vanilla game to offer more kinds of zoning and better control of road traffic there are mods that will provide all sorts of improvements. The community and Steam Workshop stuff are awesome. You wouldn't believe the amazing add-ons the community has created.On the downside, the complex simulation unfortunately doesn't allow very large areas and the population is limited as such. While there are (of course!) mods to unlock restrictions your performance may suffer as a result. Have a look at a few videos what players are doing, you'll be amazed how detailed and efficient the game can be."

You can sink hours and hours into designing the perfect interchange for your freeway system, or just play to see if get traffic so bad it backs up forever in your city. Making money is relatively easy if you've ever had any experience with city builders before, definitely not punishing for new players, but still complicated enough to keep you on your toes. So much support on the Steam Workshop from modders, with everything from building assets, new maps, and mods to help you design the perfect traffic circle (roundabout). I've only really encountered two problems with this game. You do need a pretty good computer to play this game. I wouldn't go by even the ""recommended"" for even good gameplay. The 600 series will play it, I suppose, but you might as well play on a potato. Your fps will be low and you may not be able to use any mods or DLC. The second problem is that some of the mods (looking at you Traffic Manager: President's Edition) might almost be considered required for high end cities. The ability to control lanes usage, when and where people can change lanes, and which lanes can be used for turning can be a make it or break it in large cities - where micromanaging traffic can become almost a full time job. While the games AI for traffic is good, your cims aren't smart when driving no matter how many universities you have in your city. Without this mod, your traffic might get so bad your city becomes a giant parking lot. Despite those 2 downfalls, I would highly recommend this game for any city builder fan - even those who refuse to use any mods at all."

That is a complement to how well the game simulates a city as if it were real. unlike the iconic sims city the game's graphics are focused on making the game look as realistic as possible. The game also differs from classic city building games in the sense that instead of building individual houses you can designate area as low density residential, high density residential, low density commercial, high density commercial, industrial or office spaces this allows citizens to build how they want like in real life. There are also other buildings such as parks, utilities (power, garbage, water, ect.) buildings, emergency services HQs, city iconic buildings, transport, ect. The game allows for intense customisation from names of any entity, how traffic flows, The colour and model of your city busses, polices for each district of town (that you assign) (polices include no smoking, no trucks, building high limit and much more). Once again I cannot stress enough that the game is hard to run for good reasons it is very fun to play and because of the experimental combinations of many customisations you can never get bored. I strongly recommend this game."

While Sim City had a lot more polish on its animations, Cities Skyline delivers the more classic Sim City style gameplay that Sim City 4 lacked and, thus, delivered exactly what everyone actually wanted. The game thrives on the modding community, which is actively encouraged and incorporated by the developers. Personally, I dislike mods in my games (I prefer to play the game the way it's meant to be played) but I cannot deny that here, mods are often not only well crafted but well supported and efficiently integrated."

You will need several DLCs and mods to get the full experience and to be able to do all the things you would typically want to do in a city builder.One thing that's been bugging me about C:S is its enormous RAM consumption when using mods and custom assets, repeatedly leading to crashes of my 24GB system. Some people even reported 32GB not being enough. I fully believe that. Every new DLC also adds at least another half GB in RAM consumption, so one needs to be very careful as to how far they want to go modding-/asset-wise.Another thing is the minimum requirements. It is claimed the game would not support integrated Intel GPUs, yet it does. I got it running on my gaming laptop using my CPU's Intel Graphics instead of the dedicated NVidia GTX, at lower settings and with a lower framerate, of course. Also, more RAM is needed for that as the Intel chip has no dedicated VRAM and will use some amount of system RAM instead. So that's a solution for people with good business systems that have a fast CPU and a lot of RAM but no high-performance GPU. The game will remain playable up to some point."

With a large amount of ways to play throughout the variety of maps, in the beginning you can have so much fun finding what works and what doesn't (and trying to recover from some royal screw-ups). After some time of playing the game constantly, you find a method that works. There are only so many methods that work so when you find one, you stick with it. Throughout every map. Every time you play. DLC mixes things up, but you find what works with that and stick with it. Throughout every playing session. Point is, this doesn't seem to me like a game you can straight out play for a month consecutively because it eventually becomes too boring since you don't have a main objective to achieve once you fix everything. But when played with a few months between each session can really be fantastic once you forget how to play and have to learn the advanced tactics all over again. Overall, 7/10 would recommend if you have some extra Steam cash to spend."

Whether you play vanilla for strategy, or go deep into modding for the ultimate creative endeavor, there is something for everyone within this game.

EA has pouring ♥♥♥♥ into it's customers mouth so much for so long with Sim city games now people has crazy low standard for city building games that everyone think this game is actually good. Entitled ""Cities skylines"" but the same building pops up next to each others and make the ""skyline"" looking like ♥♥♥♥ when they could have done a few simple scripts to fix this. The developers is very mindless about the crucial elements of the game such as mods management. The nightmare of scroll through thousands and thousands of assets to manually enable the assets you want because some error panels pop up during the gameplay and you're trying to fix it. That means you have to click the tick box for god knows how many thousand times when you can just ""CTRL + Select"" then modify like any post - 1985 technology instead you have these stupid ""select/deselect all"" buttons that can not do anything else but select (literally). But Paradox doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about their players because their game and DLCs still sell now that they technically have the monopoly on the city building games market, you either play EA's garbage or play this mediocre ass game (or play Arno and Tropical but they're kinda different). Mods is what make this game playable and having a big player base but at the same time is stopping them from pumping out a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs (they actually is doing this but less) thus losing them loads of money.

The gameplay consists of 1) Traffic Management. 2) Maintaining the proper amount of residential, commercial and employment zones.3) Traffic Management.4) Maintaining full coverage with all services while minimizing the number of buildings (as you need to maintain them and it is not cheap (especially if you play on hard or costume difficulty))3) Maintaining a good public-transport network. (if you know Cities in Motion (1&2), 90% of these games are ""transportation"" element of this game)5) Traffic Management.Tips:- if you want to have a ""main street"" (and you have to have them) minimize the number of intersections, (use helper streets or join many small roads at once).- create small independent regions surrounded by the ""main street'- NEVER create a single bus line across the whole city (every person/car is simulated with definite destinations, so transportation must be realistic(ish))"

7379,KRX,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KRX003/,1,,1,"2,423.2",November,"13,",354,0,1,"Cities Skylines is a great game. It picks up where the Sims City franchise faltered. You can play and enjoy the systems in Cities Skylines for about hundreds hours before either realizing you enjoy the design aspect of making cities, or you're ready to move on. This is due to the fact that the mechanics of this game are very shallow. The game basically plays itself, and there is not much of a requirement to manage or make difficult decisions. After a small learning curve, you will have mastered this game.What keeps most of us playing the game is the large and active community, mods, and creativity ambition. This is a design and building game and it is very good at that. This means Cities Skylines fits more in line with the Sims or Planet Coaster rather than it does with Transport Fever or Banished. Short Tutorial (6 mins) about making your first profiting city and general tips and tricks for brand new players. I think it is important to note that the DLCs for Cities Skylines are not necessary and focus more on improving the cosmetic variation in the game. There is very little meaningful gameplay provided by any of the DLCs. That isn’t a bad thing, since for myself and many other long time players, the game is more about design and creativity than management. These DLCs give you more items to create more visual character and variety within your city areas. My Ranking for the Cities Skylines DLC as follows1 - Green Cities - (Expands the base experience by adding the most “stuff”)2 - After Dark - (Bolsters the base experience and needed for some modding)3 - Parklife - (My personal favorite)4 - Industries5 - Campus6 - Mass Transit7 - Natural Disasters8 - Snowfall"

I'm onto my 20th city and while this current city has been the one that has progressed the most, i fear a restart is coming along soon.

The Steam Workshop gives the chance for the community to aid the game and make it more personal to you, as well as a lot of quality of life mods.The only disappointing thing about this game for me is the performance, it is terrible. I was running the game on an i7 6700k with 16GB of RAM and a GTX 1080, I have now upgraded to a Ryzen 5 3600 with 32GB of RAM and an RTX 2080 SUPER and the performance is exactly the same. I have barely entered in 3 thousand population mark and my fps is between 25 - 50, from what I've read the engine utilises single core CPU usage, and in this day and age we have Quad core CPU's.Personally I wouldn't be happy with releasing a game that ran so poorly, but then again I'm not a game developer.But, I recommend the game, if you can put the terrible performance aside and focus on the game then you will have fun."

Make sure garbage is handled, manage waste water, manage the mail service, set policys for different zones like 'recycling' or 'free public transport'.You can even import height maps to the editor and rebuild the city where you live as you like.Connecting roads, building effective intersections and managing traffic flow is extremely addicting. You dont want traffic jams.Seeing all the little people getting to work using your subway network is so satisfying.Also, great music makes watching your skyscrapers grow a pleasure.There is also great mod support if you want to go down that rabbit hole, some of which makes road building a lot easier.Waiting for a sequel!"

It can be pretty complicated initially if you're new to the genre. I do highly recommend doing a bit of research on some of the best available mods if the game starts to feel a bit bland.

This game at its core is about administration and the joy of seeing your beautiful creation function, as the only goal the game sets for you is to grow your city, everything else you want to accomplish is up to you. There’s a lot of artistic freedom on how you want your city to look like, and the game is quite forgiving to let you experiment, most of the time things will work well as long as you don’t ignore increasingly growing issues (pay attention to those tweets!). However, some problems like traffic accidents or saturation of public transport are non-existent in the base game, which makes it less punishing but also unrealistic to some degree.And if you reach the skill ceiling or are hungry for more you have tons of DLCs and mods that bring more content to the table, even when the standalone version is already very good by itself.Also, . Your first city will probably have issues, but if the income stays on the green you can fix them. I made the mistake of obsessing over rubbish like traffic jams and tried to make everything perfect for hours when instead if should’ve focused on solving any problems that come by and just responding to citizen demand. As I said, the game is forgiving and will give you time to fix mistakes and make improvements.If you’re into resource management and administration this game will be your cup of tea. My personal advice getting into it is to watch a beginner’s guide to get you started on the basics, which is the hardest part as there is no tutorial, only small explanations that pop up on how each feature functions."

Not only does this game have a great vibe, big beautiful levels, and a wide selection of use created maps, but it has so much DLC and user content you can make any city you can imagine, with rare exceptions (Venice is still out of our reach, even with the canal system).The game plays much like Sim City. You have zoning types, you can create districts and enact laws citywide or only in that district, and you can watch the day-to-day of your citizens. Here's some kickers that make this game fun:1) Traffic management is huge and a very rewarding thing to optimize2) With expansions activity of your city changes with the day-night cycle.3) The creation of mega-parks can aid to making your own paradise4) Very generous selection of special buildings5) Different building sets for different culturesI highly recommend people give it a shot.

It might be laggy if you have a laptop not designed for gaming it's still good. It also will take longer if you're playing on a work laptop. I'm gonna leave some tips.1. When you start to build roads you'll start to lose money, to prevent that you need to stop the time by pressing the button in the down left side.2. The green, blue and orange(ish) means what people living in your city want. green: houses(low residential zones)  blue: shops (commercial zone)  orange: industrial zones. if the bar is high it means that people want/need it.3. When you level up(meaning when you reach ex. 500 people in your city) pause the game because you start to go in the negatives unless if you're already in negatives you'll lose even more money.

If you for example set streets to close to one another that street will in-turn become more heavily trafficated. You need to really plan your city building if you set out to build a gigantic metropolis. The possibilites are endless.

Because it's much more than a city building game, it's an experience. if you ever wanted to create a virtual replica of the town/city you are currently living in then explore it through the eyes of a civilian you can do that. If you want to sit down and create a public transport system of massive proportions than go ahead, it's possible. The base game is worth the money on it's own however the modding community and various dlc's just make the experience evermore enjoyable. In the hundreds of hours I have spent in this game, there is not one moment where I have felt like there is nothing to do, because there simply is never a moment where there is not something to do, one of many features which makes this game one of the best ever.GET.

7661,Matt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/mattiscanada/,1,,0,"1,265.2",July,"1,",65,0,1,"This is gonna be a long one, but hopefully its helpful.I got this game as a replacement to Sim City 4 nearly right as it came out and at the time and for the following 2 years I really loved it, and I felt as though this game was state of the art. However after most players finished building cities for the two years after release, the true limitations of the game started to show. I really feel like the developers missed a giant opportunity with this game 2 years after release, DLC quality has been on and off, with a lot of content included in the DLCs being things that should have been included in the base game (Just take a look at the DLCs). Basic items and buildings in the game haven't been updated or given a facelift, you know this becomes an issue when literally 90% of people playing the game have to opt for ""user created"" tree's and buildings. It gets to the point where most people playing the game use mods (""Prop it up"")  just to remove props from developer made buildings or just choose not to use the buildings at all because the community (Steam Workshop) is able to create tremendously higher quality and more optimised assets then the developers are able to. Modding in this game is easy and hard at the same time, searching the workshop for things you want and adding them is easy, but troubleshooting mods or general problems you might be having due to use of those mods is where it gets difficult, there are so many problems (maybe not problems, but flaws and lack of realistic thinking by the devs) and inconsistencies with this game that there are so many mods created to fix them (which is great on the communities part, but I shouldn't have to download a mod just to have traffic use the correct turning lane, be able to place a special building twice, or place a road across a canal) and it becomes overwhelming and you really only feel at peace once you have created a collection of assets and mods that works for you. Once you get into the building aspect of the game with a heavy modlist and assets is when you start to have fun, although this game burns you out quite quickly (like I mean very quickly), it's fun when you are really feeling it and have a idea of what you want to make in mind. On the flip side massive design flaws in the game can totally ruin a lot of your building (a lot of big Cities Skylines youtubers have spoken about this), roads are problematic due to the lack of customisation and building highway lanes and interchanges that connect smoothly is infuriating even with IMT and Node Controller. Scale is also a huge issue in this game (I think Skibitth or Strictoaster talked about this) stuff will often look too small or too large, (Trees, Benches, Planes, Boats, Certain Roads, etc) this has a negative effect on roads since you will struggle to build small intersections without having the pavement glitch or something not work, just building a roundabout without any mods is close to impossible. To get a good result with a build in this game you need to put in hours of effort, which maybe fine for some people who want to spend 3 hours placing lane markings and asphalt due to the games lack of an ability to build proper parking lots, but I enjoy a healthy medium. My love-hate relationship with this game is the complexity and work that has to go into making simple things (roundabout, highway on/off ramp, functional metro station) and it puzzles me why a lot of QOL glitches won't be fixed by the developers. At this point in time, I cannot recommend this game, I would say to hold off until the next one comes out (if that is ever gonna happen) or just enjoy some of the great youtube content there is of this game and really think about if you wanna get into this game.Also, I remember reading a review here a while ago where someone stated that they had some privacy concerns with the new launcher."

7664,Robotica,https://steamcommunity.com/id/robotoxic/,1,1,1,722.0,July,"1,",831,0,1,"As of June 2019 Cities: Skylines is probably the best city building game there is. It's not perfect though, the simulation can be buggy at times and even if you have a powerful PC your FPS will still struggle. Apart from these issues though there really is a lot of things to love about this game, especially if you love city builders like myself. In the world of city builders there are generally two types of players, those who play to micromanage the simulation and those who play to build beautiful looking cities. I typically fall somewhere in between the two, though I tend to land on making beautiful cities.The base game and the DLC are great, I own just about all of them (apart form Natural Disasters, I don't like the idea of destroying my city), but where this game truly shines is the mods. The Steam Workshop contains thousand upon thousand of custom buildings, tools, maps, luts, etc etc. With the community involved the possibilities are truly endless. Oh, and speaking of the community, it's huge! Also, it's full of great people who love to build and help others as well.SimCity 4 was my city builder of choice prior to CS, but being a trully 3D game CS offers much more flexibility and diverse building possibilities than SC4. Building networks in SC4 was also incredibly time consuming and tedious, not to mention it was extremely easy to accidentally break your entire interchange and have to rebuild it, but in CS things are much much easier (emphasis on the much). With a massive collection of prebuilt interchanges you can easily get a complex network up in no time. Even if you need to hand build one it's much quicker and much less tedious. Also, if you prefer the isometric look of SC4 it's possible to get close to that aesthetic using mods. If you build your network with straight roads and 45 deg angles you can get a very similar look.So, if your a fan of city builders and looking for a new game to sink your teeth into you won't be disappointed. I'm at about 600 hours and I feel like there is still a lot left for me to do."

In my opinion, the base game is worth the price even when it is not on sale. On the contrary, there are a lot of DLC's that are must haves in order to get the full experience with this game. I would recommend buying most of these during the next big sale. This is my list of stuff I would recommend vs. wouldn't.Deluxe vs. Normal Game:If not on sale I wouldn't recommend deluxe because it only brings some real life monuments into the game and gives you the soundtrack.If big Steam sale:Everything execpt texture and music packs and maybe concerts.Top DLC's- Must Have (in my opinion):1, Match Day- Only because it's free2, After Dark- This one is a must have because of all the base game content added3, Mass Transit and Green Cities- Both of these add fun content mainly for the late game that is not necessary but cool to useWild Card Spots:Industries + Campus + Parklife (all three of these DLCs work the same way just with different parts of the city. Industry, College, and Parks respectivly. You paint a zone and build it up over time unlocking more building to put in it as it levels up). If you like this kind of customization go for it otherwise steer clear of these three DLCs.Snowfall- kind of obvious. This DLC brings you maps with snow on them. There are a bunch more services needed such as snowplows and heating. Note: this only happens on some maps.Terrible DLCs you shouldn't get:1, Texture Packs -Kinda Obvious (no new content)2, Music Packs- Also Kinda Obvious (if you really wanted the music you could find it on Youtube or something)3, Concerts- Build a concert ground to hold a concert.

Instead they improve on what is already avaible. From DLC list only about  8 is delivering actual content (the rest are either useless radio stations or pointless retexture packs). Beside that, the game  has  thousands of free mods to offer via ""Steam workshop"".  What is interesting, , if it is a big concern for you.When it comes down to the actual game: it offers thousands of hours of content. The more your city will grow, the more thinking it will require. Some DLCs make the game even harder (Industries DLC) while some make things easier (Mass Transit). Although the problems which you will encounter are nearly always the same- you build new district, attach electricity and sewage system and when people start using cars you end up with like 5% traffic flow.

7868,Ashley,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ashleydavies/,1,,1,161.0,May,"8,",283,0,1,"First, the ""negatives"" - strongly warrants a solid CPU for the best enjoyment, and you're gonna need the 25 tiles mod (otherwise your city size is a little on the unnecessarily restricted side).The only significant negative point I have is that sometimes the routing for traffic can be dumb and short-sighted and you end up with crematoriums sending hearses across the city over miles of crowded roads to pick up dead, rather than just waiting for one of the closer ones to have a car available. This sort of thing spirals - since it takes so long for the cars to return, those crematoriums run out of cars, and the dead around them cause cars to be dispatched across the map. But onto the positives!Traffic management is awesome (though road utilities mods letting you play with lane directions & the like are very helpful), it's really fun to try to balance public transport with good highway backbones, and to manage cargo coming in and out of your city and industrial districts.Really, it's a spectacular game if you love any sort of city building simulation. It's truly insane how well this game performs considering what it's doing, and as a software engineer myself I find it unbelievable how ""real"" the simulation feels - every individual car and person can be zoomed in on, watched, and tracked to home or work. They all behave in ways that seem real. I have absolutely no idea how that's possible for 100k individual agents, but whatever optimisations they've got under the hood powering it never break the illusion - I've never once felt like when I zoomed out it stopped simulating the agents (they're often still visible if you look closely)."

7886,Darc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarcone/,1,,1,390.9,April,"13,",9,0,1,"Good game that is very replayable and fun, you can play for hours on end and loose track of time and you will always find something to add or upgrade in your city BUT you should install DLCs and mods for the best experience.There are a lot of mods that are available for the game but some are absolutely necessary and allow you to do things that you would expect to be built in (Traffic Manager: President Edition, Move It, etc). Modding is well supported by the game developers and the overall experience of modding is smooth. The paid DLCs are pretty good and mostly expand on features that are already in the game so therefore aren't really needed until you want to evolve your cities further.In terms of performance the game isn't the best, it is not very well optimised and when you start downloading more mods, assets and DLCs it will get worse but is still very playable. If you don't have much RAM it can become an issue as you start to add more things to your city since sometimes it will straight up crash at launch if it doesn't have enough.OVERALL the game is really fun and the community is great, you will have difficulty getting bored once you start since theres always more you can do and the positives overwhelmingly outweigh the negatives. 9.5/10"

How satisfying! I find myself worrying over my budget allocation for my monorail transit system, whilst wanting to ensure my population are educated enough for the office buildings I'm about to entice into the neighbourhood. The excellent graphics and music offer a serene experience - perfect with wine (choose your colour). This is one of the few games in which I find myself reaching for the DLC, craving the aesthetics of period buildings, of all things. I first experienced this on XBox gamepass, when I was bored and likely drunk, and now look at me: addicted to town planning and loving it."

Cities: Skylines is no different (and perhaps even better, depending on who you ask)! Pros:+ Incredible detail for almost every aspect of the game, whether it is managing the traffic in your city or deciding how much you'd want to invest into each of your city's utilities, and you can tweak them to your liking.+ Being able to zoom into your city and just ""drive"" around your streets, enjoying your city from the perspective of low-flying drone+ Feedback from your people helps you better manage your city and turn it into the best city there is!+ Not very punishing if you mess up - The game has several ways for you to rebound from a mistake. Personally, I managed to regain control of my city's finances (thanks to loans) after accidentally overspending my budget :)+ The discounted price makes the game worthwhile - Buy the game while it's still discounted! + Very active and robust Steam workshop community - Lots of free mods and other stuff here!+ Astounding graphics Cons:- This is probably just me but I find the landscaping tools a bit hard to use. Tried leveling a small hilly area so I can zone better and I end up with a sinkhole... lol- Scenarios are locked behind DLCs (I think). I was able to open a scenario from the Steam Workshop with my editor but I wasn't able to play it.Note that I'm not the sort to build pretty cities... I'm the sort of player who enjoys packing as many buildings and people into my city as I can. You've been warned! :PCities: Skylines is an incredible city-builder and is definitely a game that fans of the genre need to get! The game isn't too expensive either, especially if you grab it during sales (like right now!). The only thing I would love to play, besides being able to build my own cities, is the scenarios. It's just a pity that the game doesn't let you have a taste of that game mode if you don't own any of the DLCs... so be sure to get them (specifically the Mass Transit and Natural Disasters DLCs), if you'd like to give scenarios a try!

Everything fits within the city, and looks as though it belongs. You can build across a variety of maps, both developed by Colossal Order themselves or by content creators on the Steam workshop. You can build everything from a sprawling metropolis or megalopolis to a quaint small town.Buy it while it's on sale, because that happens semi-often. But, if you want it NOW, its worth it even if you don't buy it on sale. Buy the ""main"" DLC's (Industries, Parklife, Green Cities, Mass Transit, Natural Disasters, Snowfall, and After Dark as of the time of writing) because they expand and build the available options for building your city. The other DLC's are wholly optional, because YouTube/Spotify/Soundcloud can also provide background sound, but the in-game radio is very fitting for the game.Conclusion. Buy it, mod it, breath life into the land."

7984,solwra,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Solwra/,1,,1,"1,017.8",January,"5,",65,0,1,"Probably one of the best city building games out there so far. It is both challenging, fun and relaxing to play.For me I really found it enjoyable to get into small details and try to flush out my districts thoroughly, while also I found it to be challenging for the start of the game to get myself around some resource managmenet and deciding, rearranging and refining everything to ensure it works well. The game by itself offers alot of features for you to get hooked up into it and the DLC keeps you playing even longer. It is rich in what you can do with your city and the interface is very easy to use, making the overall gameplay feel heavily polished.The modding and the editing engine the game comes with is great and allows you to further customize your city.However, the game is not without it's issues. My biggest problem with the game is lack of variety; the buildings, cars, roads are very limited in terms of different looks they have by default. This often creates districts that have too many identical buildings, making me feel very frustrated when I'm trying to make the district look unique. Another minor issue is the way the traffic behaves and the services, I sometimes get garbage trucks that are going off in a distance to a house that has a garbage service closer to it and the same goes for the rest of the services. Really wish we could create diversions or restrictions for certain roads so for example I can redirect some of the vehicles to not obstruct the service vehicle exits and entrances.Another issue I have with the game is the road building, the tools are simple and easy to use however it doesn't go further than that, you cannot create good looking roads in vanilla game without sacraficing alot of time and effort. It is neither extremely precise which may be bothersome to people and they will resort to using mods to fix these kind of issues.But alot of these issues can be resolved in mods, it's just a bit of a shame that the game is lackluster on these features as it would be a game that I would be playing all the time.The game is a solid city building game, definetly worth buying if you are into management or strategic games which offer a more relaxed tone. 9/10 - Best management game overall, just some mods need to be in vanilla game."

(maybe some incompatible mods?)-The textures fu*k up every time the buildings don´t have smooth transitions to roads (quite often).-Terrible water management, especially quays - too high, no leveling, beaches even worse - there are no people there, no one is swimming/tanning without specialized buildings-Lacks a more in-depth town hall management (thinking politics) - could be a potencial DLC-Lack more placeable props-The NPCs could go walk somewhere where there are no roads or paths (atleast in park areas/beaches)In conclusion - Since I have pointed out mostly little things (that I would love to be changed/added in the game, but still...), you can work out, that the game is very good.

I made a huge garbage center right near my soon to be downtown. I based my new area which almost became my downtown on top of natural resources. I would always have about 10K dollars because I put down way too many schools, and more and more problems.In the base game, some things aren't the best.The graphics don't look that good, the roads are too bright, the AI path finding is absolutely abysmal and more.However, modding can help greatly.I have mods that make the game look beautiful, make roads american styled, fix AI path finding, allow you to move things, give you more road freedom and more.I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a simulation game."

Having said that, I was glad I at least gave cities skylines a chance as the game has a number of things going for it. Pros: 1. While Anno 2070 has to be one of the more complicated city builders I have played, Cities Skylines has to possibly be one of the most in depth city builder games I have played as you can control things like public transit and city policies which have a real impact on how your city functions. 2. Almost all the DLC for this game except maybe mass transit is completely optional as they only add things like new buildings which I have found only add to the enjoyment of the game. 3. The game seeems to be very well tested and all updates so far are integrated (relativley without incident) into already existing saves which is a really nice feature (unlike Stellaris). 4.The game is still being updated to this day with some new features making there way to even people who did not invest in DLC. Again, the updates integrate seemlesly into already existing cities which I have had a few old ones for nearly 2 years now. Cons: Other than a very minor bug I may have encountered from time to time, Colossal Order did an amazing job with the game at large with my only complaint maybe being that most cars only line up in one of three lanes available unless they are making  a turn. Overall I am very pleased to have bought the game and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an in depth city builder were you manage things like transit and should you have the DLCs, could even manage disaster response, parks, heating, industries, the environment and much more!"

Thankfully only two years later, this game came along from Colossal Order, and finally just this last week I go to dig into this game and the massive amount of developed DLC it has gotten over the last three years.So what do I think of it? I love it.The degree of micromanagement you can get into, deep into the most obscure and minor of city services types and industries, is frightfully specific. Personally I've always preferred the balance of Sim City 2000's micro and macromanagement of cities, but nevertheless, it's wonderful that there's finally a contemporary city simulator which allows the type of any-level-you-wish to manage your cities at. While I may still have to wait and pine for another city simulator to recreate the balance of management I loved in Sim City 2000, this game will scratch my city building (or destroying) itch certainly for a long while."

Great game in overall and a perfect time killer if you have it. The options are not too complex yet not to simple, so the learning curve is not that bad, once you get the DLCs (which I think the majority should be in the base game) you'll need to learn more stuff but makes the game experience better. And if you want to make the game experience even better, you can find lots of stuff in the Steam Workshop, specially to get rid of some annyoing mechanics of the game itself (not bugs but minor mechanics that annoy).Summing up: best game of its genre by now, 9/10. If you were searching for a nice City Builder, this is it."

While it's my first city sim, I wanted to get an understanding of how layouts of the cities I build in Civilization would be. How small clusters of houses can grow and change over time. How limited funding and techs that grow can affect the formation resulting in useless little sections that could be so much better designed but no one can be bothered to put in the effort of reconstruction. This game helped with all of that, and more. And while I don't play it often, I keep coming back to it (especially but not limited to when they release new DLC)."

Gameplay mechanics are fun and work perfectly together, it is challenging all the time, and there is no point your city flows just like this. In contrary, bigger cities are an extra challenge you will have to face. It is perfectly balanced, the graphics are nice, the cities are living and even kinda beautiful sometimes. Yes. It is challenging to learn to play properly, there is a damn lot of content to buy in form of DLCs, so you have to have the time, the money and the discipline and the will to play the game, if you really want to enjoy it. Hey, it's paradox, what else did you expect? Despite their insane DLC policy, they make great games, C:S is a great game, so if you meet the criteria I wrote, I recommend it to you. It's totally worth the money, once you really manage to sink in. And you can try it with the base game first, see if it appeals to you and invest more time and money later on. The choice is yours."

You can either play it as an actual game with scenarios, progression and milestones or go wild, download thousands of assets from the awesome community and use it as a city planning or traffic simulation software with whatever map, buildings and vehicles you want. It is lightweight when playing vanilla, but can easily melt your RAM with tons of assets and mods. I am already using 32 GB RAM and it's still not enough sometimes, but I tend to go for realism so that's my weakness I guess.The graphics are okay in the base game and can be heavily modified to look very realistic with post-processing and custom textures and whatnot. Even unmodded it's a lot better than competing city sims, although the building style might not be for everyone because it is rather futuristic, but you can change that of course!Updates are made regularly with loads of new content which gets better with every expansion and I think they are still decently priced. The game itself is fairly cheap and it's a real must-have for city sim fans.I love that this game offers almost any opportunity to be modified and improved and the devs work really hard to implement some of the essential user mods into the base game.I have nominated Cities: Skylines for ""Game of the Year"" and my playtime speaks for itself I think."

A GTX 770 can handle all that with no issues. Policies and industry specializations help to shape the city the way you want. Upgrading roads, that felt as a major problem in other city builders, feels smooth and painless in Cities: Skylines.This is a game that manages to keep you entertained for long hours with its beautiful atmosphere, relaxing gameplay and in-game radio stations (I love the ads! Pure work of genius!). It has it all... and more. After Dark, Snowfall, Mass Transit and Parklife DLCs are highly recommended."

While base Cities: Skylines is a bit basic and the DLC are fairly expensive (especially if you buy them all at the same time), Cities: Skylines is still one of the best games on Steam. Even though the base game is fairly basic, it gets all the basics right. Most of all, the modding support is amazing. There are so many great mods, assets, maps and themes that are very easy to install and use in your games. With modding you get so many more options in almost all aspects of the game than vanilla. The DLC are nice additions to the games but as I said above, are fairly expensive. My personal favourite, Snowfall adds a whole ne feel to the game that gives a nice chnage when you are getting bored of permanent summer. If you are looking to pick this up, steam sales are your best friend. At $7.49 during lamost every Steam sale, it is a steal. The DLC also go on sale and that's probably the best time to pick them up too.Pros:+ large map+ great building tools+ amazing modding support+ nice looking graphics+ best city builder on the market+ replayabilityCons:- expensive DLC- low fps on large cities"

As if you couldn't have guessed that already. It allows you, in its basic state (that being without DLC or mods), to create a city from a fair variety of maps, each with different things going for them such as water quantity, oil reserves, building area etc. Your task is, simply, to get as many people to live in your city, keep them happy, make it as good as you can, and make a load of money. The same as the government’s job, really. Except the ""keeping people happy bit""...yeah...The game allows you to design and expand a city with the use of many tools such as zoning, district planning and other features that let you change the smaller, more intricate details of your city. You can set different laws within your districts to make them work more efficiently at what you want them to do. I feel like this is all done really well. I have not got any DLC's, and only recently did I get a few mods, but I don't feel like the game ever really needed them.Over the course of your cities expansion, you will face challenges. You must supply water, electric and road access to people, and zone your areas well to create a nice amount of residential, commercial and industrial areas. As the demand for them increases, it is expected that you appease them. You will also have to work around the formation of the land that you are on to make your city as functional and as sustainable as it can be, otherwise it will lack in efficiency, and perhaps upset the people. If they don’t like your city, they will first stop paying taxes, making it much harder for you to amend your previous errors. After that, they will leave, and you will be very lonely in that ghost town of yours. And probably quite angry as you’ll have to start a new game again. One problem that is hard to manage is the flow of traffic. You must make reliable and efficient road networks throughout your city, otherwise it will become stagnant. Public services such as busses will be rendered useless, nobody will be able to get to work, and emergency services will be crippled if your roads are congested all the time. As your city progresses in size, the feature is available to you to buy more land, thus enabling you to continue your expansion. Eventually, if you are good enough at this game, you will fill the maximum amount of land you can buy, at which point, you’ll probably be feeling quite proud of yourself. Well done. Overall, I would rate this game a well-earned 10/10. I can’t really fault it on anything. Out of all the city building games out there, this is the most detailed and intricate, while remaining fun to play, and enjoyably challenging. Graphically, it looks great, and the gameplay feels smooth. It has to be the best game of its type."

When I sit at my desk in the morning, holding my mug of coffee and listening to the swwet sounds of endless jazz, I see only one thing in the darkness.  When I sleep at night, I dream about one thing only.Roads.  My entire life is now based around trying to work out how to design roads.  The life force that is tarmac spaghetti has weaved its way in to my brain and encapsulated my attention and imagination.  I look to outside inspiration - the concrete jungles of America; the twisting, seemingly random estates across middle England.  I have barely even played this game, all the hours I have on it have been spent designing the circulatory system of my non-existant cities.  When I'm sitting at work or procrastinating at Univeristy I draw and ponder on how to sort effeciency from absurdity.  People say that your life is a highway.  Well if that is true then I can see why life is so complicated.  Congestion, sliproads, byways and highways.  Sometimes your road connects to another, creates a head on collision and hundres of people are killed or injured.  To me this is beautiful, and so are roads.  In conclusion, don't buy this game because you like cities - buy this game because you love roads."

I have been playing Sim management games since the original Sim City done by Maxis. I have bought (and played thoroughly)Cities in Motion I & IICities XL & XXLSim City I-IV (including simcity 3000)BanishedTropico (all of them)And so onThe point of mentioning this is to demonstrate that I have been playing this genre for a *very* long time.Cities: Skylines made me dance for joy when it came out. Particularly because I have moved over to linux full time and it has a native build. But aside from that I sunk a ton of hours into learning how this game operates. Aside from the ability to lay infrastructure and zones down (which is fairly standard) Skylines took inspiration from the Cities in Motion series with all kinds of different transportation options. Sure in the traditional games in this genra you might have had trains, buses and subways but the level of management you can choose to engage in with Skylines is quite good, especially with the Mass Transit expansion.The graphics are well done and the background music is pleasant and blends into the background without getting annoying. The day/night cycle is an interesting visual touch as well as adding some strategy to when certain services may be most effective (for example significantly increasing garbage pickup at night to reduce traffic).The modding scene is very active and I think that's great. I personally only use 2 or 3 mods, but you can get all kinds. The community fills in missing holes that the devs overlook. Interestingly, I have noticed that functionality from certain mods end up making it into the main game which shows that the devs are still paying attention to their community.It's not all sunshine and roses though. One of the things that made SimCity interesting was once you got a stable balance you couldn't just run the clock because your infrastructure aged. Sure you could it for a little bit, but if you weren't careful your powerplants would explode. Skylines does not seem to age their infrastructure, Additionally, I was very disappointed with the Parks DLC. I had these grand ideas about what glorious green spaces I would create only to find out that most of the ""props"" are cosmetic and don't provide any real value. On top of that, dropping a plaza here, or a skate park there seems to do more for the value of the area then any glorious parks you may build.I would also like to see a way to create man made lakes. I know that there was a thing that you can kind of do that with, its a pipe thing that is supposed to be used to help flooding in emergencies. I tried my best to use it anyways but it often lead to intermittent flooding.Another thing I would like to see is the ability to trade with neighbouring cities. In SimCity for example, I used have 3 or 4 cities on the go at one time, connected, treating them almost like districts of a larger city. This way you can get rid of your trash, or set up commuters so they can get to parts of the map without having to make pockets of residential areas in your heavy industry zones.Overall though I have really enjoyed the series. They really know how to milk it though as I have easily spent more money on this series than any other series. Sometimes, like Mass Transit, the DLC is well worth it and other times I get excited only to have a big MEH feeling. I also find its hard to tell from the reviews if a DLC is worth it. Largely this is subjective and will depend on your own creative endeavours.PROS* Modding community* modern city builder cross platform* devs seem to pay attention to the community* lots of transport options* decent traffic management* good variety of maps to play on* great visualsCONS* No trading or having multiple cities working together* Parks DLC largely cosmetic and thats disappointing* WAY TOO MANY DLC* if you buy the dlcs the series is expensive* infrastructure seems to be immortal (not withstanding natural disasters)* seems to be no good way to make man-made lakes"

The larger my city gets the more it slows down and that is a bummer but also an incentive to find a new map and tray again. Now speaking of maps. I love all the choices and the maps that people are trying to create the true catography. But maybe I missing it, but I would love a map that is just the geography and nothing else. I can choose how to land my transportation systems. I end up often taking a map I like and removing all things from it. Also, I know I could do a map on my own, but with so many amazing map designers why. I would love to ask for a way to grab a map with no roads and trains. I always use the 81 tiles mod anyhow.

The tools and freedom this game gives makes it possible to really let your creativity flow almost endlessly. And what is more amazing, is that most of the DLCs are actually relevant (with the occasional exception like ""snowfall""). And like most people tell, it is annoyingly addictive. Four hours will never pass so fast as with this game. And in all honesty, it can be dangerous for your day-to-day life, because you will end up missing important stuff as you lose yourself into the creative world of Cities: Skylines. It is a sure buy for anyone who likes to build, be creative and just play a relaxing game.  I give this game 9/10.Hold on! Only 9/10? I just told you it is amazing?!Yes, it is amazing, but it still has some flaws. 1) Thanks to the workshop and the amazing mod-community, the possibilities in this game are endless. But my question is, why aren't most of the stuff already in the game? The things I really miss in the vanilla game are the following:- Traffic Manager President version- Move it- Road Anarchy- Fine road adjustment- Tree-brush-  The ability to spawn water; for creating artificial lakes- Automated Bulldozing; considering bulldozing does not cost anything to perform (unlike in real life) there is no reason why the Mayor should order buildings to be destroyed after they've been abandoned.I would also like to see this game less americanized; one such example is the water treatment systems. This game is produced in Sweden and developed in Finland. The two countries IN THE WORLD with the best, industry leading technology in water treatment and cleaning, and recycling technology, and yet the vanilla game does not feature proper recycling stations (might be in ""green cities DLC"", but it should exist in the vanilla game as well).I would also like to see a patch that would enable better support for modern, multi-thread CPUs; as it is now, the game does not utilize modern CPUs that well. The worst offender for this game, though, is the traffic AI. While you certainly can mess up traffic by yourself a lot, many times the AI is the main issue. Have a 4-lane single-direction highway that ought to keep the traffic flowing? Hah! AI will use only one lane for some reason.So in reality, this game is closer to 8/10. But because the devs DO ALLOW mods, almost all of the ""issues"" (which are really nitpicking on my part, apart from the traffic issue) can be solved and you, as a gamer, can have an almost completely free sandbox where you can do whatever you want.Just buy it already!"

I don't really feel like giving an in depth review lmao but it's really good.  Even though this isn't the only good thing about the game, I really enjoy sitting back and watching the city work.  There's a ton of detail when you zoom into your city.  It feels like the city is alive because all of the people are real because you can literally click on a person and track them throughout the day as they use transportation and go to their jobs.  That's only a little bit of the experience.. the other parts are the building.  I'm not gonna go deep into how the building works and how you actually build the cities but I really like it.  I love seeing the buildings start being constructed after you zone a part of the street.  Everything is so satisfying.

8218,ploovonik,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ploovonik/,1,,1,203.7,October,"22,",247,0,1,"I’m kinda conflicted, I really both like Cites: Skylines and Sim City. And I think they’re both VERY fine games. But I’m gonna tell ya why I think you should buy Cities: Skylines. It’s definitely been one of my favorite games to play this year because of how interesting of a game it is. Both C:S and SC do things better than each other, but I think Cities: Skylines may have a little bit more going for it just because of the intricacy of things.I really love how roads are done in this game. They’re done so much better than they are in Sim City. You can make some really nice cities with the roads in this game. I’m very thankful that I can be more creative with my roads in this game because I wasn’t really digging how they were done in Sim City. The creativity of your roads is only limited by your imagination. Another thing that I really appreciate about this game, is just when you reach about 80,000 people in a city and you get to see those nice skyscrapers because the way that you designed those roads. Definitely a really good thing for someone like me who just wants to make a nice lookin’ metropolis.Another aspect that I really appreciate about this game is DISTRICTS! They are so cool, they’re mostly industry focused but I thought they were cool nonetheless. Of course you can zone in the main part of your city with a district, and it gives you the amount of people living in it and how educated they are. But I like that I can specify a certain type of industry to either be oil, ore or farming. Something else that was a game changer for me was that I can purchase land! I thought that this was the coolest thing ever. Because in Sim City, it’s always been buy a square a of land and then after you finish that area you can’t expand it. But in C:S because you purchase land and with modding it’s even better. You can continue to make this burgeoning city and aren’t just limited to one square. And you can fully take advantage of the area you have, and when you’re done with it you can buy a new piece of land. In Sim City, you’re given a square that you can’t increase at all. And the only way to keep up the demand for population is by upgrading the roads. Which can be really monotonous, not that I thought it was a problem but still it was a bummer. If you have a mountain or a lake, it just becomes an obstacle that you can’t build around. And you’re always encouraged to build really boring square roads. Real city building games don’t limit the amount of area that you build in because they’re meant to be a sandbox. And because the land area is so much bigger in C:S you can fully take advantage of everything because of the space that you have. Another good part about Cities: Skylines is that it’s on Steam! Well not only being on Steam in general, but also being able to have access to the Workshop. I think you should start nodding this game as soon as you can because it can fix some of the issues with roads and stuff. And also because you can stop playing just the vanilla maps and try something community made.The biggest hurdle about this game is the traffic, that and ensuring goods and services. Which is a part of traffic control. There is a small learning curve with learning to making effective roads, but I’m sure you might enjoy this game if you’ve played another game like Sim City. Verdict: Definitely buy it I bought it for 7 dollars during a sale, definitely something that you should pick up."

I spent a lot of time deciding if I wanted to chance another City Simulation game by getting Cities: Skylines. I am so glad I did as it continues to be the best one at the moment.

Buy the game on sale, for $10 USD, like I did. If you like it, you got an awesome deal. If not, no biggie -- it's only ten bucks.DLC are what keep developers like Colossal Order and Paradox in business. They make games you'll play for hundreds of hours, and purchasing the DLC ensures that they'll continue working on a title, giving everyone free updates, and adding new content to keep the game fresh.   Which is why you don't need to start right off with the DLC.  Once you find yourself a hundred hours deep, you can add on stuff to make it more interesting. But in all likelihood, even at that point you'll still be discovering loads of cool management features even in the base game.  Get the DLC when your time spent makes the expenditure worth it. The cool thing about the add-ons with this game, (unlike CK2 or EU4), is that they can be applied immediately to your already existing cities -- you don't need to start a new save.  At least, it worked that way for After Dark: I could immediately start adding new buildings and re-zoning for tourism and leisure.  That's some dope crack!"

The availability of a steam workshop. +++The balance between simulation and design +++The bad?From my experience,The game now is locking up in several repeating loading screens and the dis-ability to play your game offline.This game is bloatware to me. Turns out that is only on first run/boot of game.The creation progress for someone new to the game is frustrating, especially because starter road and other stuff is locked for the duration of the tutorial. Which makes it hard to prethink and prepare you city for a grand scale-able increase, so the bulldozer is there and wil be used too often. and that will waste precious starter money. Especially since Building can be a pain, first I had trouble bending road before I knew of the bend button, the tutorial didn't help there.The tutorial also didn't warn me that you need plenty of space for electrical towers and I vaguely rememeber the last time I played having trouble with the irrigation system which also it doesn't prep you for.Lastly some of the UI could need a bit of brushing up. When you select left sided driving or right it can get confusing if it's on or off. This game will frustrate you and possibly reload a dozen times. But for the patient and steadfast, this could be a quite enjoyable simulation.I am NOT recommending this game because the tutorial (un-skip-able) is not helpful enough to give you the tools to make great cities, because that what you want to make right?

It has many features to build a beautiful city and with player made assets it makes the game even better as you can incorporate businesses from your own country.  The game is extremely detailed I love how you can zoom in to store fronts and to peeps.  You can see them walking dogs going to work or school. When you click on a peep you get information on them like name, where they live where they are going. I find this very interesting and detailed. You can click on a parked car and it will tell you its owner.  This game has lots of expatiations that are not even costly to buy which is very good and they hold lots off offers. If you like city building games this game is endless hours of fun, with plenty of tools to build what you want."

The first is unrealistic traffic. All traffic seems to just occupy one lane and one lane only. For some reason, the game decides to have all lanes point in multiple directions and I guess the AI gets confused and to make it simpler they all simply use a single lane. For smaller towns, this isn't a problem but late game traffic becomes horrendous and your cities are barely navigatable and travel times between workplaces, homes, schools, parks, etc. become really high. Also, the AI prefers to drive personal vehicles rather than use public transport. One good public transport method to use in cities is the metro and despite the fact that a large number of citizens are using it, this is equal to about 5% of the total population which is unrealistic as a lot of people prefer public transport over vehicles in real life as it's much cheaper, more economic and commuting is shorter. There are other aspects of realism like the travel speed of Cims, cars and the general game speed are extremely fast, so fast, it looks like Cims are sliding across the ground as they travel at the speed of a moped on the pavement. This isn't a major problem, it simply breaks immersion. But traffic is definitely a major problem and the devs need to change the AI's route script.That's literally, in my opinion, the only problem the game suffers, are the game's unrealistic traffic and AI route plotting and common sense. Also, the game speed is too fast and should be reduced. But thankfully the game has steam's workshop support and good scripters can make mods to fix these issues, but unfortunately, these mods can have their own issues and may not be compatible with specific game versions or cause texture and shader issues or corrupt save files. In my opinion, just stick to mods until the devs fix the game's issues or wait until a new and better city building games get released and play that. DLCs are pretty overpriced but their content is reasonably good enough. Apart from the other issues I mentioned, there's nothing else I really find problematic and to be honest it is a fun, interesting and playable, well-optimized game."

If you liked SimCity+++ then this is definately another helping from that pot.If you didn't, or don't, then my opinion is probably of little value.What else can one really do but compare this with the prior art that clearly was all the inspiration behind Cities:Skylines...It is certainly more refined in some places, polished - focusing on the micromanagement that made the likes of SimCity/2000/2/3/4 the A-type fly traps that they were.  Although, it suffers from the same affliction of all the delightfully pure simulations - that : without an engaging narrative and a driving story the ultimate outcome is going to be patterned repetition, stagnation and eventual boredom.  The type of boredom that gets bronzed and mounted.. in a prized fish sort of way.Of course this is not to say you wont get many hours out of it, oh no - this game is truly an amazing investment with fantastic replays and self set challenges and achievements.. but, expect the end result to always be the same; and final reward a fundamentally etherial creature.Like all icecream you can only consume so much in a sitting before you either get brainfreeze or bored.. no matter how fancy the spoon or selection of custom sprinkles.Love it - will wholly recommend.

Annoyingly, every time I load up that save file, within 30 minutes it not only crashes, it crashed my entire computer giving me a blue screen of death. No other game I own does this... This consistently happens every time I load up this one save file.I'm hoping the save file is just corrupt, but it's really messed up that I lost literally everything I've ever done in this game.Because of that, I guess I can say, if this looks like the kind of game you will really like, you probably will. if you are on the fence about it, or think it might be boring and unrewarding, it probably will be.Even though I am probably not going to play it ever again because of losing my city, I can't give this game a negative review, because I feel like it does what it says it does really well.

If you've played SimCity-franchise games and hated the hell out of that last debacle EA puked out, I cannot recommend this highly enough.1. Great big maps for starting, various 'connections' from highway, rail, air, ship to consider.2. Maps are expandable as you progress (ie. you can buy another plot of land adjacent and continue sprawling).3. The economics are tight, but intuitive and easily balanced if you have experienc with this type of game (took me two or three cities to get one cash-positive enough to build up a couple of million in surplus).4. Wide variety of features, building types and other stuff that unlock gradually in progression mode.5. Fantastic integration of game-asset editor-steam workshop. Easily the best I've ever seen. You can go from designing a map, or a highway turnpike, to testing it in a live-environment, to uploading it within a few clicks.This game is everything I've ever hoped for in a city-builder, right down to the ability to name every street, district and citizen (probably, I hadn't thought to try that until now).I mean seriously, I followed the donut truck around town for half an hour one night watching him haul vanloads of donuts to the rail freight depot to ship out of town."

My experiences with it are threefold and could have been fixed in that long time, 1] it isnt fun for long for those looking for a light sim city 4 replacement, this game is very much more of a spend months perfecting one map simulator experience. The challenge has an artificial gamey feel to it, so get that sandbox mentality or get bored.2] which would be fine except that there is so much conspicuously missing from the base game, and in DLCs. To not feel halfbaked; Skylines needs you to start out spending a lot of time digging for mods. Very sad the developers clearly have expected the modding community to do so much of their work for them. 3] the UI is not up for the task, i mean you get through it; but it is very poorly put together and is tedious to navigate. This would be a no brainer purchase with an all DLC till recent year platinum edition for $40. But its just meh and halfbaked for the premium they still expect. Get it and your wanted dlc's on steep sale and be prepared to spend many many hours gathering up mods. Many that add feature and assets that should have already been in the game.I like this game, i've played a lot of it.

Not to mension if you get boared with this game, their are endless mods and DLC you can add to make your game experience even better. Some of my favorite features are the expandle tiles, Steam Workshop, and the piping / Eletrical system. The radio stations are great i only wish their was a mod for Dimond City Radio from Fallout 4 which has some of the best music in that game.

The game has wonky traffic AI at times, unrealistic population density, a lack of seasons, and  other minor faults that don't effect game-play as much as just don't jive with my preferences. But all these problems have been minimized, if not fixed (except for the always summer or winter that's a game engine issue) by the modding community.So if you haven't purchased Cities yet, you should, although wait for a sale, the base game goes 75% off quite often anymore.

Many mods and assets are broken by version updates and you just can't tell until you load it into the game and it crashes without telling you which mod or asset did it.  So load your mods and assets slowly.* Too much DLC, with a total price way beyond what someone is willing to pay to enjoy a full experience.Upsides:* Looks gorgeous with a full set of mods in.* Can make cities that are way better than Simcity could.* Has the ability to customize almost every last aspect of the game with full modding and editors.* More relaxing than Factorio, while traffic still offers enough management interest to keep you mentally occupied for hours.* A mostly viable game without buying any DLC when combined with enough of the right mods.

I'll say however they have a wonderful modding community with several big authors who have made a name for themselves howwever, once you start adding mods  the game kinda takes a dump and as a user you are responsible for everything after that ive never had a game run so unstable before and the numerous games ive modded from Skyrim,fallout,minecraft,justcasue 2 &3 and GTA 5 were way more stable than this. the game in itself is great but I just wish somehow mods for this game were more stable. good game if you play it just vanilla all positive vibes there.EDIT: SYS specs 6800k with 32GB ram @ 3000Mhz and 1080's in SLI and only 30fps so be advised you need a high end system."

If you love city simulation games, then you should look no further. The core game is amazing in itself. But then when you add a well supported modding community, this game is endless. The development team keeps fixing and adding DLC. The DCL in a few instances might not add as much as its worth, but they keep innovating. I think overall what they are adding is great and price appropriate! I really appreciate that the developers embellish core features and let the modding community take on content and advanced additions. I think people forget that not everyone likes having overly complicated features that the community offers.   If however you want to extend your city to the brink, then there are really some Kick@$$ mods. Everything form a volumetric rain and drainage system to changing police cars sirens. Absolutely amazing, I highly recommend!! Pros- - Everything SimCity should have but couldn’t be! - Modding community is highly supported and amazing - Easy learning curve- Great graphics and styleCons-- DLC’s are both a pro and a con in terms of features vs price. But overall not bad. You don’t have to buy them to enjoy the game."

The sheer number of workshop elements are making this game a game without limits. You can build whatever you want and enjoy hours and hours of playing. There is only 2 things I don't like as they make the game somewhat unrealistic:1. The traffic and thus the number of roads needed is way too high. When you have a city with 30.000 inhabitants you have to build around 4 highway exits and several multi-lane roads to keep traffic somewhat flowing. And public transport does not fix the problem.2. My city looks huge, but the population is small. In several story high skyscrapers there are only 60 people? Come on... But maybe this is better because imagine the traffic. No actually, I don't want to imagine. Traffic is horror xD"

Very realistic except for certain things like the way buildings place down and there parking lots which makes it look weird. Many great mods in Workshop. If you want a city building game that you cant get away from, this is for you. Worth buying. Many things that make this game so realistic is environment, weather, polution, investment, taxes, economy, policies, and so much more. If you play without infinite money it is very challenging to maintain for you have to keep earning money and not lose so much on payments and running costs. Maintaining water, sweage, electricity, and otehr services is challenging for u have a tight budget. If you want infinite money, go to Content manager, mods, and look for infinite money and enable. Now. What are you waiting for? Go and build your dream city! (It is also worth buying DLC's. Especially Natrual Disasters, Snow Fall, Mass  Transit, After Dark, Green Cities, Park Life, and more. There are also 3 free DLC's to get. Sports Day, Chritsmas Radio, and pearls by the East. I rate this game a 9/10. (Powerful Gaming PC needed!)"

Alot of people are saying it goes way far and above it with even rumours of introducing malware and it collects far more im not going to say if its 100% true but i dont know the truth must lay somewhere in the middle or else people wouldnt be so upset by it.my personal feelings: the launcher sucks there saying it allows them to do more. i dont buy that for one second its more like an advertisement page (after it take a few minutes to load) theres just stuff plastered everywhere dlc this dlc that this that heres our social media platforms come follow us blah blah blah.hint paradox and colossol order everyone knows you have social media platforms heck the games main menu reminds us, if anyone wanted to follow you they would of already done it if they don't they don't i dont care about your social media platforms at all personally i just start up my steam and play your game. Look at microsoft in the past trying to push stuff down peoples throats it never worked never will.now back on track a bit with the launcher, it simply wont work for people and some guys like me who even have a nvme m.2 ssd have to wait a minute or 2 to get a bunch of ads for dlc and social media platforms shoved in our faces to fight through that menu to click play on the game. then after getting into the game the whole left and right side of the menu is plauged with the same stuff once is enough thanks. OH ALSO to add to it even if you own the dlc its shoved in your face to top it off i have over 1200 hours into this beautiful game it pains me to click that thumbs down cause the game itself is amazing so the thumbs down is for shady practices i have bought every dlc besides the art one's at times i even defended your dlc practice cause i think they are worth it.this though i cannot defend its 1 step to far i was thinking of purchasing other paradox games cause i heard they were great and i dont own any, well my moneys gonna stay in my wallet.comments are open if anyone has anything to ad or if i should make corrections."

Currently having problems with transport but there's heaps of guides on YouTube (Imperial Jedi is easy to watch and learn from and he knows his stuff, and I'm about to use an industrial park plan created by a guy called Akruas which I'm hoping will fix my gridlock). Once I've unlocked all the achievement buildings and monuments I'll be downloading some mods and starting a brand new, even better city with all the tips and tricks I've picked up along the way, and I've also added all the DLC to my wishlist so I've got hundreds of hours more entertainment yet to come.

But in my opinion that is a lot of the fun of the game, to try and figure out where you've made a mistake, and it's so satisfying when you finally figure out a great way to solve the problem.The basic game is very good in itself. But for me the fun really started when i took a deeper look into the workshop items and mods, because holy smokes, in there you can find anything.With some mods, my current city is up to 320k population. and still growing rapidly, I even terraformed part of my map to host a huge dam to power the city with electricity instead of having 100's of wind turbines.And terraformed another part of my map to have a few beautiful waterfalls aswell.

Some may play the game because it's relaxing or because they want to roleplay something.When you pick up the game at first you will strugle a lot, but after you manage to get  your first city going, you are gonna have a lot of fun. For the first 30 hours (+- depends on your learning curve) the game is really good. But after I established 2 or 3 cities to the goal I first assigned to them it became bit boring. That's why I bought the DLC's. They provide much content and new goals, new chalenges. Every DLC provided me with another 20-30 hours of gameplay value. Now that I'm on around 110 hours of playtime, the game doesn't seem that interesting to me.Many will say that there is much content in the workshop to contribute to that and they are absolutely correct. For a lot of people, as well as youtubers, this is enough content to keep them playing. However these mods aren't changing the mechanics of the game.The coding of the game is really good. So far I haven't seen another game with a mod support that well integrated. Hats down to the developers for this!In game the physics are behaving very realisticly. The water is very well made (except when you make a dam tsunami), also well animated. Every aspect of your city is connected and one thing will affect another thing.This is also the best traffic simulator I've ever seen. (hats down to the developers again!). It represends the traffic in a very realistic way, and if you buy the after dark DLC, there are rush hours and exc. which contributes to the realism.All in all, I'm very happy with my purchase, if it wasn't for the challenge, there are many other ways someone could enjoy the game that I haven't covered.9/10, would reccomend again."

Of all the games I own, this is one of my three absolute favorites. The Steam community makes this the most conveniently moddable game I have ever seen; the workshop spans pages of mods and assets to shape your game to be whatever you want it to be, however you want to play it. Furthermore, the in-game content editor allows you to create maps and assets for the community with such ease, which allows the workshop to be filled with thousands of unique buildings, landmarks, and mods that make the game a sheer beauty. I hope you all enjoy playing Cities; it is super fun and super worth it."

No. The game is barely playable in its basic form. The base game could not even compare to Sim City 4. It is also is not as fun Sim city 2013. This game had a lot of different goals and achievements which can lead to hours and hours of game-play trying to figure out how to optimize each map for optimal resource harvesting. However, Cites Skylines has an amazing community of players, modders and asset makers that makes the game great and very realistic. With saying that though once you start modding and downloading assets the game can become very unstable if you are not careful. The interface that is used to add, download and organize the mods and assets is less then adequate, and can become complicated with assets that contain props and dependencies. It is also extremely slow and temperamental. In addition, the game also needs to be better optimized for multi-cored systems and higher end graphics cards to improved performance in the later stages of the game. Overall though I played over 1000 hours so once you get a good city going it can be hard to peel yourself away from the screen. Once you get over what the game is missing, the graphical and interface challenges, the game can be quite.. addictive."

Excellent gameplay and beautiful assets make for a wonderful experience and its so easy to sink hours into this game and not even realize it.  Definitely epitomizes the ""just one more thing"" addictive gameplay that keeps players engaged.  There are some bugs in the game however and it needs to be said that traffic AI leaves ALOT to be desired and alot of time can be spent just working around the congestion caused by idiotic cars who only use one lane of a three lane road for five miles straight.  Also the lack of multi track subway systems without a mod is a huge oversight.  Mod are plentiful and theres literally over a hundred thousand different things in the workshop to suit any city situation.     DLCs are getting a bit expensive for the amount of content they contain but the small size of the studio and the obvious love and effort they put into the base game make them an easy pill to swallow.  Cities Skylines is all you want in a city building sim, amazing gameplay, great community support, and the ability to realize your craziest city dreams.... HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED"

I picked it up on sale, and during the first few hours it really did a good job of showing me the ropes. The mechanics, interface and design are all intuitive. Yes, with time you realize additional menus that make things even better, but the game is definitely easier to pick up on then some other simulators out there (I’m looking at you planet coaster). Visually, the game is very pleasing.Within a few hours my city had grown to a respectable size. Little did know what troubles were in store for me! one word.... TRAFFIC...... I made some poor design choices when placing my roads. Couple that with poor placement of industry, commercial zones too many high rise residential areas. ineffective public transport system and you have the ingredients for a disaster. Traffic became so bad that my services couldn’t get around to clearing out garbage, putting out fires, moving the dying, fighting crime and so on. People started to move out and the next milestone of my cities growth was out of reach (mile stones unlock additional tech for your city i.e. better power plants, new buildings, trains, airplanes, etc...). I went back to the drawing board, did some research on road design, interchanges and started to build a better city next time round.What makes this game even more fantastic is the wonderful community. Tons of videos and guides are out there to help you and give you new perspectives. Additionally, the modding community has developed some wonderful material for this game. Some of it is a must for when you play. For example, mods for additional bus designs or new car types, or different buildings. Or pre-created interchanges to save you time building them yourself. I advise you do some research into the best mods and utilize them to make your experience even better."

I've lost entire weekends to crazy city builds, and I'm not sorry for that time lost.It's also one of those games that when the DLC comes out, I'm actually looking forward to it, to see what gets added to the game. I learned to tolerate and evaluate DLC because of this game, honestly: I grew up in the cartridge age, where the full product had to typically be in the cartridge on release, and couldn't be patched or updated in any user-accessible manner (at the time). Adding on full features makes it worth the extra handful of bucks here and there, and keeps the developers paid."

If there were a statistic for road rage incidents, I am sure it would top the charts.  Crime, fire, medical emergencies?  My roads look like a fireworks display of emergency lights, compounded by the fact that they are all stuck in bumper to bumper traffic.  Step aside Chicago, there is no way you could reach my homicide rate.  One might think that I would be frustrated at this point.  Not at all.  I've never built a city before.

There is a very large community for this game on the Steam Workshop.Do not buy this game if you don't have the minimum RECCOMENDED specs, as the game will run very slowly even without many mods or assets installed (I never have an FPS above 30 with a decent sized city, and I have 8GB RAM, i5 and a GTX 970). This game goes on sale pretty often, often getting discounted 75%, to $7.50, which is fantastic value. The DLC tends to be discounted 50% during these sales as well.

This game by far is the best SimCity game i have ever played - the interface of building is so much better as far as placement of roads, optional elevation - types of avenues, single lane and highways goes. They have come a along way since the first SimCity. the addition of districts is also super cool - now you can have a massive industrial area in the center of your city without creating a deadly amount of population. The addition of tourism options is also handy. I also really like the way they revamped the public transit structure - it is now way more effective and alot easier to use.I could go on and on about this game. Overall i give it a 11/10. absolutely love it."

The main focus of the game is managing traffic and public transit systems though that really shouldn't be a surprise.

The base game comes with enough material that you wont even look at the DLC until you've put about 50 hours in, and they rejuvenate the game playing experience everytime. I was worried about the controls being hard to learn since my only previous experience with city builders was tropico and the Sim City franchise, but the game gives you freedom without throwing you to the wolves. When you first start, you have basic utilities, and you gain new amnenities as you progress in your city building, which allows you a chance to gain familiarity with the controls without the high risk pressure. Cities Skylines is a relaxing, complex, creative game well worth the price tag. 10/10 would recommend"

8605,Lambda Six Two,https://steamcommunity.com/id/allabaster11/,1,,1,39.8,December,"22,",326,0,1,"Cities Skylines is currently the premier city building game with other games pretty much non-existent at this point (SimCity was killed when they introduced the always online feature and made it mandatory to use Origin, so yeah at this point I wouldn’t consider SimCity fit to compete anymore). The game has all the bases of a good city building sim plus some extra features that were specific to this game. For example, the free hand drawing district mechanic that allows for very specific areas to be designated as a district regardless if its full of holes or a very tiny 1 block area in the centre of another district. The game is still being updated patched and given free content, which really extends the lifetime of this game. The game is also extremely mod friendly with thousands of mods available in Steam Workshop with modders making a lot of incredibly stuff. This games approach to modding is honestly the best way to keep a game alive since it allows a lot of content to be created by not just the developers but the players themselves which gives limitless potential for this game (My personal favourite is a unique building but is actually the Kongou Battleship which I just place at the end of a pier to give the illusion of a Museum Battleship). The game has great music with a lot of variety within each radio station but the downside of any game that has continuous looping music is that after a few hours it will becomes repetitive so I recommended switching radio stations  often or getting a radio station mod to increase the amount of songs in the game (also the chirp notification sound is extremely annoying and the messages in them are not that varied so it’s nice for a while but I turned it off within the first 3 hours). This games DLC are generally good with some DLC almost mandatory for the game. These good DLC are such as Mass Transit which really expands the transportations options of the game, Snowfall which gives a new factor to work with (providing heat for housing) and it also just a cool seasonal look for the game, and After dark which really gives the city a life like feel with the lights coming on at night. The other DLC’s such as Natural Disasters are more of a gimmicky thing with a city destruction mechanic which doesn’t personally I don’t enjoy too much since I worked hard to make a huge city and a shame to destroy it (Green cities DLC I can’t comment but it might just be like Snowfall but not game changing experience like After Dark). All others that I didn’t mention are either cosmetic or aesthetic DLC’s which don’t change gameplay but just add new building types. All in all, this is a great game for an experience city sim builder with a lot of DLC and options to mod the game. For a beginner city builder, this game can be overwhelming with all the tabs and options but focus on a single aspect of the game and build slowly and even a beginner can grasps this games mechanic quite easily. So, if you have a thirst for city building games this is the game that will quench that thirst."

I do think the dlc's are a bit overpriced when just released but buying them right away or waiting on sales is totally up to you. But, I am gonna add this even though it has nothing to do with the vanilla game; the steam workshop community is amazing but that in combination with the DLC's is eating on your performance. Just keep that in mind when you want to buy this game. I wish the traffic/ pathfinding of AI would be different/ better or more realistic but there are ways to work around it, or work with. In the end, this game is fantastic and has a lot to offer. If you like building/ simulation games and such and you don't have Cities: Skylines in your library than shame on you!

I don't care if it makes it easier to keep up with news, give me free things, pay my bills or do my laundry for me, I simply do not want another launcher on my system for a game that I actually enjoyed until now.If you really feel the need to create a useless overhead piece of software to a game, give me at least the option to not use it and disable it.Otherwise, can I request my money for everything back now that the product I bought is no longer what I payed for and agreed to use?"

The DLC packs aren't cheap but definitely not overpriced either, and as long as you don't want them right on release they go on sale every once in a while.The community is very active and the amount of mods and additional assets is HUGE. For almost everything (from sewage and garbage treatment to new buses and trams) you have a wide variety ranging from ""just new skin, same function as vanilla model"" to versions that are already close to cheating (like a waste recycler that creates energy without causing any noise or pollution).I'd consider some mods almost mandatory so you can properly enjoy the game.

If you enjoy planning and designing you will enjoy how the game plays, but there are no objectives to complete, neither missions or scenarios.

A fantastic game."
