I finally did it today. This game literally took me back in time to where I was playing The Complete Saga on the DS and the Wii. It was a much needed ""one last time"" event that took me back before I become a legal adult. And although I can never go back in time, this game certainly did just that... except for the fact that its not a DS that I could take with me where ever I wanted or a Wii that that kept crashing every few weeks."

Now I will get into what I view as the pros and cons of the game. SPOILERS?Pros: 1. Lego humor has never been funnier2. The game is open world3. Ship combat is fun4. The visuals are stunning 5. There is so much to do6. Taking a capital ship is fun7. There are so many details in this game8. Can't believe I have to say this but in today's gaming industry we finally have a game that isn't a mess at launch 9. Side quests are fun Cons: 1. My biggest gripe is that when it comes to the actual missions they feel lacking in content, they could have added more from each episode for sure. My biggest issue with this is that there is no level for the opening battle scene from Revenge of the Sith, that was my favorite level in Complete Saga. That may just be me though 2. This isn't really a con for me because I am definatly a more casual gamer, and this is a game for children, but the game is very easy. If your tired of Dark Souls and Elden Ring and just want to relax look no further. This game is for sure worth the 2 year delay and the $60Edit: After taking the Death Star this game is better"

Feels like the government or some other agency should take a look at this sort of scam thing. Why i said its a scam? because it influence my buying decision when i first bought the game.

34,BILLIE WESKER,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DEATHXRONIN/,"1,019",11,1,269.6,April,"6,",194,43,1,The definitive LEGO Star Wars game Pretty much covers Episodes I-IX with content and references to the other films / shows. One of the few times Deluxe Content is actually worth it plus Pre-order. I've played these from the first installment and mastered every game since then going on almost 20 years. This game truly captures the familiar vibes while adding its own modern twists. Gameplay is pretty smooth and the combat reminds me a little bit of DMC / GOW. I love how you can do Mute Voices with Retro Graphics. Performance runs like water even on an older PC and the graphics are crisp. Runs about as well as Consoles. I played on there first before getting early access here. You can do Controller as well as Keyboard and Mouse. I rate this: 100% True JediMay the Force be with you and God Speed.
35,Hank Hill,https://steamcommunity.com/id/STEFANDOlphin/,426,9,1,84.2,April,"8,",168,0,1,"I want to make the point that this game is not LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga. I know people wanted it to be, but it isn’t. The mechanics are different, the levels are different, the style is different, everything is different except for the story. There have been a lot of complaints about the level design being “too easy” or the levels are too short. Again, I want to point out that LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga came out 15 years ago and LEGO and Travelers Tales have changed their format, level design, and overall gameplay a few times over since then. I personally did not want a “remastered” game, I wanted a new game, one that would change the formula of LEGO games. I would say that this game definitely does that. To be clear, at the writing of this review, I have completed 6 of the 9 films on story mode alone (1,2,3,4,5,7).Looking to the complaint of the short levels, I will agree, the levels are significantly shorter in this game than in the past. That does not mean, however, that there is less content. In addition, I think the voice actors do a great job of summarizing the Star Wars story with letting direct quotes and general set pieces direct the story. The one thing that seems to be more interesting about this game is that the open world is very integrated into the story. You have to go from one mission to the other (for the most part) by traveling to the planets yourself, or the different areas of said planets. The story definitely feels shorter, but I would say it reminds me of a “spark notes” version of Star Wars, especially with the voice acting in the game adding depth to the story. The mumble mode is a fun nostalgic call back to the old games, but in my unpopular opinion, it does not work for this game. The reason why it worked in the old games was because the characters mouths don’t move, but they are fully voice acted with detailed mouth movement. The Clone Wars voice actors sound phenomenal in the prequel trilogy and would highly recommend playing through with mumble mode off. Of course, I will play some stuff with mumble mode on for funs sake.For those worried about trekking over everywhere to get to missions, there is a designated area in the menu to play just the missions again once it has been played through on story mode. This game still has a lot of unlockables, lots of upgrading, and plenty of time to spend hanging out in the Star Wars universe. The combat in this game is really new and exciting with “combos” being implemented as well as interesting mechanics with both lightsabers and blasters.Overall, I would say this game is an exciting, fun, new aspect of not only the Star Wars franchise, but also LEGO games in general.10/10Pro:Fun nostalgic callback to my childhoodInteresting new levelsOpen world is refreshing and seamless into the storyCompletionist dreamVoice Acting is wonderful (Prequel trilogy with Clone Wars voice acting is *wonderful*Mumble modeCons:Levels/Story is slightly shorter than previous installments of LEGO gamesOpen world can be overwhelming when starting offSome small bugstl;dr – game is super fun, “this is where the fun begins”10/10"

Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga includes the Story of all 9 Movies in a compressed way. The cutscenes are cut down to the very basic information’s of the Story, which isn’t a bad thing directly, since the Lego games were never meant for long drawn out cutscenes. It can be hard to follow what’s going on thou in case you haven’t seen the Movies. Over the course of the Story, you visit all Iconic locations from the franchise like you would expect. You can choose to either begin the game at Episode 1, 4 or 7, depending on the order you want to experience them.                       The gameplay is mostly the same as in the old games, destroy everything and loot studs! The game isn’t too hard and you don’t lose to much in case you die, its designed to be a relaxing, enjoyable experience and they definitely succeed with that. But thankfully, they did improve the game systems. The 380 Characters you can unlock are sorted into different categories like Jedi, Hero, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Droid etc. Each category has different skills you can invest into which can be upgraded in 3 Tiers each on top. You get skill points by collecting Special Bricks in each level, which are rewarded for different goals and challenges.The combat system also got a general overhaul and is now more versatile compared to the old games.   Beside that you can also collect Mini-kits, Vehicles and of course, new Characters. The levels feel bigger to me like in the old games and more open ended. Each is filled with a ton of Stuff to do, if you enjoy collecting Items and upgrades, you will find your happiness here. And like in the old games, the levels are designed in a way, that not everything can be looted the first time you visit a location. Some items need talents or Characters you will only obtain later to reach.                The Graphic is a lovely mix of detailed Lego Models and Bricks/Structures and a more real general atheistic of the environments, which works out flawlessly in my eyes. The Audio is really good, it sounds like you would Star Wars expect to sound.                          If you enjoyed the old Lego games, you will immediately feel at home in the Skywalker Saga, all the new features, and a game that can be enjoyed solo or in coop with a friend, with the good Lego Humor on top guarantees a good time. If you are new to the Series and/or just found the game because you are a Star Wars fan and you are on the lookout for a relaxing game that can keep you busy for hours, or just for a while after a long day, I can fully recommend Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga to you as well!"

Well, it probably won't be a real review. I think it will be more of a story about me and the initial conflict about the game.I've been putting off this „review“ for weeks because I don't even know exactly why this is so important to me and I just can't find the right words.It may well be that this has something to do with the partly negative reviews, which I can also understand somewhere. But also because I was a bit disappointed with the game myself at first and I needed some distance from the game to think about it. After all, I've been waiting for this game for a long time and I'm really looking forward to it. Admittedly, it's also one of the few games that I bought right after it was released.I downloaded the game, started it and then went to the menu. Let's see what has changed. Yes, hello, what is that? That's a menu, a real one. No longer such a spartan menu as in the other Lego games where you can only adjust the volume, effects and a few graphic settings. Yes oops. I can adjust a lot of things. That's amazing. I really like that. A few settings made and off you go. Hm, now I have to decide which level or which part to start with. Well, since I'm as old as the Star Wars films themselves, I went with the ""classic"" variety, the order of release. So in this case Episode IV. So the first level and... ""wow, what's that,"" that looks mega. That's absolutely amazing what had an effect on me graphically and playfully. I would not have expected that in my life. So get into the fray and diligently cut up and tear down everything that comes in my way and yikes, what's up now? As ? Why is the level over now? I've only just played what feels like 5 minutes? What's happening ? , I look at the cutscene when my wife comes home and says: oh cool, the new Lego Star Wars. And how is it ? Yeah, um, I don't know, I said. Actually totally great, but I just played a level and it was over after what felt like 5 minutes. How can that be ? It wasn't like that in The Complete Saga. Exactly, that wasn't it and that's what made it so difficult for me and somehow I didn't enjoy it anymore. Of course, I then took a closer look at what had been written about the game so far and especially the negative reviews and the more I read, the “worse” things got for me too. At some point I didn't feel like playing the game anymore that I really left it there for days.One morning when I opened Steam at work I came across these two videos:When I watched these videos it kind of “clicked” for me and when I got home in the evening I grabbed my kids and said, listen, you have to play the new Lego Star Wars now.How you make your kids play Lego Star Wars... Well, I wouldn't necessarily call it that. I'd rather say I've changed the  priorities a bit, but joking aside, I asked them if they wanted to do that because I assumed they weren't averse to it anyway and because they've also enjoyed playing Lego games so far.But since I didn't want to buy the game again, family sharing and my own score had to be used and I couldn't continue playing myself for the time being. But it doesn't matter, it was a good thing because after a short time I heard the first giggles, laughter and phrases like ""oh, how cool is that"" or ""that's mega"" from the rooms.Unlike my son, who, like his father, first destroys everything in the area to see what is left at the end and only then deals with the rest, my daughter prefers to spend time exploring Tatooine, taking her time in peace to stroll around the area and see what there is to discover, who to talk to and what else you can do. In the following days, more and more friends joined them. It got louder, wilder and more and more difficult to get the kidz away from the game.What I mean to say is that Lego games are actually primarily designed for children, even though the games have been enjoying increasing popularity among (younger) adults for quite some time. Nevertheless, one shouldn't forget that children (by that I don't mean all adults for the moment) have a different point of view and also value other things. For the moment, a child doesn't really care if R2D2 suddenly can't hoover anymore, as long as it's even aware of it. For me, the character editor has never been relevant, except for the respective achievement. Others do, and that's fine, but there will certainly be reasons from the developers that some things in the game just aren't the way we used to be. Maybe even licensed. I think you can't always have everything, no matter how nice it is.When I asked them what they think of the game, everyone said it's the coolest Lego (Star Wars) game they've played. Yes, but what about The Complete Saga? I mean how does it compare to that?The answers were quite simple and unanimous.  They are just two different games and they have nothing to do with each other.The point that was so decisive and important for me. Considering the game as a sequel, remake or whatever, apart from the technical changes/innovations, it's fair to say it's bad.But that's not it. In no way.It is a new, independent and, above all, different game that should not be compared. Even if it's a bit difficult at times. But if you can do that, then the game is also a lot of fun.The Star Wars story is told more in the cutscenes. These are, in this case, also shortened to be suitable for children and the dialogues actually only consist of the well-known quotes. Strictly speaking, Lego Star Wars doesn't actually tell a story, but is more of a commentary track that emphasizes silly jokes. These jokes usually consist of the characters suddenly deviating from the script and doing something different, unexpected or stupid.So if you haven't seen the films, it can happen that these references aren't funny without an explanation and don't make any sense in relation to the story either. The game is clearly aimed at fans, but it's also suitable for children.The Skywalker Saga is a Lego game I've been expecting in 2022 and have been wanting for years.The fact that Lego games aren't perfect, that one or the other doesn't work that well and that the level of difficulty isn't particularly demanding is simply part of it for me and it doesn't bother me in the least.✅ Extremely extensive game✅ large open world✅ great design✅ typical Star Wars music✅ Slapstick humor✅ funny animation✅ new melee mode / combos✅ new collectibles✅ different skills✅ high replay value❌ Missions could be a little bit longer❌ Puzzles repeat themselves❌ maybe a little too easy❌ Gameplay not motivating in the long run❌ Camera position not always optimal"

57,N-V US,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NVUSAttitude/,132,3,1,111.5,April,"23,",334,0,1,"100%'d the game so I've done every scripted thing you can do and what can I say about this.Well for fans who wanted a LEGO Star Wars game as good as TCS since it came out, this is the answer you're looking for. It's humor and zany cutscenes have devolved since the older games, but the tradeoff is a complete rework including redone levels, an excellent combat system and an expansive galaxy that has a decently immersive effect.First, the Story: The story does a more accurate job of retelling the saga with tons of decent voiceacting (you can turn off voice acting with mumble mode to have an older LEGO experience. I will say though, mumble mode isn't single mumbles, they mumble out entire sentences, so it feels a little weird), the cutscenes work with or without voiceacting which is a surreal dynamic experience that the devs get my kudos on, but the levels themselves are really short and kind've disappointing. They introduce ""level challenges"", there are 3 in every level and they're alternative ways of going about each one. They're fun in general, but if you're trying to 100% they can be a nightmare sometimes. Minikits have been reduced from 10 to 5 per level, which was debatably my favorite part about replaying a level. Overall, cutscene and immersion-wise, the levels are fun to play and have the same great puzzle-solving they've always had, replayability is quite low though.First-Time through 9/10Free-Play 100% 6/10 (basically, thank god they're short)Now Galaxy-Mode was easily the most fun I've had through the whole experience. Instead of collecting gold bricks to a grand total of 250, (using the Marvel Avengers game as the mold here since it's the last one I 100%'d, god it sucked), there are 1,160 bricks, (known as ""kyber bricks"") that are collectable through completing level challenges, collecting minikits, getting ""true jedi"" on each level, doing side quests among 33 planets, destroying kyber comets, smuggling, doing bounty hunts, and puzzles on each and every planet. It was a ton of fun to mark each planet off the list as I collected each planets' worth. Some quests can only be done if you've progressed through the story up until that point, or until you've done other side quests. Personally, I recommend playing the base game all the way through 4-6, 1-3, 7-9, THEN doing galaxy-mode, so there will be less holdups. In advance, there was only 1 planet that gave me trouble and it was Endor, my guess is, the fire VFX would keep spawning as you loaded new areas, and it wouldn't unload areas you're not in anymore so the constant fire VFX made it a laggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (However, entering a village hut loading zone, then exiting refreshed the lag, which led me to believe it was fire VFX that wouldn't unload.) Other than that, the quests and puzzles are really fun to complete.9/10, it is the after-story experience you want.I'll wrap it up here with the UI, combat/upgrade system, and the red bricks rework.So the UI for the most part is pretty straightforward, might take a bit of learning but once you have it down, it all makes sense, stuff goes where it should go, changing characters is a bit messy and if you have OCD about how you want your free-play characters organized, that might be a huge problem because thats the only place where the UI falters heavily. Once you play, you'll figure out what I mean.The combat system is EXTREMELY intricate, you have a third person firing mode with guns and saber-throwing. There's also cover you can hide behind (and rebuild if it gets destroyed) and shoot from if you want to play that way. The biggest highlight though is the melee combat system. You initiate combat with a standard attack which can then go into changeups like heavy attacks, uppercut moves, and spike moves, depending on which corresponding button you press. These changeups become extremely prevalent in the lightsaber boss duels which make you feel like you control how the corresponding movie-scene flows.The red brick rework has been made easier to manage and deal with, you don't collect red bricks, instead you collect ""Data cards"" (1 per particular planet) in galaxy mode. They aren't specific to certain extras, you get the data card and choose which extra you want. (I recommend not buying anything until you get your first data card and do the stud multiplier route, things are hella expensive this time around so I'd say focus on getting all multipliers before you buy anything else) That being said ""Stud magnet"" and ""Fast build"" aren't extras anymore, they're ""Upgrades""The upgrade system integrates things like collecting studs, building faster, sprinting quicker, having more health, doing more damage, etc. which is where kyber bricks come in, as they are used as it's currency, plus an additional stud fee. (Now this is the exception to my advice about ""not buying anything"", buy upgrades when you can) There are core upgrades and class upgrades for specific character types, (Jedi, Hero, Bounty Hunter, Scoundrel, Scavenger, Villain, Dark Side, Astromech Droids, and Protocol Droids.) all of which have their own abilities and uses.All of these features really make the experience flow a lot smoother and are a perfect 10/10 for me.TL;DR: buy the game if you've been wanting a decent Lego Star Wars game, things are different for the better, mumble mode is there, and if you get deluxe, you get classic character packs (if nostalgia is your thing) among other misc. character packs. red bricks have been changed into a more easily flowing system, and the combat = good.Big word of advice: once you're in galaxy mode, buy the rumor for the character ""Grummgar"", complete all the missions to get him and you get to run really ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fast around some of these bigger planets to complete your side quests."
58,iamzachhunter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/iamzachhunter/,601,16,1,193.9,April,"11,",32,26,1,"Lego Star Wars I/II/III/Complete Saga were four of my favorite video games as a young lad. I pre-ordered The Skywalker Saga a few days before its release; and at 100 hours of the game played, all 9 episodes completed, and 900 Kyber Bricks collected, I feel I can give an informed review. I will be judging the game on individual metrics, and then I'll give my final score.Exploration - 10/10If I could only mention one aspect of this game at exceeded my expectations, it would certainly be the vast galaxy laden with puzzles, side missions, and collectibles. I would hazard a guess that the average player will spend upwards of 200 hours achieving 100% completion of this game. The developers give the player the freedom to explore hub worlds immediately after discovering the planet; this allowed me to take frequent breaks from the episodic story to pursue all of the hidden collectibles throughout the worlds. In my opinion, the most fun part of this game is exploring the hub worlds. It is a completionist's paradise.Progression - 7/10I really appreciate when developers put time into erecting a progression system in their game - especially in an open-world genre; this allows players to work towards an eventual goal as they complete missions. In the early game, I looked forward to acquiring faster sprint speeds and stud magnet ranges. Later, I looked closer at the class-specific abilities and started investing in the Bounty Hunter and Dark Jedi. I wasn't expecting much in the way of a progression system from this game and was pleasantly surprised when I learned one was implemented. That said, I can't score the game too highly as I feel that most of the abilities are not particularly impressive. Once I had collected 500 Kyber Bricks, I was able to unlock all of the useful abilities, after which my interest in collecting more Kyber Bricks diminished. I still fully intend on obtaining all 1166, but the short-term rewards are lackluster at this point.Story - 3/10I must say the story missions in this game were a chore to play. I started off with the Phantom Menace and quickly learned that the enjoyable part of the game was exploring the hub worlds, not advancing through the tediously scripted missions. I felt like for almost the entire story mode, I was traveling between checkpoints as main characters spouted the dialogue from the movies, switching classes to interact with the same darn button puzzles, or engaging in ""intense"" light-saber combat with the bosses. I was told the combat system in this game was to be more advanced, and while it technically is more complex than the original Lego Star Wars games, the developers gave up on the puzzles integrated with the boss fights. It is simply a slashing fest for five minutes for every boss: Maul, Dooku, Grievous, Anakin, Vader, Sidious, Kylo, etc. In most boss fights, once the boss reaches a certain threshold, they will run away; and it usually takes several minutes to catch up with them. This really breaks the urgency of combat. And this often occurs 2-3 times per boss. The space combat is much more enjoyable as there are no breaks in combat. You simply search and destroy the given targets until the mission is over. Luckily, there are other aspects of this game that make up for the missions' shortcomings.Movies - 9/10So glad to see that the wit of Lego games as persisted all of these years. There were many occasions I audibly laughed at the humor throughout the movies in this game. My only complaint is that you cannot access the movies anywhere in the menus. In previous installments, you could purchase and watch the movies in the shop at your leisure. It made it difficult to share funny moments with my friends/family, as I would have to find a clip on YouTube of the scene I was on just to show it.Performance - 8/10As this game has just released, I am going to cut it some slack on occasional bugs I encountered throughout playing it. I experienced only one crash in the entire game - when I attempted to equip the Shore Trooper character in my first hour of game play. The only serious bug I repeatedly encountered is the Trade Federation Battleship occupying the center of space battles when it wasn't supposed to be there. It had no substance, so it was still possible to complete the missions. Graphically, the game is beautiful. I never experienced frame drops at 3840/2160p 60hertz. (RTX 3060ti) My one complaint with the graphical settings is the FOV status. I felt way too close to my character throughout this game. I would have appreciated an in-game setting to adjust this.Overall Rating - 37/50 or 74%I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the hub worlds in this game, solving all of the puzzles, collecting all of the Kyber Bricks and Data Cards, unlocking all of the characters. To supplement the boredom of the story missions, I listened to Ben Shapiro podcasts while I played with the sound off. I wouldn't say this lives up to the glories of The Complete Saga, but did anyone actually think it could be that good? No, I don't think so. But this game still is a lot of fun a deserves the attention that any Lego Game gets.Final RecommendationsStart with Episode 7 and unlock the scavenger items as Rey. You get them early on, and multiple puzzles require them to be completed. You don't have to finish episode 7. Just get the gear and jump back to one of the good trilogies. Don't try to 100% every hub world immediately, some Kyber Bricks and Characters can only be obtained after completing a side mission that is started on another planet. Once you've obtained all of the Kyber Bricks visible on the map, you've done all you can do for the time. Also, make sure to check inside interiors on the map. Kyber Bricks do not appear on the tracker until you're in the building."

62,Ace of Losers,https://steamcommunity.com/id/aceoflosers/,346,9,0,15.0,February,15,187,0,1,"If you really want it, wait for a sale. It's been a while since I played a lego game so maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but there seems to be something (or multiple somethings) missing from this installment. While a lot of new ideas were tried, it seems to have come at the cost of enjoyable content and 'real' gameplay.The worlds, while detailed, personally feel to lack some charm in previous titles and instead feel designed to maximize the time it takes to do anything to pad the game. Many world objects that I believe would have been 'lego based' in older games have been rendered realistically/geometrically to the point that in some areas the characters themselves are the only lego objects on screen.The move to voiced characters has also led to a fall off in cutscene quality. Whereas in the past they were very expressive and creative in getting across the plot, now much of it is just through dialogue. I do appreciate however that they allow the option to return to the classic 'mumble voice' mode.Finally the difficulty seems far too easy. I know this is a childrens game so I'm not expecting dark souls but it is literally almost impossible to die even without any upgrades equipped, especially in the space battles. This lack of a challenge has made many of the fights a bore and something I'm forcing myself to push through. Additionally, there is no requirement to play the levels with the 'intended' characters. Instead you're able to select any character you want even on the first playthrough of the level (making freeplay near pointless and many levels very easy to break/make even easier).I really wanted to like this game, but so far I've been unimpressed. However I do plan to finish it and hopefully will have my mind changed by the end."

That doesn’t normally happen with me, I’m a big fan of having my fill of a game, penning a review, and moving on. But not this time. The Skywalker Saga is a perfect mix of immensely engaging and endlessly sprawling, a game that can ask me to do the same thing at hour 60 that it asks at hour 1 and I agree to it eagerly. It breaks a surprising amount of ground for a Star Wars game, and also remains fun and light-hearted enough that you’ll never really tire of it. And not even the technical issues can mar my enjoyment of this massive adventure.“The Skywalker Saga” refers to the nine mainline Star Wars movies that chronicle the rise, fall, and legacy of Darth Vader. From the lakes of Naboo to the sands of Tatooine, and all the way to the blasted surface of Exegol, you can play through all of the big beats of the Star Wars films. But unlike previous LEGO games, this isn’t so neatly broken up into stages. Each episode has five story missions, but they’re stitched together through open-world exploration across 28 planets seen in the movies, often with scripted events and cutscenes to fill in the gaps between missions. You’ll fly the trench run, battle the Separatist leaders, and take down Starkiller base, but you’ll also defrost Rebels at Echo Base, serve up orders at the diner on Coruscant, and rummage through Maz Kanata’s castle. And if you can believe it, playing through the events of the films is only the start of your journey.As far as a retelling of the Star Wars epic, the LEGO version hits all the right notes. It sometimes picks some unexpected moments to turn into missions, like Yoda’s battle with the droid armies on Kashyyyk or Princess Leia running around on the Tantive IV, but always turns these into fun romps. The open-world segments are also plenty of fun and do a lot to round out the story, taking you through notable events while also leaving you free to roam for cash and collectibles. Missions contain plenty of variety, including space battles, large army clashes, on-rails shooting sequences, and more. Even the normal on-foot adventuring gets mixed up with multiple teams doing things at once and branching paths. Most notably, climactic battles with characters like Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have been given a ton of attention, becoming multi-stage challenges with all sorts of dodging, blocking, and combo mechanics that echo the boss battles of more… severe games.As fun as playing through the movies is, the cutscenes and dialogue are a huge part of what makes this game so fun. LEGO has really made a name for itself with licensed properties by parodying them without losing their core appeal, and that’s more evident than ever here. Cutscenes are always hilariously slapstick, the major characters all have their own running jokes that get used to great effect over the course of nine episodes, and even the most dramatic scenes get broken down into comedic beats. The big climax to Episode I against Darth Maul had me in tears with how funny it was, for example. You’ll see plenty of that cleverness with every mission and dialogue from random NPCs, too, and the fact that LEGO Star Wars never lets that air of wacky hijinks falter goes a long way towards keeping the game fresh.Fresh is what you need this to be, too, because the real meat of the game is collecting things. There is a staggering, unconscionable amount of things to find here, between the 380 characters, 100+ ships, dozens of quests and challenges, and more. New to this LEGO outing is the chance to upgrade the abilities of your characters, who are split across about ten different classes. You need kyber bricks for these upgrades, of which there are over 1100 scattered all over the galaxy. The challenges to obtain them range from looking behind corners to planet-hopping odysseys that end in hidden boss battles. Side quests can also be impressively involved, spanning land and space, and throwing you into all kinds of battles and hunts. You can even capture certain capital ships, which essentially turn into secret stages with their own unique events and mechanics.There’s so much to see and do in The Skywalker Saga, it’s easy to lose sight of what may be this game’s greatest achievement and biggest appeal. This is essentially the first open-world Star Wars game, offering you the chance to freely wander any of the planets and notable locales of the films at your leisure. Sure, you’ve got characters to unlock and collectibles to hunt down all over, but I cannot overstate how magical it is to simply touch down on Coruscant or Kamino or Bespin or Takodana and just be there. The folks who made this game went to incredible lengths to make every location feel like a real place, with beautiful, realistic environments and effects. They meshed this immersion perfectly with their LEGO characters and objects, too, because your bricks and figures look absolutely life-like with plastic seams, reflections, and even sand and dirt caking their surfaces on some worlds.It’s worth noting there are a fair number of technical issues at the moment, ones that may or may not get sorted out via patches. I’ve had to reload the game a few times because of explosions or textures not rendering correctly. One of the instanced space battle areas is aligned around a background model that can make it really hard to see. Most importantly, there can be crashes from time to time, including one consistent one during an Episode III mission that I had to turn my graphics settings all the way down to get around. Surprisingly, that had little impact on how the game looked, so this one seems both extremely well-optimized and also rather unstable. I’ll also add that I haven’t really lost any progress to crashes, because the game is saving constantly, but it’s definitely an annoyance.With that out of the way, I really have nothing but love for this one. If nothing else I’ve said in this review has sold you on The Skywalker Saga, let me say this: I have never really liked the LEGO games, not even the Star Wars ones. I’ve played several in the past, but never stuck with any of them for more than a few hours, owing to hollow, simple gameplay and tedious collecting. In stark contrast to that, I am absolutely obsessed with this one. It’s crowded out all my other games, drawing me back day after day to hunt more kyber bricks and character unlocks. Above all, it’s just fun. It never forgets how light-hearted and charming it is, and everything it offers the player is there to help you enjoy it even more. This is the Star Wars game I’ve been waiting decades for, an open-world romp that does everything it can to make you enjoy your time in a vast galaxy of adventure.Did you enjoy this review? I certainly hope so, and I certainly hope you'll check out more of them at  or on my !"
66,Brent,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Brentwahn/,75,1,1,22.6,September,"22,","2,040",0,1,"~OVERALL RATING~70%~ SUMMARY ~It's a reasonably fun game that does a fantastic job capturing the key story elements from all 9 movies. It's actually amazing at how it does it - you'd expect that turning the movies into games would mean each game would be 20 hours each, but somehow they packed it all in and still made it fun. I took 22h to complete the core game, doing minimum side quests, and finished all 9 episodes in that time so it's only a bit longer than watching the movies themselves.It's just not quite deep enough for my tastes. The lightweight, whimsical style of LEGO and the fairly simple gameplay and skill tree just didn't do that much for me. It's perfect as a kids game though, and there is a vast amount of content to explore.

77,AviaRa,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1AviaRa1/,100,3,1,116.3,June,"22,",929,13,1,"A long time ago, the announcement of  got me excited, making it one of my most anticipated titles, but its constant delays made it clear that my galaxy’s visit is still far, far away…Yet, I remained so patient that even Yoda blissfully shivered from my accomplishment.Was it worth the wait? Absolutely.By portraying all three trilogies,  provides a coherent, entertaining storyline filled with humorous twists and quips that never become boring. Truly. Not only that it feels like a complete, parodying recreation, but it also comes up with its own jabs that even make fun of some of the decisions made in each instalment; thus, even horrendous episodes like  or  are enjoyable. Moreover, it inspires itself by the popular  memes, which is a nice touch as it underlines its dedication to the fandom.Due to that, it caters to the fans rather than to everyone—and that is fine. Could you enjoy it without being familiar with the films? Probably, as the game still has a lot to offer, but many jokes might fly over your head at lightspeed. I am glad that it is like that, though, as it would lose part of its charm otherwise.The way you experience the campaign is a bit different this time; it lets you galavant through the galaxy and visit numerous planets, with an occasional unique mission here and there. Thus, it feels like a thorough, delightful journey rather than a bland list of levels, making the whole adventure more satisfactory.As it is an action-adventure title – from a tighter third-person perspective this time – the usual gameplay loop revolves around exploring, platforming, hoarding all the collectables and, of course, fighting. When you are not directly following the story, you can just venture away and explore the universe on your own. However, do not expect a seamless open world; instead, it consists of a bunch of playable areas in each system. I would say it is better that way because the locations are designed with care to provide just enough content without overwhelming you.Apart from relaxing sightseeing, there are the said collectables to find; picking them up is not pointless, though, as you use them to upgrade your characters’ abilities or unlock additional, hilarious rewards, like a fierce Porg companion or baguettes that replace the lightsabers. To obtain them, you usually have to solve a simple environmental puzzle. Even though that might get a bit repetitive after a while, I did not mind it because I adored discovering new locations and trying out other iconic characters.Speaking of those, you can unlock them, along with starships, by completing side missions. These quests often tend to deliver an even more over-the-top take on . At one point, you might find yourself smuggling trampolines to Mustafar, ending it with a bouncy fight against Bossk, or you could be crushing down a revolt of cloned woolamanaders – who are essentially cute blue apes – on the Kamino facility. This kind of content serves as a sweet, optional stuffing that can spice up your journey.That leads us to the combat, which surprisingly has a lot of depth when compared to an average  game. For sure, it is still pretty effortless, so do not expect any hardships or obstacles in your way. There are, however, several possibilities to use, as apart from mashing one button, you can engage in various combos that make encounters more fun and satisfying to observe. Whether you viciously slice through a bunch of Clones with Maul’s double-bladed lightsaber, blast everyone’s heads off with Boba Fett’s carbine rifle, or slap others as C-3PO, you know it is going to be a joyful time. And if that does not convince you, then undulating around as Mamma the Hutt, licking everyone in the process, should do so!These differences do not only influence the combat but the overall interaction with the world, as well. Where a Jedi will take advantage of their agile movement or the Force, a bounty hunter will rely on a jetpack and grappling hook; due to that, the character classes complement each other. It is a simple yet effective system that pushes you to try out more of the iconic heroes or villains.Unfortunately, the skirmishes in space are disappointing, though serviceable for what they are. While there is a decent variety of starships to choose from, the combat lacks the complexity of the ground one. You only have one attack option, with the possibility of unleashing a homing missile, and that is it. Thus, all of these encounters are bland and uninspiring, becoming boring later on. The exceptions are a few main missions or battles with capital ships, which at least offer unique objectives that balance out the monotonous gameplay.Additionally, the absence of online cooperative play is saddening. Even though you can use , it is not enough, mainly because every progress made counts only for the host while your friends gain nothing. That is weird and discouraging, as you suddenly cannot use the characters and abilities you unlocked but rely purely on your friend’s ones. Also, doing all the collectables twice does not sound that appealing either.Where  beautifully shines is its audiovisual presentation. Simply put, it is top-notch. All the planets with their iconic locations are glamorous to lie your eyes on, and all the ships, even the capital ones or Death Star itself, are made purely of  bricks, which nicely distinguish them from the rest of the environment. Just galavanting through the deserts of Tatooine or the city of Theed, listening to its iconic themes is heartwarming.Another nice touch is the presence of some of the original trilogy’s actors, who reprise their roles, like  as C-3PO or  as Lando. You can also hear a few familiar voices from the animated  show. Naturally, not everyone could be present, but the attempt still shows the dedication put into this project. Moreover, the number of additional monologues and even dialogues between numerous characters is astonishing; even Darth Vader and Kylo Ren have their small talk, and at times, they might even perform an amusing animation when you let them stand in place for a while. The love and care just jump at you at every bricky corner you pass by.That would be perhaps the best summary for .Overall, I adore this title, as it is a special experience that managed to awake an inner child in me, a kid that enjoyed watching the films over and over again. The humorous nature and relaxing gameplay make for an excellent combination. Yes, some aspects could have been a tad bit better; however, that does not take away the dozens of hours of fun I had. Thus, I can wholeheartedly recommend it to any  enthusiast.Now excuse me; I still have a few collectables to find."

79,CornGolden,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CornGolden/,323,12,1,9.6,April,"6,",693,11,1,"Hello there!When I heard there was gonna be a remake of Lego Star Wars Ep's 1-6 with the added bonus of those things we'd all like to forget about called Ep's 7-9, I was pretty excited about the announcement as a huge Star Wars fan and thought long and hard whether I should pre order this game or not.The old Lego Star Wars games from the PS2/Xbox/Gamcube era (and later Xbox 360, PS3, and Wii with the Complete Saga) were a thing of beauty and kind of helped Lego kick off their long running series of Lego themed games ranging from Indiana Jones, to Harry Potter, to Marvel and DC super heroes.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga now allows us to experience the entirety of the Star Wars series again in Lego form and fully voice acted too which the old games didnt feature. The voice acting is just the 1st major change for this game. Along with this the combat has been changed up to feel more hack and slashey with lightsabers, and more third person shooter like with blasters, a major step up from the old games.You can now freely move the camera around and access most of the games features from the select menu without ever having to return back to a central hub area like in the older games. There's side missions you can do to gain more studs and hidden collectibles to find again scattered throught the episodes. You now have the new Kyber bricks collectible which helps you level up your character abilities and powers. This game also contains the largest collection of Star Wars characters and vehicles available to play as spanning all 9 episodes and even The Mandalorian and Solo if you have the DLCs with more characters being added soon. The graphics are also very pretty and look good no matter what graphics settings, and can run well on some older hardware like GTX 10 series GPUs.Some other upsides of the remake are the almost seamless transitions from world to world when going through levels (with some slight technical hiccups here and there, but I'll get to that later). You can enable silly extra options like ""mumble mode"" to make the characters sound the way they did in the original games or alter the gameplay for a good laugh. The Skywalker Saga also pays pretty good respect to the original films, keeping a lot of memorable lines from the movies for important moments of the story, while sometimes sprinkling in the Lego goofiness for laughs. The game is also not difficult to play compared to the original games, which makes it more welcoming to younger audiences and casuals who are Star Wars fans, but aint big on gaming. For me personally, the easier difficulty of the game wasnt to my liking, but with this being a family friendly Star Wars game, I can understand why this was done.Now onto the downsides. While I like the game so far and feel satisfied with it as a Star Wars fan and a gamer, I am disappointed with the way some moments of the story were cut out, probably due to time constraints, or shortened by just having certain characters or locations show up at parts of the story they werent supposed to be in yet (eg. Yoda explaining Kamino being gone from the archives to Obi Wan in the Library and never showing the part with the younglings wisdom and the cool space map in the training room), but again this can be understood in order to cram 9 movie stories into 1 game. Still, the games progression through episodes feels too quick and it doesnt help that intense action filled moments dont happen frequently like in the old games, and leads to moments where you just walk from point A to point B with little to no resistance only to activate the next cutscene.The game also has some bugs and glitches that can lead to soft locks that require a restart. Had my game soft lock on me 3 times when trying to start a mission or go into a cutscene and had to restart. Had a glitch when trying to buy Zam Wesell from the in game shop where my studs would be spent but Zam still showed up as not having been bought. I had another odd glitch where side missions in spaces just wouldnt show up and I was flying in empty space, I could only see the story mission icon and the blue asteroid thing floating by. In the droid factory level for episode 2 the games fps plunges as low as 28 fps at times on areas where theres a lot of machinery and enemies moving on screen. Also one thing that annoys me is that every time I restart or tab out of the game it never saves my resolution settings and always sets me to 1080p 50 fps every time, had to play on fullscreen mode for this game too because trying to use windowed borderless after restarting will just put you in windowed only and cant be fixed unless you switch from fullscreen back to windowed borderless.Personally, I like the game and recommend it to any Star Wars fan for episodes 1-6 remade alone (7-9 will always be a mistakes barfed up by Disney's lousy writers), but I'd wait a while to buy this on sale for $20-30 at the most, the gameplay and pace of the game don't warrant $50, or $60 with the deluxe edition. Unless your a hardcore Star Wars fan like me, wait for a sale."

82,Heresy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/basedkat/,644,23,0,80.6,December,"5,",358,0,1,"This isn't a bad game, not really. But when you stack it up against its 15-year-old predecessor, it comes a bit short. Sure, you technically have MORE content. But, personally, I find it hard to consider repeating the same exact puzzles on every planet, the same exact fetch quests with different names, and the same exact on-rails ""levels"" as meaningful content.Let's actually talk about the levels for a bit. When you get to an *actual* level in the game (say, the first mission in The Force Awakens, the Canto Bight prison break in The Last Jedi, or the escape from the Death Star in A New Hope), they're surprisingly open, have relatively clever puzzles, and come across as a pleasantly surprising update to a 15 year old formula. Unfortunately, these moments are far and few between. Most levels are either boss fights that follow the exact same formula of spam attack until the boss runs off, immunity phase, repeat; and on-rails vehicle segments that all function exactly the same, with the only difference being the ship you're piloting. This would be less of an issue if these were, say, 1 per episode like in The Complete Saga. Instead, you have issues like Revenge of the Sith being almost entirely boss fights with only one (Droid Attack on the Wookies) and a half (the first 1/2 of Down for the Count) being *actual* levels. instead of 6 levels per episode, now you only get 5 - and most of them are exactly the same. The other segments of the films that could have been (and in the past, *were*) levels are now relegated to painfully dull, pace-killing walking simulator segments, in which you spend 5 minutes walking to a location/character to listen to some dialogue or watch a cutscene, and then repeat until you get to one of the 5 actual levels.The majority of the work in this game went to the open world, which - while visually impressive - lacks any sort of substance. As mentioned before, all the side quests and puzzles are carbon copies of one another, rendering them repetitive and borderline pointless. Yes, objectively speaking, 700+ puzzles is more than The Complete Saga or The Clone Wars had, but does the total amount matter if only about 100 are unique?A similar issue exists with the characters. Wow, over 1,000 characters with more on the way in the form of DLC! Unfortunately, they almost all function exactly the same - and most don't even have voice acting. This is something I really don't care about (IMO the LEGO games were better when they didn't have voiceovers), but, at the same time, if you're going to have VO, then at least apply it consistently. Even characters who have voice acting will lose it if you elect to use certain skins instead of the default. Again, does having ""more"" matter when it's done in such a half-baked way?Finally, there is no end to the technical issues that mar this game. Six months after release and performance issues still plague certain levels. To TT's credit, they did fix these issues somewhat - ""Better Call Maul"" went from literally unplayable for me to actually running at a consistent framerate after patches - but the performance hits are still apparent in areas such as the Droid Factory. This points to underlying engine and optimization issues, which - unfortunately - are not so fixable. Additionally, bugs crop up left and right: things as simple as audio getting stuck and constantly looping, to things much more gamebreaking as not being able to lift Force objects. There are bugs tied to acquiring collectibles that actively prevent the player from getting 100% completion. One side quest in particular has a bug where you have to specifically quit to the main menu in order to get it to advance. If you go somewhere else in-game or ALT-F4, it simply will not progress. The latter two problems have been known issues since the game's launch; neither have been fixed. With the release of the Galactic Edition (and the questionable DLC practices that came with it), the chances of these issues ever being fixed has decreased from slim to none.So, final verdict: if you love Star Wars, and love LEGO games, and don't mind uninspired, repetitive content or just want a game to keep you or a kid busy for the next several months, then this is by all means a fine game. If you're looking for a worthy update or successor to The Complete Saga or even other, newer LEGO games, this isn't it. Personally, if you have a choice between The Complete Saga and this game, I'd go with the former every single time. That's not nostalgia talking, it's just simply a better, more technically polished game in spite of its age."

Overall the game is a fantastically fun romp through everyone's favorite fictional space epic about destroying each other over politics with lasers. Tons of stuff to do and see, its a good time. Would I recommend 100%ing it like I just finished doing?NO.The blessing, but also massive problem with 100%ing a game and playing it for so long is you see everything the game has to offer, and I mean EVERYTHING. Sure while I saw every character, every joke, every reference, every unlock, I also saw every glitch, every bug, every cut or rushed corner or idea. Every repetitive nonsense, every boring game moment. I physically recoiled in my chair every time I was forced into 3, brain dead difficulty dogfights every time I just wanted to transport cargo through ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hyperspace. Around the 70% mark the game had already become very painful to digest, but I stuck it out just so my ape brain could see the sticker on my steam profile and the infinite shower of coins you get as a 100% bonus despite the fact that money has no value after you've 100%ed the game. (Also by the way the last challenge that stood in my path to 100% was bugged, and I had to replay the level 13 times before It randomly worked by accident that last time. I will murder Kylo Ren with a snowman.)The story missions are quite abridged, fast forwarded and simplified if you will, which really sucks if you are a person who genuinely cares about the story and wouldn't mind being retold it again in detail. It stings a bit when even the quiet reflective and powerful scenes from the movies are cut short or played completely for laughs. The real meat and potatoes of the game is through exploring all of the different planets, or at least the planets that the poor time crunched devs had time to finish, looking at you Kijimi.  Overall if you pick up and play the game it will be a good time and worth the money, but the second you start to reach deeper you soon realize that the Skywalker Saga puddle is actually quite shallow and rough around the edges.

The mini-open world aspect is very cool too. Combat is fun enough to make the game interesting. Story is obviously a dumbed-down version of the films but has a lot of prequel memes which is always good.If you were buying a LEGO game and expecting some sort of Dark Souls-level of difficulty then you probably won't like it. But if you've ragequit Elden Ring for the 20th time and just want some low-key fun then you'll love it."

90,Zap105,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115331264/,371,22,0,4.9,September,"9,",152,0,1,"I'll be honest, kinda underwhelmed.I was uber hype for the game during development, even after the delays, because I grew up playing Lego games with my brothers, and I was more than ready to play this supposed ""ultimate Lego Star Wars"" when it dropped.Unfortunately, after months of not touching the game, I just haven't been able to bring myself to keep playing past Episode 1, and even completing that single episode felt like a chore more than a game. PROS:-Amazing and dynamic graphics and cinimatics-Faithful, yet humorous take on the Star Wars film plots, as is par-for-the-course in Lego games-Large open world(s) to explore and find collectables-Lightsaber combat is fun-That Darth Maul fight was absolutely GLORIOUS -A leveling/powering up system that incentivizes finding Kyber bricks-Funny back-and-forth interactions between the characters you choose (one of my favorites: Young Anakin: ""That's a cool suit! Where can I get one?"" Darth Vader: ""Patience, child. Patience"")CONS:- Walking. a LOT of walking.This isn't even a joke, about 60% of episode one consists of traveling between locations where nothing happens (except some dialogue if you're lucky) and you can't fast travel to speed things up. As an added bonus, if there's characters talking, you are slowed to an absolute CRAWL for the duration of the area in order to avoid skipping any dialogue.- The aforementioned saber combat, while fun, is uncommon, at least if you're following the ""story mode"" - Blaster combat, while having a nice, over-the-shoulder playstyle, feels clunky and monotonous. (more of a personal nitpick i guess)- Starfighter combat is janky, slow, and repetitive. I found myself many times asking ""Wait, another wave of enemies?"" as i slowly steered my fighter to shoot the barely-moving fighters. Easily one of the most disappointing parts of the game, especially considering how the fighter combat in the Lego The Force Awakens game worked.- The mind-boggling amount of the EXACT same puzzle with little-to-no variation ( batteries, platforming, more batteries, character panel, and EVEN MORE BATTERIES)- The way you unlock characters outside of the story (glorified fetch-quests of talking to the right people) is very, very annoying and not at all rewarding to pull off when you finally find the right joker to ask about the character you want.Heck, it's hardly worth the hunt because all characters are basically just reskins of the same handful of classes (Jedi, hero, astromech, etc) with no gameplay variance between them.- The sheer quantity of the kyber bricks being kinda just spat all over the world, not in any really clever ways with cool puzzles or sequences like old lego games did, just in a ""oh, didn't think one would be here"" kinda way.The most ""unusual"" puzzle (if you can even call it that) that I remember from my playthrough of Episode 1 consisted of rebuilding pipes to fill tanks with water on Tatooine and, despite being the most ""unique"" puzzle I encountered, was by far and away the most monotonous, boring, and frustratingly slow sequence of events and took a good 10 minutes, not from difficulty (it only gave you the pieces you need at a time, so a bit hard to mess up), but from the sheer length of the ""challenge"". The reward? A single kyber brick. SO fuggin worth my time...- ""Actual"" levels don't really feel unique or special, usually feeling like an extension of the open world area (and not in a good way. It kinda feels like ""Oh wait, that was a level I just did? all i did was WALK do a hero panel and shoot 3 droids""TL:DR-Once my nostalgia-tinted glasses were taken off, I was left with a monotonous, boring, repetitive, aimless, wannabe Lego Star Wars game that, while it it has some good stuff to work with and matches today's standards of graphics, feels incomplete or unfinished gameplay-wise.A real shame. At least we have The Complete Saga still which, I might add, still holds up today, at least in my mind. Go check it out instead of The Skywalker Saga. You won't be sorry."

With the deluxe version, you get additional DLC character add-ons to use during freeplay. One thing that surprised me the most about this game was how short each level is compared to previous LEGO franchise games where you go through many modes within each level. I finished the entire Phantom Menace in just over an hour, while the time it took me to complete one level in 2016 Force Awakens Game about 45 minutes to an hour. That could be due to the 2016 game being the entire movie plot, but it was very surprising to have only the Gungan Battle Mission last merely 7-10 minutes. It reminds me of the Complete Saga game, if not a bit shorter. I'm so happy that Lego incorporated the Clone Wars voice actors to VA their given characters in the Prequels. It was awesome to notice that. Also, the open world mechanics are amazing and will for sure last you days just to cover one planet at a time. There are so many opportunities to complete civilian missions and collect kyber blocks to upgrade your skills. Using the holoprojector is still new to me, as that is where you will be able to access your freeplay characters and ships, as well as purchase unlockable characters.   One of the griefs that I have about this game lies within the DLC, and that is not having the ability to access the Bad Batch, Mandalorian Season 2, and Rouge One character packs. Part of my reason for buying the deluxe edition was for the immediate access to these amazing characters so it's a bit frustrating to have to wait longer till April 19 and May 4th. The villain duels are flat out amazing to play, I am definitely replaying those missions just for the fun of it If you're a die-hard fan of the Lego Star Wars Franchise I would absolutely recommend this to play."

TT games really took a while to get ground with it. I was in shamble with every delay announcement., but I am glad things eventually worked out amazingly. Not only we get additional content from the Mandalorian seasons and the Bad Batch, the game also runs amazingly well without any major frame rate drops. The visual is by far the best the studio has put out. Though the lightsaber effects are still a bit weird when you turn around a little...No big deal though. Things I wish to have in EA's battlefront 2 like Rogue One characters, the two series related contents I've mentioned above, more skins for iconic characters like Ben Kenobi and Kylo Ren, and BANTHA, are all in this game. What's not to love? Except probably the absence of FOV slider and Online COOP. I hope they will add these two features in the near future, especially the FOV slider. This default view really would mess some people up during extensive play sessions, and I am one of them. You don't have issues with these two things? Then hop your ass in and buy the game! Oh yes, you better buy the DELUXE EDITION. It gives you all the sweet characters from the Solo, Rogue One, the Mandalorian, the Bad Batch and some other stuff! Pretty good deal if you ask me, whether you are a fan of Star Wars/Lego or not. Trust me, this game will make you feel the love and efforts the developers have put in. Now I hope they get some good rest from those crunches."

Proof that when you have merit and care about the product, you can produce quality.Finally! A Star Wars game where developers can take liberties with the lore without offending fans. This game REALLY makes you feel like a Star War. Playing this is a kind of nostalgic bliss. The Lego Star Wars games were my exposure to Star Wars as a kid and were how I first experienced the movies. I still remember being a little kid when the first Lego Star Wars came out. It was the greatest thing ever, I at least put like 500 hours on that game as a kid. When I played it originally I couldn’t read yet so it was very hard for me, but it was always amazing. I  still can’t read, and actually don’t know how I am able to write this but here we are. As a somewhat adult man, I gotta say we’ve come a long way from the days I would grind the Lego Star Wars II Mos Eisley level on my Gameboy… what a feeling. The hours I put into the Complete Saga, along with all the other games is astronomical (no pun intended), yet I feel like a little boy again whenever I pick up and play the Skywalker saga. It’s just phenomenal. It has its issues too, but it’s just amazing overall. It's a solid game and a great rehash of the old game. Looks absolutely stunning! LEGO humor is intact, which is great. Some levels from the old game aren't in this one but it's pretty much an updated Complete Saga with more modes and features and even more characters to play around with. I've had so much fun with it and it's a superb game.It's everything I wanted as a huge fan of the older games, plus a little more. It has so much amazing content that I love and I think it's worth every penny, especially for someone who enjoys completing games.I'm a big Star Wars fan, and this definitely has become one of my favourite Star Wars games. Let alone Lego games. This is pretty much everything I could have asked for from a Lego Star Wars game. I enjoyed every single level and the open world is amazing. I have to reiterate it isn't perfect and I have a few small problems with it but I could see this become one of my favourite games of all time.Whoever is running the Lego company really  knows what they’re doing. The games and movies they make are always so high quality it’s astounding. It’s one of the very few children’s companies that actually seem to care about their product. Well, whatever they’re doing… it’s better than what Disney has been up to that’s for sure.This might just end up being the best Lego game of all time.10/10"
118,leia (she/her),https://steamcommunity.com/id/yelldow/,90,2,1,146.8,April,"8,",190,4,1,"SPOILER WARNINGSPOILER WARNINGSPOILER WARNINGFantastic game! It's 100% clear to me that TT Games has made this with the old games in mind; not as a replacement, but as a successor, a game that kindly respects them rather than ignorantly bypassing them. (It even uses the original minikit collection sound as it's build complete sound! I have too many hours on The Original Trilogy and Complete Saga to ever forget that satisfying bit of audio.)The game has taken to a completely different set of levels. Instead of raiding the Jedi Temple in Episode 3, you'll be fighting Sidious in the senate chamber. Instead of fighting a bounty hunter mid-flight in the first level of Episode 2, you'll be exploring, trying to figure out what that dart thing really is.Frankly, it's a much more immersive way of going about the story. In LGS (The Prequels), you'd finish fighting Grevious then immediately transition to running and fighting clones on Kashyyyk, with little to no story explanation; it was a bit of a mess. Don't get me wrong, the levels were fantastic (and specifically levels 1 and 6 of Episode 3 had some of the best design of many of them.)Even in The Original Trilogy, you'd go from murdering Jabba the Hut to going around in speeders; the games seemed to be picking specific points to hit from the movies rather than retelling them, and that resulted in games that weren't all that immersive; games that really were a bit scrambled.This game is different. While the levels may be short, they're very involved and combat-filled. And, when you finish a level, you don't teleport to the next level automatically, you're still within the relative area of where you finished it; you have to travel to the next level yourself (or stay where you are and get Kyber Bricks, a fantastic part of the game that I can't stop participating in), really showing off the fantastic galaxy TT has made. The more story you complete, the more planets you have (and you can go anywhere anytime!)The game is a bit of a fabricated experience, though; it shows you what to do, and actively directs you towards that goal. You're always able to go your own direction, but you cannot 'untrack' the story mission, it is always tracked. You'll always have a tiny orange exclamation on your screen, nearly 24/7, adding to the odd smattering of UI elements the game's dropped on your screen. Of course, a fabricated experience isn't a bad thing; it's a kid's game, after all, meant for a very wide audience, not just 20-30 year old gamer nerds. The game does let you tune these to an extent (you can disable or enable consequence-free falling, for example, reducing stud loss to 0 when you fall into the void), but not everything can be turned off or skipped. For example, the game will give you a tutorial when it deems you should be shown it, locking your controls and forcing you to do what it's asking. You can't turn them off, either; just do what it's telling you to do. It's a little infuriating, to be honest.That's all nitpicking, though. In it's entirety, this is a massive, beautiful game, with a ton of massive, beautiful environments, and a ton of massive, beautiful levels (that are short in a linear sense, but have so much exploration to them that more than makes up for it!)I highly recommend this game, it IS worth the price. (For reference, I can count the times I've paid $60 for a game in the past 10 years on my left hand.)This was worth the price.I love this thing.THANK YOU TT GAMES YOU ALL ARE FANTASTIC"

I want to replay missions in the Skywalker Saga.4. There should be an explorable Starkiller Base planet, and Kijimi should be explorable. There also should be a Supremacy capital ship, too.5.

128,Lieutenant Tea™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ProffTea/,66,3,1,31.5,April,"18,",116,0,1,"This is the definitive Lego game. This is one of the most enjoyable games I've played in a long while.The game has all 9 episodes, it took around 17-18 hours for me to beat in co-op, just for the base game, it will likely take hours upon hours to 100%. I really enjoyed episodes 1-7, 8-9 were questionable but more on that later. There's also tons of side quests and missions. If you're expecting a remake of the complete saga, you will be very disappointed. This game is very different but in a good way. They tried so many new things and it worked. The game is now semi-open world, it has some rpg elements like quests and upgrades, etc.I beat the main story in co-op, and it was great in co-op, I'm pretty sure it would be enjoyable in singleplayer too. No online multiplayer kinda sucks but Steam remote play is surprisingly stable in this game, especially over ethernet. I played with people from halfway across the globe and 98% of the time it was flawless. As far as performance on the host machine it's not great, I'm running a RTX 3060 & Ryzen 9. The game dipped under 15 frames in some missions.This game has so much polish, for example on Tattooine or Hoth, your player will have sand or snow particles on them. And almost every character has unique dialogue with each other, it results some interesting character reactions with characters from different episodes. It also has the normal Lego slapstick humor we all know and love.Episodes 1-6 are amazing, I enjoyed basically every second of those. I am not a fan of the sequel movies but I actually enjoyed episode 7 too. Episodes 8 was surprisingly mediocre. But episode 9 was straight up bad. On episode 9 I got straight up softlocked once or twice, the level design was confusing, it was pretty boring gameplay, on top of a bad plot. But the other episodes were amazing. I love 1-7.The game is very buggy. It's not uncommon to completely softlock yourself, or have another major bug. It's actually sometimes really annoying and happened to me a handful of times throughout my playthrough. But a good chunk of the game is flawless.Overall hard recommend whether you're a Star Wars fan and/or a Lego fan, adult or kid. It's amazing. I loved almost every minute of it."

All the characters are beautifully animated and blaster fights have been massively improved since The Force Awakens. Unfortunately, thats where the positives end for me.The levels are very short. To some, that sounds like a good thing, but to me, it fails to make an impact on the player. Just when the level starts to get good, it ends.Also, the bugs. I have no idea how a LEGO game, has this many bugs. The mumble mode that so many LEGO veterans like me have been so excited for; it actually breaks some of the in-game sequences. In my experience, I also have quite a few game-breaking bugs that force a game reset, and even a crash to desktop.When I first booted this game up, I was beyond excited. When the bugs get fixed, I will delete this review to give a [Neutral] stance on this game instead.Edit: No Battle Over Coruscant level requires that this game recieves a permanent negative review."

There is usually one 5-10 minute mission per 1h hub area.* Lots of loading time... made worse by the mission  design which loads a new level for 30s of walking.* Many missions are uninspired: You are not doing anything interesting, varied, ...* Some missions were clearly not tested / designed in co-op, with the 2nd player not being able to do anything for some time* Hub areas are littered with collectibles that require little to no thought to collect.... just enduring the tedium. less than 5% of the tasks actually require some though. With more than 1400 things to collect it is all quantity, no quality.* Inconsistent UI/controls, and in general lack of polish and streamliningAltogether it feels like they were just doing the game by-the-numbers, instead of iterating the design, and much to the detriment of fun missions, and puzzles. It's a shame, but it seems the developer do not really know what made some of the older ones fun (Lego Lord of the Rings is still one of my favourite)"

Now, since i'm not stupid enough to dump more money into this game, i'm not sure if that 'collection' of character packs give you different characters, but with what they've done to their deluxe game purchasers, I would probably say they don't and they're just trying to make as much money as they can. It does look like you're paying for the same characters 3 times in some cases.

I was fortunate to not experience any game breaking bugs unlike other unfortunate users. However despite being able to play-through in the games entirety I have experienced a few bugs which I will list.- major fps drops in the ewok village open world area and in the droid factory level- character switching bugs when doing remote play co-op- random crashes- characters having no faces- mynock mynock puzzle breaking, was able to fix by using boba fett to catch the glitched mynock- unable to complete certain levels and level challenges in free play- the minimap option of rotate with player doesn't work all the time while it is selected for some reasonThis list of bugs whilst not game breaking were certainly a pain to experience. Another unfortunate thing is that from my experience the game was not optimised well for the remote play co-op. My friend and I encountered various issues whilst playing, particularly the character switching issues in free play which would cause the other player to randomly change character when the other player was selecting a character. We also found that the secondary player often had what we coined as ""little brother controls"" in levels due to many of the levels being 1 v 1 boss fight scenarios. This made the experience for the secondary player less enjoyable although I'm not sure what they could have done to help this.But enough of the negatives lets get into the positives, this game is nostalgia central. it reignited my love for Star Wars as well as my love for LEGO. The open world exploration is massive and really well done. There are hundreds of puzzles and little side missions that make up for the fairly small amount of story levels (only 5 per episode). I really enjoyed playing the game and actually followed through with 100%-ing it completely which for me never happens. There are plenty of the classic LEGO game witty jokes and funny cut-scenes which I enjoyed despite being and adult. The gameplay is really good, the fighting mechanics are really nice and I liked the camera angle that the game used. They could have done more with the ship and space gameplay but we have to remember that at the end of the day this is a game designed for children. Overall I'd give the game an 8/10"
138,Badger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jordanjamison/,388,16,0,40.6,April,"6,",293,34,1,"This review is based on my experience of completing Episodes 4, 5, 6 , and 1 story to completion.This pains me to write. I have been looking forward to this for years, and I am not enjoying what they made for us.The levels are short. The few puzzles there are, are lackluster. Building is rare if present at all. Difficulty is non-existent. Over-the-shoulder gunplay is repetitive since Troopers are just blaster sponges.This is a LEGO game only in style and name. They spent so much time developing open exploration that they didn't give platforming and puzzle design the time and care it deserves.Some more specific issues I've had:-Turning off aim-assist and health regeneration changed nothing in regards to difficulty. The only thing that changed was that it actually made the speeder level on Endor impossible, forcing me to turn aim-assist back on so that the speeder itself locked on as you can't aim.-Enemies and vehicles pose absolutely no threat, not even the AT-AT's. The Battle of Hoth is lazy, hardly feeling like you're actually taking down an AT-AT. Instead you're just flying through hoops in a clockwise fashion, providing no real satisfaction when you succeed.-The platforming doesn't feel good either. When grappling some climbable areas your character doesn't automatically lock onto the ledge. Instead you have to make sure that the game specifically prompts you to ""A to JUMP"" or ""B to GRAPPLE"". Otherwise you *will not* grab it, even if you are clipping through the geometry. And during some sections swinging between poles or vines on Dagobah does not feel natural. It locks you to one position, and the momentum is non-existent. There's a section in the Maul fight where you're supposed to platform across an electricity floor, but literally all you need to do is press A to jump across one at a time. No skill or difficulty at all, just one button.-The lightsaber duels are set up with a tutorial that seems promising, hinting towards more in-depth mechanics, but no. There is no satisfying dodging, or QTE. It's just as shallow as the rest of the combat.I understand this is a LEGO game, made for kids, but even The Complete Saga has an abundance of puzzles and at least some more difficult combat and platforming.And as of writing, there are also so many precious moments to Star Wars that are not shown in the Story missions. There is no infiltration of Theed palace. C-3PO isn't blown up and carried on Chewie's back. Leia doesn't find Wicket, she just appears at the village. You don't even get to blow up the Death Star in Episode 6. It just happens without you."

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join.

Especially episodes 1 2 and 6 most of the events happened in cutsceans even blowing up the deathstar is not a level and happens in a quick 10 seconds cutsceane. Developers clearly spent 90% of thier time on how the game looks and 10% (or less) on how the game actually plays. The game boasts a massive 400+ character roster but once you unlock them there is nothing to do with them as levels are so short. Nostalgic player will relive their childhood for a short time before realizing all there is to do is walk around hub worlds and unlock collectables that dont actually serve a purpose in the game. But newer players will find a mostly empty gameplay experience that can be completed in a single afternoon. Was hopeing for a lot more given the 3 year wait time but at the end of the day there just isnt anything here. puzzles are embaressingly easy, so many kyber bricks are just sitting in the open with no puzzle behind them just lying the middle of the street. Space exploration is non existant except as filler from going from one level to the next. On the plus side the game does look amazing and many iconic locations can be explored and that classic lego humor peaks through every once in a while. unfortunatly this game will get pointless after unlocking the 1 millionth kyber brick than can only be used to unlock a pointless upgrade to your hero.  Similar to the early stages of No Mans Sky its a massive ocean but its not deep enough to even drown in. Was mostly dissapointing but had so good laughs along the way. 5 out of 10"

It may just boil down to me being too old or not liking the more open world concept vs the older more linear titles. It gives off a very large as a lake and as deep as a pond vibe. All in all I think it fits the age range it was meant for. Anyone below the age of 10 or anyone with a short attention span should totally pick this up but anyone wanting a newer and prettier Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga should not waste their money."

159,GRIMM,https://steamcommunity.com/id/punishedtoplay/,18,,1,43.2,April,"6,","9,737",0,1,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the latest in the long running line of licensed LEGO games from Traveller's Tales. It was also one of the most heavily anticipated games in the entire TT LEGO series. And why is that? Well, for 2 reasons... 1, the trailer looked amazing. But also because it was one of the titles that spent the most time in development and promised the most new features and changes to the series. If you look back at the long line of games you'd see we got a new LEGO title pretty much annually. In some years we even got as many as 2 or 3 new LEGO titles. Basically Traveller's Tales was pumping these out like clockwork. And then after 2019, after the release of The LEGO Movie 2 Videogame, nothing. We got our first glimpse in 2020, but it would not be for another 2 years until the game finally released. A little over 3 years between games. Yes, the anticipation for this one was as strong as the force. But was it really worth the wait? Skywalker Saga takes the formula of past LEGO games and makes a bold choice to switch things up, which results in a few steps forward, but also a few steps back. Where the game really shines would be in 3 key areas: Action, exploration and unlockables. But where it suffers mostly would be in the overall flow of the main game. The game is comprised of 45 stages spanning all 9 movies with 5 stages per movie. The stages are tied together by segments that will have you go through some of the free roam areas, but in general they are rather short. Most of the playtime will be spent revisiting stages to unlock things you could not access before with new characters in free play mode. It's a bit of a downer when compared to previous LEGO games, and this is primarily due to the fact that levels are not padded with puzzles but rather focus more on action segments with minimal puzzles, which is a 180 turn compared to previous titles. While the game does do a good job capturing many key moments from the movies, there are also a lot of key scenes at the same time that fans will notice are missing, or heavily compressed into short segments in cutscenes. While it's not unusual for LEGO games to rush through story pieces taken from movies, it is still a major bummer since we waited this long. Luckily the game makes up for some of this in other areas. For starers revisiting some stages is a blast. While some are going to be short no matter what, others do feel a tad bigger when revisiting to unlock things. Also the free roaming areas for the most part are massive with tons of side quests and lots of things to unlocks. You'll spend a lot of time hunting down these new things called kyber crystals, which are essentially the replacement for gold bricks. In past lego games gold bricks did not hold much merit. Some games allowed you to accept new quests if you got so many gold bricks, but that was pretty much it. Kyber crystals on the other hand can be used for currency to unlock new abilities or enhance character classes. And there are a ton of these to collect also, with over 1,000 of them scattered across the entire galaxy. Combat is also another major improvement over past LEGO games. In previous titles combat was simple, and pretty much a straight up button masher. That's not to say this one is not also a button masher. It still can be. But there is also a bit of strategy to be found here as you can pull off combos now. Sometimes enemies will even block your attacks if you mash the same button over and over, forcing you to press other attack buttons. It's a small change, but its still a very welcome one that takes away from the tedium of pressing the same attack buttons over and over. Ranged combat has also been overhauled, as you can freely aim in any direction now like a traditional over the shoulder 3rd person shooter. Some enemies will even have reactions depending on which body part you hit. Like shooting at their legs may make them fall over, or shooting the helmets of stormstroopers will actually make them fly off revealing the lego heads underneath for a followup headshot resulting in an instant kill. You can even sneak up on enemies for stealth kills. Hell, there's even a counter button, though I did not see much opportunity to use it as the LEGO characters you play as already seem kind of overpowered as usual not giving you many opportunities to need to use the counters. But when you do get an opportunity the counter will result in a special move reminiscent of some of the flashy spectacular special moves you'd see in some of the past lego games. Some of them very good for crowd control too. Needless to say, the combat changes overall are a very welcome addition to Skywalker Saga.Aerial and space combat is also a welcome change. In past games that featured this you usually had 2 types of aerial and space combat: On rails or tilted top down. Now there are still a few on rails segments here, but they have ditched the tilted top down space combat for full control of your spaceships, meaning you can get into  some full 3D dogfight action for once! And it's a blast when you are in these stages. You'll be weaving in and out tie fighters with your X-Wing, Millennium Falcon or whatever ship you have access to while taking down the enemies or shooting at cannons, satellite dishes or other objects on massive space stations or dreadnoughts or other massive spacecraft. Sadly this type of combat is limited to certain stages, and the space sections you'll find while exploring the galaxy are just that... space. It would have been nice to see more action in the free roaming space sections. Visually Skywalker Saga looks phenomenal. The name of the game is anything but realism, and instead your characters are all comprised the typical LEGO bricks. I mean we are talking a LEGO game. But the mixture of solid animation and little details make it a visual treat. You'll find little visual nods like when you walk around Tatoonie seeing bits of sand getting stuck to your minifigs, or walking through the snowy tunnels of Hoth and seeing your bricks getting snow stuck to them. Cutscenes also have some wonderful animation that look like a proper CG movie. Very spectacular and a great treat to behold. And the overall look of the worlds is also eye candy on the LEGO scale. Like many past LEGO games, it is a mix of bricks and more realistic looking set pieces also. Typically if it is made of bricks it can also be destroyed, so some areas can get completely wrecked leaving bricks scattered. Sadly the chaos does not last as bricks do disappear when destroyed after a short period. But all the same it is very satisfying breaking things down. Mostly the game runs great for me playing at 3440x1440 with an RTX 2080 Super playing on max settings. The overall stability of the game is far from perfect however  as there are still some bugs to be ironed out. I have had the game crash to desktop on me a total of 4 times in the 25+ hours I have played so far. 2 of the crashes while revisiting the General Grievous. There are also 2 areas which also are prone to massive frame drops even on high end machines as multiple people have reported (myself included). Those 2 areas being the Droid Factory Frenzy stage and the Ewok Village. Traveller's Tales is aware of some of these issues so now it is just a matter of how long before they are fixed. But when not encountering the 2 aforementioned sections the game runs extremely well for the most part. Pros:Amazing changes to combatHuge open world hubsTons of collectablesAerial and space combat is extremely funCons: Story skips or rushes through several key segmentsBugs still need to be ironed outOpen world space sections feel underwhelmingOverall, I think Skywalker Saga was indeed worth the wait. It might not be perfect, and some parts do feel rushed, but that aside I have had a blast so far playing the game."
160,Derangedraptor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Derangedraptor/,172,,0,13.5,April,"6,",663,7,1,"I give it a thumbs down but really think it is just a meh game because the devs put a lot of love and care into it and made it follow the movies much better than the original games. That being said, if you are looking for an experience similar to the original trilogy game than don't buy this. In my opinion they gutted everything that made the original fun and replaced it with a lot of empty open world and near zero combat. Most of the game is spent going from place to place essentially seeing a lego set of the movies. I am incredibly underwhelmed. If I wanted to watch the dialog from the movies, I would just watch the movies. I came to smash things and solve puzzles and 99% of the smashing has been on random lego structures and the puzzles are badly placed and scattered across the open world rather than the actual missions. The only upside is how nice everything looks. Otherwise it totally fails in comparison to the original lego star wars games.Update 1: I played through the first three episodes and the Phantom Menace was by far the most boring. I would argue that the game got progressively more fun, but there were a ton of missed opportunities. The main one being that they make you go check on Anakins mother in ep 2 but don't let you fight the sand people, instead they make you wander around for 15 minutes with no action and then give you a cut scene."

While i would never expect this from a lego game, it is rather tame in regards to combat difficulty, at least from what ive experienced so far. Its unlikely that though the journey your heart will be racing, hands sweaty, mind racing as you try to beat the final boss of an episode, because that isn't TT style of lego games, rather the combat is satisfying and fluid, rewarding you for combos and parries and massive hoards o enemies to mow down and fling pieces everywhere!! Great game overall, definitely the pinnacle of TT games, however if you like intensity in a game, this may not scratch that itch, its relaxing and slower, but really really immersive."

169,MrKeego,https://steamcommunity.com/id/keego1745/,82,2,0,89.8,May,"2,",304,13,1,"I must preface this review by stating that I have fully completed the game. I have 100% in-game plus the extra Steam achievements which are not required to pull the 100% lever on Yavin 4. I don't usually post Steam reviews for the vast majority of the games that I have in my library, but this is an exception. I hope my lack of formatting skills and/or awareness can be overlooked in favour of the review itself.Perhaps it was the hype that got me overexcited to buy and play this, considering my last REAL experience with LEGO Star Wars games was with the Complete Saga, and I believe perhaps this hype affected a lot of us whose last games were the Complete Saga. I hope that my review will stray away from nostalgia and focus on the real problems I have with the game, but first...THE POSITIVES:It would be wrong to say that content is lacking as a whole in this game. All of the character models are incredible, the planets and space battles/levels are beautiful, and a lot of work evidently went into making these characters and worlds come to life. The comedy through the story missions in particular, I felt, was excellent, and many gags landed perfectly, such as DJ's tool to get out of the Canto Bight prison being one of those orange brick separators and his reward from the First Order being a solid gold brick separator. Those moments stuck with me throughout my experience, but unfortunately they were far too short. I believe that is my main issue.THE NEGATIVES:I think you would understand given that I haven't recommended this game that I have far more problems with the game than I have praise. Thankfully I did not experience many bugs throughout my experience so I won't include any lengthy sections on them, but I do feel like a game that has been delayed for as long as it was should have been able to iron out the more ""game breaking"" bugs that certainly do exist.THE STORY of the game is incredibly lacking in comparison to the open world, so much so that I feel like the actual Star Wars story was put on the sideline in favour of the extra content. Extra content is not a bad thing in any capacity, but when it outshines the story then there is a problem. This game is the saga of the Skywalkers, hence the name, yet you will spend most of your time doing anything but furthering that goal. Extra content, challenges, and side missions should surely compliment the base game and not overshadow it. I feel as if the added content was done more out of ""memery"" than story telling. I remember more from having to annoyingly escort Gonk droids around than I remember of the Sequel trilogy levels as a whole.THE LEVELS are incredibly short. I get it: it's a LEGO game. The levels are always short, right? Well, no. With the Complete Saga as an example, the levels were as short as necessary, not as short as possible. I'll paint this picture with reference to the beginning of Episode I. ""Negotiations"" is present in both games. In the Complete Saga, it is an entire level. In keeping with telling a story, everything is present from the movie. The ship the Jedi arrived on is destroyed thus trapping them on the Trade Federation ship, it introduces the player to combat, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan discover the invasion force destined for Naboo, they sneak aboard one of the Droid tanks, and the level is over. In the Skywalker Saga... the level consists of a cut-scene showing the destruction of the ship, one hallway and then you walk out into the hangar and that's it over. It's not even counted as a level in the game, which is something else that annoys me to a great degree. It actually feels like filler - no more than a connection between meeting our characters and landing on Naboo. It's underwhelming to say the least.MORE FILLER THAN CONTENT plagues this game. For certain levels I spent more time travelling to the necessary planet, waiting through loading screens, painfully making my way through walking segments, sitting through a cut-scene, all for a level that may last five minutes. The odd level will take longer, but what purpose does a level like the Naboo monster escape have to the Skywalker saga? Dodge attacks, shoot backwards, mission over. It's frustrating having levels like this but then the actual levels where you would expect content is lacking. Again, Negotiations could have been made a level and the Naboo underwater monster level could have been taken out entirely and nobody would lose any sleep over it. But every trilogy has these missions where when you start the mission you don't actually start the mission, you just start the build-up to the mission. Every time it happened my friends and I would jokingly shout ""GAMEPLAY"" as we walked forward half-listening to exposition that is incredibly rushed.LEVELS THEMSELVES LACK CONTENT outside of walking to the missions. Episode II's Geonosis Arena is probably the worst offender of this. Following the battle with the individual creatures, the arrival of the Jedi to the arena was almost non-existent. The main Jedi appeared, like Mace Windu, Kit Fisto and Ki-Adi-Mundi, but outside of that it was really quiet. And the arena battle amounted to basically nothing. In the Complete Saga, the Arena battle felt alive. It felt as if a battle was taking place around you and you were just trying to survive before the boss battle with Jango Fett. This time, Jango is part of the droid ""attack"", you kill him relatively quickly and that's that over. The Geonosis Arena battle meant an incredible amount for the story of Star Wars, with most of the Jedi being killed since they were unprepared for the combat they were facing and the overwhelming odds against them. In the game it's just an excuse for the Jango Fett boss battle. It's shockingly empty.100% IS A CHORE and incredibly frustrating. Gathering over 1,000 Kyber Bricks scattered across the planets was not fun, and realistically meant nothing because I easily beat the game (meaning the story levels) without upgrading many of my character classes. By the time I finished Episode IX I had hundreds of these things just sitting and waiting to be spent on upgrades that now meant nothing to me. The data cards were an interesting take but pretty much pointless outside of the stud multipliers. Why could they not have been bought with the billions of studs I amassed throughout the game at some kind of inter-planetary shop? I had far more studs than I knew what to do with any hardly anything to spend then on, and 25,000 studs for hints or whatever else means nothing when my pool of money was in the billions. Gathering characters was the least fun I had in this game. Sy Snootles, Mama Hutt, and other INCREDIBLY RANDOM characters are all in the game and have to be unlocked through purchase or missions, but they couldn't include a character customization option? I have no reason to run around as Babu Frik outside of two seconds of it being funny before realizing he's ultimately pointless and only included to add more characters... for some unknown reason.--------I could go on and on about issues plaguing the game, but I think I've at least shown the most egregious offenders in this review. I did not enjoy playing through this game for the most part. It felt incredibly rushed, it favoured side content instead of main story content, missions were far too short and linked with unnecessary long travelling sections, wanting to 100% this game was a slog instead of an enjoyment and so on. It has its moments, but I genuinely don't know if even the casual player would enjoy playing through this game. It lacks originality for a series where LEGO would make it original enough. It's just... bland. Uninspired, boring, frustrating... and bland. For those reasons I just can't recommend this game. I doubt many people will see this review, and I'm just a random guy on Steam so my takes probably hold no merit but hey... I thought it was important to say that no, this game has a lot of glaring problems."

The missions are fun, the jokes are enjoyable even at their worst, and the openworld is nicely made. If you want a fun game for you and your friends (skip the online coop problem) in the star wars universe this is the game for you. However, compering it to old LEGO games (Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, DC Super Villains) that I played this game is not as good at keeping you in after the campain is finished. In DC Super Villains I went for 100% complition due to the fact I wanted to collect all the characters. They all felt different and I considered the missions different and interesting. I did the same in The Clone Wars with the characters but in this game the way they have it set up they all feel the same due to the class sistem. I get that the Jedi and the Sith are preaty similar but Leia and Cody shouldn't be identical in abilities. This simple designe choise has a few effects on replayability and might be the reasson character customisation was dropped. This sort of character class sistem is boring because I have no reason to search for other characters once I get one off each class since I could do everything now, there were no new mechanics, no new interesting combinations, everyone feels the same. If to this you add an open world that barely throws staff at you unless you ask for it and even then it is week, you get a post mission world feels empty. The ships do not change that with few of them feeling different esprcialy when it comes to turn and roll rates (they are the same for all) makeing dog fights not skill based but spam turn better based. With all of that beeing said the game is still peaty good. The ground combat is fun and enjoyable, the missions are fun and if you sow the films you will enjoy them, the bosses are well made and the places look and feel good, its just that they didn't fill this wonderfull game with enough unique things."

182,Na0ki,https://steamcommunity.com/id/na0ciriSpielt/,281,22,0,24.8,May,"23,",287,23,1,"This game felt so good during the first few episodes, but every second more made me realize that it's all fluff, mindless padding and barely challenging gameplay. Now, before you stop reading, I know this is a LEGO game. I know Lego games aren't supposed to be Elden Ring, however, if  the AI misses 99/100 shots while you're completely standing still, if the key to a door is literally a meter next to you, if the puzzles become so mind-numbing that TT Games gives you the skill to simply skip them, it becomes apparent that you never had proper gameplay, just padding. Kids these days play Fortnite, games that aren't really always easy, but if you even dare to put Mario or Kirby next to LEGO Star Wars the Skywalker Saga then you realize that even kids games have an ounce of a challenge to them. This game makes Mario or Kirby games seem hard.It isn't all bad. The planets to explore are amazingly designed. I had a lot of fun exploring these, getting the collectibles and enjoying the beautiful graphics. I never knew plastic could look so good. The combat is also giving me a strong Devil May Cry vibe, but it's obviously a bit easier. Doing combos in this game feels amazing until you realize that the foes you're put up against aren't even nearly worth the spectacle. They die in a few swings which never makes the combos outstanding, rather short-lived.Now. Let us talk about the bad. Every game deserves some criticism, even a LEGO game.This game has so much content, but most of it isn't quality.When it comes to the episodes, there is a lot of padding. Most of the time you spent 20 minutes going to the missions, and even when you arrive, they aren't really fun. The game acts like you overcome these great challenges, but none of the battles give you more than 5 enemies per spawn to fight. Great wars like the battle of Kashyyyk, the arena fight on Geonosis are completely mindless, and it ruins the atmosphere. These battles feel more like barren wastelands with the occasional droid trying to do some minor havoc by missing 90 shots. I can't even call the puzzles ""puzzles"", since you aren't even doing the one thing you're supposed to do during a puzzle. Thinking. Most of them are just pressing a button at the right moment with a 5-second window, or simply pressing 4 buttons in the correct order. This is yawningly boring and handholding on the next level. Especially level design completely suffers through that. There are never any stakes, no sense of urgency or whatever. I even ran through a level and somehow got the ""True Jedi"" achievement, my guy, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.The bosses too are most of the time recycled. The first boss you meet will be the most fun, because Darth Maul, Count Dooku, General Grievous, Darth Vader or Kylo Ren will have the exact same attack pattern. It is simply copy and pasted.The level selection itself is odd too. Each episode has 5 levels, which completely limits TT. The battle over Coruscant, the fight between Mace Windu and Palpatine are generic cutscenes. That is truly sad. The Complete Saga was better in that.Last, but not least, the cutscenes. The cutscenes are well animated, however the game doesn't do well in telling the story in its own way. It completely misses the impact of many cutscenes, like Anakin's mom dying or Order 66 happening. Luke loses his parents and immediately goes ""I guess I wanna be a Jedi"". They often miss the point, for the Sequels it makes sense, because they don't have a point, but the lack of explaining makes me want to rather watch Star Wars and play a game like LEGO City Undercover rather than playing this game, which has the ""story"" of Star Wars in a LEGO game setting. Humor too often falls flat. The Complete Saga had many jokes, some subtle, like Darth Vader's corpse sliding into Luke's ship. Disappointingly, the humor in this game is so on the nose and so constant, every serious scene you saw in the trailers gets ruined by humor before and after. Not even one cutscene goes without trying to tell a joke, I only laughed at 2. You can't be funny, if you start expecting when the jokes will come and are rapid firing into your funny bone. It doesn't work. 5/10, I had more fun exploring the planets than doing actual story related missions or side quests."

187,Penguin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kjseb/,84,3,0,49.3,June,"8,",435,6,1,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a disappointing game, a fact that took me a while to fully accept. I didn’t want to believe that one of my most anticipated games of the year could let me down in such a big way.I started off by playing Episode 1 and for the most part was enjoying myself. The updated combat system felt refreshing, the visuals were stunning not just for a Lego game but in general, and the cut-scenes still had that Lego game charm. After playing around in the open world between each mission, I realised my goal of achieving 100% would be easier by playing through the story missions first, then alternating between open world for collectables, and then replaying story missions in free play mode to collect everything I missed or was inaccessible. I got to the Darth Maul fight and thought it was quite fun. I was still enjoying myself at this point, but some doubt was starting to creep in. Around Episode 3 is when I started really noticing how much the game was using the old walk-and-talk method to convey immersion, where a character provides the illusion of gameplay but is not more than a cutscene with very limited control. Some missions would involve more walking than actually getting to play the level, which is an issue the original Lego Star Wars games didn’t have. For some reason, it seems this game is taking the modern approach of making games more cinematic, which may work in more story-driven games like God of War, but doesn’t really work here. The more the game progressed, the more issues I started to notice. While the combat is fun, it boils down to spamming X on the controller, with the occasional button added in as enemies can now block your attacks. You can pull off some quite spectacular combo moves with a lightsaber akin to Devil May Cry, but unlike that game, this game doesn’t reward you for being stylish, therefore providing little incentive to do more than the basics. Shooting is mindless, monotonous and sometimes broken, such as shots not being registered. Dying provides no inherent risk to the player, so any sense of challenge dissipates. The bosses all boil down to the same combo - damage them until their first health bar goes away, forced quick-time event, repeat until all health bars are depleted. There are over 300 characters in the game, but with only 9 dedicated classes, they feel like 9 characters with different skins and each of them functioning the exact same way. The story doesn’t know if it wants to be serious or funny, which provides a real jarring juxtaposition within story immersion. It really doesn’t feel like a Lego game, as it removes features found in old Lego games like puzzle variety, the ability to build fun objects and being able to create a custom character. It’s a traditional third person action-adventure game with a Lego skin. When I reached Episode 5, I realised I stopped having fun a while ago and was forcing myself to finish the story so I could move on to open world - the part of the game I really wanted to play. Once I finally reach that point, I started to enjoy myself again, but that  was short-lived when I realised that each planet you explore was basically a re-skin of another. Kyber bricks are the main form of collectable in this game, which are like the golden bricks found in other Lego games. Although most of them would only feature around 250-350, Lego Star Wars made the choice to have , more than half coming from the open world and roughly equates to 40-50 hours of game time (by my estimation). Each planet would house Kyber bricks found through basic exploration, races, side missions and more, but the variety caps after one planet. I have completed 67% of the game, acquired about 750 Kyber bricks, explored just over half of the planets and fully completed Episodes 1-3. During Episode 4 in free play mode and having close to 50 hours in the game, I realised I was playing only to reach the 100% goal and I wasn’t enjoying myself.I stopped playing and haven’t returned since. The game does have its positives. Collecting data bricks, (this game’s equivalent to red bricks in the other Lego titles), allows you to unlock some fun extras like big head mode, pew pew mode, all lightsabers turning into baguettes and more. I can’t pretend to act like this didn’t put a smile on my face and honestly, it extended my game time. The planets are perfect recreations of the ones found in the movies. Exploring Naboo, Tatooine and Coruscant was a great experience. I don’t recommend this game, but I can see how others may enjoy it more than I did. If you were thinking of picking it up, I’d honestly recommend playing the old Lego Star Wars games instead (they don’t have the sequel trilogy, but that may be an added bonus to some). It does most things this game set out to achieve, does it much better and will continue to be fondly remembered for years to come, which is more than I can say for Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga."

195,Elixir of Will,https://steamcommunity.com/id/RegretZero/,40,4,0,15.7,January,25,"1,043",0,1,"Skywalker Saga is a game I was low key excited about. I fell off the Lego games wagon a long time ago, sometime around Lego Indiana Jones/Lego Batman. I remember playing Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga for hours and hours with my brother during my childhood, so despite the fact that I’m not hugely into Star Wars, seeing the original announcement and occasional news of Skywalker Saga evoked some nostalgic feelings in me. I didn’t think it’d be my game of the year or anything, but a semi-open ~~world~~ galaxy Lego Star Wars is the kind of thing that would have blown my mind as a kid, so I figured it’d be moderately enjoyable and worth checking out. Unfortunately, the Skywalker Saga really let me down. My main complaints boil down to four things: the overall lack of polish, the lackluster method of storytelling, the lack of trust in the player’s intelligence, and the variety of systems that feel simultaneously overcomplicated, pointless, and too simplistic.When I first started playing Skywalker Saga, it appeared to be a pretty polished game, but that illusion quickly faded. Every single time I open the game with borderless window selected, it doesn’t display correctly until I switch to fullscreen and back again. There were also a lot of clunky moments - things like pressing a button prompt to interact with something but somebody/something getting in the way, so you’re locked into a walking animation until that is resolved, which can take quite some time. Worst of all, several times during my playthrough a level became completely glitched (typically during boss fights when the enemy froze while invincible and the scripted part failed to trigger), requiring me to restart from the beginning. Skywalker Saga’s story is fine - it’s Star Wars, enjoy it or don’t, I’m not getting into that. It’s the storytelling that I take issue with here. There are lots of silly moments as you’d expect, and that was enjoyable to see. The problem is that Skywalker Saga levels are so incredibly scripted and constantly take away your control to show you something (often something completely mundane that you could’ve easily figured out yourself if it weren’t shoved in your face). It really sucks all the fun out of it when you keep not being allowed to play and have to sit and wait and watch something happen. This frustration is further compounded in boss fights - most bosses have multiple health meters and they tend to become invincible as each one empties until some scripted thing can happen, which gets old extremely quickly. To make sure I wasn’t blinded by nostalgia about this, I went back and looked at some let’s play footage from TCS to compare with, and they were much more reserved - just placed at the start/end of levels rather than constantly interrupting you throughout. That seems to me like a much better system. I remember going back and replaying levels in TCS with silly characters (such as the custom characters, notably absent here), but I have zero interest in sitting through all that scripted stuff again.Then there’s the apparent lack of trust in the player’s intelligence, which is one of the things that I find incredibly annoying. Like many of its Lego game predecessors, Skywalker Saga frequently throws little puzzles at you that you need to solve throughout your adventures. This includes things like smashing things up to get pieces to build into something else, opening locked doors, or using a droid to do any number of things. Building weird little gizmos (the boxing glove drill was my favourite) to clear obstacles is fine, but the rest of this stuff just feels like useless padding. The droid unlocking minigame boils down to rotating a couple of rings around to align the correct pattern, which sometimes requires literally 2-3 button presses. Unlocking doors requires you to either do this very slow dpad QTE or remember a pattern of 4 dpad presses, depending on the door. These things and the droid QTE are all so incredibly simplistic and slow that it feels like their only point is to pad the game out, which really sucks. And don’t come at me saying “it’s a game for kids!”, because that’s not an excuse. You can put more complicated things than that in a game for kids, it’s been done before, they can handle it. There are a lot of additions to Skywalker Saga that were not present (or present, but less so) in TCS - things like an upgrade system, the explorable semi-open world, the more in-depth combat system with combos, the little weapons caches, mounts, etc. All of these things are really cool ideas that on paper should elevate the experience, but they fail to do so. The upgrade system is convoluted on multiple levels, requiring you to find and spend kyber bricks (only around 270/1000+ of which are in the levels themselves, by the way) to unlock perks. Annoyingly, the skill tree consists of a lot of unrelated perks which are locked behind one another, so it sucks to see later down the line that you can increase your damage by 10% but first you have to upgrade your movement speed, unlock the ability to detect hidden collectibles, and other things like that. I realize that a lot of games do things like this, but typically the skills are at least organized into sections that make sense, so unlocking the best combat skill requires investment into other combat skills, but here it’s just a bunch of unconnected nonsense. On top of that, a lot of the upgrades are really boring/useless - % damage increase to melee, % damage increase to ranged, faster build speed (lol), etc. Surprisingly, I found the semi-open world areas (more like hub areas, really) to be more annoying than anything else. I’m sure if you’re into the game it could be fun to go around doing the little side quests and exploring for secrets, but when you just want to play the story it’s incredibly annoying how many instances of “follow the moving gold objective indicator for a couple of minutes” there are. All that pointless walking around is pure padding and the game would have been better off without it. Another issue is that because the developers want you to be able to get distracted by something along the way, “follow the NPC” missions will stop in their tracks even if you get too far ahead of them. You literally have to follow them the entire way or they’ll just stop moving and progress will halt until you come back.Skywalker Saga’s updated combat system is probably the thing I dislike the most about the game. Sure, you have access to some different combos and it’s fun to aim the guns yourself, but this came along with enemies no longer being one hit kills like in TCS and instead having health bars. I despise the health bars. The game constantly throws mission objectives at you like “defeat the stormtroopers” where you have to whittle down the health bar of a bunch of boring basic enemies that pose zero challenge whatsoever. The combat system in TCS by comparison is incredibly simple, but I think it works a lot better overall - neither of the games are challenging, but at least you weren’t bogged down with so many boring time waster enemy segments. I guess I just feel like if you’re going to expand the combat and make enemies this much more tanky you’d be so much better off going even further with it whereas Skywalker Saga’s combat seems halfhearted and can still easily be mashed through… so what’s the point?At its core, Skywalker Saga feels like a game made by people that had a million different ideas on how to expand on the core gameplay of previous titles - a skill tree, a combat system with combos, semi-open world hub areas to explore, and a million other things, but none of it seems to really come together in the way you want it to. On paper, all this new stuff should’ve been exciting to play around with, but in practice none of it was fleshed out enough to be satisfying, and in many ways the new stuff ends up feeling like a big step back."

If you enjoy this game and are reading other reviews, understand that this review is based on my own personal experience with my friend while we played through all 9 stories in Coop.This is a game that I had initially looked forward to back when it was first teased. However, the much needed delays honestly caused me to lose interest in this product, for example I didn't even notice the game had released (even though it was on the top of my Steam wish list) until like 3 days after the fact when I started to see people posting glitches on Twitter.Now, the reason that I do not recommend this game is solely because it is absolutely not worth the full price in the current state it's in. The levels are rather boring and quite spaced out (some of them even drop your frames into the single digits.) If you're interested in this game, make sure that you get it on sale so that you don't feel as duped for how little there is going on in the game.Pros:Some jokes land and are actually goodThere's plenty of references to other medias that have a clever spin on themThe graphics are goodThe clone wars voice actors did a really good jobPlenty of things to collectGun play is fun when it's used which is quite rare""I don't like sand""The Combo system is quite fun, but it's hard to get a high combo since there's not enough enemies to get a higher combo than maybe 30 without abusing a bugCons: Really empty feeling hub worldsVery few enemies to fightVery few instances where you have to buildReally short missionsPlenty of bugs that really shouldn't be in the gamePoor quality of voice acting for some of the Original Trilogy and Sequel TrilogyAnimations on characters either not loading or just looping?Lots of clipping and things being where they shouldn't be (not just clone troopers in the wrong era)No online coopSteam remote play is super unreliable and can drop connections to dirt despite having no real reason to do soEnemies don't have enough health to make Melee combat feel rewardingTutorials that won't stop even after disabling them in the settings like literally 25~30 hours into the game and still getting tutorials on basic features Cover system isn't necessaryCoop boss fights are really boring, for example, one player is Obi Wan and the other is C-3PO sitting there watching the fightClaustrophobic multiplayer split-screen (what happened to the one that the other games used with a thin line that moved dynamically around the screen?)Upgrade system makes you overpowered way too fastDatacards remove the enjoyment of finding the red bricks of prior gamesOverall, my friend and I both gave it a 5/10 and we played through every mission in the game and have an overall completion 61.2% and have no interest of going back to finish it to 100% since so many features of the game are just boring.I understand that this game means a lot to many of you on how the game is a ""upgrade"" to the Complete Saga, but there are so many intentional game design choices I feel are just so poorly made (for example the missions can be completed in speed runner times without even trying that hard.)Like throughout the time playing this game, there were plenty of times where we had joked about the fact that this game was delayed by 2 years, such as when fish on Naboo would swim through the level itself.If you like Star Wars and Lego, you might like this one, but just wait until it goes on sale since again, it's not worth the full price.Like many Lego Star Wars games are collect-a-thons, this one bolsters a high amount of things to collect, but those collectables are used as a way to cover up many of the significant flaws with the base game. Sadly the level of polish on this game could've ultimately used another 4-8 months to resolve.Some exploits to have some fun with:Force characters can bypass basically every puzzle  • Standing on a crate that's meant to be lifted with the force can bypass some puzzles  • Droids are basically the crates and characters all in oneThere are more than a few instances where objects keep dropping money far past the point that they should no longer be doing so  • The barrier on the Hoth mission in Echo base can be shot infinitely and will repeatedly drop blue and gold studsSome characters can stun lock enemies There are many instances where you can shot at an enemy's spawn and rack up insanely high combosLego Star Wars is something that I hold near and dear to myself, and this game just has far too many flaws in it's current state for me to find it enjoyable. If you are still interested in this game, by all means, pick it up, play it and enjoy it as much as you'd like to. Don't let my review here stop you from enjoying the game just because you either disagree with me or have noticed similar flaws, since I am not advocating for you to avoid the game all together, I just do not believe that this game is worth buying when it's not on sale.Did you notice the Eddie Izzard reference to the Death Star Cantina standup routine? (this video here  ) like Darth Vader is literally in the Cantina on the Death Star itself when you go there. It seems that nobody really caught this reference since it's not as child oriented as many other jokes in the game are, and yes, I know about the ""Better call Maul"" joke."

I remember Lego Batman 3 where every quest was a meaningless fetch quest where Lego Kevin Smith would ask you to go pick up some dumb collectible. Lego Skywalker Saga has varied quests, fun openworld puzzles, and a very good use of cutscenes, meme lines, and other well timed gags that make reliving the star wars stories again still fun. Some reveiwers are saying the finished the game in 20 hours, but I have been finishing most puzzles on the way, and even in over 24 hours I have really only made it through the first 3 episodes."
198,amazonen66,https://steamcommunity.com/id/amazonen66/,34,1,1,20.6,November,"17,",804,0,1,"This is that game I’ve always wanted, an open-world star wars game, but it's also the game I dreamed of when I played lego star wars 1 and 2 (separately of course), a bigger and better version of the lego star wars games. I always wanted to fly around in space, explore the different locations and planets, take in the vistas and unlock all the characters. This game is all that, but I’m not the person who wants that anymore. All I can see now is the shallow combat, the frankly bad side quests, and the wonky performance. I didn’t care about that back in the day, but again, I’m not that person anymore. I care now, I care about the experience and the story but I’m also a gameplay-first kind of guy and this game just didn’t deliver outside of the almost great combo system. The complete saga has better level design, it’s not the better game but as an adult, this is so easy to see- this game didn’t focus on level design as much. They wanted the world to feel sort of grounded and realistic but this hindered their puzzles and their levels. But as a kid, The Skywalker Saga would have wowed me to a degree so high I would probably get a heart attack and die right there and then. But now I can’t lie and say I didn’t expect more from a game I’ve wanted to play my whole life.So I guess it's fine."

The episodes stories feel a bit short but the cutscenes make up for it. The only reason why I would not recommend this game at least for now is the amount of game breaking bugs I've come across. Mumble mode causes softlocks, there was a point where I couldn't get out of the ship when starting the game back up so I was basically stuck and wasn't allowed to free roam I don't know how I fixed it just did it itself, and things just not triggering so I can't progress and I'm forced to exit the level and re-do it it's just infuriating. There's a ton of more bugs I've encountered and so have other people. I would love to 100% this game but with the bugs I just can't right now I hope they will release a patch soon that fixes all of this and if they do I'll change my review to recommend it but for right now I just can't recommend this game just for the bugs itself."

It's filled to the brim with content, keeps the charm of the originals while updating features. It's probably the greatest collectathon game of all time with over 1000 kyber bricks 100s of minkits, level challenges, and characters. The levels are fun and mix it up a lot. I mean the amount of ideas they packed into the main story is great. But with that said some things really didn't seem like they were very utilized. Like the class special abilities. Also there is an abundance of quick time events that aren't partially interesting, but it is a kids game. And for a kids game it looks amazing, the graphics are great and the style has grown on me. I would give this game a 9/10 honestly because of all the fun I have had with it. But there is one huge thing  that holds it back. THIS GAME IS BUGGY. There are smaller funny things like Boba's infinite bast to huge game breaking bugs. Here are just a few of the big things that I and others have dealt with.> If you have mumble mode on in Ep 9 the story misson won't let you go on unless you restart game game without mumble mode on.> infinite loading between worlds> Stuck camera > infinite death loop> Random crashes when changing characters> And one of the worst things ever is the character menu, everytime you load in it shows all your characters are new, when you buy a character you have to cycle though before you can select them,  bought characters are shown as not bought and just over all it isn't a nice UI, its just hard to get to who want to select and the sound effects aren't great and it's because of the character menu that we have character dupe glitch.I could go on and on about lag and models not loading in. There is a whole lot wrong with this game, and it's probably has to do the how the game forced to be made at home during the pandemic and was delayed.  But these things can be fixed and changed. I don't thing every little bug will be fixed but in the future I hope this game is a lot more playable. And still with all the bugs I will keep on playing, because this is a fun game. So I would give this game a 7/10"

230,Kitty Nat,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120400500/,10,,1,103.5,March,16,77,0,1,"We've been waiting since 2019 for , originally scheduled for spring of 2020, to be released.  The delay was not all due to the pandemic.Was it worth waiting for?Er, mostly. Storyline is the usual solid adaptation, but the collectathon/completionist partcontimues looonnnnggg afteward.The game is organized into the nine movie episodes, plus a Galaxy Exploration for easy access to the hub worlds for Free Play.Since each trilogy has its ardent fans (and detractors), the game makes the opening of the first movie of each (Ep I: The Phantom Menace, Ep IV: A New Hope, and Ep VII: The Force Awakens) available to you from the start, so you can go to your favorite trilogy first or save it for last.The game engine has been rebuilt, but not reinvented.  Most of the gameplay will feel familiar to anyone who has played any other game in the TT Games LEGO franchise.In solo or co-op play, players switch amongst at least two characters, using their various abilities to solve puzzles and advance through the levels.Levels have a variety of segments.  Some are simple exploring.  The light saber duels are represented and involve lots of button mashing, often with breaks to chase the opponent and do more exploring.  There are some spaceship chases, and destroying enemy big ships.New are the combos you can do in battles for extra power or for more money from defeated mooks.  These are not particularly needed, though, and just hitting X a dozen times works, too.With all the shootouts in the franchise, the devs have provided some low cover that both sides can use.  I've never been into shooters, and mostly resorted to the Jedi.  It is slightly annoying to have my character slip into a ""taking cover"" pose when near the barriers that make up the cover.  The barriers are rebuildable, and the pieces become distractions with their ""build me!"" animation.A brand new twist here are the Classes.  Characters in these games have always seemed to fall into various categories or classes, and here they are official.  Classes here are Jedi (Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda), Dark Side (Vader, the Emperor, Maul), Protocol Droids (C-3PO), Astromechs (R2-D2, BB-8), Bounty Hunters (the Fetts, Leia as Boussh), Scavengers (Rey), plus Heroes (Leia, Padme, soldiers for the good guys), and Villains (Empire and First Order officers and stormtroopers).  There's also an Extra category for characters that don't fit easily or can't be used well, such as some tiny droids.  As usual, the devs give you almost every character model they whipped up to use, even if the cutscene or level segment missed the cut.All characters in a class have the same abilities, with no unique additions or combos.  On the one hand, this makes it easy to remember which character can do what.  On the other hand, it also prevents the devs from giving a character a unique ability (Think both hobbitty Baggins with the One Ring.)The distribution of abilities is always a source of annoyance for fans of a property adapted into a LEGO game.  Someone somewhere is always scratching their heads over why a certain character was given (or not given) a particular ability.For example, both Bounty Hunter Fetts have a jetpack, but cannot fly with them, even though both use them as bosses.  The Jedi and Dark Side share an odd one, using their light sabers to climb walls by sticking them in the wall and pulling it up.  And Heroes, Villains, and Astromechs all have their own terminals mainly to open stuff up.On the other hand, one of the best abilities is given to the Protocol Droids.  Hub world NPCs speak several different languages.  Many characters know a few languages, but only the protocol droids, created specifically to help in diplomatic affairs, know ALL of them.The Classes each get their own set of Upgrades, and there are ones for the whole game as well.  This not a min-max system, as you can jump in at almost anywhere and can accomplish most things without getting a single upgrade.  Rather, these are simply things that make the game a bit easier or faster, such as stronger hits, a greater health bar, more shielding for ships, or bypassing the repetitive minigames for Hero/Villain terminals.The sheer size of the game world(s) gives you a daunting task if you are a completionist tackling the collectathon part of the game.Seriously, the galaxy here is HUGE!  Almost a couple dozen planets to visit, some with a couple different areas to go to.  And some of the planetside areas are large in themselves, often beating the expansive Manhattan of the LEGO Marvel games.The main thing to collect are the Kyber Bricks ( of them!), a reference to the kyber crystals that power light sabers and give them their color.  This is the game's version of what are normally Gold Bricks.A chunk of them are awarded simply for completing the levels or accomplishing various things in the levels, such as for completing minikits (micro version of space ships in the game) or each of the three tiers of True Jedi money quotas.  (The partial credit is new and a nice touch; it's very difficult to reach the full amount in Story Mode.)New this game are Challenges.  Get all three for a level and you earn a Kyber Brick.  Some are easy, such as simply rolling to shake a homing missile in the flight levels.Some however, I found very difficult, such as: You have to either luck into completing the Challenges, buy the hint in the in-game menu, or just find the solution in an walkthrough.  The hints can be tricky to figure out.The hub world collectibles include more bricks, character or vehicle access (you still have to pay to fully unlock them), and datacards.There are the standard races, on land and in space.  In space, the races include Scramble Runs, in which you do not have to pass through the gates in a particular order.In space, you can destroy a Kyber Comet for a few bricks, or be offered smuggling runs to another planet.  You can even take over a capital ship (the Dreadnoughts, Star Destroyers) by destroying its defenses and defeating its captain.Hub world collectives include Datacards.  With one of these and enough money, you can unlock the Extras that in past games were earned with specific Red Bricks.  These include the traditional money multipliers and some stuff's just fun and silly, such as the Cantina Song on a loop, or light sabers looking like baguettes.Both non-flight levels and hub worlds have maps.  The hubs even have indicators for various things, including useful NPCs who will tell you about collectibles.  Some just point you to the nearby brick, others send you offworld.  Recruitable characters ask you for a favor before they will let you use them.Many missions will have you hopping from planet to planet.  There are also a couple ""find all of us"" missions, including hunting the mouse droids and finding a wookie tourist on every planet.The game has a shooting (and light saber toss) FPS mode.  As I don't usually play FPS games, it took me a while to figure out the controls.  A tutorial game would have helped.  There are some aim assist toggles, though, and one tap sets the gun to continual fire.  However, there is a shooting gallery (to earn a vehicle) that the aim assist doesn't work/help with.This is when I had my ragequit moment.  I had sunk a bit over 100 hours in the game ALREADY (including 10 or so on one particular level's challenge), well over the time on any other LEGO game, and still had about 30% left.  I had the satisfaction of completing the trilogy of trilogy levels, including everything in Free Play, but wasn't going get everything as I usually do in these games.  So, time to move on.But it was still a fun ride for most of the way."

Combat is a bigger focus in this game with a slightly deeper hack-and-slash system and over-the-shoulder third-person shooter combat. The character system has been overhauled as well, with characters falling into particular classes that can be upgraded at large. And being a comedic Lego adaptation lets the game make the most of the movies' settings and set pieces while smoothing over the prequels' wooden dialogue and blunting the ridiculousness of Palpatine somehow returning. Ultimately, this game is no masterpiece, but neither are the films. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is the best direct video game adaptation of the films that you're gonna get and a very fun one on its own merits, and that's all you can really ask for."

Still a questionable relationship, but not illegal or statutory rape. Furthermore, they were separated soon after meeting, as Padme went back to Naboo and Anakin became a padawan under Obi Wan. While it was obvious that Anakin was in love in episode 1, it's not really suggested that Padme was yet having sexual thoughts about Anakin. They did not meet again until episode 2, where they were both above age 18. Only then do we see Padme falling in love with Anakin. So, in conclusion, it's reasonable to assume that they never had sex until episode 2 and Padme is definitively not a pedophile.Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."

249,Vex,https://steamcommunity.com/id/5687754378342/,61,1,0,2.2,April,"8,",292,0,1,"When I was a kid, one of my fondest memories was getting a PS2 with the first Lego Star Wars for Christmas 2005. That game helped shaped my childhood and my love of Lego games going forward. Lego Star Wars 2 the year after was also a great experience with many improvements over the first. The humour and quirkiness of these games set the bar for gaming that both children and adults could enjoy. The 6 missions per film with between 30 mins to an hour-ish per level gave a good amount of gameplay and despite the levels being ""linear"" there was plenty to build with hidden secrets to find. From illusive Minikits to Dancing Skeletons to Snow Globes on Hoth there was many a fun and unusual quirk in these levels.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga gets rid of these big levels in favour of smaller set pieces with 5 in each film and honestly... it's a mess. I find myself running between various points in hub worlds (a cool idea in principle) to small missions that feel anti-climatic, unfulfilling, and generally clunky without the fun puzzle solving that the first games had. There are puzzles but they feel hollow, samey, and erratic. By the time a mission starts, it's over and I am aimlessly wandering an open world talking to generic NPC's that I could skin how I wanted and import into any generic game.Co-op is pathetic at best. Player 2 is often on the sidelines in big epic encounters as opposed to the original games where they were an active participant to defeat the boss. I will stop rambling but all I will say is, the devs obviously worked hard on this game and had a love for Lego Star Wars but whilst it is a large game it feels unfocused and more like a spiral galaxy of ideas that sound good but just make the core gameplay feel rushed and unfulfilling. The plot goes by at lightspeed and I feel as if I am not able to take in the story of these amazing films. Honestly, if you love this game then I am happy for you but for me, I recommend the original Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga to fill that nostalgia with a more focused and fun and satisfying experience that honours the narrative of Star Wars more."

The levels were long, the combat was too easy and really the only thing that the original game had going for it was the sheer amount of unlockables.This game fixes almost everything that's been wrong with the lego games, the combat is fun with a new combo system and lightsaber throwing, movement feels good, there's a free third person camera, the graphics are beautiful, and it doesn't ask for hours and hours of your time per session. The way they tell the story in this game is just like the older game, it's quick and only touches on what it really needs to. There are so many collectibles in this game and I've been having a good time going around collecting them all, most require you to switch to a specific character type, or solve cute well designed puzzles :)There are a few criticisms I have concerning the flow of the gameplay loop mainly in the prequel episodes, it feels like episode one and two specifically never leave you alone to explore. It was overwhelming, it asks you to travel to a new area what feels like every five minutes leaving you no room to breathe. While I like the fast progression of story in this game, for some reason it just goes WAY too fast in the prequels.The one other thing that's a little lame is that there are 'puzzles' where you walk up to a device with a specific character and perform a series of actions to open a door or power something. These are never built upon, it's always the same throughout the entire game and they feel arbitrarily placed around the game with no rhyme or reason. But honestly that's where the bad stuff ends.Finally, do not play this game in fullscreen. Play in borderless windowed. This game does not want you to tab out and trying to tab back in after doing so will either result in the game being scaled down to 800x600 and you having to set it back or the game just not focusing again. you have been warned.Overall this game has been a blast so far and i'm excited to keep going. It brings back the same emotions I felt when playing the original as a kid and sometimes i find myself smiling at just how immersed i am in a silly lego game :) There are a few poor trends this game follows but they don't outweigh the pros at all. play this one"

I know most people wish the levels were longer, but for me, it keeps the story moving along at a pace I can enjoy.Everything and everyone is in this game and it is amazing to see the world they built and how graphically amazing it looks for legos walking around.I just wish they had online co-op.

No cool new missions or gameplay only cool cosmetics to try out in the missions you have already played with the normal characters.

If you're getting this game for just an open world star wars game you're in the right place but if you're getting it for a Lego star wars game, don't bother. The good: The open world is amazing being able to travel between different areas on Coruscant or moving to Tattooine is great I love wondering around in this game and finding all the small details in the open world. The stories [at least the stories we got] are funny at the very least they were able to keep the lego game aspect even within the open world. Datacards I love the concept of Datacards and how they are essentially the red bricks now make them feel more star wars like.The Graphics are amazing I love wondering around this game and exploring these locations with such great graphics. The cities look amazing even the movies we dont speak of have good looking areas that fit them they feel alive.The Bad: The story is lack luster half the time when I've been playing this I am playing a mission only for it to be like... Thats all? I'm already done...? Iv spent more time collecting Kyberbricks on the planet than actually doing the actual story of the game. I wish we got more story even 1-2 more missions per movie would of been great but they went with only 5. I would of sacrificed some of the open world for more story honestly. Split screen is terrible, iv tried playing with a friend and if you even remotely try aiming the aim circle is placed right behind your head half the time and its unplayable to even look around properly. Custom Characters removed, Honestly the removal of custom characters is a big thing for me. Its sorta the key factor of a Lego Star wars game and its just removed. Taken out... makes me sad to see this feature leave us. Ray is the first character we hear when we boot up the game... not even a skywalker.. why? They could of done Anakain... or Luke even ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ben... but they picked... Rey.... not even a skywalker.Characters are no longer unique, R2D2 can no longer hover. Palpatein cant shoot lighting, Darth Vader can force choke but every other dark side character ALSO has this ability. This game is missing so much in terms of unique characters. Honestly I would of given up a good 100 of these characters in this roster for unique characters and custom characters to come back. The platforming in this game feels clunky and incomplete some of the time just falling off do to my character refusing to do the proper taskThe enemies are way to easy I only died once in a boss fight and that was to maul and my own mistake. Dosn't help if you farm kyberbricks you can get not 1, not 2 but 4 health bars making it almost impossible to die. Ship combat is way to easy I understand this game has kids in mind but honestly really? Conclusion: If you want a free roam star wars game, go for it, but if your buying it for a lego star wars game. Don't bother its not worth it. It dosn't even feel like a Lego game anymore. Unique characters are gone. The levels are short and there are few of them. The collectibles are outside the levels now. Custom characters are gone. Just to many negatives that overwrite the positives. The only thing this game really has going for it is the free roam is great.Edits and Corrections: Something else I will add the combat system upgrades are amazing. Don't get me wrong on that, the issue I have is again characters just feel the same and dont have anything special going for them.Also for the split screen comment about how its ""Not needed"" a big part of any lego game in my opinion is the ability to go and play it with a friend. Just cause you don't play it with a friend dosnt mean others won't try. Split screen in this game just needs to be improved.For those thinking palpatein can shoot lightning he can briefly use it in his combo. There is nothing for long lasting actual lightning like he does in cut scenes. Iv also just played to confirm I see no traces of them actually using their abilities that people say they have so my point still stands. Little traces of it in a combo does not count cause they are still the same as any other character. Their unique abilities are gone and that is what im upset about. Not the fact palpatein has lightning in his combo.Correction:  I was wrong about force choking not being in the game but literally ANY DARK SIDE CHARACTER can use it which still proves my point about no unique characters."

I enjoyed exploring around the various planets and collecting the bricks/etc.  It was almost too many but most of them were interesting enough to collect to make it seem not as tedious as it can be in other games.My only real complaint is it seems the only DLC still coming is more character packs.  I'd love to see some additional planets even if they only offered the usual things per planet hub area with some more quests.
279,Sinico,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sinico2/,7,3,1,20.7,April,"6,",79,4,1,"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.StrategyHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.The Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.A Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.The Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.However, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.Against non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.It is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.In a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.Long-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.When there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.Passive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.Defensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.If the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.For Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.For Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.They can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.The Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.A Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distractedA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.This can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower."

There is usually one 5-10 minute mission per 1h hub area.* Lots of loading time... made worse by the mission design which loads a new level for 30s of walking.* Many missions are uninspired: You are not doing anything interesting, varied, ...* Some missions were clearly not tested / designed in co-op, with the 2nd player not being able to do anything for some time* Hub areas are littered with collectibles that require little to no thought to collect.... just enduring the tedium. less than 5% of the tasks actually require some though. With more than 1400 things to collect it is all quantity, no quality.* Inconsistent UI/controls, and in general lack of polish and streamliningAltogether it feels like they were just doing the game by-the-numbers, instead of iterating the design, and much to the detriment of fun missions, and puzzles. It's a shame, but it seems the developer do not really know what made some of the older ones fun (Lego Lord of the Rings is still one of my favourite)"
284,TheMaid™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheN00BDude/,6,2,1,132.1,April,"8,",118,0,1,"TL;DR: The game isn't the best LEGO game, it has it's pros and it has it's cons. If you want to buy the game for the star wars story, don't bother but if you want to play the game for all of the LEGO collectables then this is more than worth it's price. VVV Pros and Cons VVVPros:- Graphics- Collection of Characters- Space Mechanics- Most Combat (not covering fire)- Has Darth Vader (That's pretty cool)Cons:- Buggy- Designed not around base mechanics, but designed around assuming you have the assists on- Lackluster main missionsI am giving the game but only barely and honestly, out of bias, this thumbs up. In all honesty, the game has been a small mess to say the least. I've read a lot of really positive reviews all saying that the game is great, bugless etc. but this isn't true unfortunately.I'll start with the good things first. The obvious is the vast improvement to graphics and overall quality of the game. I've had great performance running the game on 1080p, max settings for what it's worth and I only have a GTX 960 graphics card, I'm pretty sure integrated graphics could run it if anybody is concerned about that. Anyway moving on, the game has a large collection of characters from each Episode varying multiple classes and this feature is really cool, you can upgrade each one and use each class to complete the few puzzles that exist, I'll get onto puzzles later. There are also various different ships that you can actually fly around space and onto different planets though flying is limited to space. Space battles are another cool thing, while travelling between planets you can get pulled out of hyperspace and be dragged into a space battle between 2 clashing factions. There are small scale ones where you destroy a few fighters and then there are larger ones that include the games capital ships. I love the combat, I'll say that, the new combat is really nice to use especially and mainly as a Lightsaber user. With blasters, it was very hit or miss, sometimes i'd have a blast using the different blaster types and just destroying all of the enemies that had gathered behind a single bit of cover or simply spraying across a crowd, lightsaber/melee combat just hit differently though. The new combo system is small but still cool, you have to start it with a regular attack and from there you can either use the force, go into the air then slam or just continue attacking. Pummelling Darth Vader in the corner with constant step backs, combos and lightsaber throws has to be the most satisfying thing I have ever done in a LEGO game. While the main missions leave a lot to be desired, the open world of the game doesn't, you can explore every planet from the 9 main movies and most of them really in depth too, all containing a large amount of collectables on each planet, I'm currently on Utapau and about half way through completing the planet. Large planets I'd say takes a good few hours to complete while the smaller ones just 1 or 2, but that all depends on how you play. Each planet also has Ships and Characters you can unlock by completing their respective side-mission which you may use rumors to assist you. Rumors are small hints that you can either buy from the menu or find with certain NPCs spread throughout the galaxy.Onto the negatives. The game is just buggy, there have been multiple times where I've had to reset levels because I have been unable to complete the objective which sometimes left a pretty sour taste in my mouth after it happened the 3rd or 4th time. There have also been times where i have flat out just fell through the floor on multiple occasions and I'd be left falling in a loop since the floor is also the last 'safest' place to reset. In some levels where you control a vehicle, mainly speeder and space fighters, I would just be thrown to the left or right for no reason, a complete 90 degree turn which resulted in frustration. Another thing with vehicle control, mainly in space, if the mission requires you to be going straight ahead and pushes you that direction while also giving the player free range, it just doesn't end well. If you turn too much to either the left or the right, the game would take control and instead of turning you back to the objective or simply resetting you, it decides to just turn in every direction it can which often leads to confusion and frustration of losing control of what i want to do. The next thing i want to bring up is the way the game is designed around the assist settings. The game has options to toggle on or off Aim Assist and playing with this off has led to a few rough levels, specifically the speeder chase on Endor. This level without aim assist is out right impossible, your shots would more or less always go into the ground unless your speeders front part got lifted by a bump on the level or something but other than that, there was absolutely no way to control it. The end result was me turning on Aim Assist for the first time and realising how much the game seems to function just a small bit better, with correct hitboxes and hitting targets. Next is level design, I know this is a controversial thing to say because ""It's a kids game"" but that doesn't justify the lack of puzzles and/or challenge to the game. If you look at previous LEGO titles, there have been puzzles galore and personally it was my favourite part of the LEGO games, trying to find out which pieces fit where in a grand scheme of bricks and layouts to unlock a mini-kit or some more studs was just exciting, in this game, that wasn't there. You'd maybe come across a room that requires you to move some large bricks into place so you could access a terminal to unlock a door which would grant you a kyber brick or ship. The next is levels, levels are so short and do not engage well with the player, most of the time you'll watch a cut scene, shoot some guys, finish the level and then another cut scene, they are also incredibly short and have at least one of the get behind cover and shoot mechanic in all of them, which after a couple episodes, starts feeling dull and I began to run right through them. The last thing with levels are bosses. Overall they're alright, they get introduced in a cool fashion but then you get a pretty mediocre fight. The fights go like this, Hit boss, boss runs, you fight troops, you chase after boss and then that loops 2 or 3 times depending on who you're fighting, it got boring pretty quickly. The last thing I want to talk about is the story, obviously it's going to follow the star wars story and that's cool, it's a reason i bought the game. However, I feel like the developers had more of a joke with the game and didn't take many things seriously, every small bit no matter how serious, includes a joke and it won't even be something small, it would just be something that ruined the scene for me.This is my first review so i'm sorry if it's a bit drawn out but i felt passionately about this game and thought id provide a few insights for anybody scrolling through the reviews, this may not be well received but it's just my unfortunate experience while playing the game. Either way I hope it helped.i am still going to be playing this a lot and will 100% it!!"

Now, after all the delays I have to say, its not the game I was hoping to play for the last 3 years. At first I thought I had fun while playing, but it was actually just the built up hype that wouldnt let me accept that this game is 0 fun. You just play through the levels and they all feel and play the exact same, for 45 levels. The Story is boring as f****. There are 4 types of levels: -) run around till you reach your destination and shoot enemies who literally deal 0 damage, even if you stand still-) drive around till you reach your destination and shoot enemies who literally deal 0 damage, even if you stand still. -) try to find a card or a key or another random object, you will need to progress further in the story. Those objects are extremely poorly hidden.-) fight bosses, who feel the same in every single bossfight and also do 0 damage. The prequels are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in level design, 0 puzzles and no difficulty. At least the original trilogy and the sequels don't feel that rushed, but still, TCS levels were 1000x better. The gameplay is actually good, it feels so much better than in the old games and the combos are fun to use. Problem is, you can’t fully use it because of the AI. It is impossible to die in this game, even if you are a child or a person whos bad at videogames in general. It is literally a challenge to die. The graphics and the open world *design* are pretty damn good. Very detailed and nice to explore. But after you‘ve seen every planet and completed the story missions (which takes like 10 hours max if you’re not collecting every single stud.) you have the open world missions left. Those missions are complete trash and not even a little bit fun to play. Over 1000 collectibles and over 300 missions to unlock the option of buying a new character. They all feel and play the same. Its repetitive asf. Its a shame that people defend TSS by saying the level design has simply „evolved“ and they had to break the „old formula“ for something better to come. I mean, they kind of made the game more modern, by applying the boring open world formula most triple A games have these days  I really tried to like the game, but its just bad. Even a remake of TCS would have been so much better. If you like to spend 100 hours in a game doing the same missions over and over again, just to complete it 100%, this is the right game for you."

I wanted this game to be a HD remaster, but i was open minded for a new style of game and would have been happy to accept a change on the format.Gameplay: This game has been simplified to the point of being boring. Lego games have never been hard, but theyve always been cute and ingenuative. It was fun to see the different ways they Incorporated a beloved franchise into a lego world, all the refrences, the humor. This game has none of that. The missions are bog standard, 90% of it is just running from place to place sitting through the loading screens. For some reason they designed the mission lay out to play out in the ""open world"" itself, meaning each section of a level is inside a part of an explorable planet, taking you out of the story while you run around looking for the huge glowing ring that lets you play the next section. Audio: Instead of using the original voice lines, they hired voice actors to imitate the original lines, some of which sound like the character but none of them are delivered half as well as they were in the movies. Gone is the charming grunting and gesturing, and theres no nostalgic rush to be had. Its just mediocre voice acting. I assume this was done to be able to easily add in lines that arent said by the original actors, but i didnt hear any of that, and even every side quest being voiced wouldnt make up for how badly done the lines themselves are. I prefer silence to cringe.Story: Its.. just.. why. The story is incredibly condensed, making every scene feels rushed and the dialog feel spliced and jammed together. Fun parts are skipped and replaced by mindless walking. Remember the naboo infiltration mission? No you dont get to play that. Instead, spend 5 minutes walking around the gungan city and sitting there ""escaping"" a monster where all you have to do is press a button when prompted. Remember in attack of the clones when obiwan finds out the location to kamino? Yeah you actually play that in this. Youre dropped into the world and have to run to dexters, once there you have to wait tables till he fixes his robot, only to sit down and have a 20 second conversation, then you have to run all the way to the jedi temple, into the library, then play a minigame to unlock the archive, then run all the way to your ship to fly to kamino, THEN you play an assasins creed follow mission and WALK from the kamino landing pad through boring hallways while listening to the kaminoin drone on about nothing till you get to the room. You spend like 20 minutes to get through what was a single cut scene in the first game. It adds nothing to the game but bloat, none of it is fun, 85% of it is running from location to location. This takes time away from story development and fun gameplay, because the developers spend their time on 20 minutes of nothing instead of adding to the world. Like much of modern cinema, its empty fluff to padd out the gameplay time. This was done in a single cutscene which was more endearing and gave more information than 20 minutes of banging my head into a desk. All of the cartoon humor has been sucked dry, I smiled a total of three times in 2.7 hours. At one point, general grevious dabs. As if he hadnt been made a mockery of enough in the clone wars, they made him do an already extremely dated dance move to further sap him of any and all intimidation he could possibly have. W h yCharacters: The characters are just boring. Its cool to see them in such high quality, but all of them feel the same. They have classes now instead of abilities. We have a new menu to change characters, instead of holding down Y and getting the whole list, you have to go through the menu to find a character menu, to find the class menu to scroll around looking for the character. None of them have noticeably better jumps, the astromechs cant glide, Jet packs are pointless. All of the classes combat comes down to spamming the button to do the exact same moves as everyone else.Co-op: Just painful. There is no dynamic split screen like in basically every other Lego game, it will be vertically split no matter if youre right next to each other or on opposite sides of the map. This leaves you with only half a screen, which makes it hard to enjoy the look of the level or even see what you need to be doing. Every, single level selection requires both players to hold down the select button at the same time, which sometimes just wont work. when youre in a ship youre likely to fly into your target while waiting for the other person to get positioned. Since theres no online play (in a game made in 2022), i have no idea why you need to agree to the level in the game, youre probably not going to be playing with someone you cant get along with.Im summary: I wanted a remaster, but i would have been happy with a good game that was different, i got neither of those. I got a boring, uncreative, uninteresting, clunk fest of a game for twice what the original cost on release. My very first video game that I, myself, owned was a lego game, its how i learned to use a controller, and how i learned my basic video game ""skills"". Ive been a fan ever since, but this will probably be the last lego game that i purchase. There hasnt been a good Lego game since Jurassic park, and this is no different. Rey Palpatine is at the very top of the menu in a game entitled ""the Skywalker saga""0/10"

A normal mission is just:you start in free world ---> run to the mission ---> cutscene ----> solve some puzzle ----> cutscene ---> boss fight ----> cutscene ---> free world ----> repeatnow as i said the cutscenes are well done and look great but theres just to many, and they sometimes do the fighting for you, if i wanted that i'd watch the movies again.If your lucky you get to fight some enemies before or after the boss fight, which is nice because i really like the new fighting system, especally the combo system, that is very well done just like the space battles which seem a bit underwhelming as there isnt much going on (only 10-12 fighter at most and 2-3 capital ships which dont shoot) but the ship controls are very good. Overall though the game also seems to easy, i have been playing this with a friend and its been really easy.So sadly i cant give this a positive review, i have only gotten to episode III after that i just didnt want to play the mission cycle for the 50th time again, maybe it will get better, i certainly hope so and if it does i will change the review but right now i would jsut buy the old lego star wars games as they are by far better.to summ it up:pro- Great Graphics- Great Cutscenes- Great new Control systemcon- Terrible mission design- Kinda boring Hubworlds- Only very short side missions in Freeplay"

330,Your C Drive,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CDriv3/,24,,0,25.1,April,"6,",186,1,1,"I actually do really like this game but I would recommend just waiting for some of these issues to be resolved before buying it, hence the reason I have the review set as negative. TT Games isn't really known for updating their games.Solid and very fun but definitely has some issues that no doubt must be resolved:1. Random performance issues. I noticed this a couple times but from what I played so far, it is especially significant in the Droid Factory level, where my average fps was just above 10. Yeah, 10. In most gameplay I get above 60 and sometimes fps can range up to 140, so the frame dips to 30 in certain moments and as low as 10 in others must be fixed.2. Some levels are quite buggy. Specifically on the Zam Wessell chase, my bolts would sometimes shoot randomly backwards into the air and worse, sometimes actually get stuck on and damage my own speeder.3. The hit-box on some characters don't match the model and blaster hit consistency is low in general. I think the hit-boxes are tiny or something, but the only work around is homing shots. But, you can't configure the homing shot sensitivity or have separate toggles for when you are or are not flying a ship. So you can either choose to never hit anything or to lose the skill ceiling of aiming unless you micromanage the option.4. There are options for most things that need options, but many of these options only have a single adjustable variable, meaning you can't customize options with specific variables in mind. I'm poorly wording this but essentially, you can't set certain setting specific to whether you're flying, aiming, using a mouse vs controller, etc. The options are all locked to either player 1 or player 2 and the player will again just have to micromanage the settings if they want them to be different based on how they're playing or what they're doing.5. there's no option to switch which side of the screen players use in co-op, which can be frustrating, no explanation needed.6. Sometimes the menus are fiddly. Specifically the character selection menu is really annoying and slow to navigate because you can't scroll quickly like in old Lego games and the menu resets every time you open it, meaning you have to spam the scroll button a LOT to test out new characters. You can actually select from your current character but that only works from within their character class. In general, the character selection menu is inefficient and clumsy.7. Camera is sometimes very claustrophobic and, importantly, can sometimes work against you by zooming in randomly and stuff.8. Sometimes your crosshair and the target you're attacking can get muddied behind the mess of effects and HUD. It can make combat and pursuit levels frustrating.There are also a few personal tidbits I want changed:1. Add custom characters. It takes development time, I know, but before this was confirmed to have been removed as a feature before release, I was quite excited to see a new character customizer even more complex and in depth than the ones in the most recent games. And it's just not here.2. There are so many fun mechanics in this game but most of the time they're slow, removed despite appearing in old games, or practically never used. Remember building? Yeah, in the game based off of a construction toy? I think I've used it maybe 3, 4 times in total in finishing two episodes. R2 and 3PO panels use a minigame that it time consuming and boring. The old games made the right call to have them automatic. Frankly, they could be even quicker than in Complete Saga. Short characters' vents are removed entirely. Just a lot of the fun and unique abilities of certain characters feel underutilised in the story missions.3. The fact that 2 of the 3 main combo attack buttons are also used to jumping and using a special ability makes melee combat feel inconsistent and bizarre, because unless you have already initiated it with a standard attack, you'll just jump or use a special ability instead. Or, if you want to jump or use a special ability while in an engaged state, you end up attacking an opponent instead. Awkward and clumsy.It might seem like I'm giving this game a tough run, but because it has years of Lego games to look at as a guideline. Yes, I expect and prefer new and improved content over previous games. But it is sad to see a huge reduction and removal of some fan-favourite features in old games, like character/class-unique abilities that do have their utility but are underutilised in the story, or the cancellation of a character customizer. Sad and I hope the game improves. I'm glad it's really fun and at least the content is complete, but there are definitely issues that plague the game which would be a huge deal in a less casual game."

333,The Bagus Man,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126147546/,5,,0,8.8,December,"19,",136,0,1,"This game is about as far away as you can get from the traditional lego formula. Not to say that straying away from established formulas is a bad thing, but when you replace it with the ubisoft collectathon model, complete with terribly slow walk-and-talk segments, then you've got an absolute bore of a game on your hands. I had been eagerly awaiting this game as The Complete Saga was fantastic, if a bit basic at times, but it was a good start and we saw that formula improved on in games like Lego Batman 1. In the years since it seems that TT's design model has totally regressed, with walking and talking segments outweighing the classic puzzle styled levels by a wide margin. Levels (from what I played before giving up, that being episodes 1,2, and the first half of 3.) also seem considerably shorter, to the point where I was beating levels before I even realized I was in one. This is an incredibly lazy game, do not waste your time on it if you don't want a completely generic experience indicative of the homogeneous game design models of the past ten years."
334,Azrieel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dantheevil/,82,13,0,40.7,April,"12,",264,0,1,"My honest opinion about this game: Absolute DisapointmentI preorded this game on my switch and also pc and as I was playing i was left with disapointment.Here are a few reasons:Nr1: Although there is a high amount of characters you can play, none of them really feel unique. For example every sith and jedi can do the exact same which is using the force by lifting up objects, throwing light sabers, influencing the weak minded. Not even palpatine can throw lightnings nor can snoke or doku. Nr2: Duel of Mustafa. I mean wtf. If you have played the complete saga in coop you actually get to play as obi wan kenobi and anikan and fight against each other. In skywalker saga however you get to play as obi wan and the other coop partner has to play r2d2 or c3po and watch the fight from aboveNr3: Although there are 5 levels per movie they are ridicously short and between those levels you have some half-hearted follow missions where you just follow a character inside the open world and sometimes have to protect them. This mechanic feels like its stretching the total story time."

So here is your TL:DR:This game is an utter disappointment not only as a video game, but also as a Lego Star Wars game.It has horrible optimization. The multiplayer is Co-Op LAN only (We're in 2022 folks). The level design is abysmal.The game is practically only cutscenes which are very short. There's so much on the HUD and so many menus and options for a game that it's distracting and just too much for what should be a simple Lego game.The entire game is as follows: Walk, kill 3 enemies, next level, super fast cutscene, repeat.In a slightly more detailed version:In an loose fashion, I'll talk about some of my problems with the game that specifically don't have to do with the actual gameplay but more about the devs choices such as much options, game options, bugs, and optimization.Me and my friend were looking forward to this game for years. It was clearly announced far too early, as we both agree it doesn't seem like a completed game. I thought after Cyperpunk happened, devs would be a little more careful.To start with a minor annoyance that I had personally experienced, I just thought I'd add to the list.The game obviously by default was fullscreen. When changing to Windowed Borderless and re-launching the game, it does not put the game over the windows task bar. Alt-Tabbing out and back in doesn't get rid of it, neither does doing Alt+Enter.I had to manually go into the options to re-enable full screen, and then back to windowed borderless.Upon learning that this game does not have online Co-Op in 2022 we shrugged out shoulders and said ""Alright, let's do Remote Play"". A great solution steam has built in, it doesn't always work the best but it does work, thanks Steam.I have 1.7 hours according to steam at the time of writing, approximately 1 hour was spent trying to figure out the Multiplayer and fixing it to work. If you want to play via Remote play with your friend, you have to use 2 controllers. As a keyboard user this was an issue for me, however I dug an old xbox controller out and got it to work just fine. If you only use keyboard, and your friend uses controller, then you're going to have to settle with being player 2 as the game does not recognize any other way of configuring between players. It prioritizes the Controller user as player 1.This issue is just silly, but it gets worse. On a 27"" screen, after succeeding with 2 Controllers to enable Steam Remote Play, my friend joined the game and it activated our vertical split screen in which it was extremely hard to see the entire time. We had to just deal with it as there are zero options to change to horizontal split screen in the options. When compared to the old Lego Star Wars, where the camera would combine upon being close to your other user, this is a major downgrade. Sum up: You're forced to use vertical splitscreen, no there is no other option.Also quite a silly issue. Both I was willing to deal with if the game was a good time, as it wasn't THAT bad.Like I said, we've been anticipating this for years, I wasn't gonna quit because of some some splitscreen getting in the way.Also on my system I currently run a 1080ti for my graphics card. I played through the entirety of Elden Ring with ease and no issue. For a Lego game, the frame drops I had were upsetting to say the least, and I've read that many other people are having trouble with this as well, so be careful if you don't have a $3000 GPU in your PC.This brings me to the actual gameplay. Most importantly!The game is just  fun.The old game was so well thought out, every level felt full, and was drawn out the correct amount of time, maybe even a little long.This game is the complete opposite. We started with Episode 1, so on the trade federation ship. We blew through the halls of the ship with minimal enemies to find ourselves in a cutscene that leads to Naboo below within the first 3 minutes of playing. We got up to and finished the entire Pod Race within the next 15 minutes.The game is nothing more than a million HUD icons in your face telling you where to go or who to talk to, with a million menus for things like planets, upgrades, characters, etc. You walk 10 steps, kill 2-3 small groups of enemies, activate next level, rinse repeat.The fact that a game in today's age can be so poorly designed and uninspired is baffling to me. Nobody wants to pay 50-60 dollars to have a conversation, walk 2 feet, kill 3 enemies, and then start the next level. This $50 price tag ($60 if you want a few extra characters) is an atrocious insult to those who spent their hard earned money on games. Especially in a time where for the exact same price you can get Elden Ring, one of the most well crafted games in a very VERY long time, this game is an insult to the old game and gamers alike.Now I don't wanna go blaming the developers immediately, because we can't know what happened. But I personally suspect Disney personally ordered this game to push their trilogy once more in a new way.If you have played the old Lego Star Wars, please heed my warning and avoid this game.If you have not played a Lego game before and this seems exciting to you regardless of this review, please try it and you should see what I'm talking about.To those of you who enjoy, I'm very happy for you, however I cannot ever under any circumstances recommend a terribly optimized walking simulator that advertises itself as the remade Lego Star Wars in which costs 60 bucks.Thank you for reading, have a good day."

Why is that?Pros:Graphics: The new engine looks very nice, even a little better than in TFA. I'd love to see more LEGO games in that qualityHumor: Let's be honest, that is the most important part of the LEGO games, and they absolutely nail it. The cutscenes are gold, and there are tons of easter eggs you can spot.Cons:Open World instead of Levels: You're walking longer from one mission to another, than the actual mission has length, sometimes a level (which was ~20min in every other game) is only 4mins long and the only element is to outrun a giant fish.Performance: I've had so many crashes I stopped counting. I remembered LEGO Games as a stable gaming experience, but even that seems to have faded away.Overall Content: Since there are already games for the Prequels, Originals and TFA (and The Clone Wars as well), you could think that the game just needs to rework some levels and fill the rest of the sequels. But instead of building on top of the great existing levels, the devs decided to throw it all away and start from scratch. I can understand why such a decision is made, but I cannot understand how underwhelming the result of that process ist. This feels more like a teaser for a real Skywalker Saga game, which probably doesn't exist.No online Multiplayer: Do I even have to say more to that? It's 2022 folks. (and yes I know such things as parsec exist, but thats no excuse for not including such a feature in the game)So overall:This is an okay game. It's far from bad, but also far from the greatness of previous LEGO games.If this is your first step into exploring LEGO games, go ahead and you will have a great time.If you have played many LEGO games before and loved them, I suggest you skip this failure."

358,Gruebber,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GruebberGrub/,40,,0,41.2,April,"17,",496,11,1,"I will preface this that I have played this entirely co-op and that we have only played episodes 1-5 so far, I will update as we play more episodes.I'm going to be honest. I've been rather disappointed by this game. All the improvements have been wasted. Not to stay there hasn't been some good moments or jokes, but its hard to enjoy the good when faced with the bad.The new combat system is great, but the enemies don't complement it. The bosses don't even work with combos. The dog fighting doesn't control well. Co-op isn't all that great which is a crime for a Lego game. Some races hide the next objective out of view if in split screen, but are in view if playing solo. Some races are impossible co-op. Some stages just have player 1 or 2 doing nothing for awhile while the other has their fun.It feels like the game is rushing you through the story, and stages are so short. Some are done in what feels less than a couple minutes. The forced replay minikits are still rampant as well.I will say the hub maps are fun to explore, maybe even the best part. They are amazing to explore and hunt down the collectibles, but feel barren enemy wise. You may encounter a couple of enemies like droids, but that's rare. NPC's usually run instead of fight so there is no Cantina bar fights. Now I understand that constant enemies would be annoying, but a designated area or two on some hubs would of been nice.The upgrade system is nice and puts the bricks you collect into good use, but some are annoying, some overpowered, some useless. It is good that you can disable them at will. A lot of the extras/cheats/""redbricks"" are mostly annoying, but some are rather fun.I want to love this game. I really do. This game has so much potential, but it feels squandered heavily. I would only recommend this game on sale.Edit: I will review the episodes that we played through.Prequel Trilogy:Episode 1:  The best of the prequel trilogy. had some good jokes and the levels were fun. All except the Gungan vs Droid battle. It was extremely short and not fun.Episode 2: Not as good as 1, but still fun.Episode 3: Sadly disappointing. A lot of the jokes don't land well, but that's a personal taste. The fight against Anakin on Mustafar was not good. Original Trilogy:Episode 4: Starts out great, then drops in quality. The trench run was extremely short with very little dog fighting.Episode 5: Best movie in my opinion, worse movie in this game.  Then the Hoth battle was disappointing. To be honest, it was better in the original game. There was no Dagobah mission, just a hub map. Cloud City felt cut in half.Episode 6: Easily the best in my opinion so far. I thought the jokes here mostly hit and made us laugh. Sadly no level to blow up the Death Star II. Sequel Trilogy:Episode 7: Mixed bag. Some parts are fun, others are not. While the Death Star and Death Star 2 did not have any dog-fighting, and DS1 had a small trench run, Star Killer Base surprisingly had a dog-fighting section and (still kinda small) trench run section. Why not also for the Death Stars? End of the day, its ok.Episode 8: It's ok. Not good, but not bad. It's just kinda there.  The last stage was quick to finish with not much going on. Not much more to say.Episode 9: Its better than the last two I guess. Its still ok. Sad that we don't participate in the fleet battle on Exegol. While there was not a mission to blow up the Death Star 2, there was a mission here that felt like it, which in turn only makes me want a mission to blow up the DS even more.  I feel like all of the Episodes would of been better with one more mission as they all felt more like a summary of the movie rather than the movie itself, even at times missing a key scene.Edit 2 : Now that I and my co-op buddy have finished all Episodes, my feeling on this hasn't changed much. Its still disappointing. I still only would recommend this on a sale maybe 50% off or more. Even if you get it on sale though, its still gonna be disappointing as its missing key moments of the saga that no sale will fix."

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

376,XiroxisTheBeard,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nightcrawler0188/,20,1,0,1.2,April,"7,",774,0,1,"I'm a big fan of the LEGO game genre, with a few of them being in the super narrow list of ""Games I've 100%'d."" I'm also a fan of (most of) the Star Wars series, playing past games like LEGO The Force Awakens and the original Star Wars LEGO games, so it seemed right to hop into this one. That being said, something just didn't feel right about it.I started with Episode I and it felt rushed. Key moments of dialogue/story were removed or, honestly what may be worse, changed. I've experienced LEGO games doing this in the past, but it didn't feel as egregious as this one. Rushing along the story and prioritizing the collection of items rather than the enjoyment of the story and world around me didn't sit well. The HUD was entirely too crowded and busy, including the menu screen for upgrades and such. The pacing in LEGO LotR or The Force Awakens felt much better, where collecting was the secondary objective to enjoying the story play out. LEGO Marvel (the first one) and LotR nailed the idea of an open world with things to do while having a cool, silly and engaging story. In the Episode I track, I felt overwhelmed by the amount that I could do in the Hub locations without being able to do much with them (because of Free Play lock, which is normal for these games), while at the same time I was underwhelmed by the Story missions' substance. Trying to fit NINE movies into one game is quite a task, and it may just be too much content crammed into one space. I'd much prefer Quality over Quantity.Bug-wise, the cut-scenes were a bit jumpy and climbing up ladders was a nightmare.As a positive, the game looks gorgeous, from the locations, to the player models having dirt on them. Wonderful work on that front.Overall, I love LEGO, LEGO games, and Star Wars, but this iteration doesn't grab me. It feels off, less engaging and, unfortunately, not very fun."

Now do that again but this time in a different order!"" For me that wasn't fun at all. I didn't play it but man it looked tedious...especially with all the bugs.This game is basically that but it doesn't have the bugs so it's slightly more bearable. This game is NOT lego star wars. It's a different game with a lego star wars skin slapped on it. The levels themselves are severely lacking, very few mechanics, boss fight mechanics are reused over and over again. And the game makes you go from open to open world to open world in between levels to waste your time so you don't realize just how short the levels are. For example the very first level you're on a space ship and...oh you just hover over the trade ship and press a button...why is this here? Anyways after that you're in the meeting room just like the old lego star wars...oh wait that's a open world/hub world...ok now the level started and you're in jar jar's home...oh wait that's another open world...ok now you have to go to the chief and tal- WAIT WAIT HOLD UP FOLLOW JAR JAR while he moves ever so slowly to the chief THEN YOU CAN TALK TO HIM! Then you have to walk to the ship on the opposite site of the hub world on the lowest level. THEN the first level finally starts...and all you do is press 2 buttons while a giant fish chases you. One to shoot and one to dodge...that's it. literally a 5m level and you had to spend like 20 navigating the stupid ass hub worlds. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? This gameplay persist throughout most of the game...1) Open world is not fun and it's dryOk that's fine because the open world areas are fun right? No...not really. It's basically just an open world with collectibles and NPCs you can SOMETIMES talk to if you have the right characters that can understand the language because that's a mechanic...cool. They do have enemies but once you defeat enemies in the open world zone they NEVER EVER respawn unless you create a new save file. YEAH!! If you want an open world Lego game there's other options that do it better.2) Player 2 experience is awfulAlso do NOT play this with a 2nd player...the fight with Anakin is literally just player 1 most of the time and will occasionally switch to player 2 as R2D2 so they can press a button to activate a panel...THATS IT! Player 2 is highly disregarded a LOT and that kind of thing happens many times.3) Controller support issuesThat's once you're playing the game that is. First this game lies about ""full controller support"" as it doesn't support the PS controller and while it does work it gives the Xbox prompts which is mildly annoying. I had to use a 3rd party software to get it to give me PlayStation prompts. However then the share/select button that closes the holo menu didn't work so I'd have to press circle 3-4 times to close out of it...so I fiddled with the software for like 2+ hours and couldn't figure it out because the button worked outside of the game but in game refused to recognize the button press. Ok...whatever R3 isn't being used...here it is ""open holo menu"" let me just rebind that...surely it will rebind it for closing it too right? right!?4) Horrible button remapping with very little options...you can probably guess...it didn't. Because whoever was in charge of button remapping let me just say...they are either really stupid or they rushed that crap together in a single day. So I couldn't rebind it and also most of the button remapping option just rebind the button for like 10+ different actions instead of just one...like HUH!?! THIS GAME IS 50 BUCKS AND YOU- naaah. I had to deal with so many controller issues on a 50 dollar game that has ""Full controller support"" and once I played the game I literally got through episode I in less than an hour with only 10m being ACTUAL levels and the rest was just going from point A to B in the open world. Which lacked any action or anything interesting.Like I said before this is some other game using the Lego Star Wars brand as a skin. If you want nostalgia sure it works but gameplay wise it's not the same and when you beat an episode rather than feeling satisfied you are left feeling empty like ""That's it?"" and concerned that you'll be done and tired of this game really quick.TLDR: Player 2 experience sucks, game lacks content and is dry, does NOT actually have full controller support. I'd honestly just buy force awakens or complete saga over this game.Now that I've critiqued the game I will say this is by far the BEST looking Lego game to date as they switched to a new engine and the graphics are simply stunning. The art team did an outstanding job I will give them that so honestly that's about the sole thing that carries the open world...while it's boring gameplay wise, it is beautiful to take in."

Let me tell you first why I can talk about this game and second why I think it's subpar for Lego games.First, I've played almost every single Lego game released (even those old ones like Rock Raiders and Lego Racer), so I've been a fan of these games since I was a kid.  I've played all the Lego Star Wars games (except I hardly touched TFA).  Ok, so let's get into why I don't recommend this game.1. Level design: The levels are very, very short.  Like some can be completed in 5 minutes.  They probably average around 10 minutes, the longest maybe at 15.  Don't expect excellent level design like in previous titles.  No puzzles, hardly any areas to explore.  Only collectibles are studs and like 5 parts of a minikit.  This game decided to focus on semi-open world hubs with short missions interspersed.  I'd be fine with that if the open world had anything interesting to offer.  90% of the worlds are focused around collecting kyber bricks, and after a few hours, you realize all the puzzles to get the kyber bricks are recycled every planet.  There are a few side quests that really stand out, but there are few of them.  Overall, level design is very poor, and the short levels just aren't made up for by the bland open worlds.Even more disappointing to me was the removal of several key levels from the previous Complete Saga game.  There is no Battle over Coruscant.  There is no space battle over Endor.  These are skimmed over in quick cutscenes, like 10-20 seconds long.  Very disappointing considering how much potential this game had.2. Character selection: There are a ton of characters in this game, and the Skywalker Saga doesn't ignore some of the more obscure characters, which I appreciate.  Unfortunately, as in most Lego games, about 80% of the characters are identical in how they act and attack, the only difference being their appearance.  There are unique voicelines for key characters which I found very enjoyable, and the company leaned hard into memes, especially prequel memes, which added a lot of enjoyment for me.  Jetpack characters got a hard nerf.  You can only hover low over the ground for about 3 seconds before you run out of fuel.  Very disappointing considering how far you could fly as Jango and Boba in previous titles (I have heard Bo Katan's jetpack is much better, but I haven't tried it myself).  The Jedi characters have several different lightsaber combat animations now which is a positive note.  They all handle pretty differently and are unique and fun.  Blaster characters on the other hand are very bland and boring to play.  The over the shoulder style camera for blaster combat is great for fighting but less so for trying to clear out an area of breakable objects.  The blaster characters in general didn't have enough differences to make them interesting.  3. Fighters and space combat: this was a big step forward for Lego who up till now had kept fighters locked into a flat plane with really weird camera angles.  Now you fly starfighters with 3rd person perspective camera and can fly any direction.  Unfortunately, there's very little to do in space.  There are some encounters, but they become repetitive after a few hours.  But the starfighter levels are amazing, especially the Droid Control Ship over Naboo.  Wish we'd gotten more of these levels instead of having them zipped past in cutscenes.4.  The story: Closely tied to the levels, the story is enjoyable but far too rushed.  Episode I in particular skips over major story points.  It probably took me 30-50 minutes to complete the whole episode.  Each episode only has 5 levels as well...  Again, missed potential.  There's no reason to limit each episode to 5 levels.  I know the devs wanted players to spend more time in the open world, but then again, they should have given us more to do in the open world.  Anyway, the story is fun, has good humor, but is too short.Overall, this game is fun for a few hours but becomes stale soon after.  The graphics are beautiful, but good graphics do not make a good game.  In my opinion, the Lego Star Wars Complete Saga and Lego Clone Wars games are far superior in level design, story, and replayability.   The Skywalker Saga has little to no replayability, and considering the short levels, it's hard to excuse a $60 (more if you get DLC) price tag.  The official MechMuffin rating for the Skywalker Saga: 4/10  Missed potential, and save your money.  Go play Lego Clone Wars."
390,Emerald,https://steamcommunity.com/id/emerald-dreamer/,19,,0,17.2,March,13,76,0,1,"Is this even a LEGO game?This game is OK, but it simply does not belong with older LEGO games. If it had any other style, realistic, cartoonish, whatever, it'd still be the same and maybe even better game. I played most of the LEGO games (some as a kid, some for the first time only recently). There are better and worse LEGO games. With each of them you can find something done well and something that could be better.Open World problems:-  Always feels empty. Sure, there are some NPCs and stuff to break, but the NPCs don't really amount to anything and stuff to break is scattered so loosely. Older games (at least most of them) had playable characters walking around the world making it feel more alive. Often fighting their enemies.-  There is no place that would feel like home. Re-playable levels:- Levels which was the main thing of every LEGO game just aren't a thing here. Sure, they are present in the game, but the story/the level is nothing. Tiny area with almost nothing to do. Only few of the levels have something to do in them.-  A lot of key story elements are missing within the game. They don't have any level or they're skipped and never mentioned.Boss battles:-  Not inventive. You have to smash buttons. That's it. Where are the battles when you had to use the stuff around you? Now you have to fight till enemy's healthbar gets down.-  Fixed camera. Fixed camera is great thing as long as it is optional or there is nothing to do or to explore. And even then, a lot of players don't like fixed camera.Health bar:-  Is it easier to know how much HP your enemies have? Yup.  But it's not cool while fighting boss. Where used to be scary amount of hearts now is just ordinary health bar. New ""leveling"" system:-  Interesting concept, terrible execution. Was there a need for it? No.  This system would be great for any other game. If this wasn't LEGO game trying to be typical LEGO game.Target audience:-  Is this game for toddlers? Or for more mature playerbase?  The game seems to not be sure either.  You can expect me to do elaborate stuff (which is fun on its own) or let the game be easy and fun.  You can't expect somebody to play this game with equal seriousness as while playing any other non-LEGO Star Wars game while he's being fed with 1 hundred millions of suggestions and hints as if the person who playes it was infant. Pick one, or let me disable all the hints.Storytelling/Humor/Mumbling:-  The main reason why all the old LEGO games were such a good games and made us laugh was in the was its story was told = without words.  Now it's just bland retelling of story with something that is not funny.-  Who are the jokes for?  Infants? Typical US citizen?  Most jokes aren't funny because they're so bland and obvious. The story is told with voice actor so people responsible for jokes no longer have to come with something creative. Characters:-  There is so many playable character that it's hard to pick which to play. And not because there is so many to chose from, but because the system (UI) sucks. It is cool to have them split into smaller groups, but changing the character is nightmare. Especialy in free play, it's not very good.-  You can play as Yaddle or even rodian dancer. Which is cool, but it's way less cool when you realize how many iconic characters is missing in the game - Seasee Tin, Agen Kolar or Stass Allie.-  Some characters got updated texture in comparison to their irl LEGO figures, while others didn't. Or as one Kenobi has incorrect pattern on back. No character creator:-  LEGO game with no option to create your own character? That's just wrong.3rd Person camera:-  Why? What for? I get why, but was it needed? No, would it be better if the camera was  above as always."

393,女孩子超忙的,https://steamcommunity.com/id/scarletswancloude/,5,2,1,117.7,April,"12,",891,0,1,"What s blaze! It’s my first LEGO game, I am so impressed with this franchise, the investment was totally worth the shot. In fact, it’s the first purchase in 2022 I’ve done that I truly felt worth every penny I’ve spent in a game.StoryJust like the movies and how they go, but with some hilarious twists from TT. Seriously, I can’t stop laughing while going through the stories. It’s family friendly, you can safely play it with kids using co-op:)ContentThe game offers rich vast content for you to discover. I divided them into a few small sections below.-Mode-Apart from story mode, the game also gives you the Free mode after completing an episode. It allows you to play any characters you’ve unlocked, run freely to all the locations you’ve been to from stories to collect anything you’ve left out. Hundreds of side missions, challenges, mini games are waiting for you to completed. So you can access these content normally without competing all 9 episodes at any time you wish.-Collectibles-There are thousands of collectibles for you to collect across the mega university of galaxy: characters, ships’ skins, skill points currency...Well, it’s a LEGO version of the classic assassin’s creed, I am not exaggerating, I repeat, literally thousands lol.-Artwork-Everything is transformed to the art models of LEGO toys, while maintaining the high quality of how neat they look, all models are amazingly in detail.-Voice-Everyone including most of the NPC on the maps is beautifully voiced, I am not sure whether all the characters are voiced by the original actors and actresses in the films, however, they don’t  sound much different to me at very least. Personally, great job to all voice actors/actresses!LengthThe game is said to be around 15 hours to go through all the story lines, if you speed run it. In reality, there are so many places to explore, so many fun collectibles to gather, so many side fun missions and challenges to completed, you probably won’t rush the game to end, so the gameplay time extends much much longer than 15 hours, easily over 50 hours I tell you, it’s a mega open-world game, in my opinion, the price it offers is worth the time you are going to sink.Performance&GraphicsGame runs smoothly with my 65 inches ROG-PG65UQ 4K display with 120 FPS at cap. No lag, no FPS drops, no stutter, nothing, apart from some bugs. Graphics look like this:   with max-out settings.And the game terrifically supports HDR, when it’s on, the visuals are even beyond what it looks here, with vibrant and vivid colors. The reason I couldn’t screenshot them is: HDR features lose when taking a screenshot, they just won’t record to the image, so the final outcome significantly loses color details which is nothing it looks like in the game. Couldn’t share them is pity, though there is no doubt how amazing they are while HDR’s on. If you also have a HDR monitor, you will be impressed, it is as good as Lucas’s films which is presenting in front of your eyes.BugThe only drop back is: the game does have variety kinds of bugs. Like cutscenes turn to black screen when sound still going on. The button promote on screen are wrong sometimes when using a controller. Game occasionally freeze when bugged out. It doesn’t remember your visuals settings, for example FPS is set beyond 60. Though nothing game-breaking.Update: the game contains massive amount of bugs, they do not prevent you from completing the whole story, but some game-breaking bugs do successfully stopping me from 100% completion. PURCHASE WITH CAUTION!SumIf you like LEGO’s cute family friendly art style, get the game! If you are a Star Wars fan, and don’t mind it’s a cute version, get the game! If you are not in either of the group, and interested in this game, I highly recommend you trying it out.It’s pity this game no longer being introduced globally. It’s better spending your time playing video games rather than fighting the war, no?"
394,darth.crevette,https://steamcommunity.com/id/darthcrevette/,34,,0,103.8,August,"5,",235,0,1,"Well, where to begin. A 100 hours for a Lego video game is nice, too bad halfway through it strated feeling like a chore.On paper, the skywalker Saga has everything to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made:So yes, if nothing else, this game has a  of content. Too bad most of it feels like padding.The story itself is super short. There's 5 missions per movie, most of them are around 5 minutes long; if you're not interested in collectables (but why are you even playing a Lego game in that case?) you're only in for 10 hours or so.But then, these collectibles. There's just  too many of them, most of which are  too easy and repetitive. I'd rather collect all Korok seeds in Breath of the Wild again, than try to 100% this game a second time. It's just ""quantity over quality"" taken to a (bad) extreme.While there's a lot of characters, half of them are just useless, either because... they just are (like most of those in the ""Extra"" category, who don't have any weapon or ability), or because others from the same class are just plain better. It feels like the devs just chose some random names from a SW wiki to add them to the game.Space battles are super boring. there's no dogfight or anything interesting going on, most of the time you don't even have to move, just stay in place and turn around to follow the enemy markers, dodge when the game tells you to, repeat for the next battle. Capitzl ships aren't much better, but at least you need to fly around a bit to hit all the targets.I won't talk about difficulty (or lack thereof), but just know there an invincibility option or an auto-dodge in the accessibility menu. Because apparently the game playing itself while you watch is ""accessibility""...Then there's the technical issues (severe FPS drops in some areas, random CTD 3 or 4 times in total) and glitches (some of which haven't been addressed since launch)..."

Probably like 15 hours. If you are a completionist well it's gonna take probably around 100 hours. Ton of collectibles and replaying the story missions. Bugs occasionally pop up and had a few crashes mostly during fast travel for me. A solid game but with a lot of bloat. Would recommend if you are a fan of star wars otherwise eh.

The humor and comedy is still there in every cut scene and it's a thrill to finish the game and relive the movies in a fresh way. Next to that the replayability is high, you can come back for the ole trusty True Jedi statuses by collecting enough studs to fill three bars, collecting all the Kyber bricks and of course all the mini kits. Next to the 40 hours that I played already, I still have a long way to go on the achievements (19/45 currently) and getting all the mini-kits, characters and ships!"
398,Clinker2000,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074902809/,16,,0,26.9,April,"6,",953,0,1,"I wanted to love this game so badly especially after being a huge fan of the originals but i just can't. - The levels are so short and feel so dumbed down and stripped of puzzles, building, combat, secrets, meaningful collectables and everything that made them great in the originals. They've got no where near as much to interact with and they feel repetitive and rushed and even feel like you're speed running them at certain points. They've had so much removed and they've lost their charm and even the cut scenes feel rushed and out of place sometimes. I even went back and played The Complete Saga after playing this game and the first level of Phantom Menace took me maybe 20 minutes to get through on there after doing all the puzzles and collecting studs, whereas that mission on The Skywalker Saga took no more than 5 minutes to complete even after looking around and collecting studs and there weren't even any puzzles on that mission. Somehow the missions feel like a second thought in this game and I think way too much time was put into the bland open world rather than the main missions. - I think one of the worst parts of the game are the open hub areas, there's just too many of them (a new one after most missions and even multiple per planet) and they're all just filled with the same boring and repetitive puzzles, endless collectable kyber bricks and pointless NPC dialogue. It ruins the flow and immersion of the story having to go to them after nearly every level. They're as wide as an ocean but about as deep as a puddle and I hate having to access the main missions through them, it makes them feel tacked on. - The hacking puzzles are so repetitive and terrible, especially the R2D2 ones which are the exact same puzzle every single time.  - Combat is mindless. It obviously wasn't the strongest point in the older games either but it's still extremely simple and the new combat mechanics feel pointless to use when most enemies die in a few hits anyway. With the gun fights, most of the time you'll just stand in the same spot shooting down a hallway over and over again until the enemies are dead. - The UI and menus are a cluttered mess. There's so many things on screen and you don't need 95% of it. Looks so much messier and intrusive compared to the simple and clean original games UI.- The quick time events have literally no impact on game play whether you win or lose or are too fast for them. For example the Darth Vader lightsaber duel on Bespin, even when you win the QTE, Luke loses and when I purposely lost the QTE, Luke still beat Vader? It's the same with the object pulling QTEs, you don't even have to wait for the circles to align to successfully complete it, you can click the corresponding button as soon as it appears for the same affect.- The environments and characters do look great though and the roster of playable characters is impressive. It's still goofy and filled with funny moments too.Nearly everything in this game is a downgrade from the originals though. Obviously some people are gonna love the new format but having played the original games and enjoying them so much more than this new one, it all just feels so disappointing and I don't understand how it's had so many positive reviews."

405,MIBEZIOR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ballsified/,9,,0,35.9,December,"21,",204,0,1,"This game is in such a tough spot for me. As someone who grew up playing the Lego games, not just Star Wars ones. Technically speaking, this game is magnificent with the amount of things you can do, as well as the visuals/audio. They are all leaps ahead of their predecessors, especially compared to the original Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga game.Gameplay wise, however, these games take steps backwards. The easiest way I can describe this game is that it is akin to Assassin's Creed games, where you have A LOT of things to do, but nothing of substance. While old Lego games involved a huge number of quests to acquire bricks and whatnot, the activities and challenges you did were a lot more varied and creative. In this game, there isn't a lot of variety. Of the things that are here, the creativity is lacking. It led to me getting bored and I couldn't be bothered to slog through half of the quests on half of the planets because I couldn't stand grinding the same repeated quests any more.The other main irritant is the way that characters are handled. I won't get into the voice lines vs mumbles debate, although I firmly believe the mumbles and old style of talking had a lot more charm to it. Characters, as opposed to having a huge roster of distinct and unique characters, are now broken up into certain classes of character (you have Jedi, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, etc.). These classes result in characters not feeling unique anymore, since each class MUST have a distinct class ability, they are required to be able to do things that don't make sense for that character. Because characters don't feel as unique, it makes the process of acquiring new ones a lot less satisfying than the past. The way that DLC is being handled is also a headache for me personally. I know that Disney is coming out with more Star Wars products/shows as time goes on, so TT obviously couldn't fit everything into the game without an easy compromise. But the way that character packs are being doled out is seriously irritating. Because they are ONLY characters, they run into the previous issue that I wrote about characters themselves. They boil down to skins of a certain class. Which is sort of acceptable if the pack has characters that all fit into different classes, but is absolutely absurd when packs have nothing but one or two classes in them (such as the trooper pack). It means that packs will have different value associated, and like I said before, they are only skins for classes. They don't include any other content of any kind. No levels, ships, areas, etc. What's worse is that these packs don't get included for those who buy the Deluxe Edition, which, for an extra $10 USD, nets you a couple included character packs.It is disappointing because again, this game should and could be one of the best Lego games of all time. If this game is on sale, then I'd say it might be worth buying. Or if you're unable to play previous Lego games or really just want to play the latest and greatest and don't have an interest in any previous games. But otherwise, I do not recommend buying this game in its current state. I didn't even mention the technical issues that this game runs into, as well as a myriad of UI or quality of life issues that also hinder the user experience."

413,Legitwaffles,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259995746/,7,,0,88.8,May,"8,",137,0,1,"As a profound Star Wars fan, its my responsibility to expose this game for what it is. I’ve completed this game 100% with almost 90 hours into it. The Good: The graphics are immensely beautiful and comparable to the EA Battlefront titles. Cutscenes are sometimes funny and are nostalgic of the old films and from “Lego Star Wars the complete saga”. The Bad: There are a lot of flaws in this game. I recommend watching Doktor Skippers Critique video on the matter. However, to summarize how bad this game is, this is a short list.- Has zero replay ability - The Levels are all “start at point A and go to B” or boss fight- Some episodes have long, uninteresting levels that can put most people to sleep - Boss fights are unchallenging (like press a button and you win unchallenging)- Large cast of characters that are identical to each other (lacking uniqueness with the exemption of their class roles) - a lot of dead space between missions (ex. A lot of walking and doing nothing) - Level collectibles are uncreative and lack flair old lego games had when pursuing mini kits - Level challenges suck (You’ll just look up a video on how to do some of them, as they are either tedious or repetitive). - Over 1000 collectibles in a vast over world… but the majority share the exact same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ objective/instruction or ask the same premise. Seriously… why are there around 45 smuggle missions??- And lastly, a mountain full of bugs, glitches, and crashes.TLDR: Buy the complete saga instead… or Lego Star Wars 3 if it interests you. This game falsely advertises a bigger game. I can only recommend it if you are a diehard star wars fan and want to go insane doing the exact same task to obtain collectibles. Rate it 3/10"

The levels in the game are painfully short, like some can be beaten in under 5 minutes and they aren't very imaginative either. This isn't just compared with other Lego Star Wars games but almost every Lego TT game which always found ways of adding to a scene. There are also only 5 levels per film which wouldn't be bad if they were longer and didn't sometimes consist of a singular area, (yes really). I also went to replay a vehicle mission in free play (a space one), and it would not let me pick a different ship.Also, the story is quick and abrupt and has some weird changes, but I think this was partially Disney's standards and practises not letting some characters be killed and instead comically knocked out while Darth Maul gets hacked to pieces ( I know he lives in the clone wars but that’s not in the game)Then there's also the unnecessary additions of both shooter cover and melee combo trees. Enemies are so weak and easy to kill that it's more efficient to just shoot them. The combo trees feel like nothing more than an arbitrary attempt to make combat more interesting, but the game is so easy it doesn't matter. There's nothing wrong with the game being easy, it is after all, for really young kids but it renders these additions pointless, most children will also be able to figure out cover is useless. The bosses are really boring too, there's rarely if ever any puzzle element and just mash attack while occasionally dodging The open world segments are in fairness really good, one major positive about the skywalker saga is that it has one of the best Star Wars worlds to explore.  Even the sequels' worlds are fleshed out and are given new life.  It makes you want to explore them.  The open worlds consist of puzzles and quests to do and are lot are classic Lego puzzles with the twist that you can solve in a few more ways. Can't be bothered to stack all the boxes slowly? Stack destructible items and use them instead, can't use a scavenger with a glider yet? Fling another character with a force push and switch to them to get the kyber brick.  The quests are very simple, don't expect brilliant quest design there just another means to an end. While the open world segments may be good, don't expect the rewards to be. There are over 1000 kyber bricks in the game. 6 per level and others are rewards. After a while they are useless. Sure, you could upgrade your skills but after a few select ones there is no point, in fact it can be a detriment if you're trying to grind for studs via a combo meter. There is no real point in going for 100% unless you get the 100% reward (it's a pointless stud fountain, don’t bother) or the characters.The characters suck a bit too. There's classes for characters which isn't a bad thing but because of this there isn't much uniqueness to them. They use the same abilities. Even Jedi and Sith are disappointing, the only difference being a unique force grab and whatever upgrade paths they have. Abilities like force lighting are restricted to stupid combo trees, you can't just pull it out which might have actually added some more puzzle variety. I’m not expecting every character to be unique but the game is sorely lacking variety.The game is a chore to play IMO, like all Lego games can get tedious after a long session but every time I came back to play it wasn’t fun.It feels rushed; it was rushed despite delays. TT employees suffered major crunch because of bad and stupid management as feature creep set in. I would honestly love to see the state of this during its intended release. This game could have benefited from being more a sandbox like lego is supposed to be instead of a weird mashup of genres.While Custom characters are not everything, we know it was supposed to be in the game and it could have benefited from a ship builder too. I mean anything new and interesting do with those kyber bricks would have been great."

428,TheOneSandwich,https://steamcommunity.com/id/theonesandwich/,3,,1,13.6,April,"18,",162,0,1,"SPOILER WARNING: If you haven’t seen any of the Star Wars movies, sorry. The original trilogy only came out 30 years ago, so I understand if you missed it.    On November 6, 2007, history was made — or, at least, my childhood was made, as  was released (jeez, fourteen and a half years ago). You’d be hard-pressed to find a child at the time that didn’t at least play a little bit of the game. So when  was announced, I couldn’t wait to get my hands on it. And while my wallet whimpered a little at the $50 dollar price tag, I was still excited to give the game a whirl. As such, here’s my honest review.    This review comes from playing through about 50% of the story. The story is, predictably, a comedic retelling of the entire Star Wars main line of movies. It succeeds in its purpose, hitting all the comedic notes in a way that felt less outside my age range (looking at you, ) and more akin to the older style of visual comedy, with some casual one-liners to emphasize the point of it being a joke.     This is the part where I fully admit it. I don’t like the voice lines. All the characters feel like bad impressions of the actual cast. This was mitigated in 2007 by having the characters never voice any lines. That worked, and meant they had to get creative with how they told the big moments. With dialogue, not only are they less creative, it feels like they try to hit every single major quote in the scenes (there is an option to turn off the dialogue in favor of the usual mumbling they do, but the scenes are definitely built for dialogue and the mumbling only serves to take away from the delivery of the lines in favor of clinging stubbornly to nostalgia).     Maybe that’s nitpicking. After all, I am no longer in the target demographic (I’d imagine a 20-year-old isn’t exactly the model target audience for LEGO). However, I’ve mentioned the word “nostalgia” perhaps a little too much now, and that’s for good reason. I mentioned the mumble option earlier, but there are a multitude of quick nostalgia trips the game decides to take, which means they knew that people like me would be getting the game. As such, I reserve the right to criticize the game.    Another criticism I have — the menu is super cluttered. I open the pause menu to see where I have to go, and I have 5 different things screaming at me with yellow dots, signaling me that there’s something new to look at. It’s distracting, I was just trying to see the layout of Tatooine. Also, there’s an upgrade tree. That’s kinda weird. It’s not offensively bad, it’s just… there. And I don’t know how to feel about it.    I, very luckily indeed, haven’t really encountered too many glitches, at least not game-breaking ones. Except one. For whatever reason, if I hit Alt+Tab to say, check an email I got, for whatever reason, the game will completely refuse to open. It’ll bring up a black screen before booting me out again. I tried setting it to borderless windowed mode, but then it leaves the taskbar visible and cuts off the bottom of the screen. I gave up on playing the game once because of this. It happened multiple times, each time after I decided to check something using Alt+Tab.      I realize that the paragraphs above paint a perhaps negative picture of the game. This isn’t entirely my intention. I really like the game, I find that it keeps the charm that makes (almost) all LEGO games great. It’s oozing with enthusiasm to tell you Star Wars’s story the way only it can. And I honestly fully bought into that. At the end of the day, I couldn’t say this is a masterpiece of a game. Nor do I expect it to be a relic of people’s childhoods like was. But it’s a good game, it’s fun to play, and it tells the story in a new and interesting way. And honestly, what more is there to ask from a LEGO game?Was it worth the $50, though? Jury’s still out on that one. Maybe wait for it to go on sale before you buy it."

There’s a lot of good nostalgia playing this game.  I remember playing these old lego games on my game cube and loving them.  This version however is a bit of a mixed bag.The good:• I actually liked the “open world” approach to this series as opposed to previous versions very linear style.• Lots of little quests, space battles and neat little puzzles to solve.• Lots of characters and ships to choose from in free play mode.• The story line is humorous (not haha funny, more dad joke funny).The bad:• 6 months later and there are still game breaking bugs.  My current game is stuck at 99.98% complete because one of the side quests is bugged and there is no way to reset it.  When I submitted the error I got a boiler plate response of “maybe we will fix it eventually”.  Pretty unacceptable for there to still be game breaking bugs 6 months after release.• Lots and lots of running around to different planets for quests.  You will spend the majority of your game-play running from one side of a map to another.Conclusion:I can’t recommend it until they fix some of these game breaking bugs.  If you’re a completionist and liked getting “100%” on previous versions, I would be wary about purchasing this version.  If you just want to play it for the corny story, you should be fine."

This game is just the goat at minute 1 to probably the end because I have barely even gone through the first episode. Compared to the previous entries this game offers so much more, and brings on more than how the complete saga ever brought to the table. To start this off the characters which in my opinion is one of the main things that truly makes a lego game show it’s colors. I just gotta say IT MAKES ME ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NUTT BRUH, like oh my lord bruh the character classes bring upon the most erotic fellow to you than almost lego games, but I don’t wanna say that fully since I haven’t really gone through the game. Then the combat for the game which I can describe of off three words. SMOKING SEXY STYLE. Like man if these motha ♥♥♥♥♥♥ would make a lego DMC game I would believe it because literally any character can just do air combos like it is just nothing bruh. All of the Jedi in this game play like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dante but on crack. However, I don’t know if there really is a Virgil yet but I will recommend on here if there is. Now when it comes to the episodes and cutscenes of the game I still haven’t gone through much, but man that ♥♥♥♥ be funny as hell. Definitely a lot of the dumb silly movie references sprinkled in there like it is god having diarrhea in the air(please don’t think the diarrhea analogy is a negative meant to be a positive). Now for some of the negatives that I have to unfortunately bring upon but are just little beta dumb cry baby cucky ones is that first the puzzles for each world can be a little repetitive. I can’t truly say this for sure, but for the areas I have played so far those puzzles are a little repetitive since it is kinda the same but can be fun depending on what you are doing. That basketball puzzle thing is some but tho like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Also, another huge and unfortunate thing that idk if I get it later or not but there is not custom characters. If they are in the game then I will definitely reevaluate regarding that in my part 2 review. Other than that this game is a gift from god himself bruh, playing through it is like having one of his angels giving you brain every minute and second. This game will definitely give you more hair on your nuts than that other game that has to do with some dumb ass ring even though it is just about some yellow tree. That is all I have so far and part 2 will come when this game is hundoed. P.S: Any dumb jokes on here please don’t take serious you nimrods."

460,Cydonia or Bust,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cydoniarobust/,4,,0,22.4,April,"6,",962,0,1,"This is the most visually stunning LEGO game ever released. The vistas are breath-taking, sweeping, and gorgeous. The revamped combat system adds a level of franticness to fights. By all the parts separately and piecemeal, this should be a thing I really like. The inspirations and level design are clearly drawn from titles like the LEGO Ninjago Movie Video Game, and the more recent superhero games like Marvel 2 and DC Supervillains, especially the notion of hopping through a hub world and telling a story there as much as the story is told through levels.Unfortunately, due to things like ""running faster"" being upgrades, this slows down the pace of the story pretty significantly, with excellent voice acting in the hub worlds during the story missions (perhaps the best in any voice acted lego game, and yes, these are story missions, this is an open-world game now, I'm very frustrated by this but that's personal preference and thus not important to this review) being secondary to my frustration at having to play walking simulator. The vehicles in the hub world, like the Coruscant walker, are not meaningfully quicker than taking 2 levels of sprint, which is a horrible gamer-y thing to say about a LEGO game. There are other systems and mechanics to complain about, like the promising combat revamp (it's now a wasd-mouse title for non-controller players, wow!) and how it tends to make fights feel even less engaging. If you were bored by the superheroes games and how they approached fighting mechanically (visually fantastic and fun, really established character styles), it basically takes the very cool combo system from ninjago, adds the sponginess of the superhero games and adds some shooting to it, all to make a perfect storm of mechanical genius and gameplay mediocrity. I genuinely wish I had nicer things to say, because I've been excited for and evangelizing this game for months. I'll probably 100% it out of spite, and in the hopes that I adjust to all these details that I've been complaining about. If that's the case, and I end up liking this mechanically, I'll flip the thumb to positive then, and consider rewriting this wacky essay."

The Game play is so much better than any Lego Star Wars game that I have played. The price may be a bit high but it is worth it. The grind is real or not a thing depending on how you play. The Space Battles alone feels like you are back in Battle Front 1 (the newer one). Though certain things might get a bit old later, the 300 + characters and there own classes, class abilities, and upgrades make up for it.If you want to 100% the game...

I am a single farther to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2020 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. We spent 7 hours on the game that night and we had killed the first 3 bosses. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

Here's why.Controls- It controls pretty good, although bit janky on whenever you swing pole to pole or on the little things (I forgo what they are called)Combat- It feels like babies first DMC, with all of the combos and sh*t like that. I find the combat fun and it does feel a little bit satisfying to pull off the combos.Quest Design- There's all kinds of quests in the game. Escort, Smuggling stuff to other planets, ect, ect. I find it completely garbage, since it repeats over and over again with nothing of value...and some of the sidequests are completely BS (see ""The Final Gonk"").Map/Level Design- The game follows a 5 level format, with 3 level challenges and 5 minikits to collect and some open world's stuff to do. The pacing of the levels are completely weird as they take 5-10 minutes (or longer if you're just messing around and trying to get the minikits), and some of the levels are on rails sections, meaning that there is no point of playing Freeplay. In fact, most of the levels don't really require freeplay to complete it, you can just be a Hero and grind for Villain costumes to put on, and you've already 100% the level. The open world sections are completely there just to pad out the story, so the episodes lasts only an hour and 30 minutes. One final thing, the fights between the Jedis and Siths are completely the same with no different movesets of how the siths fight.Graphics- I really like them! I think the models are completely superb, the environments look completely good too and I really like the details to some of the models. QTE's (Quick Time Events)- The game does have them, and there is literally no consequences for not pressing the button, because sometimes the game automatically does that for you, which I feel is completely lame. Like I get it, the game's for children, but at least have consequences of not pressing the required button. And spoilers btw!That's why the whole fight between Luke and Kylo Ren is really lame, because it's just a QTE mash. It makes sense why, but it just feels lame as hell.Voice Acting- I think it's fine for the most part, but does feel a bit off for the characters. Stability- The game runs fine, and is generally smooth. Unless you're in certain areas, that's when the game starts to dip to either 10 or 20 FPS...also expect random crashes. Oh, before I forget, USE BORDERLESS FOR YOUR GAME AND DONT ALT TAB IN FULLSCREEN Conclusion- That's pretty much it, also I couldn't 100% the game because some a**hole at WB thought it'd be a great idea to delay a patch to add in DLC characters, thank you WB. Love ya, as always LOL as for my rating for the game:5.5/10"

The only reason this game is open world is for the purpose of forcing you to spend time collecting items for the sake of upgrades, so you either spend 3/4 of your playtime ignoring the story and working on collectibles, or you just do the story and finish the game with almost nothing unlocked.

Wait for a discount.This is the type of game that makes me I wish Steam had a in between rating. So um, I will say I recommend it, but not at full price. The problem is that it's downgrade in alot of ways to the complete saga, for instance the hub world NPCs only have like two actions, walk and run away if attacked. At first I was ok with it since they were all defenseless citizens. That was until I realized almost every NPC in the hub areas are like that including Clone Troopers. Yes, the Republic's finest on Coruscant will run away at the first sight of danger. There are few exceptions where I came across some Storm Troopers in Cloud City, but that is rare sight. Not only that, but if you switch to a Dark Side character, the hub NPCs, other than a select few, will not react to you any differently, nor can you use dark side abilities on them. Sadly this game also suffers from game breaking bugs as well, which may have been fixed in patches, but I had problems with indefinite black screens during transitions causing me to restart the game again. Along with performance issues that cause the game to dip to down to 40 fps on a RTX 2060 and Ryzen 7 5800x. The graphics are improved, but not by that much that it should be causing performance in selects areas to go below 60 fps, even lower the settings does very little to help with it.The best change is the player combat and boss battles which I do feel are improved over the complete saga. Having the ability to use combos to earn studs, to aim a blaster and light saber throw, and use the force to manipulable objects in any direction you want is really good.Lastly the custom characters are removed which wouldn't have been a huge deal if the game was well refined, but it's not. The game itself lack so much polish that I really have a hard time forgiving removing such a key feature that was present in all other Lego games go back all the way to Lego Star Wars II while lacking the polish of those game. Keep in mind this isn't even the first open world Lego game, the DC and Marvel Lego games are also open world and have so much more polish and more interesting NPCs in the hub areas, which makes me wonder where all the development went into on this game, I can't imagine the player characters took so much effort to improve that all other aspects of the game suffered."

It took me give or take 2 hours to finish each episode from the saga. Someone might have done it quicker. So after losing the refund time, I thought I might as well carry on.The transitions between the episodes' stories got tiresome, walking from point A to B , click start mission. Which could have been solved using cut-scenes. Now the cut-scenes are badly placed and help remove fun. Could you have a space battle ? Yes we could've , did we get one ? No.  Episode 3 ‘s intro is a good example of this.  Sure you have 9 episodes to do and it would take longer, but it would be nice if missions weren’t watered down with cut-scenes. The good thing was the new mechanics of using a lightsaber differently, the P.O.V of aiming down sight, and characters having some unique skills. Though that isn't enough to make a game good.The games main focus was mostly making an open world filled with 1,166  ‘Kyber bricks’. To go and collect to upgrade your character's skill tree. Rather than the film's episode story.  Which i might end up doing if i'm  bored. If you want a good Lego Star Wars game I'd recommend the complete saga version."

The game has very little options for customizing the hotkeys, there are certain actions I would like to do with other hotkeys, but the game prevents me from using repeated hotkeys of my choice. The game has hotkeys that allow for various actions but I would like to choose what those actions would be instead of being predefined, since a keyboard contains several keys I think it wouldn't be a problem to have more choices and freedom in customizing the hotkeys.The game's sensitivity is also too high, even using the mouse's lowest DPIs, I still don't feel comfortable with the speed of camera movement.This are minimal criticisms that may not affect many people, but if they are improved it would be great."

The new visuals and combat are a breath of fresh air and look and feel great, but the content is so lackluster that the visuals and combat are overshadowed completely. There are only five levels per movie, the longest one being maybe 15 minutes or so. Each level is the same sequence of watch a cutscene, fight some enemies, go here, fight some more, watch end cutscene. There are no fun puzzles like in other Lego games.The open world is where the bulk of the content is, if I can even call it that. Most of the missions require you to talk to a character, go fetch something, and come back. My only positive of the open world is the sheer size of it. Almost every important planet is available to explore.I have had fun playing it, but only in short bursts. It just doesn't have the same magic as any of the older Lego games."

568,| нsт | Victorino Mora,https://steamcommunity.com/id/blazebby/,3,,1,20.7,April,"6,",705,3,1,"This was and is one of my most anticipated games of the year and it highly deserves praise for bringing the Lego series to a new frontier but I'm also going to critique it for a lot of the things I scratched my head wondering, ""Why is this an issue?"" or ""Why wasn't this implemented when I've seen it before in previous titles?""Combat: This one immediately blew me out the water with how fantastic and expanded the game can feel. Each character ranges from Jedi, Bounty Hunter, Villain, Sith, Hero, Dark Side, Astromech Droid, Protocol Droid and on top of having these different classes each class has an ability tree that you can level up and grinding towards these Kryber Bricks actually feels rewarding because you'll be needing them.  Some characters have combos that feel a lot like Dmc or Darksiders. There's so many different animations and moves to perform, one of my favorite being the Bounty Hunter that will jump up in the air and spin attack down. Open World: If anyone has ever played SWTOR this game gives off those vibes and it's fantastic to be able to explore the world at your own pace as the game presents it. As soon as I and my friend landed on the first planet we spent maybe the first 20-30 minutes just free roaming and gathering bricks and trying to do all these side quests before heading to the next mission. The galaxy map and the planets feel populated and breathing. There's tons of hidden things to find and backtracking to do at later times. (This which is very familiar to Lego games in general but still a blast to do) Characters: I can't confirm this because truthfully I haven't beaten the game, but from what I've read there are about 380 characters in the game. Now with that being said there are also a huge amount of vehicles to use and collect. (I'm just going to add that I am a veteran to Lego games and a huge fan of them. Just because there are 380+ characters and vehicles does not mean that 380 are going to act differently from one another, be aware that a lot of these characters will just feel reskinned from the last one and there will probably be about 20-30 dynamic characters.)  Alright well, I'm going to critique the game, and I am also going to nit pick here and there what I don't like and I'll be sure to label that.Story: This is Star Wars. There really isn't a ""wrong"" way of doing it but the game feels extremely lackluster and far too fast paced for the amount of delays and time we had to wait. Each chapter has 5 main missions, and each of those missions will last about 4-7 minutes long. I told my friend to finish the first movie and I'd catch up with her, and by tomorrow we could play the 2nd. Well I got on, and within 30 minutes I finished the first movie. There are so many scenes that feel left out, rushed, and simply altered to keep the comedy rolling every 4 seconds. I know Lego's have always had their way of being funny but a lot of this feels forced. For the amount of delays we had to wait it makes me question what was their focus? I'm going to assume the open world because that's massive. My gripe with this is just how much more impact other lego games have had with little to say in terms of dialogue.Voice(Nitpick): I personally don't like the voice acting for a lot of characters and a huge amount of them feel butchered. Playing LegoLOTR that used the movie audio felt bootleg and lazy, but it was a nice form of keeping the cast sounding original and sticking as close to the script as possible. Here a lot of characters have voices completely changed, altered, and a lot of it just doesn't roll with me. This is a new generation and I'm happy people will get to enjoy newer voices but a lot of the emotion was cut and left out from what the movies had already established.Multiplayer. OKAY HOW CAN YOU GUYS NOT ADD THIS? HOW!?!? LEGO WORLDS HAS MULTIPLAYER, YOU GUYS HAVE A LEGO MMO THAT SUPPORTS MULTIPLAYER, HOW DOES THIS GAME NOT HAVE A FUNCTIONING MULTIPLAYER DROP IN DROP OUT FEATURE? IT'S 2022 GET WITH THE PROGRAM! YOU DELAYED THE GAME 3 TIMES AND NO ONE THOUGHT ""hey we should probably add online multiplayer"" Character Creation(Nitpick): It's gone. That's all I have to say, it's gone. :( Can't kill kids(Nitpick): Why come?Minor bugs N glitches: Yea I've run into a few of these, non of them game breaking for me (my friend did have to restart her game twice I think?) But for me I've only had visual effects, some enemies that don't die, and weird clippings into walls. Overall fun game, going to continue to play and enjoy it, that's all I really have to say."

In previous games the game added more content around the movie however in the Skywalker Saga it's the opposite it tries to include a narrative but fails so hard due to levels squeezed to minimum. The older series offered much better way of storytelling - even though the characters never spoke a word the game conveyed storytelling via the body language of the characters which looked also very comical, however now they in addition to body gestures they also speak, which completely changes the atmosphere and now everything seems overly goofy.Levels have very poor content, the first level travels the same path and back, defeating 3-4 group of enemies on the way. Mini games which are just not even fun and serve 0 gameplay purpose other than that they are just there. In previous games they diversified the gameplay after a long tough fight or a platformer puzzles and elements which in the first 4 levels were not only simply not there but were strictly 1 dimensional.And a lot of complicated useless levels, UI elements and gameplay mechanics.The first game ever that I wanted to refund"

All of the fun elements of the previous games (space combat, Death Star runs, playing scenes from the movies the way you want to, etc) are mostly missing. Large portions of combat are glossed over by cut scenes, which should and could have been lifted straight from the other recent Star Wars games. Wanted to help destroy Death Star II? Nope, can't. Wanted to destroy Starkiller base? Nope. You do at least get to do the trench run from Star Wars, but it's a brief bright spot.The weakest part of the game is Episodes 8 and 9, where not much at all happens. ""Your mission is to run over here."" Then cut scene, then ""Your mission is to run back where you came from!"". Then another cut scene. Would you like to gather clothes for Finn? Ever wanted to go to a casino in a Star Wars game? You're sure going to! Do you want to get inside the weaker plot points of Episodes 8 and 9 in great detail? No? Well, sorry, you will. And they drag on and on.And did you want to play as random background characters from these movies? You can! Remember that person...or alien, or whatever it is, that got trotted out in early footage from one of the films? They're here! And you can play the game as them! Isn't that exciting?! Most of the side characters are ""Hey, it's that guy"" material, padded out as ""achievements"".Challenges in space are sometimes confusing. You want to get that random character that was in the background? You gotta do this race/shooting challenge. The racing challenges in space are confusing, mostly because you have no idea where you need to advance to. It's just a bunch of green boxes in space with no pattern to them, isn't hurrying and getting frustrated by this race fun?Running/sprinting seems weird in this game. Why does it take so long to sprint? You can almost lose some of the running challenges because you can't sprint quicker. High points - - the datacards are a nice new way to get skills. The previous games was all about gold bricks, but now you've got to have the datacards plus studs. Nice new feature. - playing the game as Han Solo in carbonite? Amazing idea. Honestly. - the voice cast. Snagging original actors from the series, and animated series, is one of the greatest achievements of this gameBut, they don't offset how dull the game feels. Combat is slow, lightsaber combat feels like it takes forever, and after playing through the game once, I'm questioning going back in free play. Don't recommend. Better yet, buy the Clone Wars game. Way better than this."

Missions are extremely rushed and can be finished on average in 10mins or less. several major story points are either outright skipped over or given a 20 second cutscene. i was impressed with how space battles and flight now handles, however there is virtually nothing to do in space aside from the few collectables at each planet. cutscenes make up more than half of the of the actual game. That is just an outright terrible decision in my opinion. ethere are zero puzzles, and every collectable can be acquired in the same way on every planet. why. I could barely play through the first six episodes, and that was simply to try and please my inner kid while holding out hope that it would get better as i played. I did not. Graphics do not make a game good, they merely add to the plethora of things needed to create a good game. nothing more needs to be said about that. characters with blaster serve no point aside from using them to get collectables, and they are otherwise unplayable on general occasion because you'll be better of playing with a jedi or other lightsaber wielder, and on that note even they are borderline unplayable because there are hardly in enemies in each mission, i mean like, 10-15, per mission, aside from certain boss battles. oh and about boss battles, they are all the same, i mean full blown copy and paste move sets, and they are not even a threat, because you can sit there and just through your saber at them because 90% of the time they dont know how to block it. Your multiplayer is utter trash and just does not work, I spent an hour with my brother trying to get remote play to work, but we had no luck. Overall I do not recomend getting this game, especially if you want the nostalgia of the older games. At that point, just buy the older games and replay them, because this game brings little to nothing to the table. I'd barely give the game a 3/10."

593,¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/,3,,1,87.1,August,"1,","1,908",0,1,"LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is probably the most ambitious LEGO game to this day, and honestly, I can say it's great. Ever since I tried the first LEGO Star Wars game here on Steam, I've been a fan of the franchise, and I was definitely looking forward to this game when it was announced.If you're already familiar with the LEGO Star Wars games, you should know what to expect. They're an adaptation of the Star Wars story, but with all the charm and humour of LEGO characters. As the title of the game implies, this one covers the entire Skywalker Saga; that is, all nine main movies. They play as action-adventure games where you control a group of LEGO characters, going through iconic scenes from the movies, all filled with a lot of hilarious dialogue. While I know some people have mixed feelings about voiced LEGO characters, I must say I enjoy having them, if only for the amount of extra humour they manage to get into the game, as well as references to a lot of pop culture.Gameplay wise, there's been some changes from previous LEGO games, but it remains largely the same. You'll run, you'll fight, you'll collect studs, but now the shooting has been improved, and the combat has a new combo system, which some people have compared to Devil May Cry. Another improvement to the LEGO formula is the addition of planet hubs; while the previous LEGO Star Wars games already had some hub areas (with The Force Awakens having some open world gameplay in them), this one expands it a lot more. Besides story missions, pretty much every single planet that's been visited in the movies can be visited here as well, and they're filled with collectibles to find and side missions to complete. There's also space combat, with random battles breaking out all the time in space, and if you complete enough of them, Capital Ships, which you can take over, begin to show up.As far as the story goes, well, I can't really say much; if you're familiar with Star Wars, then you should know the story. Something I'd say though, is that, while I enjoyed the game, I feel it needed a few more story missions per film. As it stands, there's only 5 replayable missions per movie, with some ""intermission"" sequences taking place in the open world, that can't be replayed without starting a new game. As for the side content, while there's many good side quests, there's also a lot that feel repetitive, like the smuggling missions. Even then, the game is overall very enjoyable.Graphically, it looks stunning. Sure, it's a LEGO game, and LEGO can look fine no matter the graphics, but the quality is very, very good. One of my favourite scenes, the Battle of Coruscant, looks incredible here, and the amount of detail present in the game is superb. Sound design is also very good, with all the familiar Star Wars tracks playing throughout the game.All things considered, I'd say this is a great game. Is it the best LEGO Star Wars game? Well, that might depend on personal preference; in my case, I'd say yes, even if it's missing a few things here and there. I recommend it."

The first ever franchise Lego game to release, way back in the mid-2000's. The first game I ever owned, on the first console I was trusted with alone. While some kids grew up playing Mario or Sonic, I grew up playing Lego Star Wars. First the originals, then the Complete Saga, The Clone Wars, and eventually even The Force Awakens, not to mention a plethora of games from other franchises. Star Wars was one of the subjects closest to my heart, so imagine my excitement when this game was announced.Then imagine my disappointment when it turned out to be a meaningless, hollow, unfulfilling experience.First, the positives:- . The detail that has gone onto making digital plastic bricks and minifigs is astounding, as other reviews will testify.- . For a game series known for its quirky humour, this entry is no different. While a large chunk of the comedy in the writing, animations, idle dialogue and collectables is ripped directly from r/prequelmemes, there are a handful of moments which legitimately made me laugh out loud. Even the prequel memes are entertaining to be fair, but they lose their charm after being played every two minutes for the 75 hours of playtime I have as of writing this review....And that's about it. For the cons, the list is longer:-. On paper having smaller, multi-route levels sounds like a wonderful modernisation of the Lego game franchise which allows creativity and problem solving to a greater extent. In reality, this as turned every level into a hollow, repetitive shell. 'Multiple paths through each area' becomes 'guess the fastest route to disappointment', as you work your way through waves of identical-in-all-but-appearance enemies before waltzing past puzzles even the children this game is made for would find effortless. Collecting minikits and completing challenges feels tedious and frustrating; . - , with no unique design features or mechanics. Lightsaber duels, which have been given a huge makeover from previous Lego entries, play exactly the same regardless of whichever iconic Start Wars villain you're duelling. In addition, combat feels no different or 'special' compared to fighting your bog-standard 'Joe Stormtrooper' from Sand-Covered Level #73. The biggest change between the two encounters is that boss fights have an irritating and inescapable forced camera perspective which makes the already-laborious effort of collectable hunting even more painful.-. Despite the numerous delays to this game's release to allow for bug-fixing, it still freezes, glitches out or crashes at least once per hour-or-so session. Some transitions appear worse for this than others, such as entering the Gungan City from Lake Paonga.-. Repetitive tasks and modern gaming seem to go hand-in-hand, and the prolonged enjoyment of the latter stems directly from the implementation of the former. Sadly, this game once again falls short. Of the 1166 Kyber Brick collectables in this game, 896 of them require performing the same half-dozen tasks at least twice per planet. Gathering them all becomes an exercise in stubbornness soon after taking any time to explore the galaxy. . - . Characters are grouped into one of ten classes, the members of which all behave (you guessed it) identically. There is nothing interesting about any of the playable characters. None have any advantages to any other. For instance, double-bladed, single-, and dual-wielded lightsabers all behave the same way with no changes to attack speed/radius/damage, despite a combat system which would fit this mechanic so well. Blasters behave the same way, regardless of if they're heavy repeaters, twin pistols or snipers. Simply put, there's no detail to any character beyond the aesthetic and when you quickly come to realise this it sucks out what little soul was left of an already-soulless game. The creation of this all-encompassing class system means there is an enormous class of characters called 'extras'. One may assume this class contains characters from niche media, spinoffs or jokes, but one would be wrong. This class - which is by far the largest in the game - holds every unique, niche, or distinct character which couldn't be shoehorned into the narrow confines of another class. This leaves even iconic characters such as Young Anakin Skywalker high-and-dry, in terms of usefulness.- A closely-related but distinct complaint is that any unique-ness which does exist for certain characters is either implemented awkwardly enough to seem like an accident or is entirely useless. For instance, Darth Vader can interact with 'Villain' panels but not 'Villain' crates, while the game doesn't consider any other Sith character to be villains at all. Many Mandalorian characters possess jetpacks, but can only hover for a second - too little time or distance to have ever been useful, when there is a class with a whopping ~10 characters () where 1/3rd of their usefulness is tied to gliding short distances.All in all, as much as I want to love this game, I can't. And Steam knows I've tried! I'm finishing this game, out of spite and solidarity for my younger self, but unlike all the other Lego games, I will then never play it again."

I cannot recommend this game, however due to the inability to actually complete the game. I have been one of the unlucky players to encounter one of the gamebreaking bugs. The bug will not let me talk to Maz, a character required to talk to to continue Episode 7. With 50% of the quests having already been completed, starting a new save file is not something I want to do. Until the bugs are patched it is not a complete game. There is 1/3 of the game that I cannot even play due to these bugs. If the bugs get patched then buy it, if they do not then do not continue to support LEGO games or products.

There are very few things I can complain about, and a huge amount of stuff I can only compliment. This review only focuses on the negatives of the game, so please be aware that while these are complaints, I still recommend this game!1. Co-op mode in this game is not optimal. You always have a split screen and can barely see anything because the fov is very zoomed in. So much so that it is hard to ignore and play the game normally.2. The levels themselves are very short. If you are not looking to 100% the levels then you can probably blast through one trilogy (if not even more) in one sitting. If you manage to not get distracted by anything, that is.3. It is oftentimes hard to distinguish between level and open-world. I find myself shooting at stuff first thing when I the story wants me to progress to a new area to collect some studs because the game does not indicate when a new level starts, nor does it have the stud bar or anything on screen until you actually collect your first studs. 4. After a while, collecting kyber crystals and characters becomes very repetitive. Which, given that there are over 1000 kybers and more than 300 characters in this game, was to be expected. But I have not even collected half of all collectibles and I am absolutely dreading 100% this game.However, this game has so much content outside the levels, has beautifully crafted planets to explore, and is so incredibly much fun to play, that I can only recommend this game. There are many games out there that cost more for far less content--and contrary to those games, this one is definitely worth your money."

I 100% the original games and I am more likely to dust off my complete saga for PS3 than play Skywalker Saga again any time soon. This game is not fun. In short, it feels like another product which seeks to exploit the nostalgia associated with a once successful brand. It became too much of a pattern by now, especially with Star Wars franchise. Technologically it's very rough around the edges, runs on a spaghetti code and is visually uncomfortable to the eyes (subjective).  3D models are gorgeous but overall impression is ruined by the overuse of awful graphic effects and art direction badly merging photorealism with LEGO bricks. Camera position and resulting field of vision isn't nice either.  The game is a definition of bloatware. From the beginning there are too many pointless and useless collectibles and nasty UI elements thrown in my face over substantial gameplay. The latter is extremely repetitive and trivial. It just feels worse and far less appealing compared to the originals. Missions are EXTREMELY short with more cut scenes than gameplay. You are expected to fly through them and then waste time on bloatware-style free roam. Being based on what essentially is a toy and being rated E is no excuse for lack of any challenge and difficulty options.  We all know that adults and young adults are the target audience of this game. Shallow variety added to combat is pointless as you can just go through the combat by spamming a single button in whatever manner you like. There is no satisfaction whatsoever. Story is told in an extremely condensed manner and lacks cohesion. In this case devs just used dialogue as an excuse not to show and just tell instead and it had a detrimental effect. Previous games just did it better despite not using a single line of dialogue. Humorous elements are poor and feel forced. Voice acting and actor choices can get very questionable at times.  I Can't recommend it for the price they ask. I'd actually recommend doing something more productive with your time than playing Skywalker Saga. This is a soulless husk made by the next generation of hacks who fundamentally do not understand the franchises they are working with and it became a common problem across all media. Due to refund time window I had limited opportunity to see more but I wouldn't be surprised if there were instances of blatant political virtue signalling of the modern age in a LEGO game; I just get that impression from the state of this product. Just another soulless corporate product for mass consumption before getting excited for the next product. You do you if you like it. I don't. And I love both LEGO and Star Wars but it's just becoming too much. I don't even come with any expectations when it comes to Star Wars stuff any more, hoping to get positively surprised but I am getting disappointed almost every time."

Other examples are the senate which only has the office of the supreme chancellor)- i havent been able to get capital ships to spawn (in free roam to unlock them) which is frustrating- ships are all practically the same (they all have the same max speed)- for some reason they took the thrusters off the astromechs- game is overfilled with npcs (for example at the lars homestead there are roaming idk how many people which makes no sense)- its filled with bad jokes that are often not funny and only a child would laugh at or jokes that only diehard fans that know everything about star wars would understand (i know this is a kids game but im sure that the majority of players is over the age of 14)- objective markers are confusing (points at one thing but youre supposed to do something at a different place)- i was dissapointed that places like varykino were left out of the game- only 5 missions per episode- kylo ren is even worse in this game than in the movies :/- a lot of the missions i was just waiting for it to end because it was just so boring (especially in the sequels)- you cant fly anywhere on coruscant (you need to take a taxi which has like 5 locations to which you can go to)overalli had fun with the game even though it has its flaws, i hope they add some clone wars stuff which everybody has been asking for  (just imagine if they take the stuff out of the comics or books that not everyone has seen on the tv show and has played in the previous clone wars games already).If you want to buy it, i would wait for a sale or get it on a key website for a cheaper price. I got the dlcs but they just give you characters so theyre not rly worth it. Im at 28 hours and i still need to complete the last episode of the sequels, so if you take your time and free roam a lot like i then this game can last you some time.I dont hate the game, Its just pretty dissapointing after getting my hopes up after seeing the trailers and teasers about it"

The ""hub world"" is gone and now you have multiple roaming areas you can travel to as you progress through the story. The new perspective being over the shoulder makes it easier to aim with blaster characters but it can be too zoomed in at times and when riding animals it is too close to the screen. The fighting mechanics have expanded, however, along with the addition of skill trees.If you play on borderless window mode then the next time you boot the game up it will not be cropped right and your taskbar will overlap with the game, so you need to reset the settings. If you play on full screen then alt tabbing back and forth can cause the game to enter weird resolution settings. No true online coop mode is unfortunate, but you can still coop with share-play but the screen real estate gets tight. Visuals are nice, but there are very few settings for adjusting the graphics in game. Music has the usual classics from the franchise and the story is told in a slightly different way with unique jokes and writing. Overall, the massive content available justifies the price."

This game is very feature rich, and the sense of humour is charming and silly as always. The time I've spent with this game so far has been extremely satisfying in terms of the gameplay, the way the episodes play out and the free roam aspect of the game, allowing you to essentially do free play at any point. However it is a much better experience to play through the story and then start unlocking the bonuses, as you'll be more than equipped to max out certain upgrades and continue having a killer time getting all the collectables. It's just overall a very fun, addicting time and I am definitely getting my lego star wars fill with this."

(i bet the biggest level was about 7-8 mins, they're all short). Well, this is a full remake of the original LEGO game, all missions have been remade, and most of them were cut, some missions like the rescue of amidala, or even other missions are completly gone, replaced by cutscenes and just walking from point a to point b, which is extremely sad, especially for such a star wars fan like me.All is not bad, from the cut missions from the new voice acting (yes, not the original act). The gameplay has completly been changed, now you can do a lot of new stuff that enchances the experience in a whole new diferent way, it feels like a LEGO game inside a action movie and i love that part. That being said you can now:-> throw your lightsaber-> throw objects against enemies-> use special attacks-> dodge attacks-> counter-bulletsAlso there is a new sandbox style of world which feels ok, since most areas have beautiful visuals, but side quests still feel very meh and barely any sense in them. Anyways, you can also fly ships across the galaxy, thing that feels OK, because just OK... Because, well, you can only travel extremely short distances, ship battles are extremely fun though.I bought this game to play with my wife, we had a lot of fun, but sadly, like i previously said, all levels feel short.Also, split camera is worse than ever. Usually, there was just 1 screen when players were close to each other, now, no matter what distance you are from your partner, there is always 2 cameras, which is hard for exploration and in some combat situations, over the shoulder camera tho is fantastic, since you can now shoot rifles like a true shooter.All in all, it is a great star wars game, but compared to some other LEGO games, especially the original one, it feels short, in 2022 i was expecting a longer game with a lot of dedication, and i paid for a game that was cut in a half, feels like they wanted to rush for a faster release. I dont care of cutscenes replacing missions, i want a full game. I still recommend this game, but for an extremely low price. A tenner, nothing more, nothing less.unplayable, enemy is a bullet sponge, flies through buildings, lost half health after 15 minutes.SOLUTION: turning auto aim on, takes exactly the same damage in less than a minute.At some point in this mission there is some sort of optimization bug, i went from 150 fps to a low 15 for about 3 constant minutes without ever going back to normal.May the force be with you! [small edit]: what is impressive about this lego title is that they built every single scene from scratch, wide open detailed areas, and i appreciate that, but all of them are not used as they should as every mission is short and takes very little time to complete. Other thing that i also appreciate is the ship battles, most are epic and take place in wide space places, but falls short as most become repetitive and you're not as free to fly as other star wars games and other lego games. I hate that they turn it into an rpg open world, because most side quests are take this, deliver to this place and thats it, so much missed potential. LEGO star wars complete saga is the best lego game ever and the best lego star wars game still, this one is not a bad game, but not as good, not even close, id rather have a linear star wars game with long missions rather than explore skywalker saga. even though it builds a fantastic star wars universe."

All the Media and Trailers for the game seemed fine and great looking. The Game looks great as well. The combat aspects of the game are also a nice change of pace and much easier gun combat. Buy Easier does not mean better, the gun combat within the Skywalker Saga gets boring after a few encounters and so do the Duels. Is repetitive with no variation. Same with the Puzzles within the game most of the Lego Charm outside of cut sense has gone. For an Example in the Cloud city level where your escaping, has a whopping 2 puzzles within it, with one of them Grappling something and shooting then the next is killing an enemy to drop a key-card. You don't even need to kill one enemy after getting the key-card to complete the level you can run though the entire thing and the last part just wait for Chewie to fix the falcon. And dont even get me started on Character Variation, cus let me tell you there is none.In conclusion I would say is a mind numbing game with the Lego Charm Removed. I would just recommend skipping this one and buy an older lego game."
631,Chief,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mr_Jacket/,17,3,0,12.5,August,"28,",104,0,1,"If you are a fan of the prequel trilogy, do not buy this game. The levels for the prequels are short, misused and have rushed cutscenes. Additionally, the developers decided to miss crucial moments in some of the films, such as the Battle of Geonosis in Episode II (every moment builds up to that battle), which I think is due to the developers not wanting to depict war and death in a LEGO game. I found that decision to be particularly disappointing because I adore the Clone War era (pivotal moment that started it was left out), and the front cover literally depicts the Battle of Geonosis.As for the combat, it feels very satisfying, whether you are using a lightsaber or blaster. The only problem is that it is heavily underused, since levels primarily require you to do repetitive side quests and hilariously easy puzzles. These problems were absent in the Complete Saga, which also had more complicated puzzles that I was able to do as a child.Overall, this game is really not for the prequel fans, as the levels are poorly designed and focus on the worst moments of the films. Hopefully, the upcoming news for this game will be TT addressing this issue, where they add more levels for the specified era."

The game does a lot of things right but some things wrong.My biggest issue with this game is the story. The levels are short and shallow. They do not have the same depth as the levels in The Complete Saga had and I get it, a lot of effort was put into the open world side of the game. I love the open world and it's something I have waited for a long time in a Star Wars game. However, open world shouldn't take away from the story. There are people who only play LEGO games for their story levels. If that's all you want to do in this game, I would not recommend you buying this for the full price. While a revision of the series shouldn't copy everything from the original, I feel like the levels don't pay respect to the ones in the older game.If you are someone who just wants a LEGO game experience and loves Star Wars, this game is still a no-brainer! The over world for the most part is incredibly fun. You will explore places you never expected to play in a LEGO Star Wars game or maybe any Star Wars game. The game has a lot of characters and ships to choose from and the best part, ."

638,Ravnsburgr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raven_the_boi/,2,,1,76.2,May,"4,",463,0,1,"I think this is a great lego game. 9/10 one of my favorite lego games and just favorite games in generalI really like the look of the game it has very nice quality, there are even small details when you visit certain planets that your characters will have visible dust or snow around some parts of their body to show that they could be dirty if you were to place them yourself in that place.One thing that sort shocked me when going in partially blind into the game was how much they had done with the combat. For anyone who knows how the combat is in every other lego game you have usually 4 or so hearts and each kick, punch, bullet and so on takes 1 heart. Here it's very different, having different health bars instead of individual hearts, you can choose to have health regen or having to pick up hearts to get hearts back, there are different classes essentially that has different weapons and abilities, move sets just all of it is just so different and i honestly like it a lot.There are tons of small details that make this game just so much greater than it already is, I can't remember all of the ones i found but again i remember seeing them and thinking it's great of them to add in such small stuff for those who know either if it was Star Wars or Lego related. Like different soldiers have helmets covering them and you can pop them off, if it's a clone they're all the same but if they're stormtroopers for example they look different with many different faces and hair. Of course The Star Wars story is great and cause first of all it is in a lego style it cuts down to more bit sized and also adds lots of comedic stuff into it, I feel as though cutting it down to make a 9 movie story play out. I can understand that it is necessary to leave out some stuff to make it not take too long to get through the story, but also in some places it left out crucial stuff that then made some missions not seem like they had as much impact or meaning. One thing I thought was kind of sad but can understand is that many of the voices I associate with certain characters weren't there, don't get me wrong the voice acting in this game is fantastic. Just wish for such a big game that they would have original voices for some of the characters even tho as the game progressed i didn't mind all that much.I know many might see this game as a kids game but still a lot of refrences and such that are more pointed towards adults, so leaving in some more serious points wouldn't be all that bad when it comes to actually showing the story of Star Wars in this more easy fun style!I really like the way they had you be able to fly to many different planets to both explore and do more missions and such in, there are tons of stuff to do, that can stretch from just fetching items to multiple missions with same quest giver or something that tells a longer tale, that in turn spruces up the world more.Any game no matter how much you tweak and fix it is always gonna have bugs and glitches, I can't say i have encountered many, of course all lego games have a bit of jank to them so that's to be expected. I had one bug where all character models were just gone except hair/head and weapon, of course it was a fun one to begin with seeing main menu with half weapons and such but not really many characters, this was kind of game breaking as i couldn't do certain actions but had to turn off and on it again to fix.Second big issue i had which ALWAYS occured in every gaming session was suddenly the screens would flicker a bit, and i would notice my night light which i like to have on was off, if i was watching stream through discord it would freeze the whole discord and Nvidia overlay just didnt wanna pop up anymore so have to restart pc after playing for that to work and restard discord for that to work properly.I could go on and on about how great it is and the issues it also has, but overall i'd say again this is a great game I love lego games and I love Star Wars so I am biased there, but I really like how open it is and fun side missions and quirks to main story too, but of course sometimes so much can be bad when first starting it can be jarring to see how much there is to do if you are completionist at times like me. Love how everything just fits so good together and i do highly recomend this game to any casual gamers who wants to play a good lego game, thank you for reading and hope this helps in deciding if you want to buy the game if you even read all of it. :)"

I think the best thing about it is that it's an entirely new experience as far as Lego Star Wars is concerned. You could still easily go back and play the Complete Saga, and I think that's great. There's a bigger focus in this game on open world as opposed to the mission based structure of the originals, which is a positive for me, since I enjoy running around and collecting stuff.Honestly my only gripes with the game is that it can be a bit blurry at times. I don't know if it's a depth of field thing (there's no option for it in the settings) or if it's some kind of adaptive resolution scaling to keep a solid 60 (which if it is, it's working since I've had no frame drops at all) though I've heard you can edit some text files to potentially fix this. The menu can also feel a bit clunky a times, but it's probably cause I'm not used to it yet."

My major problems (as a mega lover of all other Lego games, no matter how old I get lmao:1. The UI. Oh boy. It is Ubisoft on steroids. The UI is bad. Really, really bad - insanely intrusive, and takes up a ton of screen space telling you useless information and controls you never need to see after the very first time. The tutorial of this game NEVER ENDS. 2. The bugs. Within my first 15minutes of playing, I got an infinite black screen transitioning from a cutscene. Restart the entire game / mission. Same thing happened a few missions later. That was my point of refund. 3. The fun. I really don't know what it is about it - it just lost that ""thing"". I don't know if it's the UI, or the story/mission structure, or what. I can fire up age-old entries to the series and be instantly blindly entertained. Just not here - it is too.... ""modern"", and this does not fit the essence of what this game was/is. 4. The story structure. I miss the old hub-areas of going into a door and loading a level instance. The missions blending into the Hub world feel awkward, like a chore, and never live up to the separate instanced-levels. Also, the tutorial never ends, so be ready to have your hand held the ENTIRE GAME - even turning hints off.5. The voices.... okay - look, its an awesome idea - but it does not fit in a lego game. Not like this. The animations telling the story was what added to the comedy. Now, you have MASSIVE, non-toggle-able CAPTIONS taking over the entire bottom half of your screen in every cut-scene. Not only this, but they commit two CARDINAL sins in 2022: Black bars, mixed with MASSIVE closed-captions, with an EVEN BIGGER background on the text. It is insanely distracting, and you'll be forcefully reading captions instead of watching the scene 99% of the time - this is how the brain works. If they update to:A.) Disable UI elements - like, literally, ALL UI elements, PERFECT.B.) Disable tutorial elements / help messages / control overlays - PERFECT.C.) Disable Closed Captions - MEGA PERFECT.It's a shame. Cause I'm sure it's a fun game and having a billion things to collect and 20+ planets to explore is literally my thing. But A, B, and C make sure I will never, ever enjoy the actual gameplay - it is too distracting, unimmersive, and guided - basically, it is a nonstop reminder that I am a young adult playing a Lego game - I'm trying to forget this lol"

It can be buggy, though it makes up for it.First off, this game is so close to being a masterpiece. Lego's flavour to the star wars universe has always been amazing, and it is in this. Compared to the older ones it's reinvented the wheel, giving a lot of space to touch on the lore of star wars while keeping it light and wholesome.The change to classes was executed great while at the same time making every individual unique in that class, and as a plus if you switch to a character and there is already a character related in the lore. You get a line of dialogue.The Lego flavour to the story is at it's peak, it's been done very well, while not 100% faithful, it's easy to follow and funny at the same time.The gameplay is what you would expect, but with an added combo mechanic for combat, which really changes up how you play those with lightsabers and a few others. It's unique enough and easy enough that it doesn't feel sluggish or invasive. The puzzles are nice, but while going for completionism you see them reusing a lot of puzzle and the later it goes, the less inventive they get with their names for the puzzles, (I guess the juices run dry when you have to name 1200 puzzles). In the end it is really fun and engaging.Here is where it falls short of being a masterpiece. The bugs. While not noticeable if you just do the main story with a little side stuff, while going for 100% it gets frustrating. There have been times where it softlocks from a brick which requires a game restart or if you're lucky a zone refresh but sometimes it straight up crashes. Minor bugs are there and ai freaking out. While this could be a deal breaker for a lot, the rest of the game is magnificent and is worth your time."

Overall, you will definitely enjoy the story mode, but will end up having to replay every mission and chapter at least once to go back and get stuff you missed for 100%. Very repetitive and boring at the end. P.S. once you replay a mission and get something you missed (minitkit, true Jedi, etc) you can just leave the mission as soon as you get it and it will save."

There's no online multiplayer like the complete saga, and freeplay boss fights don't even work, like you HAVE to play as a certain character even though it states ""FREE PLAY"". I do like the combat and puzzles more than the complete saga, but the boss fights in skywalker saga are terrible. Not only that there's no real difficulty if you play co-op, you can just spam certain bosses and they go down wayyy faster than in just singleplayer. It's still a good game on its own, but it doesn't feel like it was made with co-op in mind at ALL (mind you lego games are primarily based on cooperative play, or have been for quite some time.)so i've changed my rating:single-player: 9/10co-op: 6-7/10"

678,𝕯𝖚𝖙𝖈𝖍,https://steamcommunity.com/id/drewahicks/,5,,1,19.0,April,"6,",158,0,1,"Adventure. Excitement. A Jedi craves not these things. If that’s the case, then all Jedi should probably cancel their preorders for LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga, since this dazzling new entry in Traveller’s Tales’ longrunning LEGO game series has brought both adventure and excitement by the plastic bucketload. With stunning set pieces cribbed from all nine mainline Star Wars films and a surprisingly vast number of iconic planet hubs to freely explore in between, The Skywalker Saga is a brick-breaking blockbuster executed with a goofy charm that had me feeling as happy as a droid in a hot oil bath.In a dramatic departure from the zoomed out camera perspective of previous LEGO titles, The Skywalker Saga features a tighter, over-the-shoulder third-person view typical of the likes of GTA or Uncharted, and it brings along with it far greater control over your attacks. Lightsabers can be boomeranged and crates can be Force-pushed with satisfying precision, and a simple combo system allows you to launch enemies into the air for a juggling volley of saber swings with ease. Fighting as a Jedi or Sith might not have the depth of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, but it’s nonetheless fast, fluid, and it feels fantastic.If you’re controlling a character equipped with a blaster, you now have the option of taking cover behind walls and other objects to pick your foes off from afar, and can switch between cover positions with the tap of the button. (A similar cover-based mechanic was featured in 2016's LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but only in specific sections of a level). I love the neat touch atop this system that you’re able to quickly rebuild destroyed cover (as can enemies), but outside of a couple of specific boss fights I hardly ever felt the need to actually shelter behind anything. In The Skywalker Saga, the combination of a constantly recharging health bar and the authentic inaccuracy of each Stormtrooper’s shots meant there was rarely any risk in taking a run and gun approach. I certainly still enjoyed the gunplay in The Skywalker Saga, but more for its flashy spectacle than its shallow attempts at strategy.Not only does the new close-up perspective make you feel more engrossed in the action, it also leads to a greater appreciation of how realistically rendered each individual LEGO brick is. With the paint on minifigs chipping away convincingly after extended use as though they’re a much-loved toy. Absolutely every LEGO creation looks so uncannily true to life, that when you blast an immaculately assembled 1000-piece Tie Fighter out of the sky, you can almost hear the cries of anguish from the parents who spent their whole Sunday afternoon helping their kid build it.The mission variety was very engaging too. The 45 main story levels constantly switch things up so that the action never grows stale. The Skywalker Saga is capable of delivering mindless carnage on a massive scale, like when The Battle of Naboo briefly blossoms into a thrilling game of tower defense, and you gleefully lob balls of energy from Gungan catapults to decimate hordes of Trade Federation droids and assault tanks. Yet it can also be more focused and cerebral, such as when Rey enters the mirror cave on Temple Island, and you carefully puppeteer her reflections in order to reach exit portal switches.Of course, and The Skywalker Saga does indeed feature levels designed around high-speed podracing, X-Wing trench runs and all the major lightsaber duels you’d expect. But even at its most familiar moments, the campaign is still a blast to play because it feels so smooth and is such an eye-popping sight to behold. The only occasional catch is that its strict adherence to a cinematic style of presentation can come across as a bit too rigid at times. In one of the boss fights against Kylo Ren, for instance, I’d whittled his health bar down to zero, yet the fight arbitrarily continued for another minute, all so I could button-mash my way through the remaining quicktime events.Each story mission is connected by surprisingly sizable hub areas situated on some 20-odd different planets, from the sandswept streets of Mos Eisley on Tatooine to the polished surfaces of Coruscant's Financial District, and everywhere in between. These open areas are absolutely rife with hidden Kyber bricks to collect by solving various environmental puzzles, and while you do see some repeated challenges across the galaxy there are plenty of other fun little surprises to stumble upon along the way. I particularly enjoyed the Lemmings-inspired challenge on Kamino that tasked me with adjusting a series of platforms to prevent a hapless clone from shuffling to his doom, or arranging a choir of Wookiees on Kashyyyk to angrily yawn a rendition of John Williams’ signature score.And if you get tired of exploring and action-platforming your way across the wealth of planets, you can always just pick your favorite starship and jet up into orbit for some impromptu dogfighting. There really is a staggering amount to do in The Skywalker Saga.TL;DR: 7/10"
679,:],https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198256157407/,3,,0,13.2,December,"24,",147,0,1,"This game is the original lego starwars game, if that game was a soul-less cash grab. I bought this game expecting it to be like it's predecessor. I was wrong.Walking in an empty sandbox listening to dialogue from the lego characters is so lame, gone are the times of actually feeling like you are in each episode of Star Wars. I feel no dialogue in the original lego game did the game very well, as you didn't need someone talking to understand what is going on. Don't get me started on the most recent Disney Star Wars lego segment in this game, just playing through it feels worse than torture. I feel that segment in this game is by far the worst one, as it just tries so hard to make you enjoy the characters to make up for how much of a mess the films were. I want to puke when I see Rey standing at the title screen each and every time, acting like as if she is the reason Star Wars was good; which is not true by a landslide. I love the prologue and the original Star Wars episodes, not the new ones. Idk how Disney just expects you to get attached to some random characters they poorly slapped into the series. I mean the lore for Disney's Star Wars is an absolute joke, it's literally just a repeat of the original trilogy with even worse characters. Overall, the game is mediocre and boring. Don't play the Disney Star Wars trilogy part of the game unless you want to be tortured, just play the first 2 trilogies if for some reason you REALLY want this mediocre game, and I recommend you get it on a steal of a deal of a price when it's on sale. Who wants to pay the full price for a mediocre experience?! If you haven't played the original for some reason though, skip this game, it's not worth your time. Go play the original Lego Starwars, it's really good."

I think Lego did a good job making good parodies of each film, but I also got the impression that they were done by genuine fans of Star Wars who put a lot of heart into the game. In addition, I think the open-world gameplay and space gameplay to be very fun. I enjoy travelling the galaxy and exploring as my own little gang aboard our own ship. Very fun, and let's the imagination run wild. My only complaint: no in-game character creator. LEGO games should all have this, it should be always be included. Instead, it looks like modders are picking up the slack in that regard, thankfully. Overall, I recommend this game and look forward to exploring more of the free roam galaxy."

It was fun at first, and the world design is cool but it seems like 90% of the game development time was spent creating the open universe rather than actual content. It's all fluff with story levels taking just a couple of minutes to complete but about 15 minutes to get to it. It is ""Lego Star Wars Universe Travel Simulator"". Some missions you travel to and then it's ""travel here and watch a cut scene. It's boring and trivial even for a Lego game.The UI is clunky and not intuitive.The missions are dull, and very short.If you're new to the Lego games, go play the old Lego Starwars games, or Lego LOTR instead.

The amount of puzzles, collectibles, side missions, and challenges is astounding. Sure, many of these are just filler—repetitive, menial tasks—but a surprising number is delightful and satisfying. And even the menial tasks can be enjoyed for the journey itself. It's nice to just spend time in this wacky, beautiful game world. I only really started to get tired of it when I approached 80 hours of game time.It's indeed remarkably beautiful. You would think there's not much potential in brightly colored LEGO blocks, but here they are placed in realistic terrains, and even the blocks make use of superb lighting and material effects. You really need to experience this game in HDR if you can, as the implementation is often breathtaking.It's not all gravy, though. The UI is very cumbersome. The controls and camera usually work well, but they can become frustrating in puzzles that require precision 3D platforming and/or speed. Load screens between planets are long, which is very annoying when working through the many multi-planetary side missions. It's also just ...  easy. If you understand how the in-game ""money"" system works, you can early on become rich enough that you don't have to think about it anymore. And combat is so trivial that it's likely you will never die. Indeed, weapon upgrades are unnecessary for survival, they'll just make encounters end sooner. Finally, the mission tracker turns most missions into brainless follow-the-blue-light experiences. That said, I did enjoy the many puzzles, which require some logical thinking and observation skills. I really wish the game focused more on puzzles than combat.But what I  wish for is a challenging, serious Star Wars open-world RPG with the scope and beauty of this game. Still, this game scratches some of that itch as it's loyal, in its own way, to the Star Wars universe and its tone. And it's also loyal to LEGO. It's very funny, very lighthearted, and very easy. If you come into it with the right attitude it can be a good time for many hours."

This is a vastly different game that plays like a mix between other modern LEGO titles but with Mario Odyssey/Scribblenauts-style open world missions. If you bring an open mind, this game can definitely hit that childlike joy. I will add that this game is incredibly easy, but you can be extra and combo enemies or use creative means to kill them such as throwing objects and mind controlling. The game is also mostly stable and finished on release, which in today's industry is refreshing. I look forward to finishing my 100% saves on both Complete Saga and Skywalker Saga.To me, deluxe is worth it. I also used a third-party to buy my key, so the price was comparable to the standard edition here.Here are my 2 complaints/suggestions: 1. There are no custom characters like in complete saga, and I really hope they add them. I unironically think this is the best game to explore the SW galaxy, and it would be even better if you could play as your avatar. I also think that LEGO of all franchises not providing custom characters is a tad ironic.2. When your sprint is upgraded, you move really fast. I love that. What I don't love as much is that if you jump while sprinting, you lose all momentum. I'm a person who spams jump while I'm walking around and I would like to just yeet myself, but alas I cannot."

It's a very fun experience to play through the game because I believe it unlocks the kid in all of us. But, I do have one complaint and its the fact that the story isn't told as accurately compared to the original game and the pacing does feel a tad too fast at times. Although I dont want to get into many spoilers, I will give an example since most people that buy this game have already seen the movies: In the fight against Darth Maul, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon take down Maul together and then Qui-Gon dies comedically to a cut in half Maul. But in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, it stays true to the story and Obi-Wan has to finish off Maul himself with that final jump move out of the pit and then rushes to Qui-Gons last words. I know it is very nit-picky of me to make a complaint out of something like that, but I just felt like it was worth pointing out. Nevertheless, the game is phenomenal and I highly recommend it to those who have kids/friends/family to play it with, those who want some childhood nostalgia, or just any Star Wars fan since this is going down as one of the best."

I'm now at 99.5% and I have to find the wandering Wookiee 13 more times. The problem is that I have already visited the remaining positions that the mission shows me and talked to the Wookiee. But that apparently didn't count. If I now return to these positions, I can no longer find a Wookiee, because I have already found him and talked to him. So I can't complete the game and get stuck at 99.5%.Very, very sad that such a game breaking bug occurs in a 60 Euro title."

I have not a bad word to say about it from the fighting to the size of the maps to the puzzles and references to other games and source material this game is just flawless. Makes me think of my childhood playing The Complete Saga and I am not let down by this sat all. If relaxing LEGO games and/or Star Wars are your thing you have to play this game. Can`t wait for future DLC packs to see what we get, the attention to detail is amazing. The character interactions are so perfect when idle. Completely love what they have done with the large flagships (you`ll find out when you play) adds such a new fun layer to the game that we haven`t seen before.The fact we actually have decent sized areas of 33 different planets to free roam and break and loot is awesome, so much more to do than ever before.Just wish I could get the republic gunship, But maybe a future dlc.Absolutely 10/10 to the people at TT games they have outdone them selves with this one.(Will be updating if I find more to say)"

769,Kahedi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kahedi/,3,,0,13.8,April,"10,",413,0,1,"I wish I could recommend this game, but I can't and that saddens me. I was very hyped about it- as I grew up with the LEGO Star Wars game, and had a great time exploring the star wars universe.At the time of my review, I just completed episode IV. And to summarize:The story gets squashed and cuts at a random paze. And they try to throw in some comedy elements. But I think the attempt at trying to tell the shove the major plot points and twists into 3 voicelines just ♥♥♥♥♥ up the pace of the game.Game mechanics:As a game developer myself, it's also sad to see some overall bad game mechanics. - UI text boxes flickers on the screen, and text can flash on screen before it should. - The camera is way too far panned in when riding animals, which makes it very awkward to move around- In general, the controls just doesn't feel good to use. Maybe I'm just sensitive to doing shooting with a controller, but it was not a smooth experience. I tried doing shooting with a keyboard, and that worked better than on the controller. But I didn't enjoy the other controls on the keyboard. In the end I just preferred doing melee attacks with a controller. And it sucks that you have to change your playstyle because the controls are bad.The whole game seems almost overengineered in a way. But also underdeveloped at the same time? It's a weird combo.I have to say I went into this experience with some hope of having a nostalgic experience. And I am. But mostly just getting the urge to playing the original LEGO Star Wars game.That said, I will continue playing the game some more. Just to satisfy my inner child. As I did pay a bunch for it. But I will continue to cringe at the screen and not the smoothest game experience. I also did have a great hope to play this LEGO game with friends, but I don't have the heart to share this experience with someone.It's a 6/10 for me."

At this point in time it's left a far better impression than most other Star Wars games despite its friendly appearance. I'm also pretty sure that the devs also visited r/prequelmemes a few times with the interactions many characters have while idle and swapping.It's no secret the Travellers Tales studio and its Devs went through hell while making this game, and to all those working at TT still and those who left, if this is your legacy let it be known as your greatest treasure. There is more love and commitment in this Star Wars game than any other. Anyone who plays and explores this game will come across this love, this understanding, these devs are also fans of the same franchise, not EA bots chugging out a game to sell a P2W experience for money and short term gain. I wish all those in TT both current and past a great future, you blew my mind with the Original Trilogy game, showed your love with The Lord Of The Rings, your passion with Indiana Jones, and mastered your very own identity with this game, Thank you for all the joy you have brought to me ever since I was a kidFrom the bottom of my heart, I wish you all the best"

The graphics are absolutely fantastic to see, the visuals as well are awe inspiring. However, in two areas specifically I saw a significant gameplay impact on my frames even with a 3060 GPU. While its not a major grievance, it certainly impacted my enjoyment in those areas.While I haven't touched a newer lego game at all, this game was definitely not hard to learn the controls and get used to them. The negatives of this is only the occasional input oddity that occurs using keyboard and mouse controls as well as once or twice with a controller. Now the story, absolutely great. Great laughs and great pacing up until the start of the sequel trilogy. By that point in the game it feels as if there's tons of gameplay thats just meant to drag itself out over time rather than being able to pull your attention and interest to make it feel as if it takes forever when it actually does take forever.Overall, the game itself is really really fun, however there are some issues with it: none of which should really be points that turn you away from this game, the takeaway should be that this is definitely a revolutionary game that is unique to itself. You'll definitely waste hours enjoying yourself, or days grinding to 100% this game. I'd also say that it has great replayability as well as being a great game to play with that one friend who really, really shares your enthusiasm about lego star wars."

The only thing I would change is for there to be more building in the levels. without building, lego games just feel like a normal action adventure story game.. in this game you only build 1 thing per level, sometimes even none at all. Otherwise, the game is fantastic and 100% would recommend, although I cant forget to mention it is a little buggy but so is every game on release these days"

Honestly they should have released this in parts starting with the OT, then PT, and finally the ST for the 5 people who would have bought that lol, they could have even connected post-release like the Hitman titles do to make one huge game. Unfortuently quality doesn't mean anything these days apparently so while I do enjoy it for the most part, it's not worth getting until AT LEAST 50% off as that's how much is missing from each movie in this game."

The biggest disappointment, they consist mostly of brief boss battles and vehicle sections. It's telling that minikit count has gone down from 10 to 5. Because the levels are so short that if you put 10 in, you'd be tripping over them. The travel/cutscene play that takes you to the next level often ends up being longer than the level itself. They feel like an afterthought when this is the core of the game.The Story. It tells the story very well with very nice scenes and the usual lego humor. Unfortunately due to the level problem you spend more time watching the story than playing the story. I remember watching the Battle of Coruscant scene where Anakin and Obi are flying their fighters to rescue the Chancellor and I was sitting there holding my controller waiting, expecting at any moment for the cutscene to end and drop me into gameplay and it didn't. Instead I watched a cutscene of what could have been two levels worth of gameplay and was two levels in its predecessor. I understand not wanting to rehash levels from the predecessor game but come on, its meant to be a videogame not a movie and it's telling the same story, that's a poor excuse to waste gameplay potential.Open World. Over a thousand collectables spread over several open world areas. Puzzles are pretty much standard. Compared to the open world of the LOTR and Marvel/DC lego games, they feel pretty lifeless. There may be more open world space but previous lego games did open world better.Combat. Never enough enemies. They never show up in great numbers and they generally are not very threatening. Unless you fall off a ledge you won't be hearing Yoda's amusing death sound effect. The battle of naboo plains is galling, you go in expecting a big battle, maybe like the Lego Clone wars. Instead you get 18 battle droids, that come in waves of three at a time. It's pathetic. Another problem is guns, both on foot and in space, with auto aim on it's brainless, in the options you can adjust the auto aim, if you turn it all off you enter a world of hitbox frustration. They also threw in a new cover mechanic for ranged characters but its impact is completely deflated by the ease of combat.Upgrade System. A new system, I was very impressed at first but I quickly realised it's largely pointless. The only upgrade of value is the minikit detector. The game is not terribly challenging, it's lego afterall it's not meant to be hardcore, so the upgrades end up being unnecessary and lack impact on your gameplay. Another 30% lightsaber damage! Now those battle droids that I was killing in two hits without damage upgrades will be defeated in.... two hits. See the problem? It also doesn't help that primary currency for buying upgrades is also the primary collectable, kyber bricks, which results in a situation where you'll have already completed the puzzle the upgrade would have made slightly easier so you could get enough kyber bricks to buy the upgrade.In summary, I can't recommend this game. It feels like they spent so much time on the new features they forgot to make a core gameplay experience you could use these new features in. For all the shiny new stuff, it's an underwhelming effort compared to previous Lego franchise games. If you like Star Wars, get the older Lego Star Wars games. If you want an open world Lego experience, go to the Marvel/DC/LOTR lego games."

Nevertheless, this game gathered my attention and being the cheapskate that I am, I planned to keep an eye on it and buy it at a sale. But I saw some content in which the game looked really fun and properly polished, so I decided to treat myself on the deluxe edition. Initially the game was fun despite a bunch of flaws (by which I mean both glitches and more subjective flaws based on my personal opinion); fun enough for me to still wholeheartedly recommend it. But at some point the negative started to outweigh the positive, so I guess I will only recommend this game when enough of the issues are addressed. Because of many of the glitches and clunkily implemented features, I doubt the game has been properly playtested. I heard the game was delayed on various occasions because of the difficulties with implementing the open world aspects, but it seems that at some point they gave up and released the unfinished product anyway. Since I bought the deluxe edition, I would assume I wouldn’t have to feel like playing a pre-release betatester and that a developer would have the decency to complete a game before releasing additional content to rake in more money. TT games isn’t the only one to execute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices like this (having some Cyberpunk 2077 vibes here), but it sure sucks it seems to become the standard. Here is a list of things I specifically like and things I don’t.Positive aspects• The game allows you to explore the galaxy a lot. In many areas you’re not constrained by objectives you have to progress because you’re in a mission, so you can help people on side missions, solve puzzles to get collectibles and just roam around and have some fun.• The dialogues are really fun. In the trailer I saw for the game, many of the jokes fell flat (for me), but in context they were much more fun. There are many jokes referencing the movies (and quotes referenced in memes), which I expect many to enjoy. A protocol droid next to the Tusken village, for example, will tell you it’s “home of not just the men, but the women and children too”. Characters selected can also have some interaction; Vader will tell Palpatine he already heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the wise countless times. • Visually it generally looks very nice, with much of attention to detail, especially when it comes to the figures. The capes look like actual fabric, and the figures themselves even have lines from the molds and a real plastic-looking shine.• Flying freely in space in combat is very smooth, at least it is with mouse and keyboard. For me it fits perfectly between the classic and new Battlefront II, meaning it’s both easy to steer to fly and to aim to shoot. On a controller, I found steering much harder, but that’s probably also the result of me being less used to controllers.Negative aspects• It’s not always clear where freeplay starts and ends. You can complete story related objectives in the open world parts, but it’s not clear when you can and can’t select other characters to complete puzzles that require a certain type of character.• The missions that don’t take place in the open world are very short. Especially when replaying them it felt glaringly obvious how less content there is in this regard. The Sarlacc/sail barge mission, for example, has a small portion that immediately starts on deck with Luke and Lando and then cuts to a boss fight against Jabba with Leia and R2-D2. It was fun to actually fight Jabba in person, but the whole mission was very short compared to the skiff hopping and below deck objectives of Lego Star Wars II.• There is a reason I spoke about “flying freely in space combat” before, and that is that in a bunch of missions, you can’t fly freely. It really makes it feel like you’re stuck on a monorail with limited space to move. In the Naboo submarine mission this felt somewhat logical, but for others (the Millenium Falcon asteroid chase and the Death Star I trench run) it felt really limiting and annoying. In missions such as the Jango Fett Geonosis chase and the Naboo Trade Federation control ship battle you’re allowed to move much more freely, making these missions much more enjoyable.• This monorail feeling also applies to many of the boss fights, portions of which you will be locked onto the boss without being able to unlock again (locking onto bosses in games can be useful, but it’s better if you can lock onto the boss yourself and disable it again as well). The game also heavily relies on quicktime events during these boss fights, which really removes a sense of urgency and personal skill when battling them. And unfortunately, these quicktime events regularly take some time to be triggered. When battling Dooku, at some point he just kept taking a beating with the same amount of barely any health, and after my 300 combo he required multiple seconds to walk to the right place to trigger the final quicktime event.• Many interesting potential missions are relegated to cutscenes, which is very unfortunate. You get to enter Palpatine’s office to arrest him as Windu and Fisto, but not to fight him, and space/vehicle battles such as the battle of Coruscant, battle of Geonosis and the Death Star II battle are just there as cutscenes. • There are various missions causing massive framerate drops without any ‘visual justification’ to back it up. The Geonosis factory and Ewok village don’t look better than most other places, so they shouldn’t cause such low framerates.• Once a mission is started, you can’t leave it without completing it (or so it seems).• The main menu animation can’t be skipped, so you’ll have to sit through Rey’s “I need someone to show me my place in all this” and the slow zoom out every time you want to load a savegame or leave the game altogether. And as a player, you’re not allowed to show her her place in all that, which definitely is not in the center above all other characters. Jarring. • The intro animation skip also doesn’t work properly; it says you need to hold F to skip it, but you first need to tap a key (either F or another one) first. • The character selection menu isn’t user friendly. There’s a lot of character classes with specific characters, and you can’t navigate the menus with your mouse.  • The game doesn’t always seem to properly apply the character you selected. Not the one you picked altogether sometimes (because it seems to think you selected it already, although you’re obviously not that character), but also not the specific version of that character you selected. In many instances, this game just doesn’t seem to want me to play as the stormtrooper commander with the spooling gun, so I’ll keep ending up with the regular one with the regular blaster.• Even when in freeplay, it’s sometimes impossible to switch characters from your preselected ones, so you’ll have to switch with the character next to you first.• The game also seems to have a hard time remembering which characters you had selected when entering/leaving a room. And switching to the one you’re not isn’t always possible because the game seems to think you’re already that character while you’re not.• The rotating mini-map (if you select the option) forgets to rotate a lot. You can make it rotate again by switching with the character next to you (and back), but it sucks I have to keep doing it every single time I enter another area.• Enemies are sparse in numbers when compared to the large amounts of the earlier Lego Star Wars games and are unlikely to kill you. Characters with activated lightsabers will automatically reflect blaster bolts without requiring the need to hold a block button. You’re much more likely to die because of one of the next few bulletpoints.[REST OF THE REVIEW IN THE COMMENTS]"
877,Lordbobomb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lordbobomb/,2,,0,0.3,March,27,335,0,1,"It seems that the PC port was an afterthought when developing this game, as it's controls are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible and can not be rebound without it feeling just as bad.Jedi and Blaster characters do not use the same key to use their primary attacks and what makes it worse is that multiple actions are mapped to them. Haven't found anything on search engines for mods or ini tweaks that could help either.I could bear the terrible voice acting and the sequel trilogy being in this game.But the piss poor controls really kills it for me plus the lack of the character customizer (without mods) really doesn't help either. And before anyone even thinks: ""BrUh jUSt BuY a coNtRolLer""No i'm not going to buy a controller just to have even a decent experience, it's not an excuse nor a solution for poor developer practices. Quake came out in 1996 and set the standard for PC gaming controls, and even it had re-bindable keys that weren't mapped to multiple actions. There is no excuse for any developer to have such terrible decisions made almost 30 years later.As someone who deeply loves the Original Complete Saga and really likes the Clone Wars game. (Even with it's questionable design decisions) this is a disappointment to say the least. I can only hope that maybe one day they'll put in some kind of preset keybinds that would fix my issue with it's controls but i quite frankly doubt they would."

879,Big Muzzy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/madikvelov/,2,,1,49.6,July,"17,",216,0,1,"I have replayed every Lego game in the last to years and I must admit that this game is much better than many in the entire collection. However, there were some questionable choices concerning the gameplay and the character roster. I feel like TT decided to simplify the categories of characters due to the fact that all of the last Lego Superhero games (DC, Marvel, Incredibles) had to many types of characters. I would say that the old system was confusing but the one that we have now is too simple. You could literally play through the entire game using only 4 characters. There are so many abilities in the Star Wars universe that could be utilized. Things like the gungans (and other species) being able to swim underwater or different villains (or heros) from different eras being able to use different puzzles, codes, riddles etc. (We only get the ""heros"" and ""villains""). The point of having so many characters is to make it fun for the player to switch between them. This game has kind of turned this option into a chore. On top of that there is a number of characters missing from the roster which again would seem to be obvious picks. We get all the knights of ren but no random geonosians?? Really? No imperial spy and no Agen Kolar (this guy is even missing in the cut scene). I get that these are minor problems and thats why I would still recommend this game but it just seems odd that they would add so many characters just for ""funzies"" but then decide to overlook some characters that are literally on screen during important scenes. Don't get me wrong I am not mad about this, I'm just extremely confused... It would be lovely to get all the answers one day but for now let's just enjoy the beautiful game that the TT team created.Anyways, I had a lot of fun playing this and will probably play it again. I hope that the TT team gets to work on more Lego titles (under less excruciating circumstances ha ha...)"

929,ajnplatinum,https://steamcommunity.com/id/archmanialandmark/,2,,1,14.3,April,"6,",581,0,1,"Going into this game you'll probably wanna take one thing into account:This game's goal is very different from the original Lego Star Wars games/Complete SagaWhere those games existed to gameify the prequel and original trilogy's most exciting moments for family friendly sandbox action, Skywalker Saga aims to retell as much of each movie as possible while presenting the player with an extremely detailed and vast galaxy to explore while at the same time trying some new gameplay mechanics to make the more action packed setpieces more enjoyable (especially considering a lot of the game's audience is going to be people who grew up with the originals)Much of the game's puzzles and exploration come from the open world you'll be traversing as the story and actual levels progress. This means that the actual levels are often dedicated to iconic battles or action oriented moments from the films, however that doesn't mean there aren't some puzzles or motivation to come back for free play to earn those minikits and complete mission challenges.Considering this, it's much easier to feel as though this is an evolution of the original formula. You're still exploring every corner of iconic locations to collect studs and other collectables like the original games, just most of it being separate from the more combat focused levels the game throws you in across all 9 movies' stories. Ignoring the overworld's exploration can make the game seem like a walking sim from point A to point B, so treat it all as one long hunt for bricks, easter eggs and bonus areas.(Edit: There is still plenty of combat outside of the main story. The overworld and areas within it will have hostiles spawn and special encounters such as taking over capital ships will include large space and ground battles to take on.)This also in turn makes the game come off as a very relaxing experience. There's over 1000 clear bricks to collect throughout the entirety of the game, with many areas feeling as though there's a puzzle or platforming segment to solve to grab one. There's two motives to finding these bricks: 100% completion and the ability to upgrade every character type in the game with these bricks. Each character type has some sort of quirk, with characters found in these categories often having their own little quirk as well. For a game with 300+ characters they somehow made each look and feel unique.There's so much fanservice and attention to detail in this game as well that putting it into words is super difficult. So many animations, discoverable locations, lines of dialogue and goofy jokes in cutscenes that reference all of Star Wars and even other properties as well (like Better Call Saul and Xenoblade of all things) make it hard to not smile at it all.This game is genuinely something special if you don't go in expecting something exactly like the original games or specifically Complete Saga. As an alternative to experiencing each movies' plot: this game excels. As an exploration focused title: this game excels. As a simple yet fun hack n slash/TPS: this game excels.This game was worth the wait and while your value of Lego Star Wars and the actual Star Wars properly may dictate your enjoyment of this game quite a bit, fans will love what this game brings to the table and I'm hoping some other past Lego titles like Indiana Jones get a similar type of treatment.10/10"

If you treat this game like a linear experience it fails miserably. All the levels are shockingly short and basic. The gameplay even for a LEGO game is so simple. At least in the original LEGO Star Wars the levels were a good length with solid level design and actual puzzle solving involved in the gameplay. There is none of that here, it is as straightforward as it gets. The constant interruptions in the gameplay with the popups asking if you want to continue the story got so annoying too. I was basically playing just to get to the next cutscene which is by far the best part about this game, the actual cutscenes themselves. All the characters are very well animated and the game is genuinely funny. I don't regret my time or experience with the game because i played it in coop and we enjoyed watching the numerous funny moments the game offers, but we would have had the same experience if we just watched all the cutscenes on youtube because we got nothing out of actually playing the game itself. The game also has a lot of performance issues in certain areas in coop. You can tell it's the outdated engine the game runs on struggling to keep up. You can also tell a lot of the effort in this game was put on the open world collectathon gameplay and not on the actual missions themselves which is the reason why i bought the game. If you plan on running around all the planets getting all the blue bricks and doing everything possible maybe it's worth getting but because i didn't bother doing that it's hard to say, i don't see the point in doing it personally. Even though i don't regret my time with the game it's not one i can recommend, especially as a straightforward journey where you are just playing through the movies. 5/10 (Average)"

My only big issue was enjoying Episodes 7,8,9. As myself i do not consider them as part of canon either of Star Wars, that is not fault by devs but Disney.

958,Manson,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maschardunn/,2,,1,39.1,April,"19,",226,0,1,"Personal rating - 7/10If you're someone that hasn't played a LEGO game in the past 10 years like myself this game will be a lot different than what your memory serves you, but it will still be an enjoyable experience. I played this game entirely co-op and am still in the process of going back to 100% the game so I will be speaking about my experience with the game playing co-op.This game has a lot of bugs. Period. Now some aren't as bad as others, but still really annoying to have to deal with. A few that immediately come to mind that I ran into often were:- Changing to random characters when entering a building in Free Play- Characters freezing when using the force and talking to characters (only way I could fix is by restarting the level)- Important mission characters disappearing off the face of the planet (literally)I was not a fan of the menus upon menus you have to go through in order to find anything you are looking for. As someone who waiting until they were finished with the game to buy characters it took an extremely long time to go through and buy every single character, ship, etc that I had unlocked which wasn't many.Lastly, some of the levels in this game were clearly not designed for co-op. Some levels Player 2 is stuck as a droid and literally can't do anything for most of the level. There are a few things they can do, but its only little character checks for bricks or mini kits. The open world aspect of this game gives me the sense of freedom I've always wanted in a LEGO game. I love going into space and being able to LAND on an enemy ship and even buy it afterwards. Its an incredibly thrilling way to earn ships. The puzzles throughout the game are nice, not too hard and not too easy. Some might not be incredibly obvious but map markers can help steer you in the right direction which is nice. I'm putting this at the bottom because in my opinion its very minor, but I find it out that they decided to remove 90% of the character deaths. This really killed the mood for a lot of cut scenes... which there are a lot of.."

As I have, quite literally, experienced all content there is in this game!This is frankly speaking a new era of LEGO games. It takes a lot of the original core mechanics of the old LEGO games I grew up playing, i.e LEGO Star Wars 1, 2 and The Complete Saga, LEGO Batman, LEGO Indiana Jones, etc. and completely modernizes it. We've got the classic stud collecting, character collecting, and upgrades. What is also still here are the standard ""story levels"". However, this time around its all been throw into a strange open world sandbox/RPG style game, and in my humble opinion they nail it.If you're just here for some quick in and out LEGO fun, then this is definitely the game for you. The story and the levels are very entertaining and well put together experiences, and a great way to re-live all 9 episodes of the epic saga we all love! To top it all off, (I never thought I would say this about a LEGO game) this game has BEAUTIFUL graphics. Honestly some of this game is stunning! Not gonna lie, this game even made me enjoy the sequel trilogy, which I am usually not very fond of. In my experience, it took around 3 to 4 hours to complete each episode. So if you're just looking to play through the story its gonna take you around 27 to 36 hours to complete it!If you want more than just some quick in and out fun, and you want to re-live the old days of LEGO Star Wars 1, 2 and The Complete Saga, collecting every mini kit and unlocking every character. Fighting to achieve that sweet sweet 100% then OH BOY is this game for you! The sheer amount of stuff to collect in this game is absolutely MIND BLOWING! Now I wont lie, it can get a bit grindy at points if you really want that 100% game completion. But if you are a sick twisted completionist like me, then you will love every second of it! All in all, the game is said to contain around 80 hours of content if you're going for 100%. This seems about right, as I'm writing this review right after I achieved 100% and I'm currently sitting on 88.8 hours.Final thoughts:Is this game perfect? Oh hell nah, this is not a perfect game. I've run into minor bugs here and there. And as I stated, to get that sweet sweet 100% some grinding must be done.Is this game fun? Oh hell yeah! This game is A LOT of fun! I think theres something for everyone here, no matter how much time you want to sink into the game. I found myself nostalgically reminiscing on my childhood, playing old LEGO games. I found myself re igniting my burning passion for Star Wars, and in conjunction with playing the game started a marathon of all Star Wars movies and shows (The Clone Wars, The Bad Batch, The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, etc.). But most importantly, I found myself having a lot of fun with a video game for the first time in quite a while, and I could not put this game down.I hope this review helps :DEdit: Played the game again recently, it still slaps!"

Such phrases lead me to wonderful dreams I have about epic adventures throughout the galaxy. These adventures are conducted by Lego Minifigures of my favorite star wars characters, like Luke Skywalker or Darth Vader. However, my favorite Lego star wars character is either the Gonk or the Jawa, I am inconclusive about this. Though, I feel as if I can connect to these characters; I am short as both the Gonk and the Jawa and only receive any attention from girls as petty love - such love they see in a baby, adorable rather than sexy. I want to be sexy, but I am not and feel comfortable when I see others like me. I also relate much further to these characters - when the Gonk droid says magnificent words like ""Gonk,"" it reminds me of my seemingly simple nature, but through a protocol droid, there is much more to be found. Both characters are also unable to drive motor vehicles, something I relate to due to both size and absence of license. The relations I have to these characters fill my heart with completion, as although I am not much, I can relate to these characters and see how successful they have become. They have fueled my drive for achievements like ""Earn 10 billion studs,"" as I hope to become as successful as thy, and if not in the real world, in Lego Star Wars."

The FOV is also quite tight, meaning in splitscreen you can barely see what's going on most of the time. Shame, because visually its really well done.It's like someone thought implementing SkyRim questing in a LEGO game would be a grand idea, IDK, can't quite put my finger on it but the kids won't touch it so it's a complete waste of money.Maybe if you're an adult who wants to play through the whole experience alone it might be worth a shout, but for this audience it's a complete washout.They spend all their time on the original SWL and Jurrassic Park LEGO series, mainly because they can see what's going on, and the dynamic splitscreen works so much better."

You run around, break the same objects (benches, merchant stands, boxes), collect small denomination studs, find upgrade bricks, and follow a nav marker to a story mission. You get a cutscene. Then you run around to the next nav marker. You get a mission that lasts much less time than your aimless wandering. Rinse and repeat. The worlds are very samey and lack the goofy Lego oddities that made the older games so fun, like force pulling increasingly bizarre vegetables out of the ground, building skeleton spooky bois that wander about, or a machine that gives you a top hat and moustache. Maybe those things come later in the game, but I'm already running out of steam in the early game.The game lacks curation. Like i said, my last LSW game was the complete saga many years ago. Those games had a single hub world with the same gameplay devices as the open worlds do in this game. You could cause some mayhem until you got bored, then go into a story episode. Those episodes had several missions which (generally) took anywhere from 15 minutes on up, depending on how well you knew the maps and whether or not you wanted to grab all the collectibles. The story beats were contained within the levels, and everything had a reasonable linearity to it. The nice thing is that there were extra rooms or areas dotted throughout the levels where you could have goofy encounters with hot tub troopers, or play some kind of minigame for studs or collectibles. Everything you needed to 100% the game was present in the levels, not the bland hub world.I think what I'm missing most in this title is the focus. It feels like im running around an MMO world with a LSW dressing, but without all of the off-beat humour to it."

It's like they took their LotR game and flipped the values; instead of the open world and side quests offering something a little extra between missions, now it feels more like the missions are something extra between the open world and side quests, and so far they've been little more than go from A to B, then press button for cutscene.Edit: So it does feel like things somewhat improve beyond the prequel chapters, at least enough for me to give a positive rating. The missions are still disappointingly short, however, and a good chunk of them are boss fights. Methinks they might have been a little too fond of the new combat system, which doesn't really add much to the game, honestly. Wait for discounts."

Compared to previous lego games, I definitely think this one tops the bag, BUT I do still have some complaints about it. Firstly, graphics, level design, combat mechanics, and open world aspects blow my mind. Sometimes, it honestly feels overwhelming to take it all in. And I'll admit, I've never been a ""voice acting"" kinda guy in lego games, but I actually don't mind for this one, especially since the voices are extremely close and well done to the originals. My only thing with the game is that the levels are far too short compared to the Complete Saga and that it lacks the same amount of content/effort. Building isn't all too present and the enemies and levels actually feel way easier than they should. That being said, at the same time, I still feel that there is much to explore all around every level and that something like this isn't enough to take away from the game itself. It's more personal preference, I suppose. It would be nice if we could also customize characters like previous games and even add in spin off stories/characters from other series like the Clone Wars, etc. (Yes I know dlc has bad batch and what not).Overall great game."

It's actually one of the more solid Star Wars titles to come out recently, which is bizarre to me considering that this is, at it's core, a LEGO game. Of course, you'll find bugs here and there, with a few requiring a relaunch of the game to work around, but I'm fairly confident that these will be patched sooner rather than later. This review is written after completing both the prequels and original trilogy. I am currently at 18 hours of game time. My current completion is listed at 22.40%.Anyhow, introduction business out of the way, let's get into my thoughts about LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga.-Gameplay is really good, and a far cry from the incredibly basic and bare bones systems of the LEGO titles that I grew up with. It is seriously a massive leap forward, and I hope this sets a new bar for LEGO titles.-Environments are stunning, and there were a good few times I just had to stop what I was doing to look around. You can tell that TT games put a lot of effort into making every location look as good as possible, within the limitations of a LEGO game.-Voice acting is actually pretty decent. Prior to playing the game, I heavily considered putting it into mumble mode right off the bat - however, upon hearing that the characters were voiced by the Clone Wars actors, I opted to play without mumble mode enabled. It has been a decently enjoyable experience so far, although I certainly won't blame anyone for enabling mumble mode out of preference.-Levels can be a bit short, however I've found that this is well balanced by the free roam exploration. As mentioned at the end of the introduction, I'm at 18 hours and 22.40% completion. Take that as you will, everyone has a different value when it comes to dollar per hour in game. As an additional note, I do expect to get at least another 15-20 hours out of this playthrough, while I tackle the sequel trilogy, do side missions, and find collectables.My only real complaint is the lack of online co-op. Although Steam has the remote play feature, it requires a far better internet connection than what we have available in many rural areas. Native online co-op is not only significantly less demanding on an internet connection, but it also comes with nice bonuses, such as not having to play in a split screen configuration. However, I do understand the reasons for not including online co-op in the game, and I believe that the game does not suffer too much for it's absence.All in all, I give this an 8/10. If the sequels change my mind on this, I will be sure to come back and update my review."

It's my first LEGO game. My buddy invited me to play using Steam's Remote Play Together and it's really cool visiting the Lego Star Wars worlds and searching for Kybricks! I ended up buying the game because of it. Unfortunately, that time spent using my friend's Remote Play Together counts towards overall playtime and Steam Support won't reimburse me for my unplayable copy because they say I have 10+ hours. $80 lost :( Hope they release a patch for the users experiencing this issue. ****** [Original - 100% SALTY TEARS - review]****** My friend invited me to REMOTE PLAY WITH A FRIEND over Steam.

1020,Furgotti,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Furgotti/,2,,1,36.3,April,"11,",298,0,1,"So, I got this game on April 7th as a birthday present from a very close friend and I have to say this was the best present I've gotten in a long time. This is a piece of my childhood, I started playing the original Lego Star Wars game before I played the Skywalker saga and comparing both of them the developers of the Skywalker saga have done an outstanding job. They did such a great job that they even made episode seven through nine better than the movies and that's saying something. This game is a great accomplishment in video gaming industry because it shows there's still hope out there for game companies to make good games without making a bunch of false promises. This wasn't a game made by EA or Bungie or Bethesda they didn't make a bunch of lies on top of a stage about how the game was going to have 16 times the detail or that they would promise that the games content will not be vaulted or that you have to paid for skins with a ton of loot crates or an item shop and use real money. This game literally gives you everything in it without having to spend real-world money and seeing something like this is like seeing a diamond in a dirty road. It's amazing that they put in so much hard work dedication and actually cared for the community then making a bunch of false promises and lies then releasing a barely working game that they would slowly patch overtime into what they promised or at least close enough to it while only caring about how much money they made. The game is pretty good and if any negative comments push you away from the game just ignore the naysayers, they're trying to make any excuse they can to give the game a negative review at this point they'll make a negative review about the game was made on the planet Earth. This game is outstandingly great. I have been playing it and I have not seen any bugs at all or any problems with the game there have been at least one bug that I've noticed with animals that you can ride spawning into each other but that's pretty much it. One thing I will say is the Droid factory in episode 2 isn't well optimized. For frames most of the time I was getting about 120 frames per second on the entire game with no drops on the highest settings but in that one level it went down from 120 to 19 frames per second which kind of sucks but all in all this is a really great game. This isn't something that really needs a strong computer I'm using a computer with 8 to 10 year old parts in it. If you want to get it for a person who played it on the GameCube when they were a kid like me, or if you want to give it to your children as a pass me down to the new generation. This is perfect it was outstanding I love that the developers were underdogs they did so many delays and in the end they were able to make a better game than most AAA titles that come out. It's sad for big companies because it shows how much they are a joke but seeing how these guys were able to make something better than most companies it's amazing and what game has cheat codes in 2022 that's an old blast from the past which is so great"

This is worst in the prequel trilogy, mostly due to the focus on politics, trade agreements, chancellor elections etc.I feel like there's a LOT less building than the original Complete Saga, instead having more combat and puzzles.Hub worlds are pretty big, and you plow through them in such a rapid pace it can be intimidating to even think of how many of the 1100+ Kyber Bricks you missed, not to even mention the minikits and characters hidden throughout story missions.I wish there was proper online co-op, though. Doesn't feel like that's too much to ask in 2022.Classic Lego Star Wars, I have no clue what's going on but I get to beat up lego dudes with a lightsaber.Overall, I'd recommend it if you liked the games of the olden days.

1058,shadow,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nonessentialism/,13,2,0,41.2,April,"17,",162,0,1,"Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a tedious collect-a-thon. With over 300 characters, they’re grouped into a few different classes which now have their own upgrades. Then there’s about 70 or so extra characters which have no upgrades and belong to no class, making them completely useless. The issue is now C3PO can disassemble, so there’s no use bringing along a small character like Young Anakin or Young Boba to crawl inside spaces. Unlike previous Lego games, each character now has their own attack pattern. For example, though Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon Jinn are both Jedi, they swing their lightsabers differently and attack with their own unique patterns. The main upgrades are just the Extras from The Complete Saga like attracting studs, increasing health, and collectible detectors. Class upgrades are barely noticeable, so it’s more useful to save studs for the main core and datacore upgrades which can increase your stud multiplier. But the menu is overly cluttered and annoying to navigate. I accrued a ton of kyber bricks and studs before I wanted to spend them on anything because of the horrible menus.The combat is clearly influenced by Jedi: Fallen Order, which is out of place for a Lego game. There’s unblockable attacks you must avoid, and you can use the force by throwing objects in the environment at your enemy. You can also defend with a lightsaber, or aim with a weapon. The shooting is a problem because the camera is too close with no option to adjust FOV. Enemy health bars are too large so you’ll be shooting without doing much damage. There’s a basic cover system, but it doesn’t matter because the enemies are easy targets who can’t hit you anyway. And with regenerating health, there’s no use staying in cover and playing defensively. The combo system is especially confusing, along with the counter for simple enemies. There’s only one difficulty, and it’s not like Lego games have ever been challenging anyway. Ship combat is great. You can adjust pitch and movement, making piloting a lot easier and enemy lock-on is fast. Acceleration is accrued over time, so you can continue speeding indefinitely.Levels are completely re-worked, but most of the missions now emphasize bosses, and again their health bars encourage basic button mashing since you’ll never fight a boss without a lightsaber. I liked the older style of Lego games where the bosses only had a few hearts requiring one or two appropriately timed hits equally spaced apart. With enough damage dealt, you’ll enter into one of two QTE’s; either you’ll have to constantly mash a button to block, or quickly press a button to counter. Missions don’t encourage cooperative gameplay, either, which is probably why online coop wasn’t included. There’s a few missions such as the aforementioned boss battles where the local co-op partner is just going to stand around doing nothing. Prequel episodes particularly felt rushed, because they emphasize the most bosses out of the entire game. If you hated the Disney sequels, you’ll hate them even more here. It’s better than Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, but not by much. Missions are short because all planets are used as hubs, so instead of revisiting the areas in levels, you explore them in the open world. These hubs are the main focus of the game, and are on every major planet totaling 24 altogether. It’s interesting to explore them for the first few minutes, but the novelty quickly wears off. Hubs are large but empty. There’s characters to interact with in order to acquire missions to unlock kyber bricks, characters, and ships, but each of them are the same between planets. And the loading screens are so numerous you’ll be spending more time loading than actually completing certain missions.  If you’ve completed one planet’s hub, you’ve essentially completed them all. Completionists will feel exhausted, mostly because it seems side missions and activities were included to artificially lengthen a much shorter game, like the developers knew the missions were too short, so they filled the hubs with monotonous extras to make players think there’s more than there really is. I experienced framerate drops in the hub areas, but also in specific missions, as well as black screens and a number of other game breaking bugs.Humor is irritating. There’s a hundred jokes about Anakin’s hatred of sand, and Luke’s love of blue milk. Cutscenes have become sterilized. One of the only reasons to play The Skywalker Saga is for the fully voiced cast, including Billy Dee Williams as Lando and Anthony Daniels as C3PO.The open world hubs don’t motivate me to 100% complete The Skywalker Saga, and despite its many features, most of them are unnecessary or included to lengthen the short missions. I’ll stick with The Complete Saga instead."

I recommend waiting for a sale if you want to play. The game itself is alright, but is definitely missing that classic lego game feel. It's completely missing all of those elements that are present in every single lego game before it that made those games fun and exciting. It's like they are making any other game and putting lego graphics on it. I am not big on the level design so far and the combo system is pretty useless as you can just spam force attacks or grenades. The rebuildable covers you can use in a blaster battle are frankly a nuisance when they get broken because there's so much stuff laying on the ground that needs to be rebuilt and they are also useless when they're intact.  In all of the levels in the game not a single time did I need to hide in a battle. You can easily just run around shooting at the enemies not really even trying to avoid shots and you'll be fine most of the time and honestly I'd recommend doing that as it takes less time than slowly trying to snipe enemies from behind cover. Couple this with spamming grenades/force attacks and you will win. Every time. So yeah, not really worth it in my opinion. It is still a fun game despite it's flaws, so I would still recommend buying it on sale or something, just don't pay 50 euro for it. I might update and clean up this review after playing through more of the game, but for now that was all. PeaceEdit 1: ♥♥♥♥ the endor speeder level, it is ♥♥♥♥, drawn out, boring and buggy and go ♥♥♥♥ yourself if you liked itEdit 2: Bruh general grievous dabs in thisEdit 3: so far pretty much all the levels have sucked ass, except for a few in episodes 1-6 and for some reason the entirety of the force awakens so far has been pretty goodEdit 4: I have now played through all the levels. Most of them are ♥♥♥♥. I generally enjoyed the vehicle levels the most, which is surprising as usually they tend to be the worst. All the levels in the game lack content and feel like only one 4th of a full level. Usually in a lego game a level would have multiple parts to it; different areas, bossfights and puzzles, but this one only has 1 area per level. Sometimes the levels are just really drawn out and repetitive bossfights, which might I mention are in my opinion one of the worst parts of the game."

First of all, the open world is gorgeous, the animations are sick, the graphics outstanding, the diversity of unknown characters is impressive and the humor is great, but almost everything else is mediocre or boring. The game is made for kids; but it's like the game thinks kids have -1 brain cells, because the AI acts completely stupid and basically just stand there waiting for you to kill them. The new fighting mechanic is great, but very repetitive (and useless, because enemies are dead after like 3 attacks, so you can't even complete the combos). The boss fights are all exactly the same and have the same animations/attacks; and if you can't even change your character in freeplay for most of them. The story mode is incredibly boring, rushed and has 0 puzzles, it's either shooting stupid AI or following a character around the map for like 10 minutes, just for some cut scene to portray all the fun stuff from what could've been a level (for example: The battle of Couruscant, the battle of Endor, retaking of Theed). Also, it has been around 1 month from release, and there are some common game-breaking bugs that won't let you continue the game that haven't been fixed. Honestly, really sad and disappointing, because this could've been a really good game, but it cut short in every aspect possible.PD: R2 cannot fly.PD 2: Yoda's death sound is different."

Addition of new levels and feel of the game is great. With that, there are a few problems that makes this game fell off. For starters there is no cantina, probably one of the best parts of the original games. No custom character creation which is pretty disappointing. The levels feel extremely short. I flew through episode one in almost 45 minutes. I remember playing the episodes in the other games for hours on end and having so much fun. Sections that I had so many memories of like the Kamino mission has been cut down to a short walking section and a very easy Jango Fett boss fight.

I don't like the idea of this pastime, but every time I load the game, I forget Star Wars and become addicted to smashing brick for pieces of brick. Story is definitely better here than in the Star Wars films. Make sure to start with episode VII (Force Awakens), as you need to unlock scavenger class abilities with Rey before you can actually use scavenger abilities regardless of progress.

And it’s probably gonna be a very weak review because of that but I'm still gonna try to get my points across. Also, no spoiler warning here because I’m sure everyone who is playing this, has played it, or will play it knows what all happens in Star Wars. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga took all original Lego Star Wars games and completely REVAMPED them with modern graphics, new mechanics, and a BUNCH of new content and features which is all incredibly amazing. However, even with all of this new and amazing stuff, this game to me personally is… Meh? Good at best? It’s honestly a debate between those two opinions and I shall now cover them. The open-world part of this game is fantastic, and I believe it is hands down the best new thing this game has to offer. The ability to go anywhere in the galaxy (as long as you have that area unlocked) at any time? Top notch stuff right there. Each area in this game is very detailed and essentially matches all the areas inside of the movies down to a T. The movement and gameplay with the characters is great and I don’t have any major complaints about it except how they removed and changed how certain characters work. For example, small characters (like Ewoks and young Anakin) used to be the only characters that were able to crawl into vents and access areas. Now, they can’t do that and instead you have to use a droid like C3PO and split him in half to enter the vents now. Why did that have to change? It removed a key feature of the small characters, and has now kinda made the game a bit harder because if you wanna access a certain area, or unlock something that involves a vent, you now have to unlock a droid and enter that mission in free roam. Another feature they removed is how droids like R2D2 were able to fly (or hover) for a short period of time which in the original games would create interesting platform sections and puzzles. In the new game they can’t, and now instead use a grappling hook or something of that sort. Again, why did that have to be removed as well?.. Ship controls can be a bit funky and wonky, especially in co-op mode. In some areas of the game, if you’re in co-op mode, both players are allowed to fly two separate ships (EX: player one could be the Millennium Falcon while player 2 could be an X-wing) which is fine, that's not an issue at all. But what IS an issue however is the other areas of the game where players are forced to share a ship (EX: the mission where you’re going through the planet core in episode I, or in episode V after Han, Leia, C3PO, and Chewbacca escaped Hoth and now have to fight their way past an Imperial fleet of Star Destroyers). One player controls the ship, the other controls the gun(s). To some this may be fine and dandy but to me and my friend who has played this game with me ever since I got it, sections like this are always troublesome and awkward/wonky because of controls. Co-op mode in this game is alright. The only complaint I have about it is the camera which is awful. Why couldn't they make it like it was in the original game where the camera was focused on both characters at all times and if a player happened to be left behind, they would just teleport to the closest character available by player 1, or make it to where if one character wanders off too far, the camera would split HORIZONTALLY and not VERTICALLY LIKE THE GAME ALREADY HAS IT (which by the way, you CAN’T change whatsoever. Unless they added the option to and if that's the case, then this complaint has been fixed) which is terrible in itself. This game pretty much nails down every episode’s storyline down to a T with comedic bits and pieces scattered throughout because it’s a Lego game, every Lego game has its comedic moments. However, with a few of those comedic events, it can sometimes go over the top a bit and somewhat ruin what was a serious scene in the movies (for example, Luke finding out Darth Vader is his father) which isn’t a major complaint, but it can be a bit iffy sometimes- The comedy aspect of it also plays into the awkwardness of the quotes. One example would be the Order 66 quote where Palpitine accidentally said Order 67 (the comedic aspect), and then corrected himself to say Order 66. But when he said this, what was supposed to be a very serious and dramatic event, ended up being an awkward moment of: “Okay.. He said the quote and the line, but all the Clone Troopers are still dancing in the background.. I don’t feel as bad, sad, or shocked at this…” Another example would be when Vader reveals he’s Luke’s father. The scene is perfect, Luke is hanging from the small platform and Vader is looking down at him, the music is playing and a scene of tension is created. Then, the line comes in which shocked everyone around the world, “Luke, I am your father..” and Luke screams and denies the claim. And then all of a sudden it’s ruined entirely by R2D2 coming in and doing his scream which causes the reaction of Vader kicking him off the platform and Luke jumping after him. See what I mean? The quotes are there, and they’re great, but the comedic aspect and sequences of the game ruins the tension, the feels, the suspense, and all those other emotions that the movie gave us when watching it, or for players that are just now experiencing a Star Wars Lego game for the first time. The voice acting in this game is God awful and I despise it entirely. The VA’s for the characters barely show any emotions when speaking in serious/dramatic events. The VA’s don’t put in any effort (or it seems that way) to convey the seriousness of the situation, and the acting is very awkward at a lot of points throughout the game. A lot of the characters sound nothing like they originally did in the movies and the fill-ins or whatever they’re called didn’t do a great job at all when it came to the voice acting of the characters- (And I know what a lot of you all are probably thinking, “What about Leia?” We all sadly lost Carrie Fisher years ago too soon, and I’m 100% willing to give credit where it’s due for the new VA of Leia in this game for she honestly did a decently good job. Also yes, I'm aware that the VA's for the Clone Wars TV series came in for episodes I - III and honestly they didn't do that bad either- Everything else though is total trash). As I finish writing this review, I’ve slowly started to realize that while I enjoy this game by myself, or playing it with my best friend, I can’t seem to find a way to recommend this game to people. This game has its good aspects, and introduces new features and some things that a lot of Lego Star Wars fans have been asking for since the first game came out. But with those good aspects, in my eyes the bad parts of it seem to outweigh the good parts of it- I can click with this game very well, and I enjoy my time playing it with friends, I really do. But with all these negative flaws, after about 30 minutes to an hour of gameplay, I just get tired of it all and go and play something else- Maybe I’m just so used to how all the original Lego Star Wars games are, maybe I’m just hooked on the “nostalgia” trip of the old games that this game gave me when I first played it and it’s causing me to not see this game in its full pride, glory, and fun and I miss how the old games are. I don’t know what the reason is, but whatever it is is causing me to feel this way and feel these things about this game. I guess what you can rule this review down to is a love-hate relationship. If you’ve made it this far in the review, thank you for reading this. It means a lot :)"

Unfortunately, it seems a tad rushed or something.

They are well animated and nice to look at. The ""skill tree"" and upgrade system got some changes. I think it's nice and well thought out.It's pretty much a typical Lego game with no challenge whatsoever. That's fine if you like that sort of thing.The biggest issue I have with this game is just the serious lack of action. Battle sequences just seem they could have been done way better. They are also pretty short. It's pretty disappointing especially when you have a bunch of upgrades that won't add up to a drop of bantha poodoo. You essentially don't need them. It's just around for completionests sake.The maps and scenery is nice. It's more of a collectible game than it is anything else. Finish the stories, and just hunt for stuff. It's not bad, but could have been better obviously.Overall, it's ok. At least it's not a complete disaster, but I was sort of expecting more.

Played the game and I cannot recommend it to someone who was hoping the game brings everything from the old Lego Star Wars games + new content. The game suffers from bugs and glitches which are ranging from texture issues to STORY BREAKING bugs. I encountered such story breaking bug myself, can't finish episode 3 because there is no mission anymore. There is also a story breaking bug in episode 7 which prevents you from progressing further into episodes 8 and 9. Currently there is no fix for those story breaking bugs and you either have to start a new save, on which you can encounter the same issues, or just don't play that episode. Which in some cases mean, don't play an entire trilogy until, eventually, it will get patched. You have 4 or 5 missions per episode which, compared to the old games, is nothing. The game could have been huge, but it feels like they narrowed it down to the ""most iconic moments"" in each episode. Free play just doesn't work in some instances. You have to use the mission's spaceship and can't choose which one you want to ride. But then you can often just switch characters in missions that you didn't enter with free play.There are no big battles like Geonosis, Coruscant, Endor or Crait. Mechanics that you COULD use at the very beginning (at least with the pre-purchase / deluxe character pack) are locked behind progression in the episodes (talking about scavengers)The game hides the fact that characters get killed at all costs (Jango Fett for instance).I really want to love the game, but all those facts combined and high expectations make it at best okay-ish."

When starting this game, I made a decision that I wasn't expecting when getting the game, which was keeping the non-mumble dialogue on. I figured this wasn't going to be a simple remake of the game I played on the Xbox 360, so there's no bother trying to pretend it was. It turns out, this was possibly the best decision I could have made before playing. As noted by most who've played the game by now, the levels aren't in the forefront. This is especially apparent after playing every level, as I have a theory on how they made the levels. It seems they intended on trying to stray away from making their levels look repetitive compared to the original game, so moments that aren't in the original game are spotlighted. For example, one of the levels in Phantom Menace takes place on the battle of Naboo as the Gungans. No level of the retaking, or even leaving, of Theed takes place. Because the levels are much smaller and less important to the gameplay, they can tend to be forgettable or even frustrating. The Force Awakens level Starkiller Queen was easily among the most poorly made boss fight I've seen in a very long time. An incredibly boring and confusing level, a significant portion of the level is finding out what move to make. And not only is the level  far too long and not nearly full enough, it's also horribly buggy.     This game feels as if it was released just a tad too early. Almost no polishing feels done, leading to many bugs. The Starkiller Queen level broke on me a few times while trying to beat it 100% due to a Stormtrooper spawning in a place I couldn't reach, not letting the next sequence continue. Other major bugs occur constantly, and I lost count the amount of times I've crashed after a dozen. (It was well above a dozen times.) Boss fights can also be notably terrible, such as the Canyon Krayt Dragon. Simply adding extra health and making attacks more frequent make for a long boss fight that adds nothing but bland minutes to the game. If the frustrating levels don't tire you, the bugs certainly will.     Over the hours of completion, I felt many of them be filled with impatience and apathy to the screen. But the other 80% of the game is pure bliss. The open world is almost entirely fun, actively rewarding you for exploring as much as you can find. Every world is fun, and it's easy to see that thought was put into the worlds. When playing through the worlds, I also found that the game had an intense charm to it. The cutscenes were hilarious, the character descriptions had jokes in them, even the mission names have delicious puns sprinkled along. And not only are the missions all names, but the level challenges, minikits, races, and even the puzzles are all named. Even the puzzles are named. That means almost every Kyber Brick in the game has a name associated with it.     Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga feels rushed, particularly in the small levels and the absent polish, but the open world (the main portion of the game) and the charm that outmatches even the original game makes it one of the more enjoyable experiences I've had in an open world game. It definitely isn't like the original, and it was a move that made the game much more intriguing than i expected. If the bugs were squashed and a post-game polish was added, I would argue this to a contender for best Lego game of all time. But for now, I will call it the best recent Lego game, and one of the better Star Wars games."

The other Lego games I have are The Incredibles and Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures. The Incredibles is the other one I own that has voice acting. The voice acting is done well, some of the original cast is there, but here they just refuse to have anyone from the movies. The only returning cast actor I know of is Anthony Daniels as C3PO. The voice acting is unnatural, there are annoying walking sections where all you do is walk and talk. Each movie only has 5 levels, which is a little lackluster in comparison to The Incredibles and Indiana Jones, which have 6 levels per movie. When you want to put away your light saber you press E by default, that's the same keybind as a force push so you end up killing your other character(s) instead of putting away the lightsaber. The puzzles here are too repetitive and too easy, except for one level in The Force Awakens. In Lego Indiana Jones there are some puzzles that are genuinely hard to find out the solution to the first time around. The only mechanic that is not repeating in the campaign is detaching C3PO's legs. It's only ever used in the final boss of Revenge of the Sith. Mumble mode is probably one of the worst parts of this game. Not because I prefer dialogue, but the lego games before DC Superheroes were designed for that. This game has terrible lip sync in mumble mode and you have to read the subtitles to know what the heck is going on. The game also offers you a freeplay mode, which is also pretty bad. There are only enemies in space so you will find yourself just walking around and doing the same boring things. The menus are very overcomplicated compared to other lego games and hard to navigate. The game has a capital ships. This is exciting at first, but it's just a cheap way at making it look like you can control the ships but all you can do is just explore them and move them around. The bosses are incredibly bad. Everyone with a lightsaber is the same stuff over and over again. No different animations, nothing! This game's characters have few variations. All of the characters look different, but have few variations of abilities. The characters in The Incredibles and Indiana Jones are more unique and have more variation than the characters in this game. Overall, this game isn't very impressive or the best lego game of all time. But there are some things I can praise it for. The visuals look very nice and have many realistic details of lego minifigures. The characters will have a little bit of sand on them after walking in sandy planets. Also, they made Jar Jar Bink's humor better, while most of the time not rolling around laughing. They also fixed some of the things wrong with the sequel trilogy. My favorite change being removing Rey and Kylo's kiss after the final boss at the end of the game. However, this is not the best lego game of all time like people in the comments of criticisms of this game say it is. Just buy the complete saga, I've seen videos of it and it actually looks fun, but I played this game too much for a refund before I knew it was bad. Lastly, I find it disgusting that Travelers Tales forced their employees to work overtime to make such a terrible game."
1106,AmbiguousOne,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136335723/,1,,1,102.1,June,"15,",105,0,1,"It's ok.The Skywalker Saga brings plenty of new ideas to the lego series. The game brings excellent voice acting and charming traditional lego humor that can be very hit or miss. Hub worlds are massively expansive in both size and number, and the levels often showcase different scenes of the movie than previous games. Even though the massive character roster makes everything fall into a half dozen nearly identical sets of skills, you've got plenty of options for flair. This time around, the majority of the story takes place in the hub worlds, and levels are only introduced for space battles and boss fights, with a few exceptions, at a much shorter level runtime. I rate this positively because the above concepts made for an enjoyable story mode playthrough with some minor hub exploration in between. Once you pass that point, you'll really start to notice the game's major flaws in design. So many minor irritations begin to add up over the course of full game completion. Look ahead to see what isn't great about this one.To start, expect to crash and softlock at least a dozen times, each time in a different way.It'll take you about 2 minutes from startup to actually get in game, almost none of which is a necessary loading screen.Character selection, post-level, and certain other moments do not pause the game, which will lead to you forcibly dying without any opportunity to input.Certain enemies go invincible or have massive damage resistance at awkward times.The upgrade system lets you choose what you want at little cost. Not having the limitations and surprise of  the red power bricks means you'll funnel your upgrade resources into abilities that allow you to become too strong, too fast. A separate list of upgrades allow you to take major powers (score x2, universal translation) or absolute cosmetics at massive prices with no in-between; obviously the cosmetics will end up ignored.The hubs have 30-40 puzzles each, most of which extremely simple, but having the same puzzles in multiple hubs becomes repetitive.Additionally, most of the 700 puzzles have a rumor told by a nearby npc, but having access to a detector so early means you'll end up ignoring those 5 hours of voice lines and just look for the blue circles around your screen.Most characters have their own sidequest before you can purchase them, but once again, they are all very repetitive and hardly unique. There's about 20 of the same smuggle quest where you warp to a small arena to fight off 10 baddies three times in a row. Skywalker Saga is so heavily padded with this type of content, so despite a full completion taking ~100 hours, a lot of it is developer fluff.The levels themselves are far worse, especially for free play. Boss fights are interesting the first few times, but all of them have the same patterns. There's more than a few levels with a permanent alarm blaring the whole time, which can only go away if you remove sound effects entirely. Controller rumble is far too much, especially in space battles that throw 20 enemies all firing on you at once. These game designers were completely against free play exploration - there's many no-return points in every level that have no real reason to be there, which becomes more problematic when you consider this lego game has multiple paths through each level. Even in free play, the game will autolock certain characters for some sequences, forcing you to navigate an already difficult UI screen to return to using the characters you like, if it even lets you. The three challenges they've added to each level sound fun on paper but disturb the pacing of your exploration, since for a lot of them you only get one shot to achieve it.All these small gripes simply make this game less fun than it could have been.If you're a completionist, I recommend The Complete Saga for a much more enjoyable experience. But for everyone else, story mode of The Skywalker Saga will bring you a good time. Just make sure to stop at the end of the story."

1108,The_Cpt_FROGGY,https://steamcommunity.com/id/The_Cpt_FROGGY/,2,,1,28.5,April,"22,","3,023",1,1,"LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ People of my generation were blessed to grow up with one of the most iconic movie trilogies ever made, Star Wars episodes IV, V and VI. And to be young enough to play with the first Lego figurine introduced on the market in 1979. I can still remember the day I received my first Legos set with the astronauts/space figurine as it was Christmas. So, you can imagine my smile when I had the opportunity to play the latest LEGO videogame, LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga! I simply couldn't resist feeling the force again!LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga is an action/adventure and exploration game based on the nine Star Wars movies. The game was developed by TT Games and Published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on the 6th of April 2022 on the Steam platform. The game is also available on Nintendo Switch, PS4/PS5, Xbox One and Xbox One Series X|S.The game consists of all nine Star Wars episodes, which include a faithful reproduction of all nine movies in terms of the story, and each has 5 main missions to complete to finish an episode. Plus, a total of 140 side missions shared between 23 planets. You'll need to talk to NPCs to find these side missions. In addition, the game has a large open world to explore with a massive number of collectables to find. At the time of writing this review, with over 27 hours of gameplay, I have only completed the first 6 episodes of the game, finding on average 30% of all the collectables per episode. There is a tremendous amount of content in this game, which is very impressive. I reckon it will take a few hundred hours to complete the entire game. As you finish an episode, you will unlock the next Star Wars episode, but the episode you completed will become free to play so you can revisit it and try to acquire all the collectables. However, when you launch the game for the first time, only episodes I and IV will be available for you to play. As I am a big fan of the first trilogy, I chose to play episode IV, The New Hope. I was really impressed with the game's fluidity, from the story to the main missions and the Lego brand's humour through fabulous cutscenes. As I finished the first, second and third episodes, my thirst for experiencing the entire Saga became overwhelming. I just had to go through the next three episodes, no matter what! Even after finishing those episodes, instead of going back to collect all the items, I was compelled to play the next one, even though I am not a fan of where Disney is taking this incredible series. But being totally immersed in the game is only one thing. The progression structure is just amazing! You have core upgrades as well as classes upgrades. There are 9 classes in total, and each has 12 upgrades to unlock. Yes, it will cost you a fair bit of studs and a certain number of Kyber bricks each time you do an upgrade, but it will take you quite a while to claim all 1,100 Kyber Bricks. You also have Datacards to find.  They’re not easy to find, but when you do you can unlock very interesting upgrades.And that’s not all! There are stacks of puzzles to do. Some are fairly simple, but others are not easy, especially if you require a specific class/character to complete the puzzle. They are 100's of puzzles in this game. For me, one of the best aspects of the game is the combat system. Each of the classes has its own style, and it is easy to use and extremely fluid for both melee and distance weapons; it is just a joy to play. There is a lot to explore in this game which is another aspect of the game that I absolutely love.The graphics and animations are sensational. In terms of soundtrack, it is always a treat to listen to the Imperial March. Voice-overs and sound effects are really entertaining and true to the original movies. The gamepedia is easy to access and full of content. It's a game that you can leave, come back to when you feel like it, pick up where you left off and keep enjoying it over and over again. If you are a fan of Lego and the Star Wars series, you have to play it to experience it.I did have a few issues. Not too many, but I had to restart the game a few times as it froze while launching a cutscene. Not a big deal, but nonetheless annoying. You can play with your keyboard, but I recommend the gamepad for this one. You can play single player or co-op on the same computer if you have two gamepads (or one person on the keyboard) or via the remote play Steam feature. Positives:~~~~~~~ +	Sensational graphics, soundtrack and sound effects+	True to the movies and with an abundance of Lego Humour +	100s of characters and ships to unlock+	Well-structured progression system, both for the core play and classes+	Jam-packed with content (side missions and collectables)+	Thorough gamepedia+	Easy to play, extremely addictive and huge replayability+	AchievementsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	No trading cards as yet-	I experienced a few freezes with cutscenesIt’s a Saga like no other!

1109,BuckyKat,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cozmicone37/,3,,0,100.4,August,"9,",206,0,1,"I wish I could recommend this game, as the visuals are great and it’s fun to roam about different areas from the Star Wars universe, but unfortunately it has too problems and there are frequent frustrations that previous Lego games didn’t have.MAIN STORY AND OPEN-WORLD CONTENTUnless you’re going for 100% completion and all 45 achievements, this game likely isn’t going to take long. While there are 45 main story missions to play through, as there are five story missions for each of the nine movies, there were far too many story missions that can be completed in just a few minutes. There are a few levels that can take a bit to complete like Episode VII’s “Reap what You Solo” mission where you’re switching between two character parties and solving puzzles along the way to advance. There are also a few levels, like Episode VI’s “Boarding Party”, that are a decent length in story more but then allow for more playtime during freeplay mode as selectable characters with specific abilities can unlock new areas to explore, but there aren’t many levels built this way. Finally, there are quite a few extremely short levels, like Episode VIII’s “Dameron’s Definance”, where you can easily finish it in under five minutes.While it’s not unusual to spend less time in the main campaign of a Lego game than it is collecting everything the game has to offer, going for full completion is going to take a significant amount of time. You have the normal 100% completion for each level, collecting characters and kyber bricks on each planet and planet space, but the most amount of time will be spent simply spent traveling to other planets performing fetch quests. This shouldn’t be bad, but the traveling will begin to weigh on you as you’re really just waiting for the planet’s areas to load.THE NEW CAMERA AND ACTION PROMPTSThe new over-the-shoulder camera does allow for a better feeling of being each character, but it also introduces a problem with receiving prompts corresponding to objects and actions. In previous Lego games, when your character was in range of a jump/grapple point or an object they could interact with, a prompt would appear simply because they were in the range of it. Now it’s a combination of your distance to the object and if the camera can see it. There are frequent moments where you can be under a grapple point but because you can’t get the camera to look directly up at the point you won’t get the prompt to grapple to it. This requires you move farther away from the wall or ledge in order for it be in view of the camera.A similar problem exists with objects specific to Jedi powers. If the object is above or below you and even if the camera can see it, you will spend some time trying to reposition your character so you’re in the right range to grab the object. The difficulty is not knowing if you’re too close or too far away from objects so you’ll be spending a little time moving towards and/or away attempting to find where you have to be in order to grab the object. There are also moments where you’ll be approaching the object, the prompt will appear, so you stop moving but then the prompt disappears. In moments like this I found that rotating the camera a little will sometimes get the prompt to then appear, but it generally resulted in moving my character around in order to find a place where the prompt would finally appear again.DROPPING WITH GRAPPLING HOOK CHARACTERSAn additional frustration with the jump/grapple points is the inability to drop from a hanging point when using a character that has a grappling hook. When playing as a non-grappling hook character you can press a button to let go of a jump/grapple point which allows you to drop down. When playing as a grappling hook character the drop button is used as the grapple button. While it is possible to jump away from the jump/grapple point, it only occurs if you can manage to only have the grapple prompt on screen which can be difficult because most jump/grapple points are so close together that the jump prompt is almost always available.While the first jump grapple point will generally be a grapple prompt, the game has you jump up to almost all higher or next points but grapple down or back to previous points. This really doesn’t make sense but is why it’s difficult to jump away. If you do manage to jump away from the jump/grapple point, you’ll generally land back on the same jump/grapple point as you will jump up above the point and then land right back on it again.CHARACTER SWITCHINGAnother big change is how you switch characters. Instead of a large on-screen grid showing all the characters in the game, they’re now grouped into different types such as Jedi, Scavengers, and Scoundrels. In previous games this categorization had been fairly easy to navigate as you could switch between the groups by pressing a button and the different types of characters would light up in the grid. Character switching now seems to be needlessly complex.To switch to get a character in a different group, you have to bring up the character select menu, and either move over characters in the current group until you reach the group navigation or press the back button to go directly to the group navigation, scroll up to down to the new group, move to the right into that group’s character grid, and then navigate across characters until you reach the character you want. Because of this major change to the character selection process, it takes far longer to select a different character than it ever used to.While I did say that characters are grouped into types, there is a group that does show you an entire roster of all the characters together but you can’t see every single character on screen at once. You’re also unable to sort or highlight specific character types so if you currently have Anakin Skywalker selected, it’s going to take a decent amount of scrolling to get to Wedge Antilles.OBJECT LOCATION ARROWSIn an attempt to help you keep track of the location of objectives, mission specific enemies and collectables in relation to your character, arrows appear around the sides of the screen. The arrows always point to an object and as you turn and move the camera the arrows will generally rotate around the edge of the screen as a way to help you understand where the object is in relation to the camera. This would likely be great if you only played in an overhead perspective. It becomes difficult in understanding this information in three-dimensional spaces and the game has issues with the arrows jumping around depending on where the object is and the direction the camera is facing.For instance, there isn’t a simple way to know if an arrow at the bottom of the screen is indicating that an object is behind you, below you, or possibly both. Rotating around the character won’t change the position of the arrow if the object was both below and behind you. As you clear out these objects it becomes easier to figure out where objects are, but when you are initially entering a new level and you have 30+ arrows on the screen because you’ve unlocked and enabled the Collectible Detector 3 in the upgrade tree, it’s very difficult to follow just one specific arrow to understand where that object is.This issue is further complicated when you’re flying and need to destroy enemy ships. An arrow that points to a ship can be difficult to find if it’s circling around behind you as you’re also trying to turn towards them. In these types of encounters the difficulty is in trying to figure out where the other ship is rather than difficulty in trying to shoot it down."

It's also surprisingly buggy for a game delayed by two years, somehow after all that time it still wasn't ready for launch.EDIT: i have finished the OT and it's only gotten worse, wish I could get a refund but by the time you realize just how bad it is it's too late"

While it's nice to see a multitude of characters, it becomes overwhelming very fast, you beat a level only to be flooded with 8 characters unlocked, some of which you've not played in the level. The puzzles are painfully bland, in just about every mission the only puzzles that exist are panels in which are either slow, or annoying to control because of a pause between actions. The charm that previous LEGO games had during the levels in practically gone, cut scenes still have them which is nice, but there's no fun animations or surprises to really be found during gameplay. Level design is horrendous, levels are either way too short, or way too long, there's no good in-between, and a majority of it is just a walking simulator, as well as constantly light-speed jumping to other planets, or taking a vehicle to different parts of the map in a long boring back and forth. Dark side characters are boring cause the only distinct thing about them is that using the force on someone is changed into a force choke (I've later discovered Palpatine has the ability to use lightning. This is still pathetic as it's a melee and not actually a beam like older games). Character specialties are boring and annoying because in free play rather than being able to do multiple things with a character that is later in the franchise, you have to switch back and forth from different characters. An example of this is Rey.. Lets say a free play puzzle has a net puzzle, some lightsaber parts, and a grapple part.. If you were to use Rey only, you would have to switch between 3 different versions because even though an episode 9 version of Rey has been through the previous situations and episodes, doesn't matter cause right now you're playing Yellow lightsaber Rey who doesn't know ♥♥♥♥. The removal of character abilities being gained through progression just makes everything tedious and is an excuse to shove more characters into the game for no reason, of which a majority of characters is just different clothing. DLC characters are very lacking, sure it's fun to have access to more characters but also there is hardly unique dialogue, interactions, or abilities. I bought the Deluxe Edition for $60, and have only played a few DLC characters once, and that was to look at them. The removal of a custom character creator makes the creativity and fun of it, there is something so exciting and fun to be able to mix and match character parts to make a unique character, and that being removed really brought it down for me, other than the disappointing nature of the game itself. UI is clunky and distracting, it constantly gets in the way, the combo meter can be fun sometimes but it's really unnecessary. Combat is fine, just the barricade system is useless and dumb, they break after like 2 hits, and serve no purpose other than to save you 2 shots that don't entirely matter.I know this review is all over the place, but overall... the game is bland, boring, and a waste of time, watch someone play it on YT if you're really that interested. If I could get a refund I would, but I spent so much time hoping and praying that even after a painstakingly dreadfully long ascend to 100% I would like the game, but I don't.. Uninstalled after 100% cause what else is there to do, nothing is really fun."

They had a great concept here and they seemed to just get lazy about it. This game is so damn repetitive and I get that its a collectathon most of the time but throw more variation in; I don't want to play the same minigame or whatever 20 times in the same game to get the same reward just because it's in a different area of the game. Overall I don't think its worth the money at all, if you can get it half off go for it then"
1130,Enemy of the People,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088084847/,5,,0,30.7,May,"6,",376,0,1,"Game is a mess from a technical standpoint, which only detracts from the experience. And the experience itself isnt all that great to begin with. And now they are announcing DLC without patching the game for a month since release. So, they went for the Mario Odyssey-like approach to collecting stuff. Dozens of short missions in every location. Smaller rewards instead of big milestones. Means a single brick is meaningless in a long run, besides getting that 100%. Not my cup of tea, but a matter of preference. Open worlds themselves are fine, although a little glitchy. Character controls are fine, although camera is awful especially when aiming weapons. Menus are the absolute worst, slow and awful to navigate. Having to hold buttons to confirm something is some of the worst user experience you can go for. And there is a LOT of menuing. How you play the game is also allright. Its quite slow as they swapped normal actions into QTEs that are tied to animations, meaning climbing went from jump-jump into press B, wait for the animation to finish, press B. Takes about three times as long, and is less fun. Just why. The combo system is fine, controls are a bit iffy because animations are a mess but it does its job. Shooting is fine, although lacks weight behind shots. Presentation is great. Sometimes the scenery makes me want to stop and just admire it for short few moments. And whenever the designers utilize the LEGO assets as replacements its charming and fits well. The music is John Williams, enough said. The problems start with the voice acting. I dont know if its because they wanted to get additional lines to fit the writing, or because (((Disney))) forced them to rewrite history before their buyout, but multiple characters have been redubbed. You dont hear Harrison Ford as Han Solo, you hear that le Marvel ecks dee dude from that movie noone watched. The advertised Mumble mode wouldve fixed that problem, but it doesnt work......and thats just the tip of the iceberg. Mumble mode despite being the only saving grace from not hearing mr.no-charisma every 5 seconds, completly breaks the game. Cutscenes might not progress, scripted sequences might softlock, you might not get written dialogue. And the game is riddled with glitched like that. Doing the smuggling missions in space? Prepare to get spawned INSIDE the model of your capital ship. Dogfighting in space? Enemy markers disappear, have fun looking for BLACK fighters on SPACE background. Models disappearing? Objects breaking on their own? Random long loadtimes? Yep, its all there. And more.If you're gonna buy it, do it on sale. And wait for patches. And dont get the completly pointless DLC with disneyverse characters noone cares about. Its an allright game, but i'd play the originals over this any day of the week. Its a muddled mess with some redeeming factors but a lot of things that just piss you off which culminates in you closing the game and going to play something else. Or watching paint dry, at least you dont roll your eyes because of the voice acting."

1140,Drosophila Melanogaster,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007775522/,6,,0,33.1,January,23,183,0,1,"Ok I would never recommend anyone pay full price for this game. I got it on sale for $25. That is fine, it is worth $25. It is not worth 50 or 60 or whatever the regular price is. It is SO GLITCHY. And that is even more inexcusable knowing they delayed this game three or four times .... to do what, exactly?? THE BADGlitches I have experienced after doing episodes 4-6:Darth vader just froze during a battle so I had to restart the levelCrashes when triggering an explosionTried to open a weapons cache at the top of a set of stairs while on the stairs and my character got stuck in the running animationStuff blowing up when it isn't supposed to, or not blowing up when it is supposed toThis game is also super hand-holdy. Expect an on screen prompt about what button to press every time you need to grab a switch, use the force,  or build something. You are not smart enough to figure out or remember that the jumping bricks mean you should build. You will get this reminder forever. All of the movement when you are doing anything other than walking around feels so weird. Flying feels weird although it is better than the previous game because now you have 3 axes of movement instead of two. But flying is jank. Speeder bikes are jank. Being in the AT-ST is jank. There are so many things i am shocked didn't get fixed for QOL. When you are in the AT-ST every time another AT-ST shoots you, your vehicle jerks and the camera snaps around to the center. Why?Why is the camera so far up my backside when I'm running around? It took forever to get used to this and makes it hard to see where studs are going when I blow stuff up, because they are behind me and I CAN'T SEE. I walked backwards into a lot of pits at first. I was getting stuck in corners in corridors and the camera was going nuts, all over the place.I have not finished the game by any means but should I really be 60% done with Episode V when I sped through it to finish the store and didn't make an effort to get any collectibles in particular? Plus there are only 5 minikits in each level now instead of 10. No red bricks. This game is all about the collectibles. LEGO Lord of the Rings had a fully open world with 10 chests in every level. They are also cheating a bit by having True  Jedi split into segments and that giving you three Kyber bricks just for getting True Jedi.Padding. You now have to do a minigame every time you want to use a wall panel. Why is  this? Were we really upset before about just pressing E and waiting one second? it is so boring. The little minigames don't require any thought or skill. They are just there to artificially lengthen the game.THE GOODThis game is so funny. I have seen people saying it doesn't ""feel right"" because of the voice acting but I think this one is funnier than the last one. And I didn't think it was too obtrusive or in your face. The voice actors are very good approximations of the real characters and you will probably barely notice unless you just got done watching the films. There is more ""stuff"" to do. You can do Jedi mind tricks, for instance,  which is full of chaotic possibility. You can throw your lightsaber. Combat is still too simple to be interesting but it is way better than the endless button spam of the previous one. Moving stuff with the force is better because you can move things any way you want and throw objects to fight instead of like before where objects moved in a predetermined way.QOL improvements. C3PO no longer does a painful shuffle. R2D2 has fighting abilities. Your companions damage other enemies and do not just charge blindly into danger although you'll have to do much of the fighting yourself. The flying levels are way better; they took the worst stuff from the  old game and improved it.VERDICT: Do not buy at full cost. I'm going  to beat it but then I'm probably just going to replay LEGO LOTR again because that game rules.EDIT AFTER BEATING STORY: So I played through all 9 episodes in story mode and absolutely nothing in my mind has changed other than that I think this game really shines in the side content. There are some truly delightful side missions in this game that I think most people are going to miss because they're going to get bored. Notably the achievement you get for finishing all the episodes is only owned by 19% of players. Less than ONE IN FIVE players finished story mode in this game and it's been out for a long time. What do you think the percentage was on the original? more than that. One of my friends pointed out that the reason why I hate this game is that there is no platforming and he is correct. Gameplay is entirely ""run to this glowing light, press buttons, run to this one."""

The Complete Saga was just a very fond childhood memory of mine on the PS2. And this one would probably create another good memory for me. Its visual is stunning, and the gameplay was a massive improvement; there’s actually something to it rather than just spamming buttons. My only minor complain I have for the game is the fact that its comedy was sometimes too over the top(?) I was a big fan of the subtle humour in the Complete Sage back in the day with the mumble voice, which yes, I am aware there’s an option for that here, but still. Other than that though, this game was not only a fantastic nostalgia trip, but also a very well-crafted game with lots of love put into it. 9/10"

Imma keep this short though.1: The game has awful optimization. I can't use a controller no matter what I try to do. No matter what, my leftward movement is disabled.2: The DLC is a deceptive cash grab. There's unfortunately no additional levels in these DLC's, unlike Lego TFA, and the characters that included HAVE NO VOICE LINES, unlike the entire base game cast. Even the special extra characters like Sith Rey had a bunch of funny voice lines. For a franchise that forced voiced characters in their games so many times, having the DLC miss that is ridiculous. All they had to do was rip lines from the films and shows they were based on, but they were somehow too lazy to do that.3: Only around 1/2 of each film is replayable. The rest of the film is experienced in a one-off exploration sequence that can't be replayed. A lot of the most iconic parts of the films aren't in the levels either. What's more, these levels aren't even of a superb quality, they're only a bit better than the Batman 3 and Marvel Superheroes levels, and those were terrible.Overall this game isn't bad, but there is questionable quality and consistency. The sequels unexpectedly shine here, because the dialogue jokes about the flaws of the films, but without being weird and cringey, like some Reddit user. They also succeed tremendously in pointing out the high points of them.I absolutely wouldn't buy this on PC though. The trend of Lego games sucking on PC is unfortunately continuing with this entry. The fact that they fail to have proper controller support for a game designed to be played with one is unacceptable."

What you get is a cluttered mishmash of both and a clunky UI. The game wants you to explore, find side missions and lego pieces, build out your talent tree, talk to other characters, etc., but then essentially annoys you into progressing the story line. There's a constant feeling that you're racing against the clock. Want to try to stay with the Gungans and explore? Well you have Jar Jar yelling in your ear that we need to go, ""Disa way!"" and a bright spark guiding you every 5 ft towards your main objective. Nothing from the RPG aspect is straighforward. Because you are constantly being directed to work on your main objective, you don't get the time to familiarize yourself with your glorified Smart Watch, which makes the game extremely clunky and an overall headache. Don't even get me started on the absurd camera angle or the sloppiness of the controls."

I believe it to be one of the best starwars games and the best Lego games.

Instead you have a main menu kinda thing but other than that I love it the open world is immersive and there’s a lot you can too sometimes it’s overwhelming. To those wondering the clone wars and rebels shows are not in the game it’s only the movies so if you wanted those characters you won’t get them AT LEAST RIGHT NOW maybe they’ll add them in a DLC later. The jokes are great too anyone who has starwars knowledge will get them and they aren’t too much. I love the game if you like Lego games grab this one"

They have the funny.Puzzles? Garbage, mostly just using panels or moving an object into place and spamming a button. Dark side doesn't exist in this game.Parkour? Nonexistent, you have to look at something and press a button.Combat? Actually quite nice, unless you start to progress. If you continue to progress, you will do less and less combat.Aerial combat? quite bad, just fly and shootBosses? All the same, either shoot or spam lightsaber attacks or get out of the way. Darth Maul was the best fight because it worked in 2 player and because it was the first boss fight.Character Roster? Too much, and the categorized characters are just too similar to each other. Jetpacks and gliders are too short, and many characters like mandalorian characters and dark side characters just don't have the abilities that they should. For example, many dark side characters that should have had lightning just don't have it for some reason, and no mandalorian character has any gun other than their blasters.Collectibles? Too many of them, and some upgrades are just too expensive and not worth it.Upgrades? Many of the great and original upgrades from the clone wars and TCS video games were scrapped, and the new ones can't even be obtained in levels. Fun upgrades like dual wielding, super speeders, actually fun super gonk, and dark side were completely scrapped.Multiplayer? Horrible, not only does this game not have online multiplayer, but the second player's (my) gameplay is honestly insulting in most levels. Usually, the only thing I can do is do the chores while the first player defeats the boss.Final Review: Boring; don't buy this game unless you really like star wars or lego, or have some sort of nostalgia. It looked and felt good at first, but the moment that I started thinking about it, I just found this game kinda boring."

The detail is amazing and everything is made with care.- Gameplay is fun but don't expect too much out of it. It is kept quite limited.- The combat feels great! Especially the lightsabers.- Vehicles are... Barely existent. I still recommend the game 100%. Especially if you have a friend or partner to play it with.If you want to play it with an online friend, either use the Steam Together feature or whatever it's called, or use Parsec Gaming.

Because this game is freaking good to the point where dare I say ""price it in any way possible?"" -- and when I mean good; I mean in sheer scope, volume, dialogue, and visuals. There is literally so much to do in this game that it is baffling that crunch was needed to make this game. I mean hello?! side activities? SIDE QUESTS?! so much exploration in a sandbox area it is truly baffling and will be baffling on any point or entry in the saga. And also let me just say on the record that this game alone has made the prequel and sequel trilogy much more tolerable to watch (no joke). There are only two downsides that might actually affect your opinion on the game 1) No online co-op. Yup, we are couch co-op baby! And ummm it's a bit ♥♥♥♥. Like no joke, the split screen becomes so intolerable that you really want to go full on ""I AM THE SENATE"" mode.2) Crunch. Let it be said that no developer in the world should have to undergo this just to make a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ video game; and this is also why games shouldn't announce themselves ahead of schedule just to delay or ramp up development just to get it on the store shelf. Yes, you might be sick of hearing it- but it is fundamentally important to understand that the developers are people too! Not the suit & ties who ball and chain them into oblivion."
1220,pipo monkey,https://steamcommunity.com/id/apeescape2/,2,,1,37.2,April,"6,",562,0,1,"after finishing the prequel trilogy, this game is pretty much everything i wanted. a humorous, condensed way to experience the star wars films with large explorable planets and ships. maps aren't as big as i quite imagined, but they're large enough to be enjoyable for me. combat is shallow but flashy enough to be really fun, difficulty is easy making this a great game to turn my brain off for a few hours and de-stress. upgrade system is fun to play around with and space combat is actually fun suprisingly. if you're expecting a game like the complete saga or lego batman with linear, 20 - 30 minute levels, you might be disappointed with the game but if you love other lego games like lego batman 2 and lego marvel, you'll love this as this feels like a true evolution of those games rather than a slight improvement like they have been for a while. as of writing this (day after launch), there are some technical issues but nothing game ruining imo. there are certain levels that have serious performance issues due to driver issues (droid factory in episode 2 especially) and one time a screen effect would not leave my screen until i closed out of the game but aside from those, the game has been running perfectly for me and i have encountered no crashes. hopefully the driver issues and other minor bugs like what i mentioned will be patched out soon. i will be playing through the og and sequel trilogies soon and i expect to have good fun with those too given my first impressionstl;dr great game but whether or not you like it will be up to what you're looking for. if you want a linear game like tcs you're gonna be dissapointed, but if you wanted lego batman 2/lego marvel with a star wars skin and massive gameplay overhaul, you'll be in for a great time."

The exploration aspect is truly amazing, but, to be fair, it is not all that matters.     The previous games did a great job at telling the whole story, and this game is lacking in that aspect. An important event, the destruction of planet Alderaan, is not shown in the game, as well as the Hosnian Cataclysm in Episode VII. Also, some deaths are portrayed in a goofy way. It is evident that this has to do with the political correctness, and sometimes it does exactly the opposite of what the developers expected. Some of the most grim scenes are depicted in a humorous way, giving it an antipathetic approach, which doesn't conveys the emotions that the movie and the original games (despite the absence of dialogues) reflected and which is capable of harvesting insensibility among children and consumers in general. I believe this is very common in nowadays content.      For me, the story is one of the most important, if not the most important, aspect of a game and this game is not loyal to the source material in many occasions. In some of them it feels very rushed. And let's not talk about DLCs, which don't have any level related with the additional characters.      Regarding technical aspects, the game does a great work for most of the time. However, there are some very annoying issues such as: low fps in certain levels, unresponsiveness in combat and some interface problems related with the minimap. If games nowadays are not capable of delivering at the moment of release due to the complexity of their nature, we should really go back to the time when we had simpler games with no bugs at all.      In general, I have enjoyed the game, but, as you just read, there are many things that I wish were different. LEGO games used to be better when they didn't have high ambitions.     Edit: Overall, this game is better than its predecessor. A while a go I gave The Complete Saga a run and realized that the episodes here are longer. Additionally, some events are not portrayed in The Complete Saga. However, the fact that important events are not playable is truly disappointing. I just discovered that you can't play the destruction of Death Star II. Draw your own conclussions.     So, in order to get a complete experience of LEGO Star Wars and the Skywalker saga in general, I recommend to play The Skywalker Saga, LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens and The Complete Saga. The latter won't take more than 10 hours and will fill the gaps that this game has."

The graphical changes are absolutely stunning with this game being far ahead of any other LEGO game before it with a gorgeous open world and great attention to detail.My only current quarrels with the game are that the Droid Factory mission in the Attack of the Clones is incredibly laggy and jittery which I believe to be an issue for everyone despite what graphics card they have. Additionally it would be nice to have a character customiser, which has been present in almost every other game before.But if you can't tell I'm absolutely in love with this game, and there is still more content to come in the form of DLC packs later down the line. No matter who you are or what type of games you enjoy, LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has something for you, trust me."

1245,Nerd Of The Force,https://steamcommunity.com/id/NerdOfTheForce/,3,,1,56.2,April,"6,",662,0,1,"So far I finished one episode and did a few side missions. But I have to say, while i'm still learning the controls a bit and am still getting a feel of all the game mechanics, as well as the skill sets, I am blown away by how much you are able to do in this game. Everything is laid out very nicely and neat so you can choose skills and characters, the side missions are pretty neat and enjoyable, the combat system is also one thing i'm really loving a lot of, the humor in here is far superior compared to other lego games, and the amount of freedom you have to go to different planets and SOOOO many different places on said planets is what makes the ambiance in this game breathtaking, beyond the beautiful views and graphics. This truly dose in fact have EVERYTHING you could ask for within a Star Wars trilogy based game without a doubt.I feel the ONLY thing that kinda made me a little off edge of the game was the fact that the guidance system within the game feels a little low ended for me personally, as if I have to smash and slash up everything to find clues, unlike older lego games. However, I do believe it was intended to be that way so it may just be something I have to personally get used to. But beyond that, I would also say while cutscenes are story for story missions and you get to play more of them then what you could in 1-6, I do feel they are somewhat shorter then I was expecting. Quite a bit of Episode I for me consisted of walking around instead of hacking and slashing up droids or doing objective based stuff. I can't judge the final episodes I have yet to play so they could be different, but that's just a little something I noticed.Beyond the small cons, the pros overwhelm them without a doubt with all you can do within this game. I'm looking forward to putting A LOT of time into this and beating everything within it. This is the first AAA title I have ever bought that made me happy right off the bat. Way to go on this one WB! You have me sold! The ONE thing that I personally think would make this game FULLY complete is if they add in a Clone Wars DLC pack, or even story missions. That would be amazing!!! Hope and pray though! For now, I am happy!"
1246,Dune Tiger,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dunetiger/,3,1,1,47.5,March,19,"5,288",1,1,"I think I've got enough under my belt now to see how the rest of this is going to play out.  Yes, at 20+ hours, I'm saying ""the rest of this"" because this game is massive.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say that it's excessive, but to be fair, that ultimately depends on whether you're a completionist or not.  The game covers all 9 mainline movies and as to be expected with TT's Lego games, there's tons of secrets, gags, and just  to discover and if you want  of it then I suggest you get real comfortable because it is a haul.  I say that as the 20ish hours I'm sitting at right now covered only one trilogy to 100% but let's not get carried away - most of that time was spent in the hub worlds between missions.  That said, if you're the type to value your games by how many hours you get out of them, then consider yourself in the best game ever? Let's break it down.I am not the biggest fan of TT's Lego series despite having played most of them and what I mean by that is that I do not leap at the chance to get the latest and greatest one and spend two weeks getting them to 100%.  I pick them up as add-ons whenever sales come rolling round because yeah, they're a good time.  I play them when I want something mindless and casual, but they're not something I look forward to.  Part of the reason for this is that none of the titles have ever held a candle to the original two Star Wars games now bundled as the ""Complete Saga"". The closest they came, in my opinion, were the two Harry Potter games. So rather than focus on how much this game  the Complete Saga, the only comment I'll make on that front is that if that's what you're looking for, it's not here.Skywalker Saga is a different design philosophy than what came before it as TT has been really trying to find a way to refresh the formula and it's not all that bad. Rather than having a tiny preparation hub and a string of long missions to explore, this one flips it around with shortened levels and massive ""hubs"", if you can call them that.  More accurately, these aren't hubs as much as they are mini worlds to explore as they change based on the movie you're going through and some are even multi-staged.  Each film gets about 4-5 story missions that run about 10-15 minutes each with the standard mini-kit hunt among other collectables, connected by a themed in-between that is freely explorable without a time limit. For example, A New Hope is initially linked together by a sprawling Tattooine as an interstitial location to explore; in other words, you'll go relive a key segment of the movie, then you're dropped back off on Tattooine before you hit up the next mission.What results is that the game feels more focused on open-world exploration with the story missions feeling like the sideshow rather than the other way around.  For some who are looking for more action and set-pieces, this can be a disappointment.  For others, it can be the perfect casual jaunt... sort of.  The thing is, like most open-worlds, these huge maps that sit between the missions often feel rather empty.  The goal here is to uncover all of its secrets, picking up special bricks, unlocking characters and/or vehicles or simply farming Lego studs to buy a multitude of powers, abilities, 'cheats', or hints. You do this by solving puzzles or figuring out how to get to places you can't normally get to (which is a puzzle, of course) and that's all well and good, but there's nothing else to do other than collecting stuff. There is so much potential to make these segments feel alive, but it's mostly just running across tons of space to get to the next little secret section.  On the other hand, there are TONS of these little things to solve and collect and if you've always leaned more towards that than the platforming or the combat or the visual gags, then maybe this is exactly what you're looking for. I admittedly enjoy it to a certain extent, but man, I'm spending most of my time secret hunting instead of anything else and it feels... kind of unbalanced.The story levels themselves are as familiar as can be, of course. You're dunked into some recognizable part of the movie you're going through and there's tons of secrets to collect here, as well. More importantly, there are level challenges to complete, but you don't know what they are unless you buy them in the menu (or you can look them up, but that's irrelevant). Even with abilities that show you where the secrets are, you're still sure to miss out on several until you come back in free play, so it's all the same stuff you've seen before. It's the challenges that I find annoying because you have to collect studs and buy them just to know what to do. It's negligible after you unlock stud multipliers, of course, but it's still a very weird idea. It's by no means a deal breaker, but suffice to say that the real philosophy at play is ""thou shalt grind."" It's always been a part of the Lego franchise, but this feels turned up to 11.On the technical side, the game runs smooth for the most part with maybe some odd places where the frames drop (2080Ti for me), but there are several little bugs littered throughout that you'll encounter like toons not doing what they're supposed to be doing, UI/UX glitches, and just unexpected random things. The most glaring bug is sometimes the game just hangs when transitioning between scenes - it induces anxiety any time I want to walk through a door to an interior location and back out again.  Sometimes it hijacks your foreground so if you don't have the skills to kill the game through a cmd prompt while effectively blind, then a hard reboot might be your only solution.All said and done, whatever this game lacks in heart (and it really feels like it's missing something) it makes up for in excess. There are hundreds of characters to unlock. Tons of ships to unlock. Minikits out the wazoo to collect. Challenges to complete. Worlds to explore. Dogs and cats living together! It's at times both fun and boring, exciting and mundane, and eh, the humor is kinda weak this time around, but whatever. Franchise fans may be divided on where it sits in the Lego pantheon, but it's still a solid Lego game nevertheless and if it's your or your children's first one, you're going to love it because despite its licensing, it's still a game first and a movie a very distant second. If you enjoy PLAY, then I think this is something anyone can sink their teeth into and have a good time."

1259,Fixx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFixx/,1,,1,65.2,April,"26,",598,0,1,"My opinion is a mixed bag On this one. I kind of recommend it as it is fun but it has SO MANY issues.With my hours and completion rate (100%) I feel I have a decent opinion.It is a fun game with good writing if you're happy with lego-style. Namely lots of puns, references, and dumb jokes. The campaign I think is worse than the original games this is combining. There is a decent bit cut or squashed there.I really do enjoy the hub worlds though. Lots of things to do and as a completionist this worked very well for me. The missions/puzzles can be somewhat repetitive though.Now for the bad. There are a LOT of bugs/things that come from a bad port. Not entirely surprising.- I have a ""double keyboard setup"" that being my typing keyboard and my G13 for gaming. Whichever one is used first in the splash screens to skip will be the one the game sees. The other will be invisible (no input) until the game is restarted.- The Ewok village level has so many memory leaks that I have to transition zones once every 2min or so to stop from wanting to die (My PC is dumb strong so its not my hardware)- There is a collectable tracker ability in the game. Often it will show the effect in an area with no collectable. After a while I am fairly sure that these fake spots are possible (0,0,0) of the map and those fake collectables are actually the ones given by side quests. I didn't truly confirm but usually when I'd do a quest that's when I'd notice those fake spots disappearing- The game has a camo mechanic. So if I play as Jango Fett the ""bad guys"" won't attack me/be my enemies. (I always am playing either jango or a sith). If you are in this camo when a quest requires a space battle the enemy fighters will not be enemies, instead your allies will be. I understand why this happens due to the camo's programming but there should be code for these edge cases. There is no situation where killing your allies you must protect is the right thing for that camo to do.- Space flight with a mouse is terrible. If you move the mouse too far you will be semi-locked in your turn. My guess is its another port problem with the mouse exceeding the -1 to 1 bounds that analog stick input tends to be bound to.- When I was doing the last cleanup of things like the mouse droids there are cases where there are 2 targets on 1 planet but I already had 1. The quest indicator (since I was tracking the task) would not point to the one I was missing but instead the one I already got. IE it brought me to the wrong place.There were probably more bugs but I'm tired and forgetful.Overall I enjoyed my time with it even with frustration which is why I recommend it.4/7If you just want the campaign it's probably more of a 5/7"

The amount of stuff to do in this game is honestly kinda overwhelming at first but once you get used to the mechanics, you wish that this was like all LEGO game you played as a kid. This is everything I wanted out of this game and far far more. My only problem with the game, it looks like and feels like this game was made totally for use with console/controller. There are several bugs on the PC version of this game, for example; black screen when loading sometimes, infinite load screen, fights sometimes just stop working for a few seconds and have weird jump cut bugs that you know are not part of the game. These are not game breaking bugs but there ones that I have encountered. I would rate this game 1166/10 Kyber bricks."

1268,LYNESTAR,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LYNESTAR/,2,1,0,99.3,October,"6,",150,0,1,"This is one of the worst LEGO games I have played.What I didn't like:Characters sorted into categories, leaving no unique-ness to each character. What I love about previous LEGO character is that you can unlock certain that can do an assortment of different things. In this game, you pick a single character from each character class and that's it. You can just use those exact same characters for the rest of the game, and sometimes you're forced to use the character in each mission from story mode during certain scenes, TT! MY BROTHERS IN CHRIST! I WANT TO FIGHT GRIEVOUS WITH A CHARACTER OF MY CHOOSING. THAT'S PART OF THE FUN! Yet you can't. Extremely disappoining.Speaking on the story levels, disgustingly disappointed. I genuinely had more fun in TCS. Where you can use fight the villains without being locked into non-free play characters, and the puzzles are unique, fresh and engaging. Most the puzzles in this game are repetitive, there is nothing unique about most of these levels, you will find yourself re-doing tasks from one mission to the next so much. Why is there so many space battles, for each planet, THERE'S NO POINT IF THEY'RE ALL THE SAME! If they're all the same, have it for a few planets, no more no less. These missions aren't even fun.Non-Skippable cut-scenes, even during Free-Play. Never had this issue before, Free Play Missions before even used to just not have them at all, that's preferable and it makes sense. I'm not playing for the story anymore, discard those cut-scenes during free play.What I did like:The open worlds were engaging, large in scope and had unique puzzles and interesting quests, although they could be much and confusing at times.The combat is fun, it's probably an improvement on the mashing button of previous LEGO games, although I can't really say this isn't button mashing. There are some obnoxious parts to the combat, like the fact you can't block the main attacks, (that's the whole point of a block function, right?) Instead having to move out of the way of the attack. To conclude, I want the entire story missions to be revamped in the games to come to include unique puzzles, to be longer than 5 minutes and I'd like to see how characters are used within the games, their abilities, perks and powers to be completely re-done so that each character has a value within themselves, rather than a value as the category they are part of. I'd also like to see a lot more effort put into the story mode, replaying these weren't interesting, I wasn't going back in free play happy to finally be experiencing all the secrets I couldn't find in the story mode, it was a slog. A boring, repetitive, non-skippable cut-scene, unable to use my own characters during fights, slog."

Not because of difficulty but sheer distance you had to travel from starting.Action sensitive controls.Isn't something many other people point out - while having many actions mapped to a single button is a great idea when executed correctly, this game misses the mark by a long mile - so many times have I wanted to just alt-f4 after 5 attempts to use a button how I wanted to use it instead of how the game thought I did.Shooting is just not fun.Most enemies are bullet sponges, they've added cover mechanics to a lego game for some reason, and the controls feel clunky and unresponsive eg. it takes over a second after releasing the aim trigger for the crosshair to disappear.Flying is horrific.I know that I come from great arcade and flight simulation games so i might be a little biased,however I am well aware that I could never hope for something akin to Ace Combat in a lego game, nevertheless Clone Wars did flying much better regardless how clunky it was. This games flying controls make zero (0(null)) sense. And combat consists of holding fire button and aiming in the general direction of the enemy while flying as slow as possible.It's hard to orient yourself, the ships handle like a doge hellcat on bold tires on vegetable oil covered concrete with a 1200HP tune up.Levels are uninspired.Short, lacking content. sure each level has 3 hidden challenges but they cut down on the amount of minikits per level and the ones you do collect are 95% one terminal or ability use away. And if you excluded all the walking from A to B to C to D about half of the levels would be: Watch a cinematic, listen to a character talk, cutscene of something happening, press button, kill enemy.Walking.Oh my god the walking, there's just so much of it I don't even feel like going in depth since there's no depth to it.Voiced lego characters.Make the writing really boring, most gags are haha minion funny tier of someone falling on their ass or doing a le funny face.And the director decided that we fo shoo need the entirety of important dialogue from the movies in the game so about half of each episode is just listening to dialogue while walking.I am well aware of the ""mumble"" extra, but it only proves how bad the game is written. When you turn it on you feel like you're wasting even more time during unskippable segments because there just isn't anything interesting going on in the background.And to remain on that topic for a little longer, the choice of actors is just bad especially for Han Solo.His VA makes him seem like a reddit moderator would think a cool guy speaks.And a big FU to the players who don't wish to play through the  sequel trilogy but still want to 100% some levels - unless you play the first mission as maRey Sue you cannot use Scavenger characters abilities so haha tough sheise.Ps. I am well aware of the grammatical errors I've committed in this here review - nevertheless I cannot bring myself to put more effort into it than was put into writing the script for the levels.Trust me you'll have wayyy more fun playing the complete saga or clone wars than this game."

Sure, it's a Lego game.. so it's not going to be the most challenging game you will play. The game is definitely laid back and designed to just jump in and have fun, especially with Co-op. Mission challenges are also available for the completionist and to add further difficulty, as well as the high score counter to earn ""True Jedi.""

Not yet, anyway.At the time of this review, the game is in serious need of a patch. The players know it. The developers know it. But there is no patch. There are new characters that you can purchase, of course, but that kind of defeats the purpose when you're having to deal with bugs on every play through.I've run into bugs plenty of times in other games. It's pretty common these days considering how complicated the games are, so I'm not saying that any game needs to be perfect. But this game has enough bugs for a few dozen games. I played all of the major missions and went back to 100% them all. I 100% episodes 1 through 6 with the exception of the very first mission of episode 2, A Wrestle With Wesell. First time through the mission lagged hard about halfway through causing the audio to fall far behind the action on the screen which fell to single digit FPS. Any replays resulted in a crash to desktop (CTD). It runs well at first, but right before the area where the first minikit is, the engine just slows down to a crawl, audio begins to lag, then it'll hang and CTD. Every time.Speaking of CTDs, I lost count. I could be traveling between planets, starting a mission, turn a corner on a map. Anything and everything seemed to be able to cause one. Audio lags come out of nowhere, mostly while in a ship above a planet trying to shoot at enemies. You can usually fix these by landing on a planet but the audio lags usually cause other problems like interfering with mission progress.There are more benign bugs like objects getting stuck in a map, character models not appearing, clipping through ships. And while they may seem inconsequential, they are numerous. The icing on the cake came when the game caused a CTD so I bad I had to hard reboot the computer. When I brought Steam back up it reported a mismatch between the save game on computer and the one on the cloud from 3 days ago. So I naturally chose the one on the computer because I had made quite a bit of progress that morning. Well, I made the mistake of assuming that the save game on the computer was fine. Turns out it was blank. So my 78% completed game save after 85 hours of exploring was wiped out. The game starts with me on Naboo where I left off, but the entire progress is gone. All the characters, ships, side missions, puzzles, bricks, upgrades, etc. Everything gone. So I'm done with it. Even if a patch comes out, I can't see myself dumping another 80+ hours to recoup what I lost. You can see through my achievements how far I was into the game. I was clearing the planets one sector at a time. Too bad it was a waste of time in the end.I'm not saying the game isn't fun, but without a well needed patch I wouldn't recommend anyone devoting a lot of time to it. If you're only wanting to play the main episode missions and have no intention to explore around the planets at all, save your money and wait for a sale. If you want to try 100% the game, wait for the game to get patched.-- rawWwRrr"

1316,GLOBAL WARMING5,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GLOBAL5/,12,2,0,42.9,April,"23,",112,0,1,"It's ok. The level design is honestly atrocious compared to the originals. Most levels can be ran through in less than 7 minutes, many less than 4 or 5. Some of the most linear lego levels ever, who chose that awful POV for the pod racing mission (honestly ruined that mission), no fun minikits where you do weird/quirky things like drive a tractor to farm some flowers to destroy to make a minikit or dropping stormtroopers into a giant pit. I love collectathons when they have unique challenges that aren't repeated over 1,100 times. The kyber bricks in each world are basically all the same thoughtless challenges that most of the time have little character/humor; the minikits of the original games were far more fun to collect. The minikits in this game suffer from poor level design and the boring collectible aspect the kyber bricks suffer from. Half the time character swap is broken; it switches the character slot to the left of the one I selected. IE I select slot 3 and it actually changes slot 2. This means I can never change the final character slot cause there is nothing to the right of it. Also sometimes it adds a 3rd character I can play as and sometimes I only have 2. The cutscenes maintain great lego humor and there is a lot of characters. Some episodes, Episode 2 stand out, a lot of the story is running from cutscene trigger to cutscene trigger. You spend so much time just running around Coruscant not actually doing anything besides activating dialogue. Open world is rarely done well in lego and this is no exception. Go back to fun cantinas and better missions rather than running simulators in lifeless open worlds with boring collectibles. People will say any criticism of this game is elitists, but the level design and glitches of this game are objectively worse than the Complete Saga and the excessive amount of kyber bricks are not nearly as interesting than other classic collectathons. If you normally dont play collectathons you wont notice how boring and overdone the kyber bricks are in this game which is fine for you, but not die hard fans of the genre. This game is 4/10 at best, would recommend to get on a big sale, don't pay full price."
1317,Haggis,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PastorHaggis/,1,,1,77.9,November,"26,",577,0,1,"The new LEGO Star Wars game has some great pieces, as well as some pieces that I wish were more like the original, but overall, I think the game is a great addition to the series.Pros:- The visuals are beautiful and anyone who says otherwise is wrong.- The new combat system is fun, albeit different. Sometimes I miss the original ""just punch everyone until they die"" system, but this one gives a bit more to do and makes the game a little more ""playable"" in how it wants you to interact with the combat.- The open world is fun and gives you a lot to do and explore, even the bits that the story won't take you through. There's plenty to do, if not too much to do sometimes.- There's a million characters and it's amazing, even if I still only use the same few characters every time.Cons: - The story missions are a bit too short, in my opinion. It has you run through the open world a lot to progress story pieces, which is great, but the actual replayable stories aren't super long and they don't have many of them. I do wish they had a few more of these.- I miss the heart system. The new health system is neat for the new style, but I wish the hearts were back and you just added more hearts instead of a bar. It's a minor thing, but I miss it.- They removed the character customizer, which isn't that big of a deal, but I do wish it was there. There are so many more characters that if they had a customizer, you could make even cooler characters.- I dislike the voiced characters. Some people enjoy it, but I personally don't. I miss the more physical comedy they had that came from the nature of mumbling. The mumble mode is nice, but when you turn it on you realize how little the characters are doing on screen to show what's going on, unlike the originals. Like when Vader tells Luke that one line, in the originals you had him showing a family picture, in the new one, he just says it. I wish that they had combined more of the physical with the voiced lines to give a nice mixture for the original fans, and for the newer fans.Overall, I love the game and I think it's well worth your time."

Granted I am a full grown adult, but the fact that it is so easy and light on story content is upsetting. At this rate The Skywalker Saga Episodes could be beaten (generously) in about 10-12 hours. ( Proof:  )To put that in perspective: LEGO SW ""The Original Trilogy"" (2006) takes about 10 hours too. The Skywalker Saga which has all 9 movies, has roughly the same story content as ONE game encompassing 3 movies. Read that again.I don't think the game is bad as a whole, but it's probably worth $15-$20. 50%+ of the content is side-quests and grinding which is pretty sad. Feels like an mmo with fetch and return missions, copy&paste sidequests, and endless walking from point A to B. The Skywalker Saga undeniably holds a fragment of what old LEGO Star Wars used to be. Convoluted with side missions that intrude constantly and shorter main-story missions than all it's predecessors combined; it's really just not the vibe unfortunately."

This is sad because it was a huge staple with the old games.To elaborate on the first two points, major events are missing like the Battle of Genonosis, the Battle of Coruscant, the Battle of Hoth and more.Its a shame that the best mode that has ever been implemented in a lego game, the ""war"" battles from Lego Star Wars III, is not present in this game. Those were some of my favorite memories.The AI is very much dumbed down as they fail to pose any real challenge unlike the old games.The cover system is pretty much useless because of the problem stated above.No character customizationAll characters play the same, which is a shame as they used to have cool custom moves and powers in the old games. Now the only character that really has this is General Grievous, who is my favorite character in this.There are some game breaking bugs and glitches, which obviously Traveler's Tales didn't have time to fix as they were rushed by Warner Brothers.Overall, this game is fun, but not the kind of fun I was expecting. For how much hype was behind this, I wanted more, but a lot of this is smoke and mirrors. This game is definitely not the replacement for the old games that they promised, because they still have better features than this at certain points. TT needs to release some major updates to fix these problems, but most likely won't because they are too focused on releasing DLC now with everyone just giving non-stop praise instead of being critical. This game has many flaws that need to be addressed but we won't see TT fix them until we start speaking up.I want to give this game my recommendation, but until the problems stated above are solved, I can't."

If this came out in my childhood I would have been crying tears of joy most likely. But, now I'm an adult and in a world overflowing with open world garbage I miss the linear levels of the complete saga. I don't like just seeing Jar Jar get saved then your 10 seconds away from the shore. I liked hopping through old temples on Naboo, fighting druids and platforming. Now I feel like the game is an open world first and a fun Lego game second. The world's are beautiful and there's lots to explore, but other than getting studs and finding secrets is there any real reason for them storywise others than just to be little hub worlds every time you're going to another mission. Maybe it's a nostalgia cloud or maybe I've grown out of Star Wars, but either way this game does not bring me any joy and much enjoyment at all. So personally I cannot recommend it."

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

I've always been a huge fan of the LEGO Star Wars games and the biggest appeal for me was always the simplicity of the games, in which you just get to run around and destroy everything and have chaotic fun with your friends. This game isn't that for me; it feels like I'm getting drowned in usually very cool features, but which don't belong in a LEGO game in my opinion. For instance the upgrade system does not interest me at all in a LEGO game, where my only concern has always been character, gold bricks and minikits. Now, don't get me wrong, there are some new features which I really enjoy, like that you need a protocol droide to translate other languages and the huge open world, but they are just too overwhelming as of now. I also really anjoy the new way of attacking, where as a Jedi the force has really been made into a usable attack, but I really dislike the combat. The combat really feels simplistic in comparison with all the new abilities you've been given; I'd usually end up just spamming light attack.And then there are the levels. The levels feel really rushed to me, like they were trying to cram as many things in there as they could, while they only had a certain amount of play time they could use. A lot of the cut scenes also felt really glossed over to me; for instance when Finn and Poe steal a TIE-fighter and flee to Jakku, the cut scene takes about 5 - 10 seconds, while it should be really impactful. Then there are also the levels, where some feel like they took about a minute, where you did close to nothing and others feel like you've been there for way too long and you still do close to nothing.I really don't recommend to get this game if you are a fan of the old LEGO SW games, but who am I to tell you what to do."

I've played every single lego game (except for lego movie 2) and this one is by far the worst. The levels are all short, boring, and uninteresting. Multiplayer (which has been a staple in every lego game) feels like an afterthought, the 2nd player never EVER does anything. A lot of important moments are cut out of this game or relegated to cutscenes such as the 2nd death star, palpatine vs windu, negotiations, a level on kamino, etc. The characters should be a highlight of this game and yet, they aren't. In the complete saga every character was kind of relegated to a class, but almost all of them had at least 1 unique thing about them. In this game there are a few classes and every character in each class plays the exact same. The only characters that really play any different are the fetts, and some characters in the extra class. Old lego games had fun and not to hard to do puzzles in each level, this game has you walk through a hallway, kill 3 enemies and then fight a boss. The vehicle levels aren't much better because all you do is shoot a target for a minute until it dies. The open world is yet again... A disappointment, there are literally no enemies on any planets, and one of the planets you cant even explore. Overall I feel like this game should have payed more attention to gameplay rather than being able to play as an obscure character that acts the exact same as every other character in their class."

I enjoyed getting the bricks sure, but I don't enjoy exploring a LEGO game even though the ""enjoyable"" part of the game is the exploring. The story is always just a repeat of the same things every time with just a bit of a different scenario.My main issue with this game is that it does not feel like a classic LEGO game at ALL. Its too concentrated on being a TPS game with combos and health bars, while the actual combat and battles are total letdowns since you can just press one button and beat any enemy despite it being a ""much more developed combat system"". Compared to the new games, the way the old games were played were essentially 100x better, smoother and more enjoyable. The game doesn't have any unique feel to it, it just feels like a lame story you try to push through to get to explore the area for collectibles. I don't care how you feel about the game, this is my take on the game. I am not blinded by the ""classic"" games and how they were played, I simply believe they actually stayed to the story/gameplay and were fun to progress in and not some poorly produced fighting game with the premise of being a LEGO game to sell better.The remake of the old LEGO games of the old films were also terrible in the same way, it didn't feel like a LEGO game at all.Also this is not a satire review but I'm not gonna cry too much about the money I wastedGG 10/100"

And you need like really good internet if you are playing from one apartment - you will cast and pull HD picture through same channel simultaneously. And you WILL play only in split-screen, which is frustrating - the view angle is ridiculous. And the game stops being fun and pleasant, turning into something like ""For the God's sake, where am I? Where is my friend?"". The bright example is speeder races on Tatooine, where checkpoints appear outside your piece of the screen and you don't understand where to go.So yes, for single you may give this game a chance.

It'd be like an RPG of the Star Wars series, start to finish, but they retcon episodes 7 through 9 because the story is dumb there.

Lots of collectables, references (prequel memes as a good example), and additional content to collect, see, and experience through the game. I have a hard time really finding anything overwhelmingly negative about this game, aside from the lack of a character creator, and that's saying something in this day and age of games being pumped with DLC. Now that being said, there is DLC for the game, but nothing game breaking or pay-to-win seeing as its only character packs as I am writing this review. If they ever decide to do major DLC for this game, I really hope they go into the side stories such as Rogue One, Solo, Mandalorian campaigns, but that is a whole other topic on its own.In my opinion, if you have a chance to ever play and/or buy this game you should definitely give it a chance."

There are still some issues that this game has: FPS issue with wrestle with wessel, keyboard bug in master code breakout to name a few. The levels feel short, but that really only comes into play when repeating the missions. Fresh play through's will make the episodes feel longer. The level amount was reduced to 5 from 6 (LSW:TCS). Alot of my game time was spent in the open world completing the other objectives. One big issue is not being able to switch ships in free play mode for some levels such as destroying starkiller bases first phase. The love the amount of characters in this game, just wished that some of the dark side characters used lightning as their ranged attack. The boss fights are really good, personal favourite is Anakin vs Obi-Wan fight. People dislike the fight for not being able to co-op fight like in TCS, but the fight is more accurate with the film. The most creative boss fight is the episode 8 captain phasma fight, since one of the challenges involves damaging her in 9 different ways.The lack of character creator is sad, but it does not make the game unplayable. With that said, it does feel strange not having a character creator in a lego game."

You can truly feel how much love and hard work TT games put into this game especially if you've played the previous LEGO Star Wars games, there so many little references and Easter eggs to the previous games and the movies and as a huge fan of Star Wars it's wonderful to see really. The game looks beautiful and vibrant and every area feels unique and interesting (and there are a lot to them) the game has so much replayability that it will probably take me a while to 100% complete. And the new combat system is such a breath of fresh air even if it's a bit basic I mean this is their first attempt at a completely new combat system. My only complaints really are that their are some levels and scenes that suffer from massive frame drops and at times the anti-aliasing options either make the game blurry or jagged. Overall this game is a masterpiece and in my opinion, a model of how game developers should take their time to put love and attention to detail in a product. 9/10 would highly recommend to anyone."

Almost every interior including like the floor, walls, and ceilings are covered in legos, really makes the game feel more lego-y. Open world areas are also really pretty combined with realistic textures and legos. 2. Most expansive character list, even the most obscure ones like Glup ♥♥♥♥♥♥. However, by having such a large list, gameplay is suffered.3. Combat is improved. You can do combos with lightsabers. Hide and build covers. 4. Cutscenes and humor is executed well. Some references in the game like one mission titled ""Better Call Maul.""1. Level design is uninspired and boring. Lets do Ep. 1 for example. In the beginning, you walk to the meeting area with  Obi and Qui Gon and then go back realizing its a trap. Then, you meet Jar Jar and follow him to the gungan Base. Then, you follow Jar Jar to Boss Nass. Then you go across the gungan base to reach a ship to go to Naboo. So far, the only thing you've been doing is walking. In the complete saga, there is actual combat and puzzle solving in the first location. There is an actual level to play not this going from point A to point B then a cutscene crap that this game does quite a lot. 2. Sure the character list is big. But all the characters feel the same. Take bounty hunters for example, the only thing they can do is shoot or use their jetpack. Literally, no flame thrower or wrist rockets. Yes it is in the combos, but no button for it.  Palpatine also doesn't have a button to do force lightning or force choke. In DC Super Villains, every character had a special ability that they could do. In Skywalker Saga there is none of that. 3. Occasional bugs with enemies not triggering combat scenes. Not being able to move happened quite a few times and resorting to restart the level. 4. Usually the game runs pretty well. Places like the droid factory in geonosis is horrible however. 5. Important scenes are cut off and replaced with cutscenes. No Mace Windu vs. Palpatine. No battle on geonosis. No battle on coruscant. 6. The open hub areas are pretty to look at with things to collect and explore. However, once you do a little bit of exploring and collecting you will realize that many of the puzzles are recycled. 7. Co-op gameplay usually sucks with the second player usually doing nothing. Such a big mistake that the fight on mustafar is against player 2 instead player 2 controls R2 and 3PO. LIKE FOR COMPLETE SAGA SECOND PLAYER COULD PLAY AS ANAKIN."

Episode 9 made me want to kill myself.I might find it more fun to play in Co-op than Solo.If you're in for a casual experience, you might like the game. But if you expected it to be fully fledged out, with loads of content for the Episodes, you might not like it. Some story elements were completely rushed through, just featuring a 30 second cutscene, like the battle of coruscant and the Mace windu - Palpatine fight.Other people have pointed out alot of flaws and pros that i wont be going over right now, but I pretty much agree with it all. I did like playing the game from 1 - 6, i will likely replay those again.Leaving the review as positive for the time being until i figure out wether I actually like the game enough in the end.Right now I can only give it a 5.5/10 score."

(without starting a completely new game). After playing Episode 1, for example, there's no way to replay the first and very nostalgic scene where Qui Gon and Obi fight a bunch of droids. The first scene/level you can play again is the one called ""a bigger fish."" But I'm sure that wasn't the beginning. This is very sad, because Lego Star Wars the complete saga and Lego Star Wars the Clone Wars did it right!But in 2022, after so much work on the game, there is such a small detail that makes the game very bad.That could be fixed by making levels out of each tiny scene or better by putting together several tiny scenes/levels into one level. I hope this will be fixed.In the meantime I gonna play Lego StarWars the complete Saga again (a good game)"

I must say though the game has a multitude of bugs despite being out for over a year. Some of the bugs are game breaking primarily when flying in space the controls freeze up and all you can really do is shoot and spin.

The game feels empty, as if they forgot to add enemies, the missions are extremely short and everything is pretty much in the open world. Now, that wouldn't be a problem if, again, it weren't completely devoid of npcs that do literally anything at all besides stand there and walk around. It could have been the best lego game of all time, but it got obviously rushed and released as a half baked product that will never be finished. This game is a fine example of what happens when you dump hundreds if not thousands of development hours into making the next big advance in the series and it doesn't quite pay off, while at the same time, neglecting the very things that made the other games great.Don't even bother with the DLC characters, they have no interactions and get old real quick, kinda like the game itself.I recommend to go play the complete saga or the clone wars lego games instead."
1479,Jopguy,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067741458/,2,,0,22.3,April,"25,",77,0,1,"I expected more from this game and I'd have to say I'm disappointed for the price I paid.  If you are thinking of getting this game, only get it ON SALE.  Overall the game lacks the complexity of the old lego star wars games, especially in the puzzle and level design.  The combat is gimicky without practical use and the dlc doesn't include new story missions.  Below is some pros and cons if any of you want further explantions.Pros- The open world system of different planets and areas was fantastic.  It was a real treat seeing the different worlds brought to life.- My favourite gameplay mechanic was the flying/starship missions.  On the controller the movement and shooting felt snappy and smooth.  - Variety of characters to play and ships to fly.  It was especially interesting trying out the differences between ships.- Keeping with the spirit of Lego Star Wars, funny cutscenes, dialogues and character interactionsCons- I can't believe I'm saying this for a game labeled as a Saga but there is a lack of content.  Every missions is around 70% cutscene and 30% gameplay.  As funny as the cutscenes are they don't make up for playable content.  The lack of gameplay becomes really apparent when you start freeplay and with the ability to skip all cutscenes you realize how these missions become a 15 min adventure at most, in and out.- Lack of puzzle variety and complexity.  I hated doing the same R2D2 puzzle with a passion.  All the puzzles were tedious and got old real fast.- Level design was simple and lacked innovation.  The old lego star wars in my opinion had more quirky designs and more complexity.  Lots of times you had to build platforms to fight a boss or solve a unique puzzle that didn't require the same old r2d2 puzzle unlike this game.  Each level in the old game had its unique puzzle for certain sections.  In this game you just switch characters and do the same puzzle over and over to solve.- Combat was never improved.  The developers boast of different combos in fighting which is cool and all.  They even put in a mechanic to prevent spamming one move by making enemies block.  This is easily overcome by spamming the same move 5 times then using a different move then spamming again.  Seriously theres no need for a player to do different combos.  It more effective to throw a lightsaber non stop (best move in the game)- Boss fights were a snooze fest because of the gameplay mechanic.  They pose no threat even to the most amateur of gamers.  My grandma could beat any boss in this game. - The DLC is simply EXTRA CHARACTERS. THERE ARE NO NEW STORY MISSIONS for rogue one, solo or mandalorian or anything.  Seriously expected at least a rogue one story mission.  That movie connects the original movies with the prequels.  How disappointing.- The collectables of minikits and bricks are a snoozefest.  Again, no quirky puzzles to find minikits and such. All you have to do is switch characters to use their abilities to get the minikit/brick.  Minikits and bricks are also shown to you by the UI taking out the fun of exploration/mystery out of it.- Unless you have all the time in the world I don't see any fun in collecting everything.  It's for the most part tedious and a chore.  20 HOURS was the amount of time it took me to go through the whole saga at a enjoyable pace, not rushing or trying to find every collectable.- An overall dumbing down of a lego game.  So much handholding and leading in this game and so little complexity/mystery left for the players to enjoy and explore for themselves."

Some of the best writing i've seen in a Lego game in a very long time. The game is very pretty and the cut scenes are downright gorgeous at times in how fluid the animation is.The biggest knock against this game is the levels feel very short and certain sequences I'd assume would be missions are completely missing. The space battle at the end of episode 6 comes to mind but there were others. The game makes up for it by having incredibly large hub worlds that can be explored for collectibles.

Another more serious problem is that of the boss battles that happen outside levels which are also once per save file events, such as the Luke Skywalker fight and the first Jango Fett fight.Another major problem is the number of people who end up with corrupted save files both local and steam cloud, so manually backing up the saves is highly advise for any who pick up this game.There is also other problems such a performance problems on certain levels as well as it seems that the extras can break the game such as in the last level of VII where it crashes the game with certain ones one."

The ""Story"" mode for this game is just a series of cut-scenes followed by brief gameplay segments. After that most of your time is just running around to get to the next story cutscene. The voice acting and mumble mode are uninspired, they hired people who don't sound like the original characters. Mumble mode is a half baked excuse for what the old games did. Some of the jokes are clever but most miss the mark entirely because of the voice acting. I'd much prefer the old no dialog with jokes like before. The collection part of the game is boring and most puzzles can be skipped if u have a jet pack char, with the most annoying puzzles being locked behind needing to finish EP 7 in order to get the scavenger abilities when no other abilities are locked behind needing to complete a level. The cover shooting and new light saber melee mechanics as well as boss fights feel uninspired and lack luster. The older hearts system was fine, idk why they felt the need to replace it. All in all it feels soulless, a mockery of the older games. I do not recommend it for those who have fond memories of the older games, go back and replay those, they are better in almost every way."

A game to be enjoyed by younglings and old masters alike. A game to try, I recommend.But beware, dear friends. A challenge it is, to play as little Lego figures and defeat giant capital ships. But fear not, for with The Force on your side, victory is certain. And if you happen to be defeated by a group of Stormtroopers, just remember, size matters not.And if you happen to get frustrated with the game, just remember, do or do not, there is no try. And if all else fails, call on the wise and powerful Yoda for guidance. Just don't ask him to do the driving, hmm? That is a skill he has yet to master.Overall, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a great game for fans of the series. May the bricks be with you."""

It's so different, yet so familiar and I find it very charming. If you grew up with the first LEGO Star Wars games like I did, you're likely to enjoy at least one thing in this game. Some people might be turned off by the open-world aspect, but I love that it gives me the opportunity to explore these rich Star Wars planets at my own discretion without having to be dragged through a linear level with many, MANY boundaries instead. Although the NPC interactions/side quests are quite goofy, it doesn't take away from the amount of detail put into these planets and their environments.Cons:The combat is a little weird, but I kind of expected that with a modern LEGO game. The device interactions are boring and feel arbitrary. Waiting for an arrow key to slowly make its way into a box to press it is not engaging for me at all. Even the Astromech device interaction where you rotate the circle is straight up boring. I skip those just so I don't have to do them. At least in The Complete Saga, it was just a cute animation that we got to see the characters do. I liked the direction of them wanting to implement the device interactions as a mechanic, but to me they just weren't engaging enough. The diegetic nature of some of the devices are cool. The arrow key device shows the screen in the game world and makes it look like the characters are actually interacting with it. Unfortunately, that did not save how bland I feel that they are as a mechanic.I will admit, I'm a bit mad at the ""Galactic Edition"" shebang as well. That kind of ruins the point of pre-ordering a deluxe edition and getting the benefits from that if I just have to end up buying even more content after the game releases. I myself will just choose not to buy it because the game can still be played without it. I've spent enough. Deluxe Edition lets me play with over 300 characters, but Galactic Edition lets me play with over 400? Okay, but the story and gameplay is still the same. If they planned on adding separate side stories from Rogue One, Andor, Mandalorian, etc, then I would maybe consider purchasing the pack, but as of now it just seems like a character pack cash grab for fans of Star Wars.TL;DRThis is a great game for Star Wars fans, but the Galactic Edition is a cash grab."

Basically, I grew up on Lego Star Wars TCS. I loved it and 100%ed it a few years ago. I didn't know what I loved about it, but I do now. It's the character and soul of the game. It's funny and cute and charming. Skywalker Saga meets this easily. It's got just as much soul and character, without feeling like a rehash.The problem is, I wanted to 100% this game too. I did. DO NOT DO THIS. It turned a fun 15ish hour game into a slog of an 80 hour checklist. If you do 15 or so side missions, and get 30 or so Kyber bricks, you will have seen all of the side content. Almost every mission is just a recycled generic objective. Every kyber brick has the same solution. Just do yourself a favor and play the story and move on. Maybe get the minikits, those are fun.

And I was right! Having only played one Lego Star Wars previously, I found myself enjoying the play of The Skywalker Saga again. Basic combat, puzzle solving and exploration means players of all ages can enjoy this game! The references to small side characters throughout the movies, the space combat, and special instances of story missions were some pleasant surprises too.I was also very surprised to see just how much they put into this game. I've now clocked over 100 hours attempting to 100% the game. Gamers, there are so many side quests and things to do upon finishing the main story, it is honestly ridiculous. Star Wars fans should definitely play this game. There won't be many other games where you can play as Max Rebo and a Wampa side by side, beating up stormtroopers."

The gameplay and mechanics are well crafted and smooth. The combo system is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. The long list of characters and added character types gives a lot of replayability that this game otherwise would not have. Despite the solid nature of this game I find it lacking compared to its predecessor. There are big stretches of missions that are just not present in this game compared to the Complete Saga. Side by side an individual mission in the Complete Saga is a much longer and more fleshed out experience. I know there are three extra episodes now compared to before but they had a very easy template to follow that was tried and true. One that they did not follow, much to my disappointment. That combined with the lack of a character creator makes me long to play the Complete Saga over this game.That being said and disregarding the previous game, this is a must buy for LEGO game fans. Despite my nostalgia getting the better of me this game is by no means a bad one. In fact part of me wishes I had played this first, just so I could appreciate it more. You can get a lot of time out of this and being at $50 full-price is a steal, and a must buy on sale. There are things this game offers that the Complete Saga doesn't and vice versa, so definitely check it out."

The mouse + keyboard controls are kind of frustrating to use, since the game has baked-in mouse acceleration which cannot be deactivated. Even after decreasing my pointer speed (DPI), the camera control was still kinda whacky and would sometimes spin around way too quickly. Rotating the camera too fast also causes frame drops, so playing with mouse and keyboard made the game stutter every time I turned around.Playing with a controller is a much smoother experience and the controls feel better designed as well.The game is quite grindy (as you'd expect), but the open-world puzzles and missions are not too monotonous, with a lot of fun puzzles and easter eggs.Having played Lego Star Wars TCS a bunch of times, the pacing of the episodes feels weird at times, even though it correlates more closely with the movies than the older games did. The level designs are nice, nothing too special, but good fun.To me, the story levels feel quite short, definitely shorter than the original trilogy levels in the old game. The game still has plenty of content, but I would have preferred more story content (longer levels, across larger areas and with a few extra cut-scenes) over the open-world stuff."

The humour, voice acting, zones, the amount of characters and ships you can collect... everything is just spot on.All of the important scenes from the lore (albeit a bit modified for the humour of it) is in the game.On top of everything else it's a beautiful game that flows perfectly fine and I've only come across one bug so far where I got stuck in a wall. Good thing there isn't far between the checkpoints so reloading was not a big issue and that solved it.I dunno if it's the game or me doing something silly but I really can't get windowed mode to function properly for me. I usually run games in borderless window mode on my main screen where I also have my windows taskbar. Usually the games take up the whole screen but this just doesn't even if the resolution is the same as in every other game. It fills out the entire screen except my taskbar which is also shown at the bottom and that's kind of annoying.

The open worlds vary in size, but they are feel alive and bring a fun element of immersion to the lego star wars universe. Biggest downside is trying to 100% this game is a tedious nightmare since there are WAY too many collectables. Also the quirky quips that each character makes when they're selected or do something interesting don't vary enough (fair considering there are like 300 characters) and they get annoying after awhile. I'd say if you don't mind just playing the levels and exploring the worlds without getting every last thing done, this is a really good game."

1708,Drexarch,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045203414/,1,,1,78.5,July,"29,",777,0,1,"TL;DR: A decent game carried by it's license and a mountain of content.Positives- Charming visual presentation that does justice to both Legos and Star Wars- An amazing selection of playable characters and vehicles that also doubles as a comprehensive encyclopedia of Star Wars lore.- Literally hundreds of bite-size, generally fun side activities where there is a constant flow of new things to do and you're never hung up on any given task too long. - Competent ranged and melee combat that is just deep enough to maintain interest.- The abridged nature of the story mode makes The Last Jedi and Rise of Skywalker more bearable by leaving many of the divisive bits on the cutting room floor. Negatives- Abysmally bad performance in certain areas. The ewok village often dipped to below 20 fps on an RTX3090. Outside of these moments the game ran perfectly fine and did not tax my system at all. - Frequent glitches and bugs. I didn't encounter anything game breaking, but quest markers were often in the wrong location, quest givers would sometimes disappear, and certain random events would refuse to spawn for hours at a time. Most of these were fixed by restarting the game, but still annoying nonetheless. - Bad climbing mechanics - climbing tries to split the difference between free control and using button prompts to mantle onto ledges, but just ends up being awkward. Button prompts frequently disappear or change suddenly, causing me to miss a jump and fall to my death. If you go very slowly everything generally works fine, but it never feels as reliable as it should. -Bad reward scaling - most of the side activity rewards come in the form of Kyber bricks, the game's upgrade currency. The problem is that almost every task rewards you with just a single brick, no matter how complicated it might be. Some bricks require solving intricate, multi-part puzzles to get to, while others are just lying around in the open. Dealing with the game's more complex puzzles starts to feel not worth it after a while given you can just go somewhere else, break open a random trash pile, and get the same reward.Tips- Use your data cards to buy stud multipliers first. You will need millions of studs to unlock certain things, and having the multipliers allows you to accumulate currency way quicker. Multipliers also factor together as you acquire them, as in 2X and 4X combined will give you 8X. - Play Episode 7 first. It's the only place you can get scavenger gear, which you need to solve certain puzzles on every planet in the game. You can unlock scavengers in other episodes, but they don't get their tools until Rey crafts them early in The Force Awakens.-Jedi and Sith characters can force lift droid characters. A lot of platforming and box stacking challenges can be bypassed completely by force lifting a droid character up to the destination. Even floating bricks can be acquired by lifting a droid into place then switching to them. -The scoundrel class has an ability that can halve the cost of hints and applies to all characters across the board. Hints are crucial for finding certain collectibles, so buying this ability early will save you studs in the long run.RecommendationThis game works best as a collect-a-thon, and that's where most of it's value lies. If you only intend to play through the story mode as directly as possible, the core gameplay mechanics really aren't deep enough to make that a satisfying or interesting experience. If you really dig into unlocking all the characters, ships, and class abilities, you are looking at about 80-100 hours of content. I had a good time with this one overall, and would definitely recommend if you are that kind of obsessive completionist."

1718,JonnyCheats,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zicon4/,1,,0,22.5,July,"13,",150,0,1,"Truly truly one of my most disappointing purchases ever on Steam. The levels are insanely short, the open worlds are empty of anything to interact with, and the puzzles are so simple and repetitive that it all feels tedious. And with 1200 blue bricks to collect, it feels tedious fast - it all feels like filler.Actual levels are few and far between tedious fetch quests and ""walk here for another cutscene"" tasks. I'd had enough when you are tasked with escorting Padme to her apartment on Coruscant, while she walked at 0.5x normal walking speed and would not move along unless you were right next to her. It became very clear that this game is a very polished but hollow shell - it looks gorgeous, but it is devoid of any of the charm of its predecessors. They designed incredible backdrops with no real content to sink your teeth into.The game is very pretty, but unfortunately behind its glossy surface lies a buggy empty mess. You don't need nostalgia-goggles to see its predecessor is the superior game despite being 20 years older."
1719,Difficulty Tweak,https://steamcommunity.com/id/difficultytweak/,1,,1,10.5,July,"11,",396,0,1,"Back in about 2007 or 2008, I saw an ad for the Complete Saga on TV, and it blew my little child brain away. I actually got so excited over being able to mix and match stuff from different eras that I actually screamed at my mom to buy me the game. Complete Saga got a lot of hours out of me and many fun memories, but as time marched on and LEGO games became more advanced, it did actually get left behind.When the Sequel trilogy (ew) finished, it was basically only a matter of time until a new Complete Saga came out to update everything, and that's what Skywalker Saga is.For those of you expecting a one-to-one update of Complete Saga, I'm sorry to disappoint, but it's not. There's quite a handful of changes that were made that put distance between Complete Saga and Skywalker Saga, some good, some bad, and here's a short list:-The Cantina is gone completely and has been replaced by an open world/galaxy map, which I feel is a bad thing since you lose that visual reminder of your progress as the Cantina fills up with people. This also means custom characters are gone as well.-Episode 1 actually adds the Control Ship as a level in the episode, as opposed to it being cut content in the original game and an extra in Complete Saga.-Episode 2 doesn't have a gunship battle, but it does have a chase with Jango in the asteroid field which I don't remember being in either the original game or Complete Saga.-Episode 3 completely skips the Battle of Coruscant's space section and starts on the Invisible Hand.Many parts of Complete Saga that were full levels have been either merged into the open world, turned into cutscenes, or those that were retained as levels were heavily truncated into much shorter missions. The first level of Episode 1, the Theed levels, and the Invisible Hand were all significantly cut down compared to how they were in Complete Saga. I imagine the case is very much the same for the Original Trilogy and the Force Awakens.The game is good - very good. It's just that I think a lot of what made Complete Saga good (the longer linear levels as opposed to the open world with short missions, for example) being lost has harmed the game quite a bit."

Every minikit, level mission, sidequest, kyber brick, all done. If DLC comes out that adds extra content, consider this outdated.This game is what every remake and remaster should strive to be. It builds on the original content without dampening the nostalgia or it's legacy in any way, whilst also bringing the game up to 2022 standards and polishing out the rough areas, whilst  adding three new films worth of content. Seriously, it's a gold standard for remakes and shines a harsh light on other remakes we've had recently that weren't created with the same level of commitment or sincerity as this. It took me 81 hours to 100% the game, but I could probably have finished quicker if I gave a bit more effort. For the price, this game is an absolute steal."

(probably because Disney owns Star Wars now ) Don't get me wrong the game is great its just that it doesn't know when to be serious. this installment is however  is also much more glitchy than the original. i found multiple glitches just playing two player(same PC), and its not letting me play episode 6 like I never cleared episode 5 when I have the acheivement to prove it. (please help me figure this out in the comments) Overall Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Sage is a bit less of what I expected but it is better than most of the other new Lego games. 7/10"

The entire game is boring and  repetitive, There's constant trailing missing and walking from point A to point B.The combat was hyped up for being more in-depth than any lego game we've seen, in reality, its just as simple as lego star wars the complete saga, You just press X over and over again and you can't lose.The graphics and sound design are my main complements to the game. Episode 4 was the only one that felt like they had put any effort into designing fun puzzles and game mechanics and even then episode 4 had a lot of issues from other episodes carried over. Player two constantly gets the worst characters to play as, For example in episode 9 when Rey goes to luke skywalkers island (which is a trailing mission by the way) player one gets Rey, and player two get some random islander frog-person with a sweeping brush. The most fun we had playing was after we finished episodes 1-9 and went to unlock yaddle and klaud so we could see them together. By the way, the side missions were better than story mode but still a lot of walking involved. my final consensus is this game is not worth the price and I wholeheartedly believe it's extremely over-rated and I give it a 4/10"

Many additions in this game were either unnecessary or actively made the game worse. The overhauled combat system and new perk system were a welcome inclusion to the series. Each jedi and sith had unique animations that matched their movie counterparts. The game also introduced combos, counters, and ADS, which were all wonderful additions to a previously lackluster combat system.Unfortunately, since the game is so easy, these perk upgrades and combat system can be largely ignored. This ties into one of my biggest problems with the game, the boss battles. All boss fights play out in the exact same way, with locked camera angles, identical enemy moves, and absolutely zero variation. Additionally, they are made for one player, so if you are playing co-op, the second player essentially just watches and does little to get involved. This is most egregious in the Obi Wan vs Anakin battle in episode III where the one character plays as Obi Wan and the other plays as C3PO and does not engage in the fight whatsoever. Other levels I found disappointing compared to the original were the Battle of Geonosis, the first level of episode III and the Darth Maul fight. I found many of the flying levels of the original to be more nuanced and challenging. The flying levels and fighting levels of this game all played out the same. Besides the samey feeling of the levels and the awkward transition between story and open world moments, the game was great. The open worlds were fun to explore and offered thousands of puzzles to complete. Many become derivative after a while, but there are plenty to keep you interested until you grow tired of them. The voice acting is also very well done. Not only is it true to the movies, the game is also really funny. The slapstick visual humor and poking fun it did to the movies was amusing. Of course the music was amazing since it is a Star Wars game. The game also has hundreds of characters to unlock, many of which have unique dialog depending on which combination of characters you use. Unfortunately it does not include customizable characters. Ultimately this game is a well packaged compilation of the Skywalker Saga. It does a fantastic job at presenting the charm of the movies with its humor, world design, and massive catalog of characters and Easter eggs. The charm can begin to wear thin near the end of the game as it becomes clear that the developers were lazy when it came to their level design and especially their boss designs. Still the game is worth playing. 6/10"

We have been mainly getting sidetracked with killing ourselves or each other in the game, due to the lack of intelligence we have, and can barely co-operate. My friend is a huge, I'd say, a huge Star Wars fan, and knows a lot about the movies and all. So I can say he is quite delighted at this game. I know a bit about Star Wars, but was never that into it to begin with. The game over all is a fantastic collection of all the movies into one action/comedy packed game. You can't go wrong with Star Wars games... Games graphics are sometimes it's downfall due to either frame drops or just bad animation, but it's not that noticeable per say. Gameplay is amazing, some characters are more fun that others, but the vast majority of them are very fun and enjoyable. Story and cutscenes, I have no complaints about. They're very funny and well animated. If you've somehow stumbled across this review, skeptical of buying the game, then I give you my advice, play it, with a friend or alone, the game is a blast. Might you find this review helpful, I'd much appreciate you liking it, to help others help decide on whether or not to buy the game.

1859,Sevotius,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sevotius/,1,,0,64.2,May,"18,",732,0,1,"As someone who grew up playing the original LEGO Star Wars games, it pains me to leave a negative review for The Skywalker Saga. Now I'm not saying this is a terrible game or even a bad one but it most certainly is not good. Let me explain:1. SO. MANY. BUGS. I've had characters getting stuck, characters phasing through levels, missions becoming impossible to complete forcing me to restart, texture problems (space encounters were permanently bugged as once I unlocked a capital ship, the entire battlefield was just consumed by massive low resolution ship that you can't interact with at all making it pretty hard to see what was going on), enemies becoming invincible or bugging out and a lot more. The state this game is in, while not unplayable, is also not acceptable.2. Missions are super short. Some of my fondest memories of the Complete Saga were playing through a wide selection of the scenes from the movies in full scale levels. Here it feels like everything's on fast forward with entire sections being just cutscenes. Some missions could easily be completed in 5 minutes with very little replay value.3. Building on the previous point, SO MUCH of this game is just collecting this and collecting that. Sure, it's a LEGO game and there's a lot of stuff to collect, I get that. But the ratio between levels and the open world collectathons is very badly skewed towards the latter. I'm guessing it'll take around 80-100 hours to get everything based on the progress I had. I spent ONLY 10 hours beating through all the levels and getting the goodies there. The rest of the 54 hours (!!) I played was just me going from Point A to Point B and grabbing something. This type of MMORPG busybody work is SO unfulfilling.4. Collecting all the stuff in the game wouldn't have been as vexing if the open world was actually fun or the puzzles/missions were interesting. It's really not. The open worlds are beautiful but so empty (and so numerous). The puzzles/missions are just copied and pasted. Maybe there are around 20-30 unique mission templates. Not bad, right? Well, there are literally over a thousand puzzles/missions here. Doing the same thing over and over again is NOT my idea of fun.5. On the other hand, the combat is actually fun! So why is this a con? There's barely any opportunity to actually enjoy it. Beyond the missions, the open worlds have very few combat encounters. It baffles me why so much effort was put into combat and RPG development (which I love) but then there are barely any combat encounters.6. The boss fights are incredibly uninspired. All of them basically have the same attack patterns, same rush attack, same AOE etc.7. There are TOO MANY SPACE ENCOUNTERS. At least reduce the time it takes for a space encounter to start OR, failing that, STOP THAT DAMN ALARM. It going off for over 10 seconds for the 50th time was torture.8. Strange how a LEGO game has barely any building in it. I really liked the idea of choosing what you can build but only the (very short) main missions have a precious few instances of it. Why?9. Obtrusive UI. It's all coarse and rough and irritating. And it gets everywhere. Seriously, why can't I turn off the tutorials for when Jedi/Sith attach to walls? Why do notifications on the character screen keep refreshing? Why is the character screen so unintuitive to use?10. The DLC characters don't have any voiced lines. Considering people are actually paying for this, why can't there be actual dialogue from them?11. I'm not a big fan of the new datacards system. Once I collected the stud multipliers, and subsequently got billions of studs, I had no reason to a) get new datacards beyond 100%ing the game and b) had nothing to spend my studs on.There ARE redeeming aspects to the game: great character models, funny gags, nice cutscenes and enjoyable combat. But the sheer mountain of bugs, tedious filler and boring open worlds make this game, frankly, just plain unenjoyable for me."
1860,Sleepy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SleeplessStreams/,1,,1,70.2,May,"18,",233,0,1,"The people downvoting this game seem to have forgotten what a LEGO game is by its very nature.Yes, this isn't the Complete Saga all over again. There's been nearly a decade full of LEGO games produced since, and each one brought a new development to the series.By this point, TT Games began experimenting with entirely new engines, which culminated in this game not even using the original engine. Instead, this game alternates between a God of War-style beat-em-up combat and an over-the-shoulder shooter combat, alongside more puzzles on-brand with the LEGO games. This game is a bit more cinematic, a bit flashier, and the levels are a bit shorter, but this is still a full experience with tons of stuff to do and see.I get people being upset that it's different, but this game is trying not to step on the toes of TT's previous work, meaning Complete Saga is still a completely valid game to pick up and play after the release of this one. There are a few things this game does worse-- notably, the computer puzzles take way longer, but the ability to dump your Kyber Bricks (this game's version of Gold Bricks) into an upgrade tree and unlock things like panel skips and stud magnets right away makes this game a lot more simple in the ""quality of life"" department.This game, at the very least, is as strong as the Complete Saga, if not stronger. Ignore the naysayers, I think a lot of them just forgot how easy these games tend to be when they're not buggy. This is the Star Wars game young me would have wanted to play, a shame it took so long to finally exist."

You assume you did something wrong so you save and exit, only to then realize the game is broken, and you can't go back into the level. I tried jumping to the later trilogies, but I was lying to myself while I kept playing. A nagging feeling that puts you down the path of the dark side, all because you don't have ""the High Ground"".

The game certainly has some differences to other Lego games. For example there's very little building and most levels are short with more emphasis on free-roam between areas. But pretty much everything is still fun so it doesn't take away from the experience.However the level challenges and side missions feel very much like padding rather than well thought out content. 'Having' to manually check each level's challenges before replaying in free play was incredibly tedious and hopefully not something that's continued in future games.

I think that the weakest part of this game are the story missions. A lot of the episode missions and cut-scenes either feel too rushed or messy for them to feel fun or enjoyable. And the level challenges are some of the roughest content that this game has to offer. Many players have noted some bugs in relation to the level challenges as well, so for those who are looking to 100% this thing, good luck!That being said, I cannot recommend this game enough. In an age where games release with far too little on launch day, the Skywalker Saga is overflowing with content that will keep you engaged for hours upon hours.Like I had previously stated, there are elements of the story missions that are a bit of a downer, but that's not where the game shines, in my opinion. It's in the open exploration areas and the side missions. There's so much content in this game by you just running around and exploring. The space battles, unlocking space ships, capital ships (), and the CHARACTERS. Good absolute ♥♥♥♥ does this game have a roster of characters to unlock.Oh, and this game gets an automatic point for being a Lego game with this much content, and a Star Wars game with this much content.

I dont understand why sometimes the second player is taken into account and sometimes not. In addition you only have a vertical splitscreen and there is no option to make it horizontal.

There hasn't even been a singular update on the PC version of the game which is really concerning, even though TT Games is fully aware of the issues.The new combat system is intriguing at first, but after a while you realise it doesn't serve any purpose and you might aswell just spam X. There is plenty of side missions too, but they're just repetitive and not really fun or rewarding at all.There is no character creator in this game either which is quite disappointing.I do however enjoy the story missions, and although flawed, i still like the upgrade system.The game is overall a somewhat enjoyable experience, but it's not worth 50€.Wait for a sale, as it might be patched up then and you'll get it cheaper aswell."

And the most fun I've had with one since the first Lego Batman game. Included is all 9 episodes from the Star Wars franchise, with each episode taking a little over an hour to complete. However the game is chock-full of side quests and collectibles and characters to unlock. Not to mention, the game spans an epic open world where you can visit many planets and iconic locations in free play as any character you like. Each planet includes a space region that you can explore in various ships from the movies as well. The graphics are gorgeous and the revamped combat system feels modern and smooth, albeit, for a Lego game. (Combat is not too complex). And the humor is great at times, accompanied by some good, and some bad, voice acting.But that's about where the good ends. As for the negatives, the game is buggy. I am still awaiting a patch for the issues i encountered, as I know many others experience the same as me. Choppy frame rates in areas where it really shouldn't be choppy. The game, sometimes, launching at 16 FPS requiring a whole restart of my system in order to be able to launch it in 60 FPS again. Which is frustrating, as I cannot find a fix for this. As I mentioned, the voice acting is bad in places. The worst of note is from Kylo Ren, sounds nothing like him. I couldn't help but laugh every time he spoke without his mask on. The majority of the voice acting is good though. And while the combat system is revamped and feels smooth, the lack of complexity makes it become stale after a few hours of play time.The game is also incredibly easy. It's literally impossible to fail quick time events and even in combat you take so little damage you could beat the game blindfolded. I know it's targeted at kids, but a higher difficulty option feels necessary here. Too bad there isn't one. And even if there was I doubt it'd do much to help the shockingly terrible AI of both enemies and your companion. it's extremely rare when the AI companion even attempts to help you in combat. Unless you are playing split screen, you're doing all of the work. At times I forget my companion is even there until I need him for a puzzle. The difficulty of this game is still the easiest I've seen out of any game in a long, long time. But the game is full of things to do and is very faithful to the franchise. I appreciate how full the galaxy feels and its still an incredible feat to pull off something of this magnitude. But you'd really think after all of the delays that the AI wouldn't be this bad and the Launch wouldn't be so buggy. But nonetheless, I recommend the game if you are a fan or Star Wars or Lego games in general. It's a great family game but if you want a fleshed out challenging open world star wars sandbox then maybe this isn't it"

First off, the open world is beautiful- if this is the formula for future LEGO games, they've completely transformed these from solid, fun, kid-friendly AA games, to super relevant and exciting gaming releases, especially considering this is easily one of the best Star Wars games of all time. In Complete Saga there were 6 level per film, here that is down to 5, but there are some story-related sections while traversing between levels. Honestly, these sections were super hit-or-miss, often filled with slow-pace escort missions. Far and away, my favorite part of the game is the open world galaxy exploration; I spent dozens of hours flying around the galaxy collecting bricks, unlocking characters, and of course, becoming a stud billionaire.Completing the main story is very enjoyable, and my time spent in galaxy free roam was full of amazing times. However, it became very clear why this game had been delayed so many times, and honestly could've used more delays. I certainly played this game more than most will, as I was going for the 100% achievement completion, but wow did I encounter some bugs. Everything from UI elements missing in fight missions, side quests being forever locked, many crashes, my resolution randomly turning into popcorn, characters being stuck in walls and many more. Another mixed feature for me was the new free-play format. In the old games levels had 10 minikits available, here levels only have 5, but there are mission quests. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I did not enjoy the mission quests, they made free-play feel like a chore, and the mission quests often require you to play levels in free play two or even three times. There were also occasions when mission quests could only be completed in story mode, with zero indication that was the case. So yeah, there are a lot of issues with this game, despite it being a massive jump for the LEGO games, and a wonderful Star Wars game. I don't like ending on a low note though, so... I'd like to talk about the vehicle levels. In previous LEGO games vehicle levels are some of my least favorite (and from what I've heard from others, nearly everyone seems to agree). That completely changes here- particularly with the flight missions which are so fun (although the textures in space are often pretty bad). Another positive feature is level variety. They could've easily redid, or modernized the levels that were used in the Complete Saga, instead there are completely new levels focusing on different levels of films that we've already played LEGO games for, which may hurt the nostalgia factor for some, but there is still plenty of nostalgia trips to experience. Another thing worth mentioning is the class system- characters are all organized into classes (jedi, sith, droid, etc.) that have special class abilities. There are some characters within their class which are more unique, such as there only being a few bounty hunters that have jetpacks. Ultimately, I had a really good time playing this game, but the longer I played the more I got annoyed by the constant bugs. I think they've created a great formula that still needs some perfecting on the technical end, bud the experience here is still unique and enjoyable."

I couldnt just type out the could like ""SIDIOUS"" for example, I had to use my WASD keys to move to each individual letter and press space as if I was on a controller.This was on my first day, and I was trying to see the border for space, so i just kept flying out. I Got to the end and It turned my ship around, but it just kept flipping me and flipping me. not allowing me to open my map or menu or anything. This has happened multiple times and each time I had to close my game because of it.On a particular mission, the one with the gonk droid on kef bir, I had done it as one of the first missions I did because I wanted to unlock the gonk ship. after completing the story, and trying to 100% the game, I made my way to each plannet and completing them fully. However, on kef bir, I still have that gonk mission on the map, even though I have already completed it. I go to the spot where it is located, and there is no kind of NPC anywhere and I cant 100% kef bir, and in this case, the whole game, because of this bug.Another bug I have ran into is character selection. I am an OCD kinda guy when it comes to this stuff, So i want each of my fav characters from each class in order, but when trying to do so, it just does not save, or the character I want in that certain slot goes out to my current party, and then dissapears when I enter a cut scene. say I have my characters 1, 2, 3. I want to change my 2 character to someone else. I go to change it, and 2 stays the same, but 1 changes to the character I want in 2. I then try to change it back, and the character I want ends up going to my party and then dissapears after some time. SO. ANNOYING.there is also a place in the forbidden valley that I ended up flying over a fence with boba, and ended up not being able to go back, with exits no where else. for some reason, I was not able to travel to any other planets either, so I had to close my game.I dont know if this is just apart of the game or not, But I have gone through each (!) new thing when that protocol droid tells me he has hints, or just throgh the menu. I have gone through each character, each mission, each side mission, each ship, each puzzle, each everything! and instead of being ""marked as read"" or whatever you want to call it, whenever I close my game and go on it again, the little orange/yellow dot (!) shows up at the corner of every single thing I just went over. super. frustrating. how am i supposed to know where new things I have unlocked are? stuff that I have unlocked on day 1 show up as ""new"" everytime I log on.one of the more gameplay parts that are quite literally unplayable, are the droid factory mission, and most parts of endor.  I have a $2000 pc and the frames I get on those levels are in the negatives. theres not much I can say about it, but the fact that even when i put all of the graphics to low, it is still just as laggy, and looks crappier. All in all, I am glad this game has come out after all of this time, but I just wish some of these little things werent so $h*tty and annoying. I would recomend, but def dont spend a single penny more than just the base model of the game. Unlike me who preordered the deluxe and the quality of the game did not meet my expectations.(9.5/10) if these things are fixed(4/10 in the state the game is currently in for me, and probably for others too"
1899,Patch,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113605788/,1,,0,14.0,May,"10,",149,0,1,"A mismatch of many borrowed features that not only don't need to be there, but aren't even used to their full potential. I went into it expecting something akin to the older games, but instead was met with something entirely different, and entirely new. Massive explore-able worlds filled with side quests are paired with short, uninteresting and uninspired story missions that often skip over the exciting parts of the films. Fleshed out combat and upgrades systems are there next to new features like cover and counter attacks that I have never once considered using. You'll often spawn on a planet that's meant to be a war-zone, being directed to a mission start beacon, and yet the map is almost entirely empty if you walk around it. Even after my short time with the game, I feel as though I can say pretty solidly that whilst there's a lot to do in the game, it's debatable whether any of it is actually fun."

The game was a buggy mess. While playing it, my save file completely disappeared, and I got it back only thanks to the steam cloud. Other than that, every time that I would change the graphics settings they would revert back in an hour or so even when I applied them, which was a real annoyance. Also while playing the speeder level, I would fall off of the map after a little while sending me into an infinite death loop, which happened about 3 times. In addition, some of the levels in this game are completely unplayable without aim assist (especially the speeder level which has no crosshair). Regarding the gameplay, most of the boss battles felt pretty repetitive and honestly kind of boring. You could just continue throwing your lightsaber at them, while they don't attack you for the most part, and they almost all followed the same attack patterns which were attacks that you had to doge, and then ones that you had to press keys on you're keyboard for. Regarding the story, the game prioritized minor story events over the major ones, which is kind of a new spin on lego star wars, but one that I did not like. Regardless of all of the bugs and things that I said above, I thought that It was very good, and brought back some memories of watching StarWars and playing the old lego trilogy as a kid. There is so much stuff to do, and I think that it was worth the 50 dollars that I spent on it. Overall, I enjoyed this game, although I wish that they would take more time releasing it to polish it up more."

If you don't have good WiFi or a bad PC then your gonna have to sit though the lag or tell them to come over to your house etc.OVER ALL:Good game sticking true to all the previous LEGO games but not just a copy and paste of the Complete Saga, I would say its worth it for the price due to all the little details added into the characters and how similar the voice actor are to the movies."

So you have to spent another 55-60h in loading screens and free roam missions and challenges. This is just full BS. They should have created more main missions for sure. If you have seen the movies, you will notice that half of the story is missing or has been shorted. Also there are some bugs. Sometimes you have to restart missions or the whole game.

I love Star Wars, I love Lego, and I loved the old LSW games.I was ready to just say this game has some weird bugs that aren't game breaking and can just be annoying to deal with, but that was until I got hit with a bug that has rendered me unable to 100% it. There is a challenge called ""Where's the Wookiee?"" where you have to find and talk to a wandering wookiee NPC around the galaxy on pretty much each planet. I was at 26/33 and all of sudden, it reset back to 0/33. I went to see if he had respawned, and he had not. I can't complete it now meaning I can't 100% the game. This has existed for weeks now and nothing has been done.The game is great past that. Combat is simple but fun, platforming is fast and plentiful, and the comedy is on point. It's what I expected and more, but sadly marred by a game breaking bug and other technical issues that make me wonder why this game was delayed so many times?If they release a fix for aforementioned bug, this review will be edited and switched to positive for sure, but with the lack of communication from the developer, I don't see that happening unfortunately."

They took their sweet time whipping up this game and there is so much to do. I haven't even beat all of the episodes and at the time of this review I am 14 hours deep. Easily the most in depth Lego game in my opinion. It is a little frustrating that you cannot 100% in your first sweep and are required to re-enter missions in free play. Some cut scenes are funny but can never top the OG ones in my opinion. 8/10 need more lego foot shots."

Such as camera angle, sometimes the game forces you to use some camera angles that I don't prefer. Another thing that I don't like as much are the space battles. They tend to follow the same formula, and at times have your ship flying through a space station to hit the enemy. I wish the flying in space was a bit more fluid.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 15 now. My son got the game from his uncle for his birthday, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

You don't even have to be a Lego fan or a Star Wars fan to enjoy the heck out of this game!  With the story lines from all 9 Star Wars movies combined into a single game, you can expect to have many hours of action and fun.  The REAL benefit to the game, though, is all of the challenges, secrets, character unlocks, and puzzles (oh, the puzzles!) that are also in this game.  You could spend 100+ hours if you're a completionist, searching all the maps in Free Play mode, trying to find all the game's secrets in order to hit a perfect 100% find rate.  For adults, there's plenty of fun to be had and a lot of challenges to overcome.  (Plus, the game's not that hard to play, so this is the perfect video game for when you just want a relaxing evening in front of the computer.)  For kids, there's a HUGE number of items to smash, and the Star Wars story is fun to follow.  This game has something for everyone."

It runs super smoothly with minimal bugs (compared to previous LEGO titles)  And the open world feels so alive! It so fun to explore!Cons: The levels themselves are very short. Like, super short. (at least for Ep I - III) In previous LEGO games you would have hours in the levels themselves and then the open world is unlocked after, in this games the levels last 5 - 15 minutes each, and there are only 5 per episode. I could stand for longer levels. Overall, this game is SUPER different to any LEGO game in the past, but I say it's 100% worth it. I just hope for the next LEGO game they keep the amazing open world and make the levels slightly longer."

Miałem rację i gra wypadła pod tym względem bardzo podobnie do innych gier z tego rodzaju lecz wyróżniła się bardzo przyjaznym dla młodych odbiorców sportretowaniem historii z całego kanonu filmowego oraz posiadaniem bardzo (jak na gry lego) zaawansowanym systemem walki.

2088,jdragon7,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jdragon7/,1,,1,50.3,April,"21,",345,1,1,"*The following guide pertains to the state of the game as it is on the date of 4/21/2022 and thusly does not refer to any future updates or patches. Also, there will be occasional references to The Complete Saga, as I'm strongly familiar with it and want to view the game both as a comparison and as its own thing.Launch day came- I was waiting a long time for this one, and even though I was trying to watch my funds I instantly purchased this game along with the deluxe pass to get all the dlc (Mando alone was enough to convince me). I played briefly through episode 1 with a friend and I've played through the story all the way through episode VI on my own since. I would love to be able to say that the game is everything I could've wanted and more, but the game is riddled with so many speed-bumps and bugs and downright strange design decisions and it gave me enough pause to reconsider my opinion. Thus, I'll break down both the bad and good parts of the game as I see them, beginning with the bad.THE BAD: I'm not going to lie the actual movie levels leave a lot to be desired. This certainly doesn't apply to all of them, but a multitude of the levels such as the endor bike battle and the gungan vs droids level just seem very devoid of interest or creativity and it makes enjoying the levels as a whole a lot more difficult since the consistency of quality just isn't anywhere to be found. Certain ways the movies and levels were interpreted are a lot more creatively bankrupt than their TCS counterparts were, and as someone who grew up with that game, it was very difficult for me to move past. Also- this is where the current date part comes in- the game has an extreme lack of polish. You cannot go two levels without discovering one infinite-death loop or even the occasional complete crash, and several of both main missions and side quests are quite bug-prone as well. The worst example I've seen doesn't even seem to be a bug- the endor bike level can LITERALLY RUN OUT OF WORLD if you can't kill the speeder clones fast enough (I had to turn on the aim-assist because of how awful shooting things with the speederbikes is, and you really shouldn't need something like that if its really meant to be optional.) At the very least I'm hopeful that the bugs will be fixed, and if they are, I'll feel a lot happier playing through it. THE GOOD: Free play has NEVER, EVER been better. It'sa so good. The ability to explore all 20 something worlds and each and every nook and cranny within them to hunt for collectibles is great, and I adore the fact you can pick whatever ship you like and dock anywhere or just fly around in space if you so wanted to. The moment I saw the Uscru district I was hooked, and besides some of the blander worlds like Geonosis feeling like more of a drag, I have no complaints about it. The combat system is amazing too- it hits that green zone between not being brain-dead but also not being difficult, and I love this game's spread of characters and their skills as well as how they can be applied in battles. In a similar vein, most every story level involving a major character you must fight is a slapper. High octane and fulfilling but never too long, and they all feel quite distinct from one another. I also very much love the hoth radio tower level- its just very fun to journey across this vast tundra looking for goodies. Would I still recommend this game? YYYYeah. My thumb's not all the way up but its certainly above the middle point. If this game got some much needed polish, it would sit just right with me. It will never be perfect, the inclusion of sequel content alone has ensured this, but I would firmly call it worth the wait."

Being able to relatively seamlessly fly from planet to planet is really great, and the graphics are amazing. There's not a whole lot of content though, which kind of makes me wonder what they did for the 2 years it was delayed. The upgrades are a nice concept but collecting 1000 kyberbricks... why, just why? The story is pretty bad most of the time, because its very compressed and you'll find most of it happens through cutscenes. There is no Coruscant space battle (happens in a cutscene), no battle of Geonosis, the death star trench run was pretty disappointing personally. As for the 2nd death star, you don't get to blow it up, don't get to fly carefully through its tight spaces to reach the reactor, that's all done in a cutscene. The co-op is nice but vertical split screen makes absolutely zero sense, especially considering you can play online not just locally, and because its vertical it severely limits your fov.Being able to explore the vast open world is great, the devs have done a good job there, the maps all look stunning. The only issue is that you're going to be spending that time completing fetch quests which more often than not have you travel to another planet, or collecting some of the 1000 kyberbricks like I mentioned earlier. The capital ships are honestly a really cool feature but the potential is just wasted completely. The selection also leaves something to be desired, for example you literally get to walk around on the Home One briefly but you can't buy it as a capital ship. They are nice to explore, sure, but the only thing to do is collect kyberbricks and maybe unlock some characters.This is by far the most buggy lego game I have ever played, I don't know how or why it was released in its current state. There are a lot of game breaking bugs, which prevent you from progressing the story. I had one in ep 4 where I had to get to yavin, but because most of the time smuggling missions are bugged I kept getting pulled out of hyperspace after killing all the fighters, and eventually I was stuck in a loop. I've lost count on how many times I've had to restart the game just because I couldn't grab something or equip something just to progress through the mission.Suffice it to say this game is a big disappointment, and for a game with no real content outside of the main story, the story still leaves a lot to be desired."

I have tried changing files and restarting numerous times but still to no avail. I could look past the dodgy missions with bad FPS, I could deal with the whole world of endor running at 15 fps for the most part, but I draw the line at starting over because of one crash.++++++++++ 57 hours laterAfter taking some much needed time for meditation and self reflection upon my actions and words towards this game, I returned less than a month later and began the journey again, I was lucky enough to somewhat restore a save and only reduce my completion to a mere 20%. The grip this game has on me has been ungodly ever since, each waking moment I long to collect more bricks. After many updates the game has been almost perfected with only a handful of irritating bugs remaining such as not being able to use ANY OF MY CAPITAL SHIPS.....Nevertheless this game is amazing and I much enjoy collecting digital lego collectables and bragging to peers.Would recommend , just don't forget to make a copy of your game save."

It's the type of Star Wars wish fulfillment I've been dreaming of since childhood.

I'm highlighting the cons because this game has a chance to get even better and become the ultimate Lego game to date.  Pros:*The scenery, graphics, music, combat, and Lego humor all fit perfectly into the perfect Lego Star Wars game and the best Star Wars game in general.*Plenty to see and do.*The ultimate Lego game.*The ultimate Star Wars game.*Exploration is splendid and I truly enjoy searching through every nook and cranny to find more goofy dialogue.Cons:*Levels are a tad bit too short (I actually enjoy the fact that most content is in the open world)*Character variety is a little bit weak in my opinion (A lot of characters are same-y & Porgs aren't playable :(  )*Open world is far too dense for vehicles and loading screens are plenty.*No character Customization which was a must in every single Lego game up until now.*Some animations are glitchy and/or missing audio.Overall, 9/10Bring Porgs as playable characters and make camera zoom out an option and I'll buy a Obi-Wan Kanobi minifig to put on my desk."

If you try to ""speed run"" the campaign, you are going to run into constant traveling between planets with only cutscenes or only dealing with a few enemies at a time. There are too many parts in the campaign where your just following a slow character that's giving you dialogue (and if you try to run past them, the character will stand still), repetitive airspace battles, and too much game padding. The collectibles make the game really fun to play as some of the puzzles are challenging, unique and different. You can tell the developers tried to make every planet a unique environment. And Anakin's battle on Mustafar will always be iconic."

Its like the complete saga but updated and opened up a little more than previous Lego titles. I was a bit skeptical of the characters talking instead of their funny mumbles but the voice actors are nothing less than stellar. I think they might have gotten the actual voice actors from TV shows or the movies themselves which is a great detail. They do give you the option to turn it back to the 'no dialogue' like the older games too. It's also nice that they didnt copy and paste levels out of the older games into this one so it gives that new feel still. Also a new addition that i was a little worried about once i discovered it was the entire Upgrades section that gives different classes of characters better abilities and damage or whatnot. I havnt seen any balance issues or anything OP so far and im 4 episodes in.  TLDR: If you liked the complete saga you'll love this one. Worth the 60$.

Is fun for people who played the old games years ago as well as people new to the game. In my experience so far I have not encountered many bugs and the game looks and plays amazing. Going to be a game that has high replay-ability if you want to 100% the game with all of the collectibles and characters. Definitely recommend for anyone interested in Star Wars or just a fun game to sink some time into. The only real negative in my opinion is there is no multiplayer at launch.

Remaking one of the most beloved games from the ground up with a fresh coat of paint, new gameplay mechanics and a massive open world sounds a like recipe for success, especially since by the now the Lego format has been ran into ground about 30 times over. However, the game is so obviously rushed and is marred with glitches. One of which won't let me get 100% completion on Episode 3 because I'm simply not allowed to collect the last Minikit. I've had to reset the game a few times because when I switch tabs for a minute and switch back, I'm given a pure white screen. During one of the dogfights, the game was targeting other X-Wings instead the TIE fighters, which made it nearly impossible to hit them. So, I had reset it again. The controls straight lock on you. There are about a million instances where I've had to spam the acceleration or fire button to get them to work (no, it's not my controller. the buttons work perfect with other games). These issues can be forgiven if the game was fun but it's not. The game suffers from the video game equivalent of dead air. There are times where you have to slog through egregiously long walking sequences. Who's idea was this? Also, having to run long distances to your vehicle in order to start the mission. Why? The Speeder chase from Return of the Jedi is particularly bad in this instance. Holding the fire button while occasionally veering to the left or right. Even thee trees hardly do any damage to your vehicle. Just awful. There are some odd choices of scenes that got made into missions. For example: they left out the second Death Star dogfight from Return of the Jedi (it's only a single cutscene here) but they drag out Rey looking for Luke at the end of Force Awakens. It's so bizarre. Even the humor is pretty off here. There are more than a few occasions where the joke is LOL Random XD or just X character is dancing for no reason. The final lightsaber battle from Revenge of the Sith starts with Anakin just dancing. I just have no idea what's happening here. The game is massively disappointing. If you're inclined to buy this, just wait for a sale.EDIT: Almost forgot to mention the AI. Simply put, it's abysmal. Whenever you're pushing an object, they make sure to stand in your way and force you to switch to that character in order to move them. Whatever happened to just being able to just push the AI characters outta the way? Also, there are times where I get pretty far into a level and the AI is standing in the beginning area. Absolute trash."

Young, old, casual, hardcore, we all get that same dopamine rush from collecting Kyber Bricks. Solid .* The new open-world aspect where you can go anywhere you've previously discovered is really cool.* The new combat mechanics reward you for doing combos instead of button mashing (though button mashing is still pretty effective!)* Speaking of new combat mechanics, when turning off the auto aiming parts of aim-assist, guns feel  good. Knocking helmets of storm troopers to then 1 shot them is incredible.* While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the voice acting is top tier along with the jokes and delivery.* The puzzles are great fun and at times can even be challenging to solve.* The story missions are the same great fun they've always been. It makes me want to watch the movies after finishing an episode.* The jokes and references are as hilarious as ever for both kids and adults alike.* The visuals are stunning! The textures on some of the non-Lego objects rival most modern games.* The sound design is on point. Whether its ambient noise, music or blaster fire, the developers put a lot of effort making sure everything sounds great.* Quite a few bugs. From a simple controller not responding to entering a cutscene only to be met with a black screen that must be Alt+F4'd. They aren't too frequent but hopefully they prioritize fixing them.* Alt-tabbing (or even sometimes using the steam overlay) while in full screen mode will force the resolution back to your native, but capped at 24 frames. Can be fixed by editing config files but shouldn't be happening.* The options are lacking. Particularly the display options, no brightness setting and very little graphical control.* Forced camera angles at random points in the game are between annoying to down right infuriating. Want to explore a boss area for minikits? Best we can do is a forced target lock on the boss. Trying to do this jumping section? Let me change your camera to a static wide angle mid-jump so you die.* . While overall this has been a blast to play with my fiancee, there are a myriad of small to bigger issues surrounding coop that we've found. When one player swaps characters, it will force the other player's character select open and ignore any inputs until they close it. No horizontal split-screen which makes certain activities like timed races where you can't see the next checkpoint very annoying. The excess party members will decide to randomly follow a player with no way (that we've found) to assign them, making some puzzles much more difficult if you decide to split up. No way to turn friendly fire off in a game that has wide swings and where you fight bosses in 2v1 scenarios is pretty silly. There are more but these are just the ones that comes to mind."

2216,Nicostar,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198129586321/,1,,1,95.2,April,"17,",129,0,1,"The Lego Star Wars series holds a very special place in my heart. I played the complete saga back in 2007 and was hooked on it since I was introduced into Star Wars in 2005. When I say I lost my mind when the first trailer for this game came out would be an understatement. This game has been an absolute joy to play. It's everything I could have wanted in a Lego Star Wars game, but that isn't to say the game doesn't have issues.Performance in the game is relatively flawless most of the time. I easily get over 100+ fps while dipping below that threshold in some areas, but I would rarely drop below 60. There are definitely a few noteworthy areas that need some optimization. The Droid Factory level in episode 2 and the Ewok village on Endor are the two biggest contenders for some optimization updates. Ewok village is arguably the worst area in the entire game in terms of performance. Due to the unnecessary amount of lighting elements and particles effects, it absolutely tanks your framerate. Not to mention the falling leaves everywhere and the fact the entire area has multiple floors as well adds to the decreased performance. I genuinely am not going anywhere near this area until it is optimized because it is absolutely awful to walk through and try to solve puzzles. I usually get 15 fps in that area and no matter what settings I change it stays the same. Safe to say I won't be going anywhere near that area for the foreseeable future.On top of ""minor"" performance issues, there are also some small, but quite infuriating bugs. One thing is the character select menu is extremely buggy. I'll go to swap out Han Solo for Padme but then Luke gets swapped for Padme instead of Han. It's extremely annoying as I like to have 1 of every category of character in case I need them in Free Play. Additionally, at times when you come out of a story mission after completing it in Free Play, your character roster will be randomized and you'll have to swap in the characters you were using before.Another small bug but something major that could be a hindrance to an unaware player is a bug involving space battles. Essentially whenever you're in space and join a space battle, whatever faction your character is  a part of will put you on one side of the battle. I play as Kylo Ren (a villain character) often so it puts me on the side of the First Order and has me fight rebel ships. If I were to play as Padme (a hero character) It would put me on the Republic side and have me fight against the Separatists. There are several side missions in the game that require you to do space battles. What will happen is if you're doing a mission-based space battle, depending on what faction your character is you won't be able to attack enemy ships. Usually you would receive aim assist and be able to lock on to enemy ships in order to keep track of them. Because I usually would play as a villain character (Kylo) I often wouldn't be able to see enemy ships or be able to track them. This made mission-based space battles almost impossible as it was extremely hard to destroy enemy ships, and it was almost impossible to keep track of them. The only way I found the counter to this bug was because of a YouTube video covering the mission I was playing. The fix is you have to play as a hero character for mission-based space battles. It's a small bug but if a player is unaware of it they would likely assume their game is broken, which isn't a good experience for any player.There are a few more bugs I haven't mentioned but my goal isn't to write an essay. I may sound nitpicky but I absolutely adore this game. Like I said earlier it's everything I could have wanted from a Lego game. Stellar graphics, good voice acting, great level design, fun combat, etc. I haven't gotten 100% completion in the game yet but I'm getting pretty close with almost 60 hours in the game so far. The game is definitely a grind but getting every collectible on a certain planet is extremely satisfying. On top of that some of the side missions are really fun and the dialogue and voice acting are an absolute treat. The game is hilarious, and die hard Star Wars fans will notice the love and attention that was put into this game.I'd honestly recommend the game to any fan of Star Wars or Lego games in general. I'd honestly suggest waiting a month or two for some patches to come out that address some of the major issues in the game, but other than that it's been an incredible experience so far and TT Games did not disappoint."

The bootleg contains hilarious English subtitles translated poorly from Chinese. Due to the language barrier, many of the words and phrases were translated either literally or with alternate meanings, and thus the original meaning was lost. Most likely, the broken English is the result of being machine translated from the Chinese script. The subtitles were translated from Chinese rather than using the original English script. There are however several lines added that indicate it was not from a machine translator.

Gone are the fun times where you could attack Obi-Wan with your Qui Gon player character, and he'd actually block the attack.Still 10/10, if they ever update the NPCs to fight back (at least the jedi/sith characters), it'll be a 15/10."

First off i would like to praise the game by saying that it is beautiful and the gameplay (especially with blasters) is much better than previous games. I enjoy the combat and the exploration quite a bit as there are so many great planets to just run around on, the character choices are great and I think it is definitely worth playing if you have been excited for this game like i have been.However I have a few frustrations with how they tell the story. It took me roughly 30 hours to casually play through all 9 movies which is a solid amount of time for a lego game but i think the way they did it could've been better, for instance unlike TCS they do show all of the important scenes in each movie through one of 3 ways: A level, story locked freeroam and cut scenes. I think their choices for what scene should be what story telling device was picked poorly. For example, Revenge of the Sith had two major movie scenes that were cut scenes in the game: the battle over Coruscant and Mace Windu vs Sidious while Yoda and Chewy escaping Kashyyyk which was a 5 second scene in the movie, was an entire level, while it could've easily been a freeroam event. This happened in a few other parts of the Saga and bugged me quite a bit. About 50% of the levels seemed very short and didnt seem like there was enough time to find all the collectibles. As I am part of the group of adult players who enjoyed the original lego star wars games as a kid, I feel like my expectations for this game were through the roof and in some ways it met them but in other ways it did not. For kids today, I'm sure they will have an absolute blast playing this game, but for adults who have nostalgia for the old ones, even though it does have flaws, I still would highly recommend it, but I would also recommend to lower expectations a tad to fully enjoy it and not get mad at it. I had fun and I'm going back in to find all the Kyber bricks and 100% it as grindy as it may be because it is a great game to just play. 8/10."

I used to play the LEGO games all the time when I was younger, and this game returns the magic of my childhood. For awhile, the LEGO games have felt different. This game however, goes back to the roots while still keeping up to date with new technological possibilities in gaming. There are plenty of characters to play, and more levels than we are used to in most Lego games. The open world aspect is awesome, and any Star Wars fan will enjoy roaming through areas we saw in the films. The game is very visually pleasing too, and runs well in most missions. The only thing I dislike about this game is several performance issues in some levels (specifically the droid factory). I have an RTX 3090 and my game was running 10 frames per second during the droid factory mission. There are also a few missions where my frame rate would drop to 30 frames which is unusual for my computer in most games. Other than that, the game runs perfectly without any issues. I assume the performance issue levels with be addressed and fixed in the upcoming weeks."

I was very excited for this games release I even pre-ordered though I normally don't pre-order many games but as excited as I was I am still amazed every time I play. There is an abundance Star Wars lore that any fan would surly enjoy which just makes the game feel like the team behind it are fans as well that shows true in every aspect of this game story as well as side missions. The game mechanics just work exactly how you would imagine it would amazing job and has come a very long way since the first games which is honestly hard to do since the saga was a 10/10 game already. I would honestly go as far to say this is the best game to come out in quite a while at least since ""covid-19''. I love this game and would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in tar Wars even for someone who is just getting into it. This game has the quirkiness of all the rest of the Lego games and  perfectly balances with the seriousness of  the Star Wars galaxy. GREAT GAME  ""11.75/10""  would  recommend"

The story lacks some missions from previous games but still is enjoyable to play through and kill time. Challenges are repetitive and similar but are varied enough to keep you playing. Side missions to collect more kyber bricks and characters are enjoyable and give you something else to do if you have finished the story or just want to do something else. If you enjoy casual relaxing games that you want to complete or just want a hit of nostalgia I believe this game will fulfil that. Price wise though I wish it cheaper as it feels like more could of went into the game and made more things to do.

It allows player to explore the Galaxy far far away we see in the films and collect hundreds of iconic ships and characters that are all faithfully adapted and fun to play as for hours as you collect more and more across the galaxy. What the Lego star Wars game gets right, it gets VERY right. Unfortunately though, the replay-ability that made the original LSW games still fun to play almost 2 decades later is lost here. Levels can be tedious to run through again and again for missed Minikits and challenges and frustrating when player control is yanked away for gimmicky level design. After entering the Galaxy in FreePlay I haven't found a way to get back and play through the full episodes again which means a New Game had to be created when my friends wanted to play through the full story with me. What was the games strongest aspect on the initial play-through is now it's biggest weakness as I can't see many people coming back to play through a episode for fun once 100% is obtained. Disappointing, especially because in anticipation for this game I played through the Complete Sagas entire story Mode 1-6 because the levels are so much fun.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is a good game, Whether this is your first Lego Game or you're a veteran you won't be disappointed with how much there is to see and do in the Lego Galaxy Far Far Away."

Luckily with this game, it gives me the encouragement to watch all 9 movies in order and then go play the Lego version after I finish 1 of the films. Doing this has given me a very fun introduction to the series and I'm loving it so far. Watching the movies, replaying them in their charming polished Lego form, and then spotting out the differences and similarities is very fun. I would highly recommend this to someone who is a Starwars fan, Lego fan, or someone who is completely new to the series that has access to all 9 films."

(Changing graphic settings, of which there are like 4 or 5, does nothing to solve or even alleviate the problem), Remote play is seriously bugged as I (player 1) lose control of the game as soon as someone connects, unless I'm using the keyboard. This result in not having a player 2 and having player 1 being controlled by both the host's keyboard and guest's controller, rendering the game unplayable for both.The level design is pretty boring with little constructions and puzzles that are now most of the time replaced by a ""terminal"" minigame (basically a quick-time event or Simon Says).The only fun I had was with some clever jokes and flying in space (which becomes pretty boring too after some time due to the lack of content).The other thing i cannot stand is the unskippable menu animation at startup with Rey saying ""I need someone to show me my place in this"", which is fine the first 5 times you hear it but becomes really cringy and annoying as time goes on."

So far I have had one glitch when I fought Darth Vader in the emperors room when he got stuck doing his attack and froze. It wouldn't let me progress so I had to reset the level and then it didn't happen again the second time.  The game crashed once when I was running back after fetching Luke's blue milk. Other than that everything has worked great. Everything else is on point from the feel, sound (love hearing the actual voices of the game) the graphics just add so much extra feel to it. It's just a fun game. I give it 5/5. Best lego game to date and a great homage to Star Wars and the prevoius Lego star wars the complete saga which I also own."

It's totally kinda too easy for its own good what is a bummer not gonna lie.but i still had a blast and really fun time playing Prequel and Original trilogy, and also not so much in the Sequel's (100% better than the movies tho.)The combat is good and really fun. Especially with a lightsaber character's who have really cool and different styles with multiple combo capabilities. Sadly the boss battles are EZ (Elden Ring ripoffs) and you can't quite use them that much, because the health bar is gone faster than Anakin's turn to the dark side. nonetheless the bosse's are quite fun and creative adaptations from the Movies.The puzzle's are easy and painfully repetitive in some places, and many were already seen in older Lego games so the thing called ""New"" experience is for those who stopped playing after the characters started talking in these games.The levels are fun, but really fast and over in 5 minutes in most cases. Also to my disappointment some levels were unfortunately skipped, like the final battle between Obi-Wan and Vader in New Hope, also The Battle Over Coruscant in ep3 and the battle between Windu and THE SENATE. and not to mention the Epic Battle inside the second Death Star. Its still playable and totally worth your time and especially if you you’re a True Star Wars-fan and you want to experience the whole movie saga in LEGO.Its definitely that love letter for the new and also old Lego Star Wars fans alike, you should give it a try. :)"

It’s not a story the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

TT Games made it their main priority to make this game absolutely unplayable and broken, challenges, side-quests, puzzles, races all fun, but the amount of things they did bug-check makes me rage harder than 4 year old little german boy who can't play fortnite or drink cola. The Game constantly breaks when it comes to objectives in-game and on the map, displays bug out and there's no getting around it. One of my current quests bugged out and now I cannot complete which I need in order to complete the sector. If you're trying to collect kyber bricks don't bother looking at your map, they most of the time disappear after you collect them, but in some cases they do not and it has you wondering if you have them.

2412,adnn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Darwizzy/,1,,1,15.0,April,"12,",265,0,1,"I will update this review once I play the game more but for now I think I should tell you how I feel. *TLDR: Get this game its great*I'm currently on Episode IV playing in chronological order, meaning I've done all the prequels and so far I'm having a blast. My biggest complaint at the moment is that Episode IV has too much blaster combat, and blaster combat seems to be slow, I don't know if I'm missing something or not. But it's better to just combine a blaster shot or two with melee combat. The game offers tons of replayability with the freeplay mode and galaxy free roam mode. Freeplay mode is where you can go back to a previous mission but play as any character rather than the set canon characters (for example - Senator Jar Jar Binks fighting Anakin on Mustafar). With the Deluxe edition costing $60 and the main game costing $50, its a steal, as deluxe comes with all dlc characters. With this game boasting 380 characters on its own, over 100 vehicles, and more, you're sure to have a ton of replayability, and the main game itself takes around 24-30 hours to beat. If you're looking for replayability and a fun world to explore, this is it. If you're a star wars fan looking for a good star wars game, this is it. If you're looking for good melee combat and an entertaining story, this is it. If you're looking for a light-hearted story with gameplay that's easy for any casual to pick up and play, this is it. The bossfights are also very fun, If I had to pick my favorite so far it would be the Palpatine boss fight in Episode III. Once I complete Episode IX, I will edit this review. Until then, get this masterpiece. This is peak star wars."

The amount of things that you cam do is truly endless. Even after completing all nien chapters, there IS STILL a lot of maps to cover over. The gameplay is so well done and the combat battles are very well done!-Content:A big chunk of this game is the infinite amount of exploration for each map. So much to cover in each episode of all three trilogies. Even after beating all nine chapters, there is so much to do. So many side quests, so many little objectives of your own that you can make. And that’s just for each episode of the game. The free roam handles this very well too! When playing the free roam, there are a great many maps to explore with many little easter eggs! The content is endless and you can probably see yourself playing this for MONTHS just to 100% the game.-Voice Acting:The acting is so very well done, although the casting for SOME character are a bit questionable, overall it’s pretty good. A majority of the Clone Wars voice actors managed to reprise their roles in this game which I can appreciate VERY much.-Storyline:The game itself knows when it’s being goofy and when it’s being serious. Well balanced between those two. Overall you can play the game expecting a frw laughs along the way, and just have a good time having a blast with this over the top silly gameplay.-Overall Thoughts:There are a few things that I would change personally about the gameplay, but overall the game is in such an amazing state and I have no regrets buying the game. If you love Star Wars and overall having a blast of a time and just having fun, I HIGHLY suggest this game for you. It’s genuinely amazing how well made this game is and what it stands for.-Personal Rating:9/10"

The only people who are gonna get past 75% completion are completionist nutters. Power to you, you mad people. More characters than you can fit in a Sandcrawler and vast open environments that blend nearly seamlessly with missions- combat is improved. You can either perfectly plan out your combos and make things work..... or just mash the attack keys and it still works.- Did I mention how huge it is? The planets are beautiful. Some have multiple areas, some only one. The graphics are stunning and my PC is from 2016 with only a slight chug during AotC and one single freeze n crash- character classes are neat and add a lot to gameplay. Plus switching between characters is easier than ever. You can select all or quick swap which is handy- Wedge Antillies VA- Lots of Clone Wars VAs are back (Anakin, Obi-Wan, Padme, battle droids, clones)- humor is don't blink or you'll miss the gag in the backgroundthe meh:- collecting all the collectibles gets very repetitive very quickly- Kylo Ren's VA isn't Adam Driverthe bad:- compared to Lego SW Complete, some of the missions are uninspired and some are VERY short. There's also some parts of the movies that are cut scenes rather than playable missions and some opportunities were missed- kinda almost too big- you can button mash during combat and still win- unlike Lego SW Clone Wars, ground vehicles are limited to non-existent - Yellow eyes Anakin- no Jennifer Hale voice acting at all To sum up, you can't kill Porgs, 0/10"

I truly despise the QTEs in this game. I was born with a disability called Friedrich's Ataxia (FA), which impacts the muscles in the body, causing the legs and arms to not function as they should. The QTE that dislike the most is the key mashes which I cannot physically do.This game should have a solution to this such as enabling/disabling QTEs in the menu."
2490,RichardGaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Richard_Gaming/,1,,1,40.5,April,"11,",189,0,1,"This game is the ultimate culmination of all things Lego Star Wars. The team at Travelers Tales have completely outdone themselves. While there are some pretty jarring frame drops, resolution and rendering issues, they are completely overshadowed by the obvious love and care that went into the creation of this game. There are breathtaking moments that cannot be properly shared in a review, just play the game, I promise, even if you did not play the classic games, you with be blown away. A few gripes of mine involve the lack of difficulty (yes this is mostly marketed to children) and a lot unnecessary repetition in many of the puzzles; however, these are easily overlooked. The vastness of this game and the amount of variation in the story mission completely make up for the few (but apparent) shortcomings of the game. Overall I would say this is one of the most enjoyable games I have played in the last few years and is something I will come back to time and time again. Well done guys <3"

Vapenation,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198143774099/,2,,0,11.8,April,"10,",341,0,1,"For those who want a quick rating:7/10This game has been getting a lot of praise,  , and most, if not, all are correct.However here is a (Oppinionized) list of issues.IMPORTANT NOTE:The pro's mostly outweigh the cons listed below. don't take my reveiws or others too suriously. if you want to buy the game, buy it. worst case scenerio you can refund it.the MAJOR complaint:The clone wars epesodes are a GIANT dissapointment, i mean i never felt this mad about LEGO, but now i do. Out of all the missions, their are only 2 missions that have clones. The first then you meet Jenga fett, and the one where the clones betray you. Their is no missions that you play that have you acatualy help fight.missions are annyoing when they are not combat.You have to walk to a point, watch a cutscene, then walk to another point. it begins to feel redundentThe combat isnt really satisfying. Hold block and spam the melee button to win most battles. Sure you have a duel here and there but just kinda boring.They were also lazy about dialogue as their is no lip-syncing, just random mouth movements that imitate talking. This is more a feature i dont care much about though.Can't change graphics in-game as far is i seen, meaning you have to play the game, go to main menu, loosing progress in the mission, just to make sure you can make the game run better.Default keybinds kinda suck. For example, Left click is to throw the lightsaber, while Q (or E, whichever) was to melee. I think this is present in most LEGO games however.Shooting guns is essentialy aimbot, where as long as your in the general direction of their hitbox, your laser hits it.I feel the epesodes are short, compared to the older lego starwars. I'm unsure if their is chapter-epesodes or just chapters where you do everything. if its the first thing, than ignore this one.Way too much loading screens.You can't skip the intro to main menu screen, and fast travel takes up 30 seconds at most, but you will be using it a lot, while loading planets take a long time.Upgrade/skill point system sucks. it requires you to stop playing missions to explore a world to gain these. for the most part, these upgrades are useless however.No difficulty change as far as i can tell, meaning i'm locked to fighting against lasers that do miniscule damage.Not much directions in missions other than ""Go here"" or ""Defeat this person"". For example the droid factory, it took me 5 minutes to figure out i was supposed to destory a floating container, and the only hint to it was sparkles.too much walking, as far as i know, you must arive at a plannet, then go to the fast travel system to go to diffrent parts of the plannet.Tab menu is really cluttered, i still cant grasp what to do, because their is so many things, perhaps too many.Options (Menu, not in-game) are somewhat limited.Missing a bit of qaulity of life stuff. for example, you are told to purchase the running skill, yet their is no way to turn off automatic running, which sometimes leads you to being either too fast or too slow when following a person for a mission.Boss fights are hardly boss fights.Honestly i was quite dissapointed. Like i said earlier about bosses, you can mostly just spam the melee button, and given you avoid their attacks its a easy win. because their is no difficulty changer (as far as i know) i'm given too much time before the boss strikes to notice and move away from the AOE indicator, often having my fights taking little to no damage."

After playing every single one (not all to completion) I can safely say even before finishing the entire game that this is the best. They have improved on everything that the other lego games tried to do. An incredibly interesting open world and way less focus on stretching out missions as long as possible. With recent titles I've gotten bored completing missions because they are so tedious. However, the missions in this game are short and to the point, sometimes even too short. (but that isn't a bad thing)Combat isn't amazing by any means but it's actually interesting and you need to pay some attention. While most upgrades don't really do anything for combat it's amazing that you can actually upgrade character abilities. Despite that it isn't perfect it is still by far the best combat in any lego game. The story is the star wars movies so I can't say much bad about that. I won't even lie either some of the cutscenes even made me laugh; for humor directed at kids I'm glad I can still laugh at it. One minor annoyance and I assume this has to do with licensing issues but man do I hate the new voice actors. I'm not sure why they weren't able to get the rights to at least most of the actors dialogue or maybe this was just a creative choice, no idea. I seriously can't praise them enough for how amazing this game is. Lego games have become so boring to me and this was such a refreshing entry into the lineup. Thank you TT for really putting a ton of effort into making a great game, it really shows."

This game did not disappoint, with amazing graphics, great story and game-play and the witty comedy u can expect from lego games which brought a smile to my face multiple times throughout playing. Its hard to find anything to fault with this game, maybe just some long levels that are based on scenes that got very few minutes airtime in the films have slightly tedious and long missions in this game (Droid factory on geonosis, search for Luke on hoth etc.) Overall, would definitely recommend to any fans of star wars or lego."

The ships are so SO well designed, ships wings change formation when boosting, the gunshots sounding so satisfying, and again.. the graphips are so beautiful in space, it doesn't feel like a lego game AT ALL. Take your focus away from all the lego bricks and studs, and it wont feel like a lego game at all. It looks so realistic!!!Anyway, the way they tell the story is pretty good! But could be better. There are some glitches in the game, tho the day of writing this, its only been a few days since launch. The major bugs like game crashing will be gone in no time.

Missions soft lock, players randomly get thrown in a death loop, things get checked or unchecked randomly, geometry just disappears, textures will flicker or disappear or swap for some reason, dialogue will not play or loop forever, innocent accidental sequence breaking can make a mission uncompleteable, swapping characters at the wrong time can just crash the game or break a mission, upgrades will just stop working, guns can spawn with no ammo or you'll be unable to drop them or both, doing another space side mission while doing a story mission in space marks it imcomplete forever even if you got the rewards, doing any space side mission will spawn all captured ships with very low textures and no collision but you won't be able to see anything since they're so big, falling out-of-world is constant, unlocked characters will sometimes just be unpurchasable,... At one point I was in Otoh Gunga and the game just randomly started spawning millions of fish that swam through everything and crashed my whole PC. The list goes on and on. What I'm saying is that it is a fun LEGO game, but also one of the buggiest games I've ever played.

The only problem I've had is during the segments where it incorporates 2 different groups of people. In the level ""Droid Factory Frenzy"", the game SEVERELY dropped frames throughout the whole level. Only during the cut scenes was it smooth. I have decent specs and was able to run the game at a solid 120 FPS with high settings, but even with turning all the fancy graphics off, and all settings on low, it still dropped frames insanely during this specific segment. It was somewhat playable but it ruined the whole experience of the level for me. I hope these sections don't lag like this again when they come up. Can people try to let me know if they have the same issue? other then that I'm looking forward to playing the rest of the game. Just hope that gets fixed so I can experience it like normal."
2659,Ripliner,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ripliner/,1,,1,7.4,April,"9,",152,0,1,"This is a difficult rate.  Ive played through episode 1 and 2, and am now mid way in episode 3.  If youve been looking for a starwars game, this will do.  However, it is a bad lego game.  When i think back to the last three starwars lego games, the complete saga, the trilogy, and starwars 3, the first thing i notice is the lack of puzzles.  Puzzles in lego games were a staple of the franchise, little things that always kept you thinking, but they are almost non existant in this game.  Thats not to say that the skywalker saga is a bad game, its good, but if you go into it with the expetation of the last three, and their story style, you will be dissapointed.  Another thing ive noticed that is super off putting is how much time they put into the story of starwars.  The key moments are there, but they are short.  If i wasnt super well versed in the lore of the franchise id be supper confused constantly with how quick they want to move the story along.  Key moments are cut short, and i feel if they had just extended the cutscenes to be a little longer, just by maybe 10 seconds, the weight of the story could have been more expressed.  But onto the good.  The game is openworld-ish.  There are tons of places that you can walk around in, like the open segments of new games, except on every major planet and area within the story of starwars.  The characters sound amazing, near identical to their film and cartoon counterparts.  Little bits of dialogue while youre escorting people are a nice touch too, and i think thats one of the main complaints people have, the escorting.  And i think the reason people have that problem is because every lego starwars game before this, the cutscene took out the middle part of walking to and fro, however this is, for better or worse, open world, so you actually have to go between areas.  YOU actually have to hop in a ship and pick which planet to go to, you have to navagate between the different levels of corosaunt.  And if you go into this thinking itll just hurry you along, youll probably be caught off guard.  I will update this when i get deeper into/finish the game, but as of right now, this game is a yes from me.  Sure it has its problems, and sure some things are lacking.  But its lego starwars, and if youre a fan of the franchise, youll like it."

Level design and storyIt's such a shame, the open world is so vast and beautiful - but everything in this game just feels like it's a vehicle for the abundance of collectables. This isn't a bad thing when implemented well with actual gameplay that the player enjoys, but I just don't. Every single mission can be cleared in under 10 minutes, then you're in the open world for until the next one. You spend more time in the open world then in the missions themselves. The mission designs are boring and repetitive, small boss fights lasting 5 minutes at best or a space battle. There's no memorable missions thus far in the game and it's a real shame as that was what made collectables so alluring in the original LEGO Star Wars games. It was because the missions were so fun and jam-packed with things to do that I wanted to go back and get them. But now, the game consists of really short boring missions followed by a terrible cutscene that tries desperately to tell 30mins worth of story in 2 minutes and then you're back in the open world.This is not everything either, the menus feel so clunky, really bad pacing (even for a LEGO game) and the bugs I've encountered - while few and far between, have been game breaking, one made it so I can't progress through the story at all by locking off the next mission start icon Maybe I've just become too jaded and my expectations were too high since I last played a LEGO game (Star Wars III Clone Wars) but I was really underwhelmed by the lack of fun and meaningful gameplay. This is by no means saying this game is bad, but for me, after being delayed 2 years. It was underwhelming."

I guess if you likee, hardcore speedrun you _might_ be able to beat them that fast?But I've done some light to medium exploring while doing episode 1 so I think that person might've been very much exaggerating. I think, had I not explored, I'd have maybe finished ep1 in an hour to an hour and a half? The game's fun. It's got a lot of good, added humour. If you like Star Wars, you'll probably enjoy this."

It doesn't entirely feel like you're replaying one of the older LEGO games in the series. Now the negatives. I'm hopeful most of these issues will be sorted soon enough, but, this game thus far has given me a lot of troubles such as not saving the refresh rate and resolution of my monitor when tabbed out and back in, borderless windowed, more often than not, will still show the taskbar and the game will be an incorrect resolution, some levels such as the droid factory has abysmal performance with sub 20 fps where other sections i will get 150+ fps."

The visuals are stunning, first your walking and fighting you way through a ship then put into a breathe taking water level. And the sound track is straight flame put drake on the track and you've got a banger hands down, gaining #1 worldwide charts and going plat in the first week.

There's a lot to collect and little side objectives to do. I do have some negatives about the game though. During one part whenever I tried to switch my character the camera froze and I needed to return to the main menu and start up the game again to resume playing. Then there were two different times my screen just turned black, I needed to X out the game and start it again. Other than that everything seems very well done I just hope that's fixed soon."

2818,Diamond_City,https://steamcommunity.com/id/diamond_city/,1,,1,34.4,April,"7,",14,1,1,In preparation for this release I have been 100% all my previous Lego games. Comparing that experience to having almost finished A New Hope I can honestly say the amount of extra material in this game is AMAZING! I will say that the amount of open world activities is what got me to the almost 4 hour game time in A New Hope and not levels themselves. I'd recommend this game simply for the mixture of unique mechanics in game and cool experiences.
2819,Chiakuu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chiakuu/,1,,1,43.3,April,"7,",96,0,1,"Now that the release excitement has worn off, Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga (TSS) is a very visually impressive game, but falls short of the originals in my opinion. I have heard that it is more of an open world pretending to be a episodic game, and I agree - especially on Kashyyyk. It is very much an open world with an occasional objective, rather than a dedicated level like The Complete Saga (TCS) has. The open world is nice, and has challenges to discover and solve, but the challenges range from the brick being behind some junk on the ground to the Yavin IV puzzle board that if you have discovered it you know what I am talking about. Still haven't solved it. The Open World also feels very small at times when you discover red barriers and/or are just unable to walk any farther. At least finally a game lets you explore Coruscant, even if you don't get to see much. Also the podracing level is awful in TSS and made me feel sick.One big thing missing from The Skywalker Saga that I sorely miss is the Bounty Hunter missions from earlier games, specifically TCS. In TCS there is a short and sweet mode where you and a group of bounty hunters have a target to find in a short time period. It is an incredibly simple mode, but the premise I love - playing as a group of bounty hunters hired with a mission to complete. TCS is better in that regard than The Clone Wars III (TCW) because instead of being a group like in TCS you have to switch between them in TCW. In TSS there is neither of those - the closest is a search for Bossk. A thing that I thought was clever in TCS's Bounty Hunter mode was also that the droids with you (eg IE-88) could hack droid panels as they are bounty hunter droids - that makes sense. In The Skywalker Saga they do not have that ability at all, nor does anyone else.I love the idea of bounty hunter missions - which Star Wars Battlefront 2015 had a version of - but in TSS it is missing entirely. It makes me so sad to see such an amazing idea left behind.The controls in TSS arent as bad as Lego Star Wars The Force Awakens (TFA) - they are less distracting and awful than TFA was compared to the original games, but to be honest I still prefer the simplicity of the original games. In TCS it was simple controls that you could just relax and play - in The Skywalker Saga it seems overly complicated in some aspects and just doesn't feel as clean and simple as TCS. Even if the controls can be overly complicated, the game is still missing out on the small details on characters. For instance, the original games just felt like they had more uniqueness between characters - almost every character in a class in TSS has the exact same abilities, no matter what. They just feel less unique to me, even though there is more options for characters to differ. Going back to the bounty hunter missions, I thought it was incredibly clever and sleek that the droid bounty hunters could hack the panels! But in TSS there is really no special things between characters - they may do different attacks when you spam a button compared to other characters in their class, but at the end of the day that isn't something you'd see in regular combat unless you specifically go looking for it. Those special attacks - for instance Boba Fett will use either a flamethrower or a grapple after you attack and then spam B - aren't even needed in regular combat. 9 times out of 10 you can just shoot and dodge and win combat, or just punch the enemy and occasionally switch buttons when they block. Those different combat abilities also are not helped by the awful voice acting in a lot of instances - I'm sorry, but adult Boba's voice just grates on my ears. The space combat is also sorely disappointing, especially based on the trailer. Episode III's Chapter 1 (Battle over Coruscant) from TCS is completely missing in TSS - that was such a cool space battle, even if it was on rails, but its just a cutscene in TSS. The general space combat in TSS is just disappointing - it is more in-depth than older lego games, but at the same time space seems completely empty. For instance, you can jump to a planet and join dogfights that are happening overhead - thats all you'll ever see in combat. There is no capital ships in orbit when you arrive, there is nothing interesting besides a tug of war you can join. Even Bigg's space mission is sad - you have to escort cargo to Yavin IV while getting attacked on the way, but when you're attacked its just by short range TIE fighters that should not have been able to stop you without a carrier. You defeat the fighters like 5 times with them increasing in number, and that is it. Even when you arrive at Yavin IV you just defeat more fighters and you're done. There is nothing to see in space, no interesting battles to fight, nothing. The only time you really see capitol ships in space is in Episodes like in Empire Strikes Back when escaping from Hoth, but thats for 30 seconds. The comedy in TSS is also way weaker than TCS - its visual comedy is still funny, but it is just no-where near the gold that the original was. For example, Darth Vader no longer holds up a family photo to convey that he is Luke's father - its just mumbles that you understand from seeing the movie. It has its moments, even if the voice acting drags it down, but it still doesn't stand up. One other thing they changed that I find incredibly sad is Episode III Anakin Vs Obi-Wan. In TCS Obi (P1) and Anakin (P2) had to escape from the facility collapsing the entire time until they reached the final island, and then it was P1 vs P2. Throughout Episode II and III you and P2 had been through everything together, and at the final end it was Sibling vs Sibling, player vs player. To me that was perfect, very creative, and perfectly invoked the feeling of brother vs brother in Anakin VS Obi-Wan. In TSS it is just a standard boss battle with P2 being the droids, and thats it.To sum it up, The Skywalker Saga is a visually impressive game that falls short of the originals. Its visually impressive, technically impressive if overly busy-feeling, but its comedy, storytelling, levels, space combat, voice acting, and lack of a bounty hunter missions mode hold it back greatly. The open world has plenty of stuff to explore, but there isn't much to see besides kyber crystals to collect. You can explore Coruscant finally, but its the small movie-slices that you would expect. The characters do not feel unique for the most part, which is very disappointing. However, the big thing that brings down TSS to me is the lack of the bounty hunter missions - I really did think those were so much fun and so unique in TCS.  It may seem small to you, but it's just something that i really enjoy in Star Wars games and really brought TCS up even farther than it already was.Also they removed LEGO Yoda death scream, that is a crime."

This game has brought me back to my childhood as well as taking the old games and taking everything to new heights! This game does have a few bugs and optimisation issues (I have a 3900X and RTX 3080 and was getting like 20-40fps in the Geonosis factory mission), but that doesn't mean they can't roll out a couple of updates to fix these issues. I am reliving my childhood here and I can't lie, after completing episodes 1, 2, 3 and 4, it is a masterpiece so far for me. Also the main missions aren't where it ends.

It's a revitalization from the original lego formula but that classic lego experience is not missing. My friend who got this game too who saw nothing on this game before buying it, just knew it was a lego star wars game with all 9 movies. When he was in the middle of starting episode 4 for the first mission he said, ""oh this is a game game not just a lego game.""Level design is amazing, optimization has been good (but I am on a monster rig of an 11th gen i7 and a 3080ti), graphics are amazing. Only had one problem with optimization in the geonosis droid factory. I had 4 playable characters in separate parts of the level and it was hardcore dropping performance. Like 100 fps down to 30 or less. After the characters got closer to each other in the level this improved. The only other gripe I have about this game is how some cutscenes seem very choppy. But that's not really an issue. Id rather have some cutscenes choppy sometimes than an incomplete or broken game. I have had 1 total crashes so far in 15 levels. The open world aspect of this game is also very well designed. If you love old lego games from tt games this one will be very enjoyable and fresh. With a crash course like story for each episode of star wars. Some have been saying there should of been a harder difficulty for people in this game and I think some forgot the key audience of a lego games being kids. Due to this the game's puzzles and battles are fairly straight forward and battles specifically a lot easier if you have played video games for a long time. Don't expect a dark souls level of depth in lightsaber combat. Its a lego game."

It feels as if you´re reliving your past. This game feels to me now exactly like how The Complete Saga felt to me when i was younger.

I lost several hours of progress and several episodes worth to a single Crash-To-Desktop error. Therefore I cannot recommend this game until this issue is fixed.As someone who grew up on the PS2 classics such as the first and second LEGO Star Wars, and other LEGO games of that era, it's amazing to see the direction they've taken it in.I am not a paid reviewer and I'm generally cynical of AAA titles these days, usually SJW pandering ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and I can't lie, this is the first game I've ever pre-ordered. It delivers on expectations, and exceeds them.This is a must buy for LEGO fans, Star Wars fans and everyone in between.Many new features you didn't think a LEGO game would be able to pull off, but does and well.Runs surprisingly well on a decent but older now PC, shocked at how well a 2018 computer can run a 2022 game.Graphics are nothing short of gorgeous, honestly. Eye candy to the max.Few bugs and glitches, but for a day one/day two release it's held up amazingly well.The humour is on point, definitely captures that old LEGO slapstick style of the older games, and the dialogue adds to it, it doesn't detract. Mumble mode is literally just that, replaces voices with subtitled mumbles. It isn't redone in any way so you're better off with the voices for context and emotion.Side quests and open explorable environments in my LEGO game? It's more likely than you think!Main story missions are a fun, if a little brief reimagining of the older games, you won't be playing the same old levels from TCS, but entirely new sections (with a lot that harkens back to the old levels)It's day two as of review writing, I started playing at like 10AM this morning, it's now 6PM and I'm already half way through the fourth episode, the bulk of the longevity of this game will come from the side missions, exploration and collection, however the campaign is thoroughly enjoyable and would hold up as a standalone game in it's own right.TL;DR: it's everything you ♥♥♥♥♥♥' expected and a hell of a lot more. GTFIH and buy it. You'll thank me later frens."

The fight combat is awesome and the world is huuuuge. It's the free world roaming Star Wars game we wanted.The episodes' stories seem a little rushed if you ask me but It's ok. I mean they included some parts which weren't in the Complete saga (which to be honest, will remain my favorite Lego game ever, Skywalker saga comes second, I think I can blame the nostalgia for this xD). To be honest, I would have waited for another year if they would have not neglected the story missions. I mean, I can see they put their priorities in the open world which is beautiful but it's a little bit disappointing that the episodes were made in a rush. I know they did a lot of overtime in making the game and I respect the developers. Just saying that they could have made a better job on story missions. Story missions from Episodes 4, 5 and 6 are the most well done in my opinion.The game lacks in replaybility. What I mean by that ? If you want to replay an episode, you can replay just the five levels you can select from. You can't replay the first cutscene of the episode or the first part prior to the first story mission or the little parts between the story levels. Such a bummer. Hoping we will get a chance to replay the episodes at their fullest in a future update.I haven't encountered game-breaking bugs like most of the users, only minor bugs which I'm sure the developers will patch soon.Thank you, TT, for this cool game !May the Force be with you ! Always !"

There's not a lot of puzzle variety, all bosses are the same fight, and the UI is extremely cluttered. After all this time I was hoping for a somewhat modernized LEGO game but it's still a step back from previous titles and isn't any better than the original LEGO Star Wars. But since it's not $60, and it's LEGO, and it's got a decent length, and it's still boat loads of fun, and it's relatively glitch free, it's hard to care too much about its problems. The cutscenes are hilarious and you still get a lot of game for the money. If you bought Battlefield 2042, you probably wish you bought this one instead"

I blasted this game for 5 hours straight and I'm almost done with Episode 3. I've been having SO much fun and man.. this really is such an awesome game.

Graphics, textures, animation, level design, eye for details (like a micro star destroyer as holo projection), the epic John Williams score and well chosen voice actors. While the old formular (collect studs, revisit some areas after unlocking some characters with new skills) is still the same, presentation and gameplay went up some steps. Controls are very responsive too, while I recommend playing with controller.Best new feature is the free (very smooth) 3rd person camera which allows for better orientation and finally look around in the beautifully crafted levels. Jump sections are easier too with it. This game caters both, LEGO game aswell as Star Wars fans (I think they have about every character of the 9 episodes in this title). Old farts like me start with Episode IV - A New Hope, of course :PPerformance is great, maxed out settings in 2k resolution run with stable 60 FPS on my system:i7-8700K, 32 GB, RTX 2070 Super, Soundblaster Z, installed on a Samsung 870 EVO SSD"

Passing the years LEGO became my hobby and many sets came and went. LEGO and Star Wars became a thing and in 2005 I bought LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game. MAN I was blown away by it. So much fun. Later on we had the Complete Saga of the LEGO video game and now in 2022 we have the entire Skywalker Saga in a LEGO game and let me tell you. It's friggin awesome.If you are a lifelong fan of LEGO and Star Wars this is it. Look nog further.The graphics, the detail, the sound, the ambiance. It's all there.

This game has revolutionized my thoughts, I am no longer a raging racist. I attribute this to the character Jar-Jar. The character Jar-Jar is an open-minded loveable character, Jar-Jar's character provokes so much emotion, during my 3rd speedrun attempt, I broke into tears, seeing such a small creature have a massive impact on the game like that, makes me so happy, it shows that the little man still has a shot at making it big. It shows that no matter who you are you can do anything you put your mind to. Jar-Jar has inspired me in so many ways, sometimes at night, I will sit at my desk, staring at pictures of Jar-Jar he gives me inspiration he gives me the willpower to do what I want to do. Jar-Jar has been there for me when no one else was. When I first purchased this game, I hated the thought of touching the grass, I hated the thought of an outside world. This game has shown me that there is more to life than just games, there is a whole new life outside. Although since buying this game I have been diagnosed with Insomnia, Bi-Polar Depression 2, Schizophrenia, as well as a host of physical illnesses, like partial paralysis in my lower body. Aside from that, my mind has never felt better, I feel mentally aware and feel as if I am ready to take on the world. Sometimes at night, I think about how I can achieve greatness and how I can leave my mark on this world, and that is by playing this game that is by finishing this amazing game. As one of my good friends once said ""The worst part of having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don't."", This game showed me that I don't have to suppress my thoughts I don't have to act like a normal person I can be who I am. This game has changed my life for the better, I still hope one day I will be able to feel the warm embrace of a woman."

Something that is a clear upgrade from the previous Lego Star Wars games is the visuals. The game is downright gorgeous to look at and there were many moments where I paused just to marvel at how good it looked. The animations of the characters are fluid and expressive and the lighting in particular is simply fantastic. A few levels here and there were quite enjoyable such as ""Reap What You Solo"" and ""Boarding Party"".HOWEVER…This game is filled with a plethora of issues and I’m going to go through the ones that are the most damaging to its quality.It’s been made pretty clear by multiple sources that this game’s development was a nightmare. The team were pushed to meet a deadline and this resulted in the game feeling incredibly rushed and nowhere is that more apparent than in just how buggy this game can be. During my time playing Story Mode, there were frequent issues regarding enemy spawns, enemies simply not dying and forcing me to reload, cutscene and in-game frame rate stuttering and straight-up crashes. Every game is going to have a few blemishes here and there but this is frankly unacceptable. When the game is crashing or forcing you to replay the entire level this frequently it is a huge problem and I am of the firm belief that the game shouldn’t have been released in this state.Another issue I have with the game is that some of the voices they chose for select characters are pretty awful and don’t sound like their film counterparts. Qui-Gon Jinn, Kylo Ren, Padme and Anakin are all strong offenders here. I understand that Mumble Mode is an option but it’s clear the cutscenes were designed with it off, not to mention the fact the default setting has voices on. Not huge but definitely something worth mentioning.The music of all things is another thing that I feel would benefit from a tweak. As expected it is taken straight from the film OSTs as it was with the previous games but the problem lies in how it was applied. Many scenes are played with ill-fitting music, the best example that comes to mind is Vader’s death theme being played in the middle of Return of the Jedi but not in the actual scene itself. The music also has a tendency to bug out and simply not play at all which leaves some scenes feeling incredibly jarring.I think the biggest issue with this game is the gameplay itself. The Skywalker Saga deviates from the way the previous games were constructed in favour of a sort of hybrid between open world and individual levels. The number of levels has also been decreased to 5 which may seem like a minor change but it not only means parts of the films many people would want to play such as blowing up the Second Death Star are relegated to a cutscene but it also leaves everything in between the levels as mundane, repetitive walking between locations. These sections have a very strict formula:travel to location > interact with whatever it was you came to do > get told to go to next place > travel there > start the main missionThis will of course vary between levels but it is undeniable that there is a LOT of busy work running from location to location that could’ve easily been trimmed down to smooth out the game’s pacing. If I were to get cynical for a second I would say the levels were constructed this way so people would spend more time with the game and thus feel more satisfied with their purchase. Think of it like this, in Revenge of the Sith the game gives you the enthralling gameplay of playing as Padme through every single step of going from her apartment to Mustafar but you don’t get to blow up the Second Death Star. Such a bloody shame.Another aspect of the gameplay I’m not a fan of is the boss battles. For the most part, the lightsaber combat has been greatly improved, instead of blindly spamming the attack button the devs chose to implement a combo system. However, the fights themselves are a joke. Due to the main stories being shortened down you will be doing these one after another quite a lot which obviously gets very repetitious. There’s potential for something here but like many other aspects it feels like more time would have been to its benefit.As the game is now, it is incredibly hollow and unfinished. If the dev team were given another year or so this could’ve been something special. The blueprint for a solid experience here but it simply needed some more time in the oven.I have only played through the Main Story and a few hours of Free Play, that is the accepted caveat here but I was seriously unimpressed. There will undoubtedly be people who had fun and I wouldn’t take that away from anyone but I cannot for the life of me understand how someone could go through the Main Story and not get bored. By the time I finished The Rise of Skywalker I was completely done with the game and I don’t see myself picking it up to try out the rest of Free Play anytime soon. Overall, this game is an empty, repetitive, unfinished experience that I can’t in good conscience recommend you pick up. If you want a fun, well designed Lego Star Wars Game, just pick up The Complete Saga."

3197,ThePiachu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePiachu/,2,,0,76.9,May,"16,","1,374",0,1,"As a veteran LEGO player, this game is a mixed bag.The game focuses a lot more on open world exploration, giving you a lot more activities to do between missions. This means a lot of situations that would've been mission levels now aren't and instead you get to follow slow NPCs moving from point A to B as they spout lines from the movies. Heck, some things to do between missions is literally ""go from A to B, then from B to A, listening to dialogue"".Oh yeah, if you haven't played any LEGO game since the old Star Wars games - they use dialogue from the movies now. It robs the games of their pantomime charm and instead all the situations are mostly played straight with an occasional character being goofy to the side. If you know your Star Wars, you will be bored with this sooner than later.A lot of the levels feel more clunky than they have the right to. The Bigger Fish mission controls awfully, podracing is very much on rails and first person (it feels awful!), space sections overwhelm you with 100 markers for things to destroy, etc.The game does look very visually appealing for the most part. Everything is shiny plastic and well modelled. What's a bit jarring is when you notice some models have baked-in grime on top of it and it doesn't look that good.So yeah, the game is a mixed bag. Definitely has a lot of content and will keep you busy for hours, but it doesn't feel more fun to play than the original two Lego Star Wars games, which is unfortunate."

They are short in content, even if you destroy and explore much.The story also is hard to follow, because many parts of the movie are not compressed but rather just cut entirely.The tone is also off.Even for a lego game it is too light hearted, which destroys many of the good moments and even the little bit of thrill it still had.In comparison to the complete saga, the tone is the biggest take away for me.The humor again is dumped down. Better than latest lego games, but still worse than the complete saga.The voice acting is surprisingly good. Thought I had to play in mumble mod, but I changed my mind. It is not just a movie line rip off (or they are that good at hiding it).Mechanics:Many of the ""new"" mechanics, like choosing a path (stealth or rushing in e.g.) or interacting with a console are not that great.Choosing a path usually is very dissatisfying, because I always feel like I'm missing out on something.On occasions you can later pick the other option too in one run, but lock yourself away from certain areas.On the other hand, you can just replay the mission. So maybe I'm just picky.The new mechanics take much longer than the old ones. For example: C-3P0 consoles are now pretty much used for at least two classes and require you to solve a little minigame, which just takes up time and doesn't add other than that.Something I also noticed is, how little you have to build or solve puzzles in the main missions. It comes down to destroying objects and killing bad guys.Overworld:I'm very sure the game has been centered around the overworld, which I still really enjoy exploring.I think I spend over an hour just exploring Tatooine. Watching all the NPCs minding their business, reacting to me and finding hidden places. This I guess is the only reason I continue to play.Even if I talk ♥♥♥♥ about some of the animations later on, most of them are very well made. The reactions of the NPCs, their expression, movement etc. All looks very much alive and fitting.For example: shivering, weapon spinning, gestureBacktracking is usually very annoying to me, but the game offers you multiple routes for side quests. You can choose between different approaches and walk back a way other than you came from.Bugs/Performance/Unfinished stuff:What I noticed upon arriving in Mos Espa, are sometimes missing or bad facial animations. After speaking with 2-3 NPCs, I noticed how often the camera wasn't showing the NPCs face. I'm very sure this was an attempt to save up some animations on the NPCs faces. It isn’t that bad, just something that instantly struck me.Performance wise, I have little to no problems.I read about people having 30XX card and very bad fps.I play with a 3090 and 5900X and get consistently about 240fps with full-hd. Cards load is about 50%, CPU is not even feeling it. I also have other programs running in the background.Funny enough, performance has been the first thing I noticed.Because I though and still think the game is well optimized for today’s standard. On some occasions you see enemies pop in or objects disappear. But they still did a good job on that part.Aside from some missing/bad animations; the game also feels rushed. Especially in the main story. It is definitely not normal if a mission just has 2 to 3 sections. Get in, solve 2 puzzles, get out. Feels very cheap.The controls are also sometimes a pain in the ass. If I want to put my civilized weapon away, I very often unintentionally throw random people around. Switching between the characters is borderline annoying. Very often they are just miles behind me. For whatever reason they don’t seem to teleport. If you need one of your allies, you often have run the same length again, you just did with your main character, because everyone else thinks it is a great idea to wait 3 buildings away.No black screen, no crashes, etc. so far (Original Trilogy).Heavy fps drops in cutscenes thocomplete saga: 8,5/10skywanker saga: 5/10 for me so far"
3199,blyzardbeast,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198317509119/,4,1,0,18.1,March,6,92,0,1,the whole game is just a movie with quick time events that you cant lose n the missions are short like less than 5 minutes for most the bosses are not hard at all i sat for 20 minutes in one of the QTEs you have to spam a certain button to fill the circle up and nothing happened its possible to make a game for kids and make it difficult just because its for kids doesn't mean you have to make it literally impossible to lose.  i remember playing the old LSW (complete saga and 3) games and getting stuck.  why isn't this the same i want to feel challenged and if i don't there is no satisfaction
3200,Sorys,https://steamcommunity.com/id/soryss/,5,,0,0.8,April,"21,",42,0,1,"God I so wanted this to just be a good update to the original lego star wars games. I grew up playing the very first and second lego star wars games as well as the complete saga. I wanted this to be kinda how the complete saga was for the first and second games with some graphics modernisation. It very much isnt.Pros:- Graphically it is an awesome update and great to sight see- Combat is a bit more indepth than the original games* (check cons on block)- Sound is as good as ever for star wars- Animating the lips moving on the characters even during mission as well as when they exert themselves is greatCons:- After you do a handful of the Kyber bricks you start to realise how daunting of a challenge the collection of all of them is going to be on top of the minikits and red bricks from original games- Story missions frankly suck. they are so compressed and dumb down that it is a real shame. Evidently i have not played through much of the game but having read a few other reviews it just goes to show how much of an issue it is- They removed the block button? I know this sounds a bit weird but timing blocks as a jedi was always cool now it kinda just seems like it auto deflects back to the person shooting. you use to have to time that?- The great graphics kinda seem like window dressing. There is a distinct feel of emptiness to the large areas which feel like they are trying to make up with good graphics but it just comes across like putting lipstick on a pig- Frame drops happen. this will no doubt be fixed for the most part but it does happen- Losing the ability to create custom characters. This one was really weird for me why would you remove something that worked and was fun such a bizarre one- Why make it rpg like with the skill tree upgrade? this just makes it so much more complicated than it needed to be. Why on earth make lego star wars into something it is not? Kyber Bricks were a bad add. All this has done is shift what was already mostly available in the game through red bricks and made them separate. - Finally doing what all open world/ open world lite games like this one do, and that is create unnecessary busy work to complete the gameThe only time I would recommend this game is if the complete saga version is not being sold, you have never played the complete saga and this is on sale for half the price they are currently charging. Sorry TT i know you guys poured your heart and soul into this one and were forced to deal with stupid crunch to get it done but this is a miss. Sadly think this is gonna be the last we see of lego star wars for a long time if not until disney decides to reboot the franchise which i doubt they will do with the TV shows they are churning out for the foreseeable future"

I played the crap out of the original LEGO Star Wars, and my feelings on this one are very mixed. I really like the new combo systems, and the skill trees are nice.  The humor lands surprisingly well for the target demographic as well (most of the time).  However, some of the levels have REALLY bad stuttering issues.  In one of the levels in episode 2, my usual ~100 fps dropped to 30 or less, and no matter what settings I changed, I couldn't improve it.  Besides performance, some of the ""boss"" encounters are SO bland that I actively got frustrated.  Very noticeable when facing Dooku twice in a row, then Grievous right after that.  Every fight is just take them down a bit, they run away, you face some trash enemies, do some simple puzzle, and they rejoin the fight.  I know it's to prevent you from just bursting them down and destroying any buildup, but it's still aggravating.I tried to get a refund, but I played too long to get one (since nostalgia wanted to give it a fair shake), so I will most likely eventually finish the game, and maybe the later episodes have a real upswing in quality, but for now, my review will remain negative.  Maybe if I notice an effort to fix performance, and the later areas are more engaging, I'll revisit it."
3208,Gene Takavic,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078993110/,2,,0,42.9,April,"22,",117,0,1,"Fun enough to mess around in playing split-screen, otherwise found the game to be a half-baked, overly simple mess.The puzzles are usually insultingly easy, the improvements to the combat mechanics over previous LEGO games are all in vain, as combat presents no challenge whatsoever. Original LEGO Star Wars games contained all of the gameplay mechanics a game like this could ever make use of. What's ""improved"" in this game is a failed attempt at reinventing the wheel, so to speak. Nothing is particularly well-tuned in this game, either. Tons of unimaginative mini-games, very weak space combat, and wonky 3rd-person shooting mechanics. This is overly complicating the traditional LEGO game formula, through-and-through.I believe if you're on the fence with this game, you're better off saving your money and grabbing The Complete Saga instead. No amount of new bells and whistles in this game can top the beautiful simplicity of classic LEGO Star Wars.*Update: I also forgot to mention the game has soft-locked on me twice in loading screens, and my fairly powerful PC is unable to keep the game playing at a solid 60FPS. Downright poorly optimized, at this time."

3212,King Link,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kinglink/,1,,1,3.1,December,"22,","2,772",0,1,"Returning the LEGO series to where it should be. I’ve played almost every LEGO game, and the more recent entries haven’t been as good, especially adding voice lines from the movies, or adhering a bit too much to the existing media.  LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga breaks with that trend and delivers an incredible game.   This is almost a full circle, bringing the series back to what started the modern LEGO Franchise games with Star Wars once again, and yet delivering an excellent experience for fans. Levels here focus on more than the original movies, like seeing parts of the original battle in New Hope ship from Leia and Captain Antilles' view.  There are 23 worlds you can free roam around including multiple locations.  There are mini-levels, open-world segments, tons of collectibles, and 300 characters from the games.  The amount of effort that went into this game is incredible.  I also appreciate that there’s still some good humor in the game even though it’s following the original stories, which is something the series has lacked for a bit.Though I am going to be just a touch negative. As good as everything is, a decent amount of the open world of the game is not LEGO, and that is why it looks great, but it also feels like cheating when it’s an environment almost any other game could be set in.  The majority of the game is like the previous LEGO titles, though there’s also a feeling like it’s a third-person shooter at times which is an odd change at first. Pick this up if you’ve liked previous LEGO games or Star Wars.  This revived my love for both of those fandoms and I’m happy to see a LEGO game like this, I’m only wondering where are they going to take this next.  I hope they revisit Harry Potter, Marvel, or DC with this style because there’s so much potential for the future with this.  I picked this up on Steam as well after playing a bit, also, Han shot first.

This game is everything that I personally always wanted in a Star Wars game and the reason that it’s only a 9/10 is because they removed a feature that we all took for granted in Lego games and that is the ability to customise your character which is a bummer and they also didn’t add online coop which would’ve been perfect in this game, maybe they will add it at some point but I doubt that. Other than that this game is packed with hours of content and exploration and sometimes it even gets a bit overwhelming which I like.Anyways this is a great game for the longtime Star Wars fans and the newcomers."

The old Lego games - where the characters mumble their merry way through all the cutscenes. I lost interest when they started talking, as a long with that the  was gone. And for me that, more than anything else, is a draw of a Lego game.That charm is also mostly gone here. Yeah, you can enable the mumble mode, but that fixes nothing. This game was written and directed with talking in mind, making the charakters artificially mumble does not suddenly remake the cutscenes into good slapstick.But that is my only complaint about this game. I had  playing it in coop with my husband. Being a Star Wars universe fan definitely add to that, but this game is just fun to play.There is always something immensely satisfying about smashing the whole world into a swirl of bricks and studs. :) But that's just an icing on the cake. The  is interesting and offers a wide variety of quests. None of them complicated, it's still a Lego game, but many quite amusing. There is many characters and vehicles to unlock and choose from. There are interesting locations and setpieces to find.This game is great for a bit of   - as it takes zero brain power to play (if you are not a literal child) but throws you into the world that is pleasing and vibrant enough to keep you engaged.Recommended for 'children' of all ages :)."

I was never much of a fan of some of the features that were included in earlier games like custom characters so I don't miss their inclusion. I never played the complete saga game as I only owned the individual games, Lego star wars 1,2, and 3. I feel like this is a great successor to those games even if it has no clone wars content which makes sense as it is focusing on the movies. I finished all of the content fairly quickly but still loved every second of it. I will say the character classes makes some characters less unique and makes a lot of characters feel the same, but that allowed for them to put in over 300 characters so I'm not complaining."

Very comedic but still loving of the movies you can tell the people who worked on it were glad to show how much they appreciate this world.Anyway, if you want to pick it up i recommend picking it up on sale, full price is well worth what you get here but sales certainly help if you're on a budget."

The camera is too freaking close to the characters. I have played games for years, and this one made me sick after 20 or 30 minutes of play with its camera. Not to mention boss battles, you immediately lock on them and you are unable to move freely through the scenario to decide how and when to attack. If the enemy jumps from side to side, be prepared to get dizzy very quick.2. The game is insultingly easy. So much so that I had to disable all visual helps, guides and ""tricks"" that come enabled by default. With them, there is zero motivation for me to explore. But even without them, you just fly through the levels in minutes by simply going from point A to B. What for? Why does it have to be so easy? Is this game intended for 5 y/o kids? Previous Lego SW Games were not, they offered a fair challenge, nothing to write home about but I never felt completing a 4x4 jigsaw puzzle.Yes it looks cools, and I heard (stop caring hours ago) that there are hundreds of characters.

3306,Michael,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ItsMikul/,1,,0,88.8,June,"4,","1,507",1,1,"A solid addition to the LEGO game franchise, with all the staples you'd expect from one and more. Simple but fun gameplay, top-notch humor, and a blend of linear and open-world levels make for a fun time for fans and non-fans of  alike. Only receiving a negative review due to excessive bugs, which can prevent progression and have gone largely unfixed since release. An easy recommendation for casual players, but not until a significant bug patch is released.  is the sixth LEGO-themed game adapting the popular  franchise, this time consisting of content from all nine of the main  films, dubbed ""The Skywalker Saga"". It's a casual action-adventure game that takes you through the story of the films, albeit retold in a much more humorous fashion, with the ability to play as hundreds of characters from across the franchise. If you've played other  games in the past, then you have at least a rough idea of what to expect already. My only prior experience with the series was  back in the late 2000's, which was a lot of fun; and needless to say that this game has improved on its design in many ways since then. Combat is mostly a mindless button-masher, especially if you're buying character upgrades that increase health or damage. You do have the option of increasing the difficulty by disabling these upgrades at any time, as well as disabling settings like aim assist and health regeneration; but there's no strong penalty for death regardless, so it's kind of a moot point. Any real sense of challenge stems from solving puzzles or finding secrets, and even those are more about good observation of your surroundings than anything. LEGO games are designed to be accessible to younger players, so the low difficulty doesn't come as a surprise; but players wanting a challenge are better off looking elsewhere. I found it to be almost relaxing, as it let stay engaged without needing to be laser-focused at all times, letting me catch up on podcasts or talk to friends as I explored the galaxy. Whether you consider this a positive or a negative is up to you, but I personally enjoyed the more casual experience.Story missions are basically the same as they've been for previous titles: linear levels with the goal to get from point A to point B, interspersed with some easy puzzles and combat segments, as well as a handful of collectibles to find if you opt to stray just a little off the main path. Some levels will deviate from this, like starship battles or boss fights with multiple phases that have you running around the map to catch them, but none of them shake up the formula too much. Each of the nine episodes contain only five story missions apiece, but in-between them you're allowed to explore open-world environments iconic to the series, like Mos Eisley on Tatooine or Cloud City on Bespin. Each of these is loaded with collectibles to find, side missions to unlock new characters and ships, and a ton of environmental and platforming puzzles to solve, so most of your time will be spent here. The last  game I played only had story missions and a small hub to access them all, so I was pleasantly surprised to see this addition, as . It's absolutely chock-full of quality jokes: simple puns, ""blink and you'll miss it"" sight gags, comedic renditions of classic scenes, references to internet memes and more can be found everywhere, though never so much as to make it tiring to sift through. It's boldly unafraid to poke fun at itself, and I'm fully convinced that the writers of these games are more attuned to the franchise and its community than the writers of its official works are. I've never been the biggest Star Wars fan, but I still got a lot of good laughs while playing, and I'd wager that more dedicated fans will manage to find even more than I did.I went into this game with the lofty goal of reaching 100% completion--not for any good reason, I've just always had a soft spot for ""collectathon"" style gameplay. Completion is less a test of your  knowledge or player skill, and more a test of your patience thanks to the sheer amount of quick and simple tasks to do. It takes a firm ""quantity over quality"" approach to placement of the main collectible, Kyber bricks, ensuring that casual players can still stumble on enough of them to buy a fair few character upgrades without needing to go too far out of their way. Missions that unlock characters or ships are more involved, but even these won't take more than a few minutes each to beat. There are a few small hurdles that can make it tough to find everything on a given planet, like the collectible tracker not accounting for subareas (e.g. inside buildings), or collectibles/missions that are unavailable until you complete another objective elsewhere in the galaxy. It's far from the hardest challenge in gaming, but you need to make generous use of the built-in hint system so you're not running in circles trying to figure out what you're missing. I did eventually accomplish my goal, and while I don't regret having done it, I do admit to a huge sense of relief when it was finally over.  Explore each planet to your heart's content, but don't stress over doing every single thing unless you really like the gameplay or you're a die-hard completionist. I originally planned to list off the bugs I ran into during my playthrough to really accentuate this point, but there ended up being so many that I figured it would take up too much of my available word count to try and list them all. Most of them were minor visual/gameplay bugs, but some would force me to restart the game just to continue whatever mission I was doing (if it didn't crash the program outright), and other players have reported bugs in multiple areas that completely prevent them from progressing. It's been two months since release, and although we've seen DLC character packs and minor Steam updates devoid of patch notes, there seem to have been no updates that substantially fix the problems I and other players have had. Until this issue is addressed, I can't in good conscience recommend picking it up yet, lest you be one of the unlucky players that can't even finish the game they paid for."

Though I must make it clear that this is NOT meant to just be a remaster of The Complete Saga, this is it's own game. There are many things this game does very differently from the original. (Rip platforming)I like most of the side quests and puzzles, the graphics are fantastic, it's *mostly* well optimized (that geonosis factory mission could use some work lol). The combat is almost souls like but simple enough to get the hang of pretty quickly. The humor is about what you would expect from a Lego game.  The class system is not something I was expecting but I really like it, being able to upgrade specific class trees over others is pretty cool.I only have a handful of real gripes with The Skywalker Saga. While the open world is absolutely massive, the actual missions feel quite short and they can be a bit repetitive at times. A lot of the bosses felt too easy, even with auto health regen off, yeah I know this is still mostly meant to be a kids game but I would have liked a more difficult option regardless. No character creator kinda sucks but modders have already figured that out.Also no online co-op, bruh.I've seen others saying this game is really buggy but I myself didn't really encounter any major ones at all so I can't comment on that.There's a number of things I could nitpick (please give us our R2-D2 flight back lol) but the pros outweigh the cons. If you liked other Lego games you'll probably like this as well, 8/10."

There are way too many framedrops, glitches and bugs wich literally force you to reload the level.For completion you have to collect 1000+ Kyber Bricks, wich becomes very repetitive and boring. Villains and Story Characters end up way differently than in the movies (e.g.  )In Boss fights you have a forced camera angle and the fight itself is the very same every time.The Petranaki-Arena and many other areas from the old games just seem dead due to lack of enemies.Side quests repeat themselves with travelling to many planets and through space fights only to get spawned into an asteroid over and over again wich breaks the game.The space battles and flying mechanics are a joke.And so much more.It's not all negative - don't get me wrong. The first story playthrough except for said missing loyalty to the original franchise was brilliant. There are many nice things to say about this game but after 85+ of frustration and decay of the last active braincells im done with this game. I now have completed it only to never play it again. . .wich is sad and can't be said about the original LEGO games.Compared to the previous LEGO Star Wars Games and all in all it's a good thought but (for me) became more and more frustrating the further you got in the game.60€ for this cluster of glitches, crashes and bugs - come on!Props to my friend  for sharing my suffering with this playthrough."

In any of the fighting, you just have to spam hit Q and you can complete most missions without dying.There is no challenge to any of the levels, I remember in the original version, the pod race took me so many tries to finally complete, in this version it took one try. The main levels leave you feeling dissatisfied, and there is only 5 per movie which feels a little weak.Every cool fight scene from the movies is turned into a cut scene that you don't get to interact with and all of the boss fights involve repeating the same action over and over. Spam hit Q, press buttons on command, repeat, that is every single boss battle.Some of the side missions/challenges are stupidly complex and the game gives you no clue how to figure them out even with buying the hints. The best example is the Explo-Sith challenge where you specifically have to use a scoundrel and shoot the right spot. All the hint tells you is ""use the environment to kill a sith trooper"", so you're left fumbling around the level, trying all the logical stuff. Challenges like this force you to google the solution which is a perfect sign of a poorly designed game. There are also a bunch of challenges that just make you waste time running from point to point, not even collecting items just chatting and then running off to the next point.Overall it just feels like a game that was partially stuck together and thrown out to the public.The worst part of this game is the fact that the developers completely ignored the Clone Wars and Rebels which adds a lot more depth to the story and should have been somewhat included in the game."

Wait for a deep deep deep sale.This was the worst Star Wars experience I've ever had in a game, especially one that had absolutely zero right to screw up as badly as it did. If you have any passion for Star Wars, its stories and emotion, and you loved the Lego Complete Saga, just play that again. There is about less than 10 minutes of cutscenes or important story sequences per episode. Every serious or emotional scene has been disrespected by some need to cram humor in instead. I understand its a Lego game, I love Lego games and have played the vast majority of them to completion but this one just left a bad taste in my mouth. Everything that should have been great fell short of what it should have been. Pros:1) Visually, its fantastic. They more or less nailed the look of the hub worlds. The Uscru District on Coruscant was my absolute favorite, it felt dense, very much reminded me of the visual feel of Cyberpunk 2077 (no matter your opinion of the state of the game). Mos Espa and Mos Eisley were amazing as well. They really captured the feel of Star Wars cities.2) That is about it.Cons:1) The story chapters/missions. This should have been the bulk of the game. I know with hub worlds there would be a lot of collectibles, but they should have put a lot more into the actual story. Obviously no one is playing this without knowledge of the plots of the different episodes, but there are vast sections of story that are either missing or condensed into seconds or minutes. The actual pacing of the story and its missions are terrible. With 5 missions per episode, the game moves through the plot with lighting speed. While playing any particular episode's story, you play both the 5 story missions and also have to travel in the respective hub world to get to the next mission. I liked that concept to a degree, but they failed at recreating sections of the episodes that should have been incorporated. When R2 escapes the Lars homestead, Luke and C3P0 set out to find him. Do you use Luke's landspeeder? No. You walk. You walk for 10 seconds to tusken raider camp that is essentially your next door neighbor in terms of distance. Repeat another 10 second walk to get to Obi-Wan's home. Luke training with Yoda was an in-between sequence. It should have been a full mission. I think I spent less than 5 minutes from landing on Dagobah to leaving Dagobah. These sequences between missions showed that the developers did not care to capture the Star Wars experience. Previous titles that operated in this manner (Lego LotR/Hobbit and even The Force Awakens) absolutely got the story pacing right. The cutscenes in the missions shows this too. Qui-Gon dies after Darth Maul is cut in half. Jango Fett dies by having a Republic Gunship landing on him. The Battle of Geonosis doesn't even exist. There is no battle over Coruscant. Grievous takes selfies inside his ship as he flies away from the trade federation cruiser. Obi-Wan and Anakin have no farewell. Obi-Wan and Grievous's fight takes place entirely in the hangar where Obi-Wan drops down in. No wheelbike chase. And Grievous is killed by Obi-Wan throwing his lightsaber into his chest. I really don't want to rant and continue but every story sequence made me cringe because it was so abysmally disrespectful to Star Wars fans.2) Character selection: There are not 380 character in this game.  There is far less than that. Every costume counts as a character, so the nearly 30 characters taken up by Poe Dameron, Finn, and sequel trliogy Leia may help demonstrate the real lack of characters. There are multiple character classes and nearly all of them play the same. Jedi, Hero, Smuggler, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Villain, Sith, Atromech, and Protocol Droid. All these classes have abilities to upgrade using kyber bricks as a currency (there are nearly 1200 to collect in the game) and 90% of the abilities serve no purpose. There is also another category of characters called ""Extra."" This category of 70-80 characters is useless. They have no abilities, no weapons, and can only punch. The game does not utilize them in any capacity. There is not a single point in the game where you had to use a Sith character. Over half of the characters you can unlock in this game are duplicates. 3) Space Exploration/Combat: All ships are the same and all space gameplay was unenjoyable. A massive let down. Something like 90 ships to unlock and I lost interest in choosing a different ship after changing them 3-4 times."

They kept this game true to the original and added more things that made it even better than the original: - open world exploration- the game being fully voice acted- side quests - etc!The one thing I really hoped this game could have (maybe a potential update to consider in the future) is true multiplayer. It would have been nice to be able to connect to maybe two or three online friends to play together rather than the split screen multiplayer this game offers."

The game also looks gorgeous and has a lot of details particular to the actual lego pieces. It's really fun noticing them all! However, my love ends there.These levels are very short. Each Episode has six chapters, and they are all pretty short, and that super sucks. Some levels are fine in length, like the final Maul and Anakin fight I remember being fine, but still. And to be fair, you do get a big open area before a new zone typically, but it's just exploring and trying to find collectibles, and also sometimes being told that you don't have the ability to get the collectible until way later- despite having the required character type for it. IMO these open areas don't make up for these short levels at all. Another issue I take up with the game is its co-op, and how terrible it feels. I always loved co-oping these games but good lord is the camera just the worst here. it just splits it down the middle vertically and is just not that fun to go through. And don't even get me started on the fact that there's no online co-op whatsoever. IIRC The Complete Saga only had online co-op in a bonus town level where you run around breaking and building stuff, and that's whatever- but how have we not gone from that to full level co-op in the fourteen years since? And yeah you can absolutely just steam remote play it together but then you have that awful camera. I think the last negative I have is this game's voice acting. This game has voice acting, and it's good! It's good, don't get me wrong, but it's dialogue and general humor isn't funny or as charming in comparison to the pantomiming of the originals. Yeah mumble mode exists- but it sounds awkward, and the scenes don't work with it. I switched off of it really quick because it really just kinda makes the game worse. I think maybe the voice acting would've been fine if the humor was just different. There's a lot of random ""that's not supposed to be there haha lol"" type humor here and its so constant and down your throat and not funny that it just takes me out of it everytime.To end: Growing up I loved those old games (much like anyone reading this review). I 100%'d the first three SW releases alongside the first Indiana Jones game (fell off while doing Batman. Would like to try that again some day). I hold a very special place in my heart for their fun and simple gameplay and unique pantomime humor, so I really am bummed I don't '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ slam dunk' love this game. Again, it ain't bad, but for me, I think it's been long enough that a revisit to TCS would be a more fun time."

Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

It felt like a real step up in ambition compared to the previous Lego games. But could it remain the charm of the older games?, How is the voice acting?, How much creativity was put into the Collection of Kyber Bricks?, Is the DLC’s worth it? The graphics were top notch, Humor was really on point and well thought out with a lot of popular references and it was clear the developers loved Star wars. I loved the Voice acting and i much prefer it to the old mumble mode, they really did a great job finding voice actors (some being the actual ones, c3po/lando for example, clone wars) The kyber bricks were at points very similar to collect, but I mostly had fun collecting them all over the galaxy. It reminded me a lot of Super mario odyssey, it of course doesn’t live up to the quality of collecting power moons :D. I enjoyed the fact that they were all uniquely named though, it was fun seeing all the puns. :In my opinion this is the best Lego game by far, It did suffer from a lot of bugs, but I was absolutely fine with it. The character roster were great with a lot of obscure characters having voice acting and unique movements. The interactions between characters were hilarious to discover and I’m sad the devs didn’t get to add as many as they had planned. As usual in these games the grind around 65-85% is a bit boring, but once you get towards the end it’s very much worth it for me :) I have 100%’d two lego games so far, this and Lego Marvel Superheroes 1!I would rate this 9/10, with the former a 8/10!

I'm currently working on grinding out my way to 100% completion and oh boy does it take some time! Supposedly there is roughly 90 hours of content & after just getting to 33 as of writing this review it certainly seems that way. I'm glad the game is this long but I feel it's starts to get boring during these end game grind hours. Challenges are a lot of back and forth missions repeating similar tasks such as traveling between 2 planets but getting ambushed 3x times (this happens a lot for side quests) with only a few key challenges having something that feels relatively unique. They bragged about the character count being so high, but do I really need 16 different versions of an astromech droid in alternate colours or rebel soldier/pilot with different names? Not really & most of them felt like filler characters just to bulk up that roster. Don't get me wrong the option is nice but I would have much rather seen bonus popular characters from TV shows as a replacement for half of these recolour/slightly different skins characters.This game as of current has a lot of bugs. From NPC's getting stuck behind objects, which in turn locks your camera at a set angle if the quest is waiting on them to get to a position to talk to, Capital ships showing up in the middle of space quests having you clip inside them and do space battles inside of their model (even when you don't have a capital ship active), random crashes, really bad optimisation in some set pieces such as the dreaded droid factory (rip my fps I get about 20 in there) for lower end devices and sometimes a quest NPC just isn't where it is meant to be or is invisible.I've been rather negative in this review but it's worth a play if you're a Star Wars fan & I still recommend giving it a try, though Lego Star Wars A Complete Saga is still in my opinion an overall better experience as the story feels less rushed and the game isn't trying to be a grind for the sake of padding it's run time. At best i'd probably give this a 6/10. It hasn't impressed me but it is still a decent play through."

Not saying TCS is bad, but the controls and level design were a bit wonky. These controls feel tight and the open world is, well, open. It's great to explore all these planets and their many biomes as a large cast of characters and ships. As of writing this, I have just over 100 hours in the game and I'm not even halfway through the campaign because the open world is so diverse and packed full of content. You can tell the creators put a lot of care into this one, even going as far as to include 'Mumble Mode' for us long-time fans. Except the Sequel Trilogy. It feels rushed (just like the movies) and seemingly lacks the collectibles of the Lucas Films. Nevertheless, the Skywalker Saga wouldn't be much of a complete Saga without them. And other than those nitpicks, they are alright. A true Lego Star Wars experience will be found in the Original Trilogy and ESPECIALLY the Prequels. I know, a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.Overall, a great game for both children and nostalgia-chasers alike.

I felt as if I should warn people about what they may possibly encounter in the game's current state as of April 16th, 2022. I could remember the following 4 off of the top of my head.1. I had my lightsaber just completely disappear during the fight against Kylo Ren in the forest on Starkiller Base, so I had to punch ren to beat him.2. I struggled to get past the speeder chase level in ROTJ where I would just run out of map to fly down, meaning I would eventually just fall into a black pit over and over again. It's impossible to beat the level without turning aim assist on.3. The most annoying one is when I would go into each combat zone during a smuggling mission, I would be spawned inside the droid control ship's mesh and that would take up the entire screen; I think it was because it was the last ship I had boarded for a majority of the game? Just a giant eyesore which happened 100% of the time in those missions. / Annoyingly, the droid control ship would also just sit there in the sky when I was on the surface of all planets.4. A couple times, movement absolutely ceased to function along with a fair few other controls. It wasn't the settings being messed up or my controller being the problem, both the keyboard and my controller were unable to move the character.There were very few crashes fortunately, too few to make them consistent or linked to each other.I still highly recommend the game, it is a load of fun and has tons of content, maybe too much but I still think it's worth full price."
3397,Solace,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Itz_Solace/,1,,1,109.7,April,"16,",67,0,1,"Ok the game is fun, like its really fun, the combat is just fantastic, the visuals are amazing and its got some hilarious jokes but for me, its an 8.5/10. The reason why is becuase after a while it feels so bland, i feel like the devs focused more on exploration rather than fighting, which is such a shame cause the new combat system is great, when im fighting droids or clones its really fun.Space combat is awesome, i feel like a badass taking down one of the capital ships, which is why i like flying in space more than running around on the planets. Another issue i have with the game is the lack of really important scenes, now i know the game is big, i get it but i still think cutting some of the most important scenes is bad, not to mention that the dialouge sometimes sounds so weird at times, someone says something and you're waiting for another character to respond but the scene is already over.I also feel that the bugs that I and several others have experienced should've been noticed long before the game even released, the mission Endor the Line when the map stops loading and you fall for like 5 minutes, should've been discovered by playtesters(if they even have any, tbh idk at this point).Now the biggest issue for me is the lack of a customizer. Now yes i know the game has like around 380 characters to play, but lets be real who is going to play every version of a battle droid, a clone, a stormtrooper or any of the other characters with 50 different variations, or any of the characters that were on screen for like 2 seconds. Now its cool that we got a lot of characters but we're not going to play half of them and even saying that we're going to play half of them is generous.Im pretty sure this is the first of the major lego games to not have a customizer and its such a shame, the biggest lego game doesnt have one of the most important features, i know some people dont use it but i always did, i loved making my own Sith lord or Jedi master and go mess around.So yeah to me and to a lot of people, it was a big deal.now would i still recommend it? Absolutely, like i've said, the game is really fun and if anyone is debating on buying it then i hope this review helped you. Oh and to anyone that bothered to read all this, you're all a bunch of legends, take care everyone."

3399,Piss Man™,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PissManTF2/,1,,1,47.4,April,"17,",99,0,1,"Through the hours spent playing with my best friend I have to say this game is quite fun. The jokes and references are quite hilarious and the interactions with the characters always make me smile. The open world is great and very cool to go around and explore doing all the side missions. The only problems I've had are a bug with the trade federation lucrehulk appearing during cargo missions, the game crashing on a rare occasion, some (previously locked) areas not being able to be accessed after going in them once... Mainly the B1-Breakroom/Dance Floor, and the major concern of the main episodes being fast paced and having a lot of major plot points being unplayable or shown for a split second. Other than that it's a wonderful game that keeps the satirical humor of the Lego series as well as the nostalgia of growing up with Star Wars. All hail the mighty Gonk"

It feels like how you remember the lego games as a kid.They've improved and expanded on so much and somehow managed to keep that simple lego game spirit.Other than a few small nitpicks (slow menu sequence that you have to go through every time you start and close the game, some cinematics/cutscenes should've been levels) and the occasional bug I really can't complain.Highly recommend!

I'm not sure if I triggered something or my game is bugged, but all throughout my playthrough Yoda has been calling me numerous racial slurs. Things like the n word, cracker, and numerous other slurs were constantly degrading me throughout the game and I could not figure it out. It got so bad to the point I genuinely thought of refunding as I do not want to support companies with these types of ethics. All in all, I chose to keep the game and finish my playthrough. I counted 217 n words (152 were hard R), 134 crackers, and 812 other slurs that were constantly rotated throughout my game. Still fun though."

This game froze on me the other night hours in. When I rebooted my PC, I launched the game. All of my progress was lost when I got to the main menu. The only option was to start a new game. This is unacceptable. This has never happened to me with any game I've ever played in my life.Steam will not allow a refund as well not even though this game has become unplayable for me to progress. This is sad because I was really looking forward to a game this refined since my childhood. Buy Lego Star Wars The Complete Saga if anything. You will have a much better experience guaranteed. This product feels rushed and unfinished. Levels lack length, depth, and charm found in the original games. I really wish this turned out differently. :("
3411,Toevahkiin,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086811739/,1,,1,8.8,April,"14,",269,0,1,"First off i would like to state that i am 26 years old so nothing inside this game is a ""challenge"" from combat to puzzles. So unless you eat lead paint for breakfast you should easily find this game enjoyable and playable. The HUD in this game can get a little messy so you might have the need to pop some adderall so stay sane but its fine. In general if you're 6 or 60 you will enjoy this game. If you're a star wars fan you will enjoy this game. if you're someone who is a completion ♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't want to see the sun for about 7 days you will enjoy this game. The only downside i see this having is no online co-op but it does have steam play, so i guess there's that. I know i don't have very many hours on this yet but from what i have done so far solo and with a friend using steam play i can easily see myself logging some serious hours into this game to try to 100% it. Buying it now at the $50 price point is a steal for how much content is inside, waiting for a sale is a even smarter approach for getting the ultimate bang for your buck. Truly this is the best star wars experience I've had in years!"

The minor details such as reflections or dirt on individual bricks is fantastic.-Combat and puzzles are enjoyable enough. It's obviously a kid's game first and foremost, but is still able to provide entertainment for adults.-For those interested, the open world provides hours of content beyond the nine episodes.-The humor is absolutely brilliant. There are many references to very popular memes.-The sequel trilogy is finally given the respect it deserves. That is to say, none whatsoever. Rise of Skywalker in particular is treated as though it were a Spaceballs-esque parody.-For the most part, performance seems to be solid enough. Individual problems are listed as negativesNegatives:-When the game runs slowly, it really slows down. There were two levels when I dropped from 144 to 50 FPS on average.-Fullscreen support defaults to 24 hz. This resets every time you alt-tab out of the game.-Controls are a mixed bag. The game played well enough with a controller, but the keyboard/mouse inputs cannot be fully rebound.-Pacing is extremely inconsistent. Some minor sequences in the films are given full levels, but major set pieces such as the Battle over Coruscant or the attack on the second Death Star are relegated to cut scenes. All nine episodes suffer from this to an extent, though the prequels and Return of the Jedi feel worst off. This is actually my biggest issue with the game, and the reason I don't recommend it."

More Qui-Gon sounding too much like the Clone Wars narrator/Admiral Yularen. A couple bugs I've noticed but other than, its been a damn near flawless release. They delayed it 2 years and id say that was a smart decision. I think more developer should follow suit with just delaying there game and then have one update trailer when its like 6 months out instead of just delaying saying its coming and then delaying again.

But two episodes in it set in quick that this was gonna be the whole game, that and the cut scenes, too make up for time, are basically turned into summaries and are really quick when compared to the complete saga, then again different times.

I played so much of TCS growing up, and this game is everything I could hope for as an ultimate edition to that and more. First off, the game boasts 45 levels (5 for each film, no shorter films like in TCS) but that's only the basics of the game. Each planet has one or more large hub areas to explore that are flush with gags, side quests, and challenges. This game is absolutely brimming with content! Of course, to 100% the game you'll need to play through every level on story mode to grab all of the extra Kyber bricks and minikits. Now, onto the gameplay. The combat has been improved, by a lot. No more isometric camera, it follows your character sort of behind and over-the-shoulder. Lightsaber characters have 3 attacks, plus a slam and a lightsaber throw, as well as counters. The game also features a hit-combo system. This being a family game it is of course viable to just faceroll and spam the basic attack to kill everything, but the flashy combos are more efficient and reward you with more studs. Blaster shots are all aimed (the game has a togglable aim assist and soft-target locking) and along with the two lightsaber-using classes there are four (typically) blaster-wielding classes as well!Visually, the game is quite pretty. It's not going to completely blow you away, but you weren't expecting that. The important thing is it runs like butter, and I've heard it even runs well on lower-end PCs to boot.Of course, the game has a few things missing and some changes longtime fans won't like. There is no more Cantina hub, as you now activate story missions by travelling to their respective planets and areas. Also conspicuously absent is a custom character creator, which I would love to get my hands on with the massive roster the game features.Overall I'd give this a 9/10 so far. It's a blast to play alone or with a friend, partner, kid, little sibling, whoever. Just go enjoy it"

3498,James Fox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jamesthefloof/,1,,1,16.4,April,"7,",216,0,1,"I've put around 10 hours into this game, so I think I have a pretty good idea how I feel about it. As someone who grew up with the older LEGO games, my hopes for this game were very high. Thankfully, this game delivers the experience I was after. The differences that stand out the most is the overhauled combat system and open world like areas you can explore outside of the main story levels. The amount of things to collect is staggering, and I think I'll be spending many many hours searching every corner of these environments for hidden goodies. I also think the graphics are quite lovely. There were several times where I stopped what I was going just to take in the visuals. In regard to the graphics, the textures were the real standout aspect here. The LEGO bricks in the environments as well as the characters themselves are brimming with detail and look like real life LEGO pieces. The modeling for many of the ships and environments look like real LEGO sets I could sit down and make if I had the right bricks.I do have a few critiques though. For one, I think the cutscenes are too short and rush through the story a little too quickly. Also, the camera can sometimes bug out and get stuck on things. I kind of wish an option was there to make the camera follow behind your character at all times. I found fiddling with the camera in certain areas to be a pain. Also, I did encounter a few bugs here and there, but nothing that took away from the overall experience. One such bug caused the game to freeze and activate my controller's rumble. I had to close the game to get it to stop.Overall, this game is well worth your time and money, especially if you are a longtime fan of the old LEGO games. It's nice to see modern games actually living up to the hype, and I hope this game sets a new standard for future LEGO titles to come."

3512,Reijvi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198179923643/,1,,0,43.2,April,"7,",213,0,1,"I want to first make it clear, this game is a decent overall game, but, personally I ended up being quite disappointed with it. Both from a Star Wars game and as a Lego game.My main issue with the game is it's level structure. They are really short and messy. You do hub mission in-between the levels which almost feels like it could be a part of the level but it's not, it's just a set up to the next level, and aren't even replayable, which makes the actual levels really short. They are so short that infact, instead of the iconic 10 minikits per level, it's been cut down to just 5.Some key moments are even put into these ""hub missions"" which means, fighting Jango Fett in episode 2 or boarding the seperatist ship as Obi-wan and Qui-gon in episode 1? Yeah, that's a one time event that you can't replay unless you start a new save. Other key moments like the battle of Genosis, blowing up the death star 2 and the opening battle of episode 3 aren't even playable events at all. Other cutscenes like the death star blowing up a planet is outright missing.Now, as a lego game. It just misses a lot of that classic vibe, when going back to levels in freeplay, there simply aren't many fun quirky secrets. Compare episode 4 in TCS, you had some stuff like a room that was an optical illusion, an infinite silver stud dispenser, a hat dispenser hidden away plus a bunch of buildable cars, a room where u grew plants, another room whose sole purpose was just to shoot out stormtroopers into the vacuum of space, and of course let's not forget, the hot tub stormtroopers. What was the reason for all of this? Just silly fun, nothing more, nothing less.Now, in TSS this same level you get to find the hot tub stormtroopers again, but now for some reason there is even an invisible wall not letting you join them, because no fun am I right? But that's about it in terms of fun hidden quirky stuff, it doesn't have the same fun reason to re-play and explore played levels.Talking about replaying played levels, you can't even switch ships in most ship levels in freeplay mode, and a lot of the ship levels are actually possible to 100% without even going into freeplay to begin with, not that it had much reason to exist to begin with, if you can't even switch into playing custom ships, which is freeplays main reason to exist usually.Other weird things are also a lot of characters feel more samey now. All characters can now double jump, and it seems like also all characters are able to fight aswell, R2D2 can't even hover anymore. Sure there are some minor things, like hey this character fights with these animations, or has this different sound effect. But otherwise, their core gameplay is quite similar. Are there unique characters? Yes, but not to the same degree or core gameplay anymore.In TCS, you had characters that could pretty much triple jump like Jar Jar, Jedi could double jump, other characters could either roll or single jump, others couldn't even jump at all, and some could float with jetpacks.In TSS, all characters can now double jump, and some like Boba Fett can use their jetpack to float for a few seconds. That's about it.As an open world game however, it's fun, it has many areas to explore and collect simple collectables, but yet again, compared to TCS or even The Clone Wars lego game, there aren't many enemies to mindlessly fight. You can find one-time encounters in the world, but after that, those areas are gone, forever. Most hubs actually have no enemies at all to fight after u complete all the encounters, which aren't many there to start with. Which is a shame, because the combat in this game is truly really fun, even if too easy at times.Even in hubs where the npcs should logically fight you, they don't. You have unlocked the death star as a hub, with dozens of stormtroopers? Well shoot them and they'll just run away. You've unlocked a big seperatist ship as a hub? Same story. The city planet Courosant or Kamino with a bunch of clones walking around or even posing as guards? Guess what, they'll run away if you even shoot remotely close to them.A side note I also wanted to mention, you can't even make custom characters anymore either.Now a more serious issue, but hopefully temporal one, are the bugs or lack of technical features like FOV.The game to put it lightly, is buggy. You may be really lucky and not experience any bugs, but if you're like the majority of us, you will experience at least some bugs, even if they aren't game breaking.For me, here's the bugs I've encountered at the top of my head. First time starting up the game, no characters had any faces, When switching to a character in a hub world it switched into a bloody big space ship and constantly crashed and hit invisible walls and got me killed. I've soft locked my game after I quit in the middle of a hub mission, this reset the hub and made me unable to complete this hub mission which was necessary to unlock the next story mission/level. (this sadly is a very common problem which render many unable to complete the story levels)I've been put into a constant walk mode, where I can't sprint.The game crashes randomly.Sometimes the game won't let me use space travel when playing in a hub in freeplay.When playing with the mouse and controlling space ships often it gets stuck and keeps flying in one direction.I could go on with a lot more personal gripes I got with this game to be honest, but I feel like this review has become long enough and I've gotten to say most of my major points."

3522,shoes4wyrms,https://steamcommunity.com/id/shoes4wyrms/,2,,0,3.0,April,"7,",408,0,1,"Honestly, most people seem to have other opinions, and maybe I just need to give it another chance, but this game seems nowhere near the quality of the old games. Sure a lot of the mechanics are more fleshed out and feels more polished, the graphics are great, and it’s just as charming; but gameplay design is the worst of any game I’ve played for years.Here’s my experience playing episode 1: everything that used to be a level in the old games is now a cutscene with mediocre voice acting and a sprinkle of decent voice acting, some gags are actually funny and overall these cutscenes are fairly charming but they are also THE ENTIRE GAME NOW. Seriously, you use your lightsaber to kill enemies maybe 4 times before the reaching the end of the episode.You get to pilot a few things but I’m fairly sure there’s no failure condition (pod race is 100% rigged in your favour). You literally spend 5 minutes walking and talking with palpatine on courescant. Why? How is this gameplay? Why was so much time spent on a level that you walk through when the entire sequence between landing on naboo (the second time) and fighting maul is a cutscene????You could make an argument for the open world areas if they were interesting, but they are for the most part vast wastelands sparsely populated with a couple puzzles and nothing to fight.The platforming sequences have been reduced to “press A to watch your character jump to the next platform”The special purposes of the characters seem to have been completely removed from the game. There are some things you can only do with certain characters, but other than the force they are not required to solve puzzles. I have not played as an astromech or protocol droid at all yet and see no need to. Anakin doesn’t crawl through little doors, jar jar doesn’t jump high. They all have unique combat abilities but you don’t fight anything so it doesn’t matter.80% of the game so far is walk to a point, press A, and watch a cutscene and wish you got to play it.The upgrade system is such a confusing choice it almost feels like it was tacked on just to encourage people to explore, dangling the stud magnet in front of you like a carrot on a stick. Most of the upgrades don’t even matter because combat is so easy and sparse it would almost be a shame to make your character more powerful. The run speed upgrade is the most powerful since most of this game is just walking to the next cutscene.I feel like this game was in development forever and I’m just surprised this is what the result was. It’s such a far cry from the absolute pure passion and love that was poured into the old games. How did Tt go from action-packed levels with somewhat tricky platforming and fun and simple Lego based puzzles where you actually built ♥♥♥♥ and interacted with it to a game with little more interaction than a visual novel?My friend and I honestly just kept asking ourselves why we weren’t just watching the movie. This game offers little more entertainment in the same amount of time."

If you really want to get this game do not think it is a good sequel to other lego games, come at it as a new experience, only then will you maybe enjoy this game, even then its pretty dissapointing.EDIT: Just dont buy the game, devs spent six months doing nothing, only to release a second season pass (Which only includes character pack dlc's), making it people who bought deluxe have to buy the second pass, man, what a dissapointing game."

3575,boxmonkey99,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jjabramswashere/,3,,0,23.8,August,"9,",118,0,1,"Why no episode 3 space battle mission? It was one of the most memorable and fun missions from the previous lego star wars games, and they replaced it with point A -> B corridor sprinting simulator where they continuously babble movie dialogue into your ear for 3 uninterrupted minutes and then the mission is over. Get used to it because the entire game is saturated with this formula. The previous games never did this. Who thought this was a good use of the players time?Also, why the overly complicated controls? I used to love introducing non-gamers to The Complete Saga due to it's extremely simple and easy to learn controls, and every time they had a blast. You could literally beat the levels knowing just 2 buttons and the left stick. Even though the controls were super simple, the levels still allowed for fun and engaging gameplay. I figured this game would build off of those ideals on release but I was surely mistaken. The character now operate like a 3rd person fps game, where you now need to use both sticks to navigate the world, both left and right triggers to aim and shoot your gun/lightsaber, all 4 face buttons for melee combat, and the D-pad for their copy-paste hacking minigames. It's  asking too much from the gaming illiterate, and I witnessed firsthand as my friend struggled to mentally map which button did what action and was fighting the camera to not get it to constantly point at the back-end of a wall or corner. Again... The older lego games never suffered from this problem. The split screen camera also feels half baked... like they did a much more clever implementation in Lego star wars TCW where the camera was a single entity capturing both your characters on a single screen, and then would separate into two screens and follow each of you when you got too far away from one another. The camera would be zoomed out enough to where you could still see what was in front of you and behind you. Here it's just a static vertical line down the center, and it's so zoomed in your characters take up half the screen, so good luck telling what's happening or where you're supposed to be going. The cutscenes are all pretty chuckleworthy, and they brought back the VA cast from the clone wars tv show, which are the only strong positives I have for this game... oh and i guess it looks really pretty. The maps also feel rather empty. Sure you can gawk at the huge map, but it's really missing that classic lego charm where you would find all sorts of derpy vehicles, fun powerups, or secret hidden zones in each level. Remember the kamino disco area? Remember the movie theater on mos eisley? Remember the Lego city bonus level? Remember the force ghosts and indiana jones? Remember the hilarious death sounds? Custom characters? Unlockable cheats? It's those small touches that truly made the complete saga a classic and it's why I recommend you play that game instead of this one, especially if you're looking to play this with friends. It's just ok by itself. TL;DR 6/10 singleplayer, 4/10 in co-op. There are better lego games out there... I don't hate the game, I just know it could be so much better..."

It's very pretty and the animations are great. That's about it for positives- 1 (one) hour into the game I'm at 20% of Episode 1 story content completed with effortless True Jedi in every eligible level. But I've already beaten Sebulba, got back from Tatooine and got the Valorum vote cutscene. That's about 50% of the movie, so I don't know what is treated as story content in this game- gameplay (story mode, so for a 9-movie star wars game - bread and butter) is mostly walking from point A to B and watching a short cutscene (under 1min)- there is no Maul boss fight on Tatooine, it's a short cutscene, which in my opinion is a crime and disgrace- the game offers 0 challenge, I'd say you could play it with your eyes closed but you have to follow the waypoint-orb in the huge wasteland hub worlds to advance the story- character upgrades are limited to ""you run 30% faster"" or ""you deal 10% more damage with lightsabers""- 731 puzzles in the game, none of which I feel inclined to complete- over 300 characters to unlock, with not much to do with them (other than tons of side content I didn't really buy the game for)- UI sound design is absolutely HORRIBLE, makes my ears bleed, switching between holo menu buttons makes the most awful screeching sound.

Repetitive and tedious, the first few space battles, capital ships, and lightsaber duals were really cool, but it's the same thing over and over and over and over.

The open worlds feel kinda lifeless as if you are running around within a painting; all there is to do is easy, repetitive quests and collectible-collecting.  The missions themselves are okay but too short.  The game just lacks the character/soul/identity of the previous ones.  But it does look very nice and can give goosebumps at times if you love Star Wars.  I recommend it at a cheap sale price, not at full price though."

Actually you should probably wait a year or two for the price to drop and here is why.So far starting at The Phantom Menace, and halfway through Attack of the Clones.. I have built (ya know where ya build things to get through the missions) a TOTAL of 6 times. The levels have none of the ""soul"" of the previous games and instead are 99% non-lego with Lego display stand, and benches, and planters cut and pasted across the entire open world parts and even the missions themselves.There are no more red bricks, instead there are kyber crystalls (over 1100) all over the maps which are used as currency to purchase class (like for Jedi, Droids, etc) upgrades, or what would be use to be Red Bricks. 2x, 4x, 6x, 8x, 10x bricks are gone, and while you use to be able to hit True Jedi without them in previous games, getting True Jedi is a major pain in the backside on some levels because it now has 3 tiers.The game has no soul, and there is more to do in the original Lego Star Wars game then in this game spanning 9 films so far.I've been waiting a long time for this game, and it suffers from what I would Pandemic Game Development™ (meaning that they just put what they had in a box and shipped it, and lacks all the charm and fun of the previous lego games.If this changes before finishing the Story Mode of all 9 episodes I'll update this."

Certain vehicle levels are abhorrent as they force you forward and you may have to redo the level several times to get all of the mini-kits.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MINOR DISAPPOINTMENTS:- Certain characters are not playable despite there existing official Lego Figures that appeared in official sets, including Saesee Tiin, Agen kolar, any version of Clonetrooper pilot, At-At pilot, and Geonosian Warrior. The last three listed were playable in the Complete Saga.- Certain characters are missing their unique blaster sounds, Jango, Padme, and Geonosian blasters.- Dislike of deviating from the classic Lego game UI, and certain classic sound effects.- No extra toggle for classic death sounds.- Venators are used in Attack of the Clones instead of Acclamators.- There are only 5 levels per episode, and some levels can be short.- Freeplay does not give you a random set of characters (atleast one of each class) like the original does to encourage the use of a variety of characters. You will have to fumble with the clunky UI instead of smoothly swapping through your provided characters. Player 1 and player 2 are randomized I think, but not the rest of the characters on quick select.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENTS:- No replayable missions for certain parts of the films, prime examples include a space battle of Coruscant and negotiations with the trade federation, which were both full levels in the original 2005 game.- Iconic locations like Jabba's Palace, and the Petranaki Arena can only be visiting during levels, despite the game's heavy emphasis on the open world. So much for finding Jabba at Jabba's Palace. - Massive disappointment at the lack of a character creator.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------"

A solid collect-a-thon that expanded upon the original and brought back a lot of memories I had when I was younger. A pretty big gripe especially when trying to live out the old days is that their attempt of recreating mumble speak isn't done particularly well, likely because the game with voice lines has the characters speaking very often but I know they could've done leagues better than this attempt.

More bloated filler content, less story, less jokes, less engaging level design - it's an infinitely bigger game than its predecessor, but it falls short in every other respect.It's such a shame.

It's a huge shift in style from the originals and you will be disappointed. The developers decided it would be a good idea to make this game semi open world, but that doesn't really describe it well. It puts you in a larger than normal level where you can run around explore. This gameplay element really slows down the game due to the collectibles strewn about in the level. Although you technically don't need these collectibles and they are all optional, the collectibles give you ""kyber crystals"" which are necessary to unlock upgrades for classes of playable characters. These upgrades can require anywhere from 1 crystal all the way to 15, and these crystals aren't easy to come by. I also find this game quite handholdy. You could argue that this is a game for children but I remember the originals quite well and they did not take you by the hand and tell you exactly what to do and what is happening. Some of the cutscenes are unnecessarily long for whats happening so you just end up sitting there waiting for them to end so you can get back to the game. This is a personal point of contention but I do not like the voice acted lines in lego games. Never have. The humor of this game does not come through as they once did. I do not recommend this game if you are a fan of the original trilogy and sequel trilogy games. But perhaps if this is your first foray into the realm of lego star wars, you might find some enjoyment in this game."

If you want the exitement you had in ""Complete Saga"" or other Lego games (Hobbit, Pirates of the Carabean, Harry Potter, Indiana Jones etc) you'll be disappointed. Instead of hacking down legions of baddies, crumbling down environment and building new structures as well as solving puzzles as a team, you get a lot of boring tasks, like following NPCs, talking to NPCs and watching over rushed cut-scenes. While playing Episode I, I was looking for droids to tackle, but apart from 1-2 occasional ones, most that appeared were just in cut-scenes. At the time I would be landing on Naboo in ""complete saga"" I was already confronting Darth Maul in ""Skywalker Saga"". It hurts me to say this, as I was really looking forward to this game, but it's simply not as fun as the older Lego games were. The story is super rushed, and the action was replaced with dull open-world tasks. Also the Coop playing mechanism is rather weak. It feels more as if this was intended to be a single player game with multi-player option, not like previous Lego games that really focussed on cooperation between players."

It feels amazing to just break everything for studs as usual. The jokes land even for me as an adult despite being mostly geared towards children. Level challenges often give you alternate ways to progress a level that you would have never thought of for your initial run through. Collectibles are fun as ever to collect. I keep having to remind myself when I get stuck on a puzzle that it was not made to be super complex, and often just requires looking around, and then I figure it out. A downside is that replayability of an episode cuts out the parts that are not the linear levels, which can be disappointing. Overall super fun."

3660,jake3433,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041756939/,2,,0,20.5,September,"27,",293,0,1,"Disappointed with this one, most of all with the levels. Levels are extremely short and just not very fun to play, they are missing something. The game mostly consists of walking from cutscene to cutscene, fast travelling from one hub world to the next, until you get to an actual level, which again aren't very good, then repeat. You can explore these hub worlds in between levels and are free to do side activities that are honestly not worth doing. There are lots of hub worlds and they're fun to explore but it get's boring quickly.The main focus of the game seems to be collecting Kyber bricks but I lost interest in that quickly as they are pretty easy to do and there's too many, it's too tedious/pointless. There are a lot of unlockable characters but there's nothing to do with them, they mostly all play the same. You can free roam as them but that's entertaining for only so long, replaying levels as them is not enjoyable for reasons already mentioned.The game does look really good though and the amount of areas to explore is very good as well, pretty much most locations in Star Wars can be explored. Overall the game does have a fair amount of content just not in the areas it counts the most, there is no replayability. It gets boring very quickly. I give it a 4/10.Cons:- levels are very short, not very fun and not enough per episode.-Not enough combat.- lots of characters but nothing to do with them.- Main point of game is collectables.- Hub worlds lose interest easily.- Switching character screen is very annoying to use.- no character creator.-  Just overall gets boring very quicklyPros:- Looks really good- new combat is really good, good combat system- good mouse and keyboard support"

3663,Luna,https://steamcommunity.com/id/flutterluna/,3,,0,14.6,August,"9,",523,0,1,"Let's start with positives. Overall gameplay is alright if we are talking about ground exploration and combat. In space tho it's simply hold shoot button to win. Not much interesting there. All ships got pretty much the same felling and bigger ships with a lot of guns like corvettes were scale down for some reason and feature the same ""2 blasters and 1 torpedo tube"" layout. The only exception is ships without guns that feel a lot faster.A lot of character and ships to unlock, you will surely find characters\ships you like. Dialog and humor is okay. Graphics and attention to details is good also.Let's get to the bad part.First of all. I'm sick of Ray on the main screen. Not only they put her as a face of Skywalker family on the main screen, it also seems she got alzheimer and constantly ""looking for someone to show her da way"" with the only one specific voiceline everytime. No wonder people try to fix this with mods. It was pretty obvious that she will become annoying with time. Main menu screen also contains animation of her appearing with her that you can't skip so you are forced to watch and listen to her every damn time.So why only one line from the only character that not really that likable?! Was that hard to add few other iconic character with their lines or ability to skip this intro? About ""screens"". There are a LOT of loading screens in the game. Activating ""continue play"" button will take you like 6 different screens, windows and buttons to press\skip. Even when loading your save it will load narration text crawl that you unable to skip for 5-7 seconds for some reason and after you finally skip it you will get another loading screen getting you into the game. What designer\developer decided that this was a good idea? Why can't i turn off text crawl screen so i won't have to skip it every time even if it will take a little bit longer to load main game? And why do i get confirmation screen with ""Loading successful"" text that i also need to interact with and close it manually because game won't proceed without it?Also i found out that this game really dislikes ""alt+tab"" combination. For some reason it sometimes changes my screen resolution. Controls for PC are terrible and ability to customize our controls are too limited, since some buttons are responsible for 3-4 actions and you can't separate them.Player\game communication also not great. Some areas or interactable objects are limited to specific characters and abilities. So game asks for a character that you have, you select it, but you still can't interact with object because actually you have to play season 7 to unlock a special ability for this class. And game does not tell you that, i had to google it.Quantity over quality. 1200 kybercubes to collect that allows you to upgrade your character and specific class of heroes. The best source of cubes i found so far is asteroids that are limited and gives you only 5 cubes. Not only that is a lot of stuff to collect, but there are also perk that allows you to seem these cubes on your current level and when you turn it on your screen will be overwhelmed with a lot of different ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have to collect, so you turn if off because of that making it useless. So why that many cubes? I can't see any practical reason why was it balances this way.Make it 100-200 cubes and upgrades to cost less. Why do i need this many cubes?!"

This is not your typical Lego game, it's filled with lots of content that should keep you playing for 100+ hours. I have just over 70 hours on the game and I've only finished the first six movies, meaning I still have many planets/locations, main missions, characters, side missions, ships, data cards and kyber bricks to find. So far my experience has been amazing. My background on Lego games goes pretty far. From Lego Star Wars the complete saga, to Lego Batman one and many more.You don't need to have watched the Star Wars movie in order to play and enjoy this game. However, a lot of extra conversations when exploring planets are about things only die hard Star Wars fans would understand.So, let me give you the good and bad about Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga. All my opinion of course-The bad-Bugs. I'm playing the game on a pretty good PC (steam version) and there have been some bugs i've came across so far. Here are some of them.- Random floating head shooting lasers- Clipping through walls/ground- Random crashing- Certain levels are very laggy (not because of PC specs, most people have said specifically the droid factory level on Episode two, Attack Of the Clones is laggy)- I haven't had this one happen to me personally but it's game breaking and needs to be fixed, in Episode 7, the force awakens. When you visit Maza's castle to do a main mission, sometimes the mission simply wont be playable therefor you cannot progress in Episode 7, 8 or 9. That also means you can't complete certain side quests and obtain certain kyber bricks and such.Cut Scenes.Again this is my opinion but I find the cut scenes, mainly and especially for the real meaningful moments are way to short. Example: Anakin VS Obi-Wan. In the movie it's such a heart felt moment hearing them speak to each other before they fight to one of their deaths, Anakin and Obi-Wan each give their amazing speeches/reasons to why they are with or against the republic, why they are fighting each other. In the game they say a couple words, be it from the movies which is still nice, but then they fight. Obviously it's a lego game, they shouldn't be saying word for word the entire same thing that was said in the movies but a little more dialog would be nice.Missing *certain content*So for this I highlight the word ""certain content"" because I see a surprising amount of people saying the game is lacking some content. The game has so much content it's amazing, now quality over quantity is what it comes to for me.A major miss and lacking piece of a mission was in the arena battle on Geonosis. In Lego Star Wars The Clone Wars the arena battle is epic. so many droids everywhere, a couple jedi but you're clearing getting overrun and it feels like you're a prisoner that has escaped their chains and has barley any help while a droid army is sent in to kill you. Even for how easy that game was you die a lot just because of the amount of enemies attacking you. In this though, barley any droids, basically just the animals trying to kill you and Jango Fett.Along with that there is a lack of Clone Wars mention. Now there are characters from it and in fact Ashoke is coming to the game May the 4th, so we know that TT games does in fact reconzige The Clone Wars in the game. But the fact there aren't many if any mentions to the show in the random conversations with NPC's, there's no Captain Rex, no Captain kruell, no Ventress, no Savage Opress, no Zero the Hutt, no Cad Bane, etc. - The Good -Now the ""bad"" list might be much longer then the ""Good"" list but that's because most of the bad will change as time goes on. Bug fixes will come out, extra content will keep coming, like I said May The 4th they'll be releasing some more characters and most likely a patch. The entire game is the good. From the little jokes and voice lines of certain characters, to the amazing voice acting of almost all 300+ playable characters. The new game play of combos, taking cover, aiming system, kyber bricks, data cards are amazing.The locations are fabulous. Yes some you can't explore that much but man c'mon. I mean look at corisont, Naboo, Endor, Mustafar and there's still many I haven't even explored yet.The graphics.The graphics are just simply beautiful, for a lego game it still feels fake, almost like someone is using mods, the game looks beautiful is every location, mission and character.To close it out I love this game. The bad is much longer like I said but that's because to explain the amazingness to the game I would just simply say it's nine movies of an amazing, beautiful, entertaining series that has brought millions of fans together to enjoy. Being able to relive some of my favourite memories in lego form in 2022 is just so fun. Seeing Anakin and Obi-Wan fighting again with the amazing music, beautiful graphics and great combat system is just so fun. 70+ hours of my life has been spent on this game I can't wait for the other 70+ to come and go. I hope this game keeps getting updates and I cannot wait to see where it goes. So do I recommend this game. Absolutely May the force be with you."

I enjoyed it fully throughout the whole 100 some hours unlike with past games where they got more annoying near the end. It's not a flawless game but I honestly think it's easily the best Lego Srae Wars game to date and one of the best star wars games to be released.-Really good graphics.-Well written with some amazing jokes throughout.-Very fun melee and blaster combat. Easily the most enjoyable combat system out of any lego game.-23+ large explorable hub worlds (some are smaller than others but it's still an open world star wars game with many different planets.)-300+ playable characters, most of which has voice lines and unique animations.-lots and lots of different ships to fly around the galaxy with, including tiny little escape pods and a big gonk droid.-Most of the time really good voice acting, including the clone wars cast for the prequels (and mumble mode for those who don't like voice acting in lego.)-lots of fun interesting little side quests throughout the galaxy, all with their own storylines that sometimes continues into other side quests.-A stupid amount of content, took me around 100 hours to 100%.-You can own and summon the death star and a few other capital ships.-Some great interactions between certain characters.-DLC packs for a lot of characters not from the 9 movies such as Mando, Rogue One, Solo, Bad Batch.-GONK. -Game is too easy with no difficultly options to make it harder. It's normally not a problem for lego games but in this, it gets really annoying when you have such a great combat system but the enemies die in 2 to 3 hits, Please TT add an option to give the enemies more health at the very least.-Levels are really short as most of your playtime is spent within the hubs.-Scenes feel rushed and/or skipped completely (no Tarkin in ep4, no playable battle of Coruscant, no playable palpatine's arrest, no battle of geonosis (outside of the arena,) no playable death star 2 trench run, etc.)-Bugs, including some progress blocking bugs (I luckily didn't encounter those but there's a lot who have.)-Level challenges can be annoying to figure out without a guide and force you to replay levels more than twice.-No character Customization.-Co-op is not great, as there's no online co-op, boss battles only really have 1 player fighting them, etc.-Not much replayability in the open world.-Not much combat in the open world, there really needs to be more enemies here and there.-Missing characters such as Galactic Marines, few jedi, Uncle Owen, Aunt Beru, imperial spy, etc.-Normal star destroyers and Venators are not explorable (even though a interior of a venator was seen in pre-release gameplay.)-Starkiller Base and homing one, the resistance ship from ep8, and the Supremacy are only explorable during the story.-Kijimi is not a explorable planet despite always being on the galaxy map.-EP7 Finn with a lightsaber is only playable during the story while EP7 Rey with a lightsaber is always playable.-No clone wars or rebel content (outside of Mama the Hutt and the ghost) with no known DLC for them coming later on.Overall the game is amazing but it has it's issues. I completely recommend this game to any fans of star wars whether or not you've played past Lego Star Wars games. It's a really enjoyable ride throughout all 9 movies and even if you hate the sequels, they can still be a lot fun here with good jokes throughout.This game could easily become the best star wars game ever with content from all media, if TT continues to make DLC which I really hope they do, As it would be so cool to see DLC packs in the future that adds story content from rogue one, solo, rebels, TCW, Mando, alongside explorable planets from them and even more content from the comics and books, upcoming shows like Kenobi and even legends. It would be amazing but it's unlikely they will take that route. We probably won't get anymore DLC other than what's already announced.This is easily one of the best star wars games ever released, it has it's problems but you can clearly tell there was a huge amount of work, effort, and passion that went into making this. I can not recommend it enough. Thank you TT, for making this amazing game."

From broken parts to weapons in their holsters swaying around, capes flutter when you move, even ragdolls when you defeat enemies (although is pretty hard to see when they de-spawn so fast)the levels are a bit short, and are even more cut up story wise compared to the complete saga, but what it makes up for it is in the jokes and the execution of the level itself. just a bit sad that some iconic parts are cut really short in this game.I really hope that some classic levels get added in the future, or even just the original level hub's from the games would be a cool throwback. oh and bring back the old pod racing level to show the new people what pain is like.Some minor gripes is just some really short LOD for terrain tessellation (its pretty distracting in some levels), and the levels that have you switch between sets of characters sometimes tanks your system extremely hard (down to 15-20 fps in the robot factory level). Other Characters get in your way a lot when your moving level objects and don't seem to get out of the way on your own.Overall amazing game 9/10, a must buy it if you can afford it."

There is an enormous amount of things to do. We are 60 hours in and still finding new things and enjoying ourselves.  It is a reasonable difficulty for a seven year old while still creating some sense of challenge. Most levels are short which is fine because there are so many and any given level doesn’t get tedious.  There are many characters but it isn’t always obvious what the exact differences are or why it matters. We figured out that there are characters with rapid fire weapons and characters with sniper rifles but we generally spend most of our time with one or two characters that are effective at moving and puzzles. (Of course we switch when a puzzle requires it, but we generally switch right back.). The game somehow lacks the “magic” of the early Lego game novelty. But it is still really good and certainly worth playing."

The older Lego games had beautiful, well-thought out level design and a nice hub world between levels. Clean User Interface, satisfying gameplay loop and sound effects, and consistent mechanics (E.G. 1 red brick per level, 10 minikits, True Jedi if I remember correctly). I am sick and tired of shallow open-worldish bastardizations of games I used to love. This game's level design is dry and uninspired. The game has complicated menus and mechanics and holds your hand excessively while teaching you little of use at all. The old Lego games had so much soul and heart put into them. I would rather buy all those again and relive those good memories than play this game even were it given to me for free. I fail to understand why they tried to change so much when they already had perfected the formula with games like Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars, and the Lego Indiana Jones Series.Please do yourself and the rest of us a favor by avoiding this game like the plague. Maybe if enough of us do, they'll go back to making good games again. Honestly, just replay Complete Saga. At least you'll have fun.

Funny game, fun to play, nostalgic, but doesn't do the complete saga justice imo.Misses some of the most key battles and fights that the complete saga allowed you to play, instead opting for short cutscenes showing all the fun you miss out on. Revenge of the Sith in particular has no gameplay for some of the most memorable and important scenes in the movie/franchise.Also, the sheer amount of forced slow walking missions, forcing you to stand within a certain distance of the character you're following, which have been notoriously hated in gaming for years on end, make certain sections (*cough cough* Kamino) pretty irritating. The combat, despite being easy (as expected for a lego game), is a vast improvement on past games, and the boss fights it doesn't completely skip are very fun to play. Maybe I'll change my mind as it goes on, but to me it's been a bit of a letdown. The comedy is still classic lego and it's still a great game, worth buying eventually, whether 40 quid is worth it though is questionable to me.P.S. How dare Rey take Luke's place on the title screen! :'("

3778,Archaedrix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LaBurnski/,2,,0,79.5,May,"7,",296,1,1,"This game had so much potential, but there are fundamental problems. The good:- The game is visually appealing - There is technically a lot to do. Some of the open world challenges and puzzles are fun and interesting.- You'll be able to play as your favorite character- Characters have skins, instead of 7 copies of the same character cluttering the menu like in the previous games- Kyber Brick system. Having powerups that you can spend to upgrade abilities is fun, and allows me to skip some of the repetitive consoles you have to use. Those suck after a while. Unfortunately, the original game (The Complete Saga) is vastly superior in a lot of ways. The Bad:- Poor tutorials. The episode 1 tutorial launches you into space flight, dumps you into a hub-like zone, and wanders you through the halls for a scripted event before starting you off. The episode 4 tutorial was fine, but Episode 1, 4, and 7 have tutorials so it's odd. How to use the character swap-list in freeplay is poorly explained. - Lack of hub world. You have a hub in the pocket in your holo device, but it is clunky and can be difficult to access when you would expect it to be available. - Empty space. There is a lot of go here, go there, between missions that try to sell themselves as mission. You can buy capital ships, and they really do not do that much. - Massive framerate issues in certain areas. Sometimes the camera will force a perspective at random in one of those areas, and it's very problematic. Consistent 144 fps in all areas, but then drop to 20 in 3 zones. - Forced perspective during boss fights. It can be very difficult to collect the few in-mission items when your camera is locked on the boss most of the time. - The challenges. A lot of them are fundamentally difficult to complete due to their nature, not in terms of skill. Quite a few suffer from needing to kill characters a certain way, or kill a certain amount, and the game does not properly count them. - Mission replay-ability. As opposed to the original missions, there are 5 minikits per mission and the mission areas are fairly small. - Missions themselves. 5 missions per movie, all of which are boss fights or vehicle levels. Miss a challenge or it bugs out, you probably have to run the entirety of the boss fight to get there. - Repetitive puzzles. Requiring me to stack 5 boxes in every new zone for a collectible gets boring. - Datacards replacing red bricks. In the original game, each red brick was attached to a purchasable upgrade. Now, you can use any datacard to purchase any power up (2x studs, or higher). These are very easily accessible in the open world, no challenge. - Goldbricks were removed also. Less things to collect. I'll edit my pros and cons as I continue playing."

I grew up playing The Complete Saga and now that I've completed story mode in this game, I can confidently say that if you like Star Wars, especially Lego Star Wars, you will like this game.It really is like you're in the Star Wars universe. The graphics are amazing; everything that isn't lego (obviously) is pretty realistic and I especially love the view of the planets from space. You can do whatever you want, especially in free play mode. Are you supposed to be rescuing the chancellor who you know is evil but want to slaughter the younglings as yellow-eyed Anakin instead? Go ahead! Go ride a Bantha instead of playing the sequels if you want (I do recommend those though as there are essential abilities that you get from those movies, and I personally like more gameplay). Heck, I did parkour as pregnant Padme. I'm sure that won't have any consequences....Some other little things that I really like:-There are different character classes that each have their own unique abilities, similar to The Complete Saga. You can upgrade the abilities of each class as well as all the characters as a whole.-The minikits make microfighters that you can fly! I think this is a great reference to irl legos and it gives you more motivation to collect them.-There is a great combination of authenticity to the movies (tons of familiar quotes) as well as classic lego humor.-The extras are both useful and entertaining. Some help you reach that 10,000,000,000 stud goal easier, while others turn your lightsabers into baguettes. It's great.-There are TONS of side missions. Some are shorter or longer, but most give you kyber bricks, which are similar to gold bricks from The Complete Saga. There are well over 1000 to collect, and there are hints available to help you find them if you know where to look. You can also get other rewards....I've seen some poor reviews on this game, but they're pretty nitpicky in my opinion (nothing is perfect, after all). The only thing I would add to this game is a Clone Wars DLC considering there is a Bad Batch one but something that minor doesn't ruin the game at all. In fact, I don't think the Deluxe Edition is necessary for you to enjoy the game, but I do think it is worth the extra $10 if you're interested. Overall, I think if you're a casual Star Wars nerd like me, this game won't disappoint. After all, it is Lego Star Wars."

It's weird to say that for a Lego game since they are mainly for kids but I feel as though the original ones had a bit more difficulty to them that made it fun to replay. This just feels far too easy and when it does get ""difficult"" its not due to the game getting harder, its due to the game getting buggier.

While I do enjoy this game, and I will continue to play it, hopefully getting 100% achievements, I do find myself bored quite often while playing.The first and most glaring issue I have is the horrible mission design, the missions are frustratingly short and uninspired. So far I have only played episode I and II, with a total of around ten levels or so. I can not for the life of me remember a single puzzle, I know there were puzzles, but they were incredibly short and easy. The only fun in any given mission is the combat, which gives you far more mechanics than you really need in my opinion.My second big issue is the lack of the Character customisation system. I have been playing a lot of Lego games since i was a child, and my favourite part of every single one of them has been the character customizer. I was so excited after playing Lego DC supervillains' incredible character customiser to see what this game would have, which is why i am so disappointed and confused as to why it is not here, hopefully they will add it in the future. Other small complaints are:Some performance issues, particularly on the droid factory mission in attack of the clonesConfusing and hard to navigate in-game menuSome jarring cuts in the story, somehow making the story feel very rushed yet also too slow at timesA very small nitpick but I feel that the characters are too cheap, I was going to safe up for maul, assuming he would cost atleast a million studs, yet when I went to check he was only 200.000, so I picked him up like it was nothing, and it didn't feel very rewarding. Hopefully Darth Vader will be more expensive :)However I still enjoy this game, and acknowledge what it has done well:It looks gorgeousI admire the experimentation with the combat system and camera view, i think it works really well and I am happy for the new generation of kids growing up with more ""modern"" lego gamesThe cutscenes are funny, and never quite overstay their welcomeThere are incredibly many and interesting characters i look forward to unlocking The open world is immense, and i look forward to turning of the HUD and getting lost in it :)PadmeAll in all, I don't feel like this game is worth what it's cost, and had I played for less than two hours, I would have asked for a refund. It is undoubtedly a big change in the Lego game franchise, and I look forward to seeing how the next game turns out :)"

3888,Myfendoren,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970677983/,1,,1,54.0,January,2,625,0,1,"tldr: If you are a fan of old Star Wars, there is a lot here to enjoy.Review:A great and fun love letter to fans of Star Wars. If you've played a Lego game then you know what you're getting here, though there is surprisingly a lot less of building as a mechanic than in other Lego games. Instead of building mechanics, fans get what they've always wanted: the ability to fly around the galaxy and visit all your favorite Star Wars locales in a variety of ships that can be unlocked while playing. There's only a few areas on every planet, but there's enough content to keep you busy for quite a while. You get to relive your favorite moments from the films with a slice of Lego goofiness, and it's a blast to run around and interact with the world.Sadly, the terrible Disney sequels are included. They are as uninteresting as their movie versions, though I am obviously biased. The missions for these episodes are not as interesting as the OT and PT episodes, the humor is not there (maybe you have to like those movies to get the jokes, but I haven't laughed once yet while playing through the disney trilogy), and at least the Scavenger class has its abilities locked behind progressing through Rey's story in episode 7. That will make a large number of collectibles from the OT and PT areas inaccessible until players progress in episode 7. Playing through these episodes so far is a chore, as they are just not as interesting as the OT and PT. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks this, as of the time of this review only 25% of players completed episode 7, compared to the ~40-50% for completing episodes 1-6. The inclusion of the disney trilogy also serves as a sad reminder of the poor efforts disney gave us instead of all the great stories that they've put to pasture from the 35 years of Lucas Star Wars. How amazing would it have been to play through Shadow of the Empire, or the Thrawn series? Or have crossovers from Jedi Knight, Force Unleashed, or even Fallen Order? How about a trilogy of episodes set in the Old Republic? What about the Clone Wars? There's mountains of content they could mine from that series. Why not include fan favorite Mara Jade? I get that this is the Skywalker Saga, so the scope is limited to the movies essentially (though to me that's just more reason to exclude the disney sequels), but it seems there could be (or could have been) lots of potential for including fan favorite content (obviously not what disney has been trying to do for the last decade).The game looks great, sounds great, and plays great. There was some performance slowdown in some of the busier levels (ie: EPII Droid Factory), but usually it runs great. Load times are very short as well. Some more display options would have been nice, like the option to turn off motion blur, but it's fine for the most part. I don't know what replayability there is yet, but I'm not sure that there is enough to keep players coming back after a full playthrough. This game is a perfect candidate for large DLC's and expansions, though, again, I'm sure that is outside the scope of this title.Update: Playing through episodes 8 and 9 was atrocious. They were long, drawn out, and featured way more dialogue then 1-6. If you remember the dialogue in those films you know how awful it is to hear it again. Funnily enough though, the dialogue was so ludicrous that I thought the developer had finally jumped the shark and gone too far with its silliness. But then I realized that it wasn't the dev's fault, it was word for word from the movies. And that's just sad. Playing episodes 8 and 9 were definitely the worst parts of the game."
3889,MeemawHustlin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Showbizelephant/,8,3,0,2.2,June,"18,",193,0,1,"This is the lowest quality of life of any game I have ever played and it basically wastes your time and gaslights you at every possible opportunity. Here the highlights in my 2 hours of gameplay:- A DLC screen in the center of the main menu, with the actual menu options hidden until you look at the bottom right to see that the A button will close the DLC screen and bring up the actual ability to play the game. Nice.- ""You unlocked a new ship! Press [button] to view it!"" followed by that menu saying I couldn't change ships and that every other feature of that entire menu was locked. Also frequently was unable to purchase things in similar situations because the game prompts you to explore freeplay specific features while stuck in story mode.- The game doesn't make it clear how story mode works and how to get out of it, making me eventually cave in and just b-line it to each objective to get the boring escort missions over with. I felt like I was on a guided tour instead of exploring an open world.- Constantly being yapped at by a breadcrumb trail thing telling me to go towards the objective instead of exploring the area (why is this open world then??). The options have no way to turn this off.- Left and right on the d-pad scroll between different characters in the character purchasing screen, scrolling through a grid that you cannot actually see and would need photographic memory to remember well enough to take advantage of this feature. On each selected character, there is a vertical column of costumes to purchase for that character. Pressing up/down on the d-pad does nothing, you have to press Y to vertically scroll. Why???????- Press down on the d-pad to open the map screen, then press down again to close it only to find that down on the d-pad now scrolls the map (which the L stick already does anyway), preventing easy toggling of the map screen. The map in general is a nightmare to navigate, with 4-5 layers of map selection, some having multiple menus within them (like traveling to a planet but not confirming yet so you can see planet progress).- The first two actual levels (which I didn't even realize were different from the not-a-level-but-still-story-mode sections) were boring on rails vehicle missions.- The pod race auto steers you (which can't be disabled) in a way that it forces you to run into everything and miss any boost pads you are trying to run over. Somehow this is even worse than the original pod race from the first lego star wars, which I didn't even know could be possible. I actually thought my controller was broken until someone told me that's how that level is.- Quitting the game makes you watch Rey's dialogue cutscene thing before showing you the actual menu options. Reopening the game forces you to hold Y to skip a series of splash screens (making it take longer than just pressing a button) and then you can't skip watching Rey's dialogue again.- A hint droid that you can walk over and talk to that opens a menu that you can open from anywhere in the game.- A ship control panel you can walk over to that lets you change your ship via a menu that you can open from anywhere in the game.- The force ""puzzles"" are a total chore. Gee I wonder if the blue canister needs to go in the blue frame? Why do I have to go through some 3D object placing control system to place it instead of the game just putting it where it obviously needs to go like in the old games? Some objects definitely would still need the free moving system but why can't certain things (like moving 4 of the exact same object into frames over and over) be automated so we aren't wasting our time?- Levels respawn all objects when you come back, devaluing the entire stud economy since each object drops a thousand studs repeatedly.- Purchasing a new character swaps them with a selected character of your party (that you likely won't even realize it selected to begin with) forcing you to swap that character with the original, making buying multiple characters at once or casually browsing the character store impossible as you have to carefully plan your UI movements to avoid extra work to correct your party layout afterwards. Why is the shop not completely separate from your team building screen?- The darth maul fight can be easily won by standing at a distance and spamming the lightsaber throw. I stood there for over a minute holding the lightsaber throw and darth maul just stood there looking at me. Most enemies behave in a similar fashion.Ultimately this game is a trap, taking over 2 hours for you to feel like you've experienced enough of it to have given it a chance, at which point steam will not let you refund it. There is an extreme amount of bloat both in the actual gameplay and in the overall structure of how the game objectives are organized. As much as the original Lego game formula gets criticized for being recycled for every game, they really did have a much more efficient system than whatever this is."

The first mission on Phantom Menace was a little bit weird because of all new things and controls, and that kinda stuff. But when you got played like 9 hours, you will see how the game is soo good. Few things I will complain and that is sound effect of some blasters, so the Jango Fett's blaster pistols, and Padme are not the one like in movies, I think they will correct that. Other things still need to get used to third person mode and not the locked screen bird perspective like the old LEGO games thats the most difficult part for me. Other things are amazing.

The world is beautiful and is so fun to explore, with so much stuff to collect.. Nostalgia hit pretty hard for me on the first few episodes but it was also really fun to see a bunch of stuff I didn't remember from the past lego star wars games.My only complaints is the menus suck to traverse, the obvious bugs many people are experiencing, the DLC characters don't seem to have voicelines, and no online multiplayer....

If you (or your child) just want to experience the game once and collect a few characters until you're bored, I can definitely see you getting a relaxing and somewhat enjoyable experience.One of the main selling points of the game is the sheer amount of content it has to offer, but unfortunately this is done in an overwhelming ""quantity over quality"" way, and therefore what is a 60-90h game (for 100%), only is enjoyable for 30% of the time. For a game so collectible-focused, it is unfortunate to see how many of the collectibles that feel lazy, copy-pasted or unpolished. The platforming feels rough, and gives the feeling that you're forced to do EXACTLY as the game wants you to do, which often makes jumping around obstacles feel like a chore rather than gameplay. Every level has three level challenges, which are requirements to beat if you're doing a completionist run. In theory these challenges serve the purpose to show the player some fun details and alternate routes in every level, but in reality many of these challenges feel random, unnecessary and some very bugged (the third of which being especially annoying).  Speaking of the levels, some are very nice and have some good puzzles, but there are wayyy too many boss fights, which have no variety from one another, and therefore get very stale - which becomes much more annoying since completing each level at least twice is a necessity.Admittedly a very biased point, but a major thing that i miss in this game, that was almost perfectly executed in The Complete Saga, were the ""just mess around and kill everything"" moments, which albeit are present in the new game, but don't feel that great due to the weird combo-system, that feels like a dumbed-down and not-as-satisfying version of the Batman Arkham combat-system. That being said, I did enjoy the combat in space, since it allows the player to turn their brain off in a very enjoyable kind of way, which is a staple of what makes LEGO-games good.In conclusion this game isn't bad, but it isn't good either. I you're looking for some more enjoyable lego games, i'd much rather recommend the following (which I have also gotten 100% in):If you're lucky, LEGO games are often available in bundles on humblebundle, which is a website that has bundles of games for often very cheap, where some of the money goes to charity, which is money better spent than 50$ on this."

Devs have fixed the biggest glitches and now I can progress in all of my save files! There are still some issues, but overall the experience is now much more enjoyable. Now I have to actually keep track of how long I'm playing since the game won't crash me out to let me know to stop lol.--------------------------If you look at my play time, I'm sure you'll be very confused. How can I have played this game for 200 hours and not recommend?The game is BUGGY. I hit a soft lock in episode 7 that has no work around and seemingly no clear trigger. I had to start a new save file since there was no way around it. This was after finishing episodes 1-6, of course. This isn't the only soft lock that exists and hasn't been fixed as far as I am aware. I know of at least one that exists in the mid point of episode 2 as well.And these are just the bugs that keep you from progressing in the game. I've encountered so many bugs that require you to close out the game. Character select decides you can't switch characters at all, loading screens glitch out and don't end, bounties just not dying and forcing you to leave and come back several times. I could go on. My favorite glitch I have encountered is receiving smuggling cargo from an episode 3 location to an episode 4 location. I had just restarted my save file and was on episode 1.There are also several aspects of gameplay that aren't glitches, but are frustrating. Targeting in spaceships is based on the character piloting the ship. As far as I can tell, this isn't communicated to you in the game; I found this information online. I spent hours thinking I had a bugged out quest when I just had the wrong character piloting. Requiring the scavenger role to create their own tools before you can use them is cute on paper, but a nightmare in practice. You have to either play episode 6 to the battle on Endor or episode 7 until Rey has scavenged her tools before you can use this character type's abilities. Again, this isn't communicated to you as a player. I read online that the best course of action is to just play episode 7 until you unlock the abilities, then come back when you want. This isn't a problem for people who didn't buy DLC, as you only unlock scavenger characters at these times anyway, but it just made me feel kind of stupid for buying the DLC and then not being able to use this character at all.Settings somehow also have issues. Vibration is on or off, and let me tell you, that spaceship vibration from accelerating has driven me INSANE. I just turn it off now, even though I prefer the haptic feedback. I wish there was a way to just dampen the vibration intensity, not turn it off entirely. No options for how to control the force, which is the single most frustrating mechanic to struggle with. I understand that if you can change the way it functions, some of the difficulty in puzzles goes away. I don't care, it hurts my brain every time I use it and I want that option.Obviously I have enjoyed the game, otherwise I wouldn't have such a long playtime. The puzzles can be fun, not too challenging at all, and the flavor text from NPCs is really fun. I enjoy the humor that LEGO always brings into their games and how they managed to maintain that, even with changing things up from the classic style.I wish I could recommend this game. It's been so much fun to play. It's also been incredibly frustrating to play. I've had to take a break from it due to frustration. A LEGO game made me essentially rage quit due to the bugs. At the current price point and bugginess, I simply cannot recommend this game. Once it's been patched and there aren't huge softlocks preventing you from playing significant portions of the game, I would love to update this review. As it stands, I recommend waiting until there have been some major updates before spending your money."

So i decided to get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he showed me how to cross play on steam for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

This is immediately noticeable right off the bat in episode 1 where, for example, when you escape the trade federation ship, all you do is run down a few bland hallways and then leave. Then again on naboo you skip the scaling into the palace to retake it. Instead they replaced it with a walk from point a to point b. The cutscenes still have that lego fun feel, but many of the missions are just not interesting.The optimization is also horrible. I have a 2070 super and am able to run every other game I own at max graphics settings. This game in certain areas I will peak at 30 fps (specifically the droid factory I'm stuck at like 15 fps). If you have an average pc you likely will have much much worse performance. Also had a bug where every time I tried to go into the gungan city the game would black screen and be unplayable. The only fix I found was restarting the game 3 times until the 4th time going into the city it randomly worked.Pros: The gameplay mechanics of 3rd person is fun. You can also tell they put a lot of work into random details like leaving footprints in sand and lightsabers leaving burn marks on walls. The open worlds themselves are also very good looking and filled with npcs to make them feel alive. Also some of the puzzles have been fun and creative.Overall as of now disappointed. Obviously a game with this hype makes it hard to live up, but leaving out many key star wars moments leaves the story feeling rushed and bugs can be extremely annoying."

It's good but if you're ""a legit gamer"", there are probably better places to put your $60. These games are made for younger kids and are basically toys, but they're a great way to chill out and experience star wars in a very paraphrased, non violent manner.

The missions are incredibly short (5 minutes max was the longest one I played). Whole episodes can be completed in 40 minutes. Boss fights are okay, I much prefer the non bullet-spongey fights of the older games. It seems the main story got shortened so much because the open world was expanded greatly. The open world does not offer much in terms of fun activities. The side missions are just walk here, talk to someone, fly to another planet, talk to someone else, and then you complete the mission. A couple more issues I had with the main missions were a severe lack of building and the aforementioned boss fights not involving much but button mashing. There are no remakes or better versions of fan favorite levels from the other lego titles. Coruscant battle? Gone. Geonosian arena from the clone wars? Toned down immensely with no real battle occurring. There are many other examples of previous levels being removed or the new version being worse. Space combat is atrocious.

Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

The story overall has been rushed over instead of being stretched in weird ways as before in the complete saga, but that actually has a nicer feel to itself. The focus isn't on the actual levels anymore but actually in small open world missions which almost feel like they could belong into a level while the (shortwhile) levels now actually feel more unique than ever.Now to the humour which has always been important to Lego games (at least for me):It is different than before but I really like it! It does not rely on gestic and mimic as strong as before and now strongly uses its new actually speaking star wars figures. The jokes are slap-stick and hit well (even Jar-Jar sometimes) ... Although any german speakers should change the spoken language to english.. really. Just do it."

Exactly what I expected.I had the game downloaded and running 10 minutes after launch and played for 17 hours straight.For those curious, prequel characters are voiced by the same voice actors from the clone wars TV series.By going from 6 levels per episode to 5 levels per episode, They cut out a lot of filler which is good, but they regrettably cut the dogfight over Coruscant from episode III and the space battle to destroy the second death star from episode VI, both of which are iconic movie moments that I wish we could've played through and not just watched through a cut scene."

Trooper Pack is great, Mando 1 is great (although the Grogu companion is annoying), but Classic ain't much. There's absolutely nothing unique or special about the Rogue One pack (Baze doesn't even have a machine gun). Solo is sort of like the Classic pack, but mainly new scoundrels. Not even giving us any mudtroopers. Aw well. I guess no shout out to the 224th? Anyway, I am kind of excited to see what the rest of the DLC turns out to be. Although, I warn you, if you didn't get the deluxe version, don't waste your money on the DLC. It seems that just like with real Star Wars, all the attention got given to The Mandalorian and everything else was just... ""okay, so we have this awesome Mandalorian DLC.... what else are we gonna put in?

It's an open world game with a fair bit of locations. The StoryAlthough funny and quite smooth. After a while you'll notice there isn't much game here.What almost takes the longest in this game is walking from mission start to mission start. The game constantly bounces you around from point to point and the actual missions themselves feel extremely basic and are over within a few minutes.I'm not 100% sure on this, but if my memory serves me correctly, the original games had longer story lines and used better moments on the movies.This game cucks you out of some moments which would've been awesome to play but they reserve it for cutscenes.The way Movie 9 ends is also kind of unacceptable. (But hey maybe they thought, ♥♥♥♥ movie, ♥♥♥♥ game chapter)Things to doThere are a f*ckton of things to do in this game, but 99,99% is the same with very slight variation.There's as always, unlocking different characters (within classes)You can level these classes (characters, e.g. jedi-sith-service droid-hero-villain) with Kyber bricks (collectables) which give either useless upgrades to straight up broken ones. You can also level up (boost) your player character in general (e.g. more hp, faster hp regen, collectable radar)There are a metric ton of Kyber Bricks to collect, around 1,164 is memory serves me correctly (been 2 weeks)Why I say buy it on a discount.Story is far too quick/short for its price imo (lego games always felt a tad too expensive to me though, however the world etc are gorgeous, sadly not exactly enough to do)Most of what you can do (Kyber-Bricks) is extremely repetitive and dull busy work for ADHD patients which require consttant stimuly. (so it worked perfectly for me the first ~20 hours till i realised what I was doing)Every 15 metres there's a shiny object, a Kyber-Brick, with an extremely easy (or somewhat vague) ""puzzle""They range from find 4 targets to shoot, stack boxes with jedi/sith, just walk over them lmao to miniquests (which sometimes require you to move between planets)The sheer bulk of content is collecting these Kyber-Bricks for your upgrades (eventually for the 100% since you'll be OP with just the melee/ranged damage upgrade (preference) and the hp regen upgrade.) But after a while you'll get really burned out with this and then your realisation kicks in of, what exactly does this game offer me and what can I do in it.The answer is, play extremely short missions and collect boring kyber-bricks dotted every 15 metres. (from what I've seen people are saying there isn't NG+ so you can't ever fully reexperience the complete story+cutscenes, also no dedicated MP (remote play was nearly input delay free for me, so it wasnt an issue)Overal, yeah it's a good game, but unless you want to turn your brain off and just collect the shiny thing like the gamer goblins we are it kinda isn't at the same time."

Absolutely no part of her ugly as sin piece of sh!t character design is endearing. God, I hate her. I hate her so much. So F!CKING much. Every time I see a stuffed toy Maz or an Maz gif or a sh!tty commercial, it ignites my primal rage response and I'm overcome by the need to punt this sh!tty little homunculus into the f!cking sun.

4069,Commandante Capybara,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122278462/,1,,1,19.9,April,"16,",153,0,1,"- Gameplay:I think they really managed to nail how gameplay should work in a LEGO game. The combat and movement feels very natural, and offers much more of a variety than previous titles, and camera control gives you so much freedom. The characters are now sorted by class, which is pretty cool as you now clearly see what your character can do, but I have to say that I probably prefer the ""old"" approach - that the characters have individual perks rather than class based ones, which made Jar Jar or C3PO more special in the Complete Saga. I'm also undecided about all characters being able to attack and double jump for the same reason. The class perk upgrades are probably fine, but I haven't used one of them.The only thing I would consider to be a downside is the difficulty. Even for most children this game is extremely easy. I wish they would have added settings for that. Boss fights rule now, as they should. Diverse attacks of the enemies and an actual challenge. Spaceships are better than ever and feel natural.- Graphics:Not much to say about that, except that they're even better than previous titles. Light effects and such are probably the most notable improvement.The devs (as in all LEGO games) have decided to include a bunch of details such as stances and movements that are quite adorable and in character.- Level Design/Story:Although I love the game, this is the only aspect of the game I consider to be worse than expected. The levels are way too short (5-15 minutes) and often feel rushed. In addition I don't always understand why some things are levels and some are not. Why include the travel through Naboos planet core, but NOT the battle for Theed? It's not that I find the existing levels bad, but it's a clear downgrade from previous games.Furthermore whilst I love how you now travel manually through the hub worlds like you do in most open world games, I sometimes felt bored/annoyed because I was just walking around doing nothing. This could have been prevented by including more levels. This all get's better after mid Episode II, but hasn't disappeared yet.Apart from that, cutscenes and the overall story is nice and or adorable. The first voiced LEGO game I found genuinely funny.- Open World:Some things I already covered, so I want to skip to how I actually feel about the open world in free play. Although it's certainly fun exploring the Star Wars galaxy, and the hub world system makes complete sense, I don't think this is my favourite open world of all LEGO games. It lacks either the character of the hub worlds from the Complete Saga, the Clone Wars or Indiana Jones - or the vastness of Undercover or Marvel Super Heroes. It's fine. Except that you can travel manually, and fly to space. They should stick with that, it's amazing.-Coop:It's sadly the worst Coop experience of all LEGO games. For two reasons. Splitscreen sucks, as your camera controls and movement is dependent on MORE SCREEN, YOU NEED MORE SCREEN...ok sorry, I digress. All improvements in gameplay are completely negated by Coop. Give us online coop. In addition, most levels are designed for one player. That's fine. But LEGO games were always cooler when you felt dependend on each other, especially when you look at the Clone Wars, this games Coop is just sad. Oh, and they decided to let you sit around and watch your buddy fight the Anankin/Obi duel.- Other:Whilst the unlockable characters are perfect, and you can play as whoever you want, ships and vehicles are extremely meh. You get one Jedi fighter etc.. Why? You already use a variant system for characters, it shouldn't have been to difficult to implement this system for vehicles. Also I guess capital ships aren't supposed to be playable, but it would have been nice if we got to see more of them, and actually steerable. As always, the system with a variety of collectibles and extras is fun.- Summary:It's a good entry and has a lot of improvements I adore. They generally sticked with the good parts and got rid of the bad ones.However it's not a perfect game. I understand the reasons for the shortcomings (not enough dev time mostly), but some stuff feels disappointing and or unecessary."

Like this Skywalker Saga just did.Congratulations to the Lego team, that suffered to bring us this masterpiece. That team gave us improved open world concept of lego games, improved graphics, optimized the game to be light enough so a GTX 1060 can run it AND gave us a complete masterpiece.

Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

A lot of criticism can be dismissed as ""it's a game for kids"" and I understand that to some degree.The Good:The game looks and feels fantasticThe combat, while easy, is enjoyableIt does a really good job of summing up the stories while also cutting out what could be considered ""filler"" (especially in the prequels)The classic Lego comedy is there and executed wellFunny prequels quotesThe Bad:Vehicle Controls feel bad and they always have been iffy in Lego games, however this is a result of only being able to see in the direction you are going, there is no way to look a different direction which makes flying a bit clunky.Levels are very short compared to the Complete SagaCharacters are no longer unique; every character within a preset ""class"" is the same as every other character in that class just with a different VA and model (with a few weapon exceptions)The game is easy, but again it's made for kids so I understand whyWhile I complained about vehicle controls, there are parts of the story that are pretty big that are cut out of being levels that were great levels in the original trilogy. The ones that I remember well are the one where you destroy the Star Destroyers and the space fight at the beginning of EP3.The game outside the levels is an open world collectathon that can get tediousNo windowed or borderless windowed in settingsThe Ugly (aka problems with Modern Star Wars leaking in):The first character you see in the game is Rey and she is the most prominent character on the title screen. I do not have a problem with strong female characters, however Luke Skywalker is, and should be, the face of Star Wars, not a character they introduced in the sequels that isn't even a Skywalker (at least by blood)Parts of the story have been retconned. Some of this is just to be more child friendly (Mace Windu not executing Jango Fett for example) but other parts I don't understand like the fight VS the Emperor ending with both Luke and Vader approaching when in the movies it was only Vader approaching. Minor things are changed as well, like Obi-Wan going to light speed without needing to use a hyperspace ring in EP2.Star Wars, and especially Lego Star Wars, was a big part of my childhood and I'm not sure how I feel about it. Change is scary, but not always a bad thing. However, there are a few things that just stand out too much for me to say that I recommend it."

4140,SubTerrel,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SubTerrel_/,6,3,0,101.2,April,"15,",151,0,1,"Alright time for a complete breakdown. Firstly, I have completed the game with 100% on everything.  I pre-ordered it and played since it was released. I grew up with the Lego Star Wars games and they hold a special place in my heart. This game however doesn't seem to make the cut. Story:The actual story will take between 4-10 hours depending on if you rush through the levels. The levels are quite easy and can be beaten quickly. A lot of the added time will come from the Cut-Scenes. The Cut-Scenes are my favorite part of the game, adding humor and interesting changes to the story from the movies. Exploration:After you have completed the story( or you can start during the story), you are tasked with finding and completing tasks across the galaxy. Some examples include: Smuggling Equipment, Hunting Characters, and Serving Customers. It is around 1500 different challenges you will need to complete in order to 100% complete the game. I recommend completing the entire story before starting exploration since some quests will be locked until a part of the story is complete. This will take up the majority of your time and is very boring. There is some humor to be found in some of the quests but nothing that would make it worth doing. Tips: Here are some tips for those who buy the game.-Complete the Story first then Explore-Planet to Planet completion is usually the fastest.-Character and Ship quests usually take the longest since you have to travel around the galaxy-Every Smuggling quest will have 3 attack zones-Unlock the skip option for astromechs, protocols, rebels, and villains. It will save lots of time-Spend Data cards on mutipliers first then Universal Translator. Multipliers stack so once you get 2x and 4x you will make 8x the studs-Sith and Bounty hunters are usually the best at finding kyber bricks. Sith can lift characters and bounty hunters specs greatly increase damage-Focus on Core Upgrades before maxing out characters-Most Minikits require Freeplay so don't bother looking for then during Story mode(exception is ship levels)-Capital ships only offer a few kyber bricks so don't buy then until you have plently of money to spare-All Multipliers applyed equal x3840-During Freeplay you can avoid enemies by switching to Sith, Villians, or Bounty Hunters.-The character you get into a ship with will decide who is your friends. Make sure to have a rebel if you are trying to complete an attack quest otherwise you will lock onto friendlies-Only 1163 out of 1166 kyber bricks are needed to fully max out every class.-Google Codes instead of submitting forms, the codes give different character outfits-GOnk as a playable character can power GOnk stations-Collectable Detector is mandatory if you want to beat exploration the fastest.-Disable Super GNK and Porg Companion in Story as they can cause game breaking bugs.-When you reach a new planet, shoot the Kyber Asteroid first since it gives 5 kyber bricksBugs:There are way too many bugs to list hear but I will list some of the more problematic bugs.-Quests breaking mid completion    -Quest Mandatory Characters not spawning, Character's health bars reaching zero but still fighting, Items      not spawning, Quest breaks if approached from a different angle, etc.-Vehicle based challenges break if you don't have Aim Assist turned on in Settings    -Applies Mainly to Endor Speeder Chase. Shots hit too low so it's almost impossible to land a hit. After a      while the map ends and becomes a void that is impossible to escape without leaving the level entirely.-Capital Ships break Smuggling Zones    -If you have a Capital Ship called and then smuggle goods, it will become a ghost ship in the battle zone      and block visuals. It doesn't have a hit box but it does cause issues with visibility since it absorbs the zone.-Some Character purchases are listed as rumors    -The character will be listed and have the option to buy but instead of giving it's true price, the character      will be sold for the price of the rumor.-Characters can't be bought if their other skin is shown in the character menu    -Some characters have multiple outfits but a menu bug prevents the purchase of the other outfit if an      already bought outfit is shown. A temporary fix is to show the not owned outfit, click to a different class      window then back and you should be able to buy it.-Rumors providing no information    -Several rumors when bought say, ""No rumor data"" after bought-Super GNk and Porg Companion break Story Levels    -They both act as respawn points so they can respawn you or load you in a zone you aren't meant to be           resulting in a level restart.Final Thoughts:My main issue is the pricing for the game. For a $50-$60 game you would expect to have a large amount of content and enjoyment. This however isn't the case, if you want to get the best out of this game without buying it just look up a Cut-Scene compilation on YouTube. The DLCs only provide characters and don't add any extra levels or content. They are outlandishly expensive for what you get. The game is obviously designed to make you buy Legos as it constantly shows Set IDs and asks you if the game makes you want to buy Legos. It isn't much of an issue but they could have spent more time on the game over merchandise. I would not recommend this game, you get about 5-10% content and 90-95% filler copy-pasted quests. Spend your money on something more enjoyable.TLDR: Game too expensive for what you get."

Instead of tight, focused levels like TCS/ Clone Wars, you have low attention span button mashing while blankly staring at a screen.  They delayed this game for over three years and its not even really a game, its more of a huge checklist with mildly engaging activities with a coat of star wars paint. Play literally any other lego game and its more engaging than this.  An actual game for toddlers, not for ""everyone.""

4185,Yorgul,https://steamcommunity.com/id/gigachadhq/,2,,1,10.5,December,"24,",22,0,1,"Effects of the Cuban RevolutionDuring the middle of the 20th century, the world had all of its eyes looking at Cuba as its government ideals were being challenged by revolutionaries led by Fidel Castro. This revolution would ultimately prove successful as President Bautista would flee the country and Fidel would take power and implement social reforms across the country. One of the main reforms would be to seize all American owned private property in an attempt to nationalize its sugar production (Wright 28-29). This nationalization of the economy would foster unique approaches to that nationalization of key industries in various countries which includes: Chile for its nationalization of its copper industry, Peru and its nationalization of its petroleum industry, and Nicaragua for its nationalization of its agricultural industry. The 1964 Chilean election would have the marxist-leaning candidate Salvador Allende lose out to the less radical Eduardo Frei (Wright 146). Allende supported social reforms that were related to those in Cuba which include: promoting unionization, raising taxes on the wealthy, and the nationalization of the copper industry (Wright 145). Frei supported almost the same exact reforms, however wished for it to be less “statist” (Wright 145). While appearing to be on both sides of the spectrum at the time, both sides emphasized their campaign to have more control on the economy and have less foreign influence on it. During Frei’s leadership, he underwent a “Chileanization of the copper companies, gaining 51 percent government control with options to purchase the remaining 49 percent” (Wright 146). This was a big step forward for combating the foreign companies, but Frei failed to satisfy the lower classes' needs for improvement (Wright 146) and would ultimately pave the way for Allende to take power in 1970 (Wright 148). Allende, now in power, would push for extensive nationalization which included the copper economy, which gave the Chilean government “commanding heights” (Wright 151). However by 1973, while having nationalized 200 of Chile’s biggest enterprises, the Chilean economy was near collapse (Wright 158). By near the year’s end, the military had taken power and begun to slow down the process of further nationalization (Wright 160).In Peru, the petroleum industry was dominated by the American International Petroleum Company (Wright 36). The IPC were responsible for being the number one producer of Peruivian oil, and at the same time, served as a symbol of American Imperialism (Wright 125). In 1968, a series of events would unfold involving this company, which would lead to the downfall of the current civilian government and would feature the rise of a military dictatorship. These events kicked off when a document leaked showcasing the major concessions by the government to the IPC over the company’s legal status and land exploitation rights (Wright 125). Once this took place, the militaristic nationalist government would take power and as for their first action, began the seizing of IPC property (Wright 125). Unlike a majority of Latin American countries who have their civilian populations overthrow the government to bring social reforms, Peru’s new social reforms and this nationalization of the petroleum industry would be started by the military itself (Wright 126). This new military government was led by Juan Velasco who would start off his leadership by denying the United States compensations for the property seized of the IPC (Wright 136). This military government would last until 1975 (Wright 138), during which, the government would bring in social reforms, including more nationalization of other industries within Peru. Peru’s approach to the nationalization of their key industry was unique, because while the other nationalizations of key industries in these countries took place over time and by the civilian governments, Peru’s nationalization of their petroleum was the first thing that occurred by the new military government. In 1979 after a long guerilla campaign, the FSLN took power in Nicaragua. This revolution would coincide with rising Soviet skepticism in the region, and more privatization in other communist countries (Wright 178). Pair that with pressure from the United States would force the Sandinistas to become more moderate than the other countries in their policies (Wright 179). With this, the agricultural industry, which employed nearly half of the country (Wright 179) would not face much at the beginning of FSLN rule. The most notable action within the first two years was the confiscation of the land, owned by the Somozas (Wright 179). This action would bring 20 percent of the productive land under the state (Wright 179). The Nicaraguan government would implement a mixed economy that would still retain foreign investors, but also increase the amount of land held by small-and-medium sized producers to 60 percent of the agricultural surface and reduce the land owned by large producers and cooperatives (Wright 179). This mixed economy would allow farmers to continue working for the private sector or become self employed and have land to farm with (Wright 180). What is unique about Nicaragua’s approach to nationalization of its key industry, is that it didn't really bring that much land under the state. Its small amount of land is likely attributed to having constant pressure by the United States in the north and even Fidel Castro advising the Sandinistas to retain a substantial amount of land in the private sector (Wright 178). This pressure would eventually lead to the revolutionary being effectively voted out of power and Violeta Chamorro would bring even more moderate and conservative reforms.In these three cases, they all brought different approaches to nationalizing the economy. The Chileans would have a slow process of nationalizing its economy, at the hands of a government that didn’t even win a majority of the people’s votes, that would end in a military coup that would end these reforms (Wright 148). The Peruvian military were the ones to bring reforms that would nationalize their petroleum industry as one of their first acts upon obtaining power. Then the Nicaraguans would try to bring a more moderate nationalization of their agricultural industry by bringing more land out of large producers into small producers, while keeping a small amount of land for themselves. These three unique approaches to the same goal of nationalizing their economies all stemmed from the Cuban Revolution and Cuba’s nationalization of their sugar plantations. All of these approaches would oppose foreign investors, mostly from the United States, who would use funds and resources to try and undermine these governments and their reforms by supporting opposition within their countries."

They cut out so many missions its insane tbh. Episode 1 had legit 2 missions that were not flying or using a vehicle and the game seems to be catered specifically for flying missions. The 2 missions were a tiny level using gungans and the other was a boss fight. Episode 2 cut out kamino basically to just walking down a hall way. I don't mind flying missions but they pruned the game down so much in terms of traditional missions. Also free play is great but the zones are so large it seems the game was made for flying missions and to make you finish asap to just play that.

The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself."

At the time of this review I have 17 hours of play-time, and I've only finished episodes I-VI. I still have 3 more movies to play and several planets are left unexplored. Not to mention all the collectibles that I only have about 10% of... so yes, this game is not short. The levels are not short. The cut-scenes and dialogue feel rushed, sure. But you come here to play to the movies, not re-watch them. Who cares if context is missing, or some part of the game are not playable. It still takes several hours to beat an episode, and what you don't get to play in the story is (most of the time) available in some form in the free-roam parts. Some missing moments from the movies are perhaps disappointing, but absolutely NOT a deal-breaker. As I said, 17 hours and I'm not even close to finished.I really enjoy that this game offers more types of combat options than just light-sabers and blasters. Playing as the droids is actually fun and you can do more than just open terminals like in the classic game. A specific level I see people complain about is the ending of ROTS, where you play as Obi-Wan and the droids. I personally liked this direction. Rather than copying The Complete Saga, TT-Games took a new approach and made the scene and level refreshing. I've found they did this for a number of levels in the game, which I really love.Now there are some negatives... unfortunately a bug has halted my play-through at this time. I have decided to still recommend this game under the assumption this bug will be patched soon. Occasionally if you need to exit the game (or crash) during a story mission then it locks you out of starting or completing the mission. For me, this has happened during episode 7 but I have heard others experience it in 2 and 3. There is also a ton of lag in some parts of the game, namely episode 2, despite my system requirements being well over recommended.EDIT: The Episode 7 bug was not fixed, but I found a workaround on YouTube. Having finally finished the story after about 21 hours of game time, I can confidently say this game is far larger than I originally thought when I wrote this review... I'm now 43 hours in and only 45% done. That should speak to the size of this game. It's so much fun, I can't explain how much I love this game.... could do with a character creator though, I'd love to make my SWTOR characters in here."

There are no difficulty settings, and everything is designed to be challenging, for children. don't be fooled by the rolling and parrying mechanics that exist, If you're looking for a dark souls/elden ring combat experience, look elsewhere, you could beat a boss battle with one finger. The puzzles are fun, but as well, not hard at all. the story and freeplay puzzles are very linear and throughout my whole playthrough of the story I didn't get stuck on a single mission. However, this game is super fun for Lego fans, and even more so for star wars fans. If you're looking for a no sweat, fun to play adventure game to play in your down time, this is the game for you. There's barely any grinding, so you can just play casually and still get characters easily (once you have stud multipliers, of course) Overall, good game, recommended, I don't regret my 200 hours."

I spent a while trying to get into the game, but in hindsight I wish I just refunded it, I could have spent the money on something worthwhile, like a surge protector or tape, or even just Outer Wilds again because the devs deserve it.First issue, tons of the content in the campaign is cutscenes, skipping pretty memorable scenes that could have made somewhat enjoyable levels. If they got rid of the hundreds of meaningless, copy + pasted side missions and actually filled the campaign with content I could see this being somewhat redeemable. The story missions are primarily just linear paths, point A to point B routes with occasional enemies sprinkled about. There is no failstate for most things, and so there isn't any challenge that makes playing feel rewarding. You would actually have to put in effort to make it challenging, if it's even possible (*cough cough* battle of Naboo). Enemies tend to meander about or ignore you.If the combat doesn't offer engaging gameplay, surely the puzzles will, right?There are no puzzles, at least ones that don't present the solution right away. Nor is there platforming, pretty much everything is either quick time events or walking to your next objective (I thought QTEs died out in 2012??), I would hesitate to even call this gameplay.Open world is pretty empty and feels lifeless with NPCs just existing to offer you missions, but I've heard that this is the status quo for many open world games (maybe I've gotten spoiled by Elden Ring). 380 characters is a lie. Most of the characters' abilities and movesets can be found in every other character in their class, and their fighting movesets don't make a difference because there is barely any proper combat.1/10 it looks pretty sometimes"

The reason I say until episode 7 is because the godawful disney films were written by dumbasses who use the guise of ""oh they don't have the experience necessary to throw their lightsaber"" BRO THEY JUST FOUGHT KYLO REN WHO IS AN EXPERIENCED AND TRAINED FIGHTER THE ♥♥♥♥ DO YOU MEAN.  Every other boss fight plays out the exact same, and speaking of playing the exact same... the vehicle levels.

The Combat is better compared to previous Lego games, but there is not enough of it. Most of the time your just running around stacking crates or pulling levers. There are only 5 levels per movie and most of them feel to short and there are too many duel levels. The game is buggy as hell. It's almost impossible to play through a level or a mission without some bug ruining the experience. The comedy feels forced and unnatural, the times I laughed could be counted on one hand.

4296,The Legend of Peter,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheOneWithTheBeard/,2,,0,15.0,October,"4,",58,0,1,"Devs apparently are concinved that more of anything is always better.The problem is: more good is better, more bad is just worse. And the ""more"" in this game is kinda bad.The game definitely has good things and looks great, but I don't find myself enjoying it too much for a plethora of reasons. In the end it's just... not very fun.Overall feels like a decent game that is held back by the sheer sum of small issues to a point where I can barely enjoy it.And instead of improving the core game, devs for some reason decided to litter (and I mean absolutetly cram) every location with unengaging and repetative tasks. Even more than the tasks themselves being boring, the reward for pretty much all of them is the same: 1 kyberbrick. You can use these to unlock or level skills of character classes, most of which are very boring (e.g. your throws deal x% more damage).And if neither the tasks themselves, nor the reward is interesting, why would I bother?This game puts every character into one class (rebel, scoundrel, rebellion, jedi, villain ...). I find this system to be deficient, making the characters boring and inauthentic.At the core of lego games are puzzles that can only be completed by specific charaters, e.g. characters with an explosive, or characters that are part of the rebellion, characters with a hook-shot... One of the most fun things for me always was finding characters that can complete as many tasks as possible. This is what makes unlocking characters interesting and engaging: figuring out their ""skill set"". E.g. finding a blaster character with a double jump and explosives, or a mini-gun character with a jet-pack, a jedi that can crawl through tunnels etc. Every class has a definitive skill-set and there's almost no reason to actually look at the characters you unlock.  Why would I care about rebellion guy with gun 24? (So far the only exception I found was Boba Fett having a jet pack.)Characters just feel more like skins than like characters. The only reason left to actually look at unlocked characters is that they might have slightly different attacks than the others - and even these attacks seem to be mostly the same within one class.Not only does this make characters boring, it also makes no sense. For example, Luke is a Jedi, so he cannot use rebellion terminals because he is not of the ""rebellion"" class. All villains (every stormtrooper, fleet captain, whatever) have explosives, but none of the rebels - because it's part of the villain class to have explosives. - you cannot choose which saga to play, you have to follow a linear path through the levels- no ground battles, which were easily my favourite thing to do in lego clone wars- hitboxes to interact with anything are bad. This includes: picking up items, placing down items, riding a vehicle, building something from legos- force attack hitboxes are so bad I had to make them their own point. Every single time I try to deactivate and put away a light saber by pressing b (or activate it), my character instead detonates a random flower at the end of the room, because for some reason the force auto-target reached absurdly far and cannot be suppressed (e.g. by holding down b instead of tapping it). And if I'm lucky and there is actually no item around that could be targeted, it instead targets my companion and kills him. Simply amazing. And because the control configuration is basically useless you can not rebind the force attack to not use the same button. Even better.- control configuration is both bad and bugged (provides no granularity at all and resets half the time)- jumping does not inherit velocity from sprinting, so any time you jump while sprinting it feels like you suddenly hit a (lego) brick wall- the hint-providing droid stationed at every hub location does not stop asking you to come read his hints (all of which have been displayed during the gameplay at the appropriate point in time, it's just for repeating stuff), and he has like 3 voice-lines in total, you can not disable, mute or remove him. This guy is actually insanely annoying, he makes me not wanna spent any time in central areas at all- characters just can't shut up for a minute in general- space-combat is boring and also plays terribly (and there's way too many optional ""hey do this space fight which is the same as the previous 10 but with a different planet in the background)- all npc's talk too slowly for me personally, same for the text speed of their speech bubbles (to be fair, otherwise voice and text simply wouldn't match). If I skip the slow text reveal to instantly see the full text bubble,  I can read their dialog like 3 times over in the time it takes them to utter it a single time.- waaay too many blaster fights that all are the exact same- game drops inputs every now and then- you can't do anything other than slowly walking around during a light saber throw: you can't run, you can't jump, you can't attack (also throws miss half of the time). In a previous game you could still run around, jump, and attack using the force which was very fun and felt extremely fluid - now throwing your light saber just feels like a waste of time.- force controls for lifting and moving an object are just terrible- parcour objects (bars to hold on to, twirling bars etc) feel very ""static"", slow and unprecise- camera is kinda bad- character menu is hard to navigate- music transitions triggered by entering a specific location are poorly made- game sometimes plays 2 tracks at the same time (if you are near a radio, you will hear music from the radio + the ""actual"" game music), this always sounds terrible and kinda hurts my ears- scavenger class does not have its abilities unlocked initially. I was trying to fully clear the dagobah area and got stuck on a kyberbrick - the game told me to use a scavenger to collect it, but even after switching to one I could not do anything to get the brick. I wasted like half an hour before I asked google about this - turns out you need to play a specific level to unlock these abilites.This was rather annoying and didn't add anything to the game - if you play the level you will literally unlock all 3 scavenger abilites within 5 minutes. Why even lock them in the first place if you're just gonna throw them at me anyways?Bonus:When following Obi-Wan to his hutt in episode IV I had to stop and go back to him 3 times because he would simply stop and stand still if you leave a ridiculously small radius. One of these times I was literally already  at the hutt, but you cannot start the level if he's not there. I could literally  see him from where I was standing, but I still had to go back to him so he would stop waiting for me - so he could show me the way to his hutt...  just brilliant"
4297,Kolbi,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197979664250/,2,1,1,6.4,April,"24,",36,3,1,"TLDR: Disappointed in the game and in myself for buying it and not refunding on time. Pressing recommend to balance out my seemingly unfair judgement after playing a mere 6 hours. The whole 6 hours I played was constant struggle with emotions and when I realized I despise the game and played too much already to get a refund I started to feel remorse paying full price for it. This is a childs game and I just don't know what I expected as a 32 Y/O dumbas$. The promise of open world just grabbed my attention and star wars in general as I am a fan of the whole universe. Pros:- Star Wars storytelling for 5-10 year olds. It is okay to get children busy for a while in a friendly and forgiving environment. Anyone older just read the books.. or watch the movies.. or play any other SW game..Cons:- Gameplay is the following: Press W- Challenges are absolutely pointles, easy and the moral reward for a 100% completion is nonsense. Utter waste of time.- Story is given obviously you can't do anything just go with the flow. There are no decisions. It is alright as the game is working with a given story. The implementation is rubbish. Even the slightest sense of decision making is missing. The game forgives every mistake you make. No consequences, you cannot die or lose anything except you will to play. - Ally characters do nothing. You have to do everything, destroy every stupid droid. The gungan armies just standing there, their backline is breached and the droids take close to no dmg from the two other gungans that miserably try to defeat them for the sake of aesthetics. You need to do everything. You need to load the trebuchet because the gungan who would have only that job is standing there and well... standing there...- Even if you turn off all AIM assist and HP regen, anything that aids you (as I did), the boss fights will be still the same... NOTHING changes. During the Vader fight with Luke I got hit zero times and wrecked the ♥♥♥♥ out of the sith lord then obviously he won. That is the story right? Same with Maul vs Obi+Ani. I had bigger challenge from the very first common mob from any of the Dark Souls games.- It is seriously not funny. It is childish and the ""fun"" just ruins the storytelling.- You cannot kill anything other than you supposed to.- The gameplay is sooooooooooooooooo forgiving it pains me. You cannot die, you resurrect on the same spot like nothing happened. - During pod racing on Tatooine if you go to the bathroom mid-race you will see that the other contestants did the same. You cannot lose the race. - Stormtroopers' aim is worse than in the movies!! How? - The only enjoyable part of the combat is that headshot is fatal (ok first you need to shoot down the helmet which is lame cuz it should not protect from a direct hit). A clean cut from the lightsaber is somehow not... - This game was not meant for casual teenager or adult gamers by any mean. It was meant for children below 12. If anyone asking I would say I recommend Jedi Knight, Republic Commando, Empire at War, but mostly KOTOR I-II and The Force Unleashed I-II because there was no better games released under Star Wars trademark than them.I am utterly disappointed that this game was released not a new Force Unleashed type one or KOTOR... and this game sells almost the same as Elden Ring. Wondering how many regret buying it... Sorry the only reason I put recommended is because I only played 6 hours. I haven't deleted it just. I am constantly torn between ""I should delete and forget, 60€ is nothing"" vs ""I paid for it I must at least complete the story""... And the worse part I bought the deluxe edition :'D"

Sure it's pretty good but it lacks the classic Lego pizzazz.First of all the characters look really good don't get me wrong, the graphics are fantastic! But for the most part they all do the same thing. There are 9 classes to choose from, each one is unique but every character in said class does the same thing. For example Captain Phasma and a regular storm trooper both do the same thing, the only difference is weapon, looks and on rare occasion there is a unique ability that character posses, but often it is not only used by that one character.Next the content, when I bought the deluxe edition and looked at the DLC, I though I would get to play through the Mandalorian, or Rogue One, but nope, just plain old character packs. But during the main story there is only 45 missions! That may seem like alot but when I tell you the level can be completed in under 5 minutes easily that really takes the time down. But after that when going into the freeplay you see that the game has 1200 kyber bricks; this games equivalent of gold bricks. This may seem like alot, BECAUSE IT IS. But after an hour or two it gets very tedious, and I myself have not even 100% the game (which I plan to do).They are on all the planets, of which there are 24, but most of each of them is just kyber brick collection with the odd couple of side missions for extra characters, WHICH ALSO ONLY LOOK DIFFERENT.Oh and the glitches! Where do I start! To start off we have Rey's back flipping animation not completeing! How could they! I'm just kidding of course and haven't found any game breaking bugs but have found a few comical ones such as key cards clipping through blasters, hanging onto air when climbing and characters standing up whilst riding Rey's speeder. Other people did find the ""child abuse flight exploit"", pretty unusual name for something, eh? There were a few preventing game completion though, possibly most notably the ""Hungry Happabore"", which would make the game softlock you by dancing forever if you had the ""Galaxy Rave"" cheat on.There is also no character creator, this was a big let down, even bigger knowing that it was in production before it was scrapped. Luckily there is a mod on NexusMods that replicates the feature, this was one of the features I was most excited for but sadly TT didn't deliver with this game once again.All in all the SWS isn't a bad game per say, just not one worth the £50 price tag. if it were on sale I would recommend it but for what it is, it's just not worth it. The game may get more DLC and if that does happen I will update my review to include it's presence in it, but for now I wouldn't buy it again."

It's just wasting your time with boring missions and dialogue you already know, but now it's a bad new synchro. There are only five levels per episode and they are all way shorter then in the original and you mostly just spam buttons to kill enemies. To make matters worse, your are forced to absolve running sections to get from one level to antoher. This can take up to 5 minutes just running from one mission to another, nothing else. The ""story"" is maybe the worst. It's like someone googled ""Star Wars Memes"" and just shoved everything he saw in this game. It's just key jangling, memberberries, whatever you wanna call it. Also you can tell that they are trying to justify the sequel trilogy with this. They are trying so hard to make it funny but epic with those last three films, it's just pathetic. Most jokes are just slapstick humour, but sometimes it can be funny. Though never even close to the original humour.Free Play is ok. Sometimes boring, few times really fun, mostly just ok. There is much to collect, so you're busy for some time. Some riddles are creative, most are basic but still this is a step up from the original, where almost all riddles were boring. So this is the best part of the game. The missions on the other hand are painful. It's again just the game wasting your time. Transport a cargo from this planet to this planet, but you are attacked three times by enemies, who grow in number each time. Or the missions where you have to catch a character. They run away, you shoot them, they get invincible for like 5 to 10 seconds, repeat. Sometimes they even stun you for no reason. And their healthbars are absurdly large, to make it even more tedious. Same with boss battles. Just spam a button 'til they're dead. No interesting mechanics, no character themed boss fight. Just click a button 100 times.Lastly: the bugs. There are so many. Most are just annoying, but some break the gameplay. For example my mission marker just vanished and I had to look up a video to find the person I needed to talk to. Or the person i neede to talk to disappeared when I got to close, forcing me to twitch my camera and take different approaches so they wouldn't despawn. Graphical glitches happen all the time, but that's not so bad, it doesn't get in your face that often.In summary: Don't buy this for full price. 20$ maximum, because remeber: You have to play the story to get to free play. That is like 5-10 hours of boring ♥♥♥♥ you have to endure. And if u wanna buy this, wait half a year til those bugs are fixed. If they even fix them."

Especially on max graphics settings the game looks very nice. With full drop in and drop out co op play available, its simple mindless solo/buddy fun.

I can block blaster bolts left and right, but if I try to attack, I attack a direction I am not facing, or my character won't attack in general. When my lightsaber returns to me after I throw it, my character stands there for a good 2 seconds before he will attack again, usually resulting in me getting killed. Whenever I play as Yoda, after every single attack, he puts his lightsaber away and takes 3 hits before he pulls it out again.The missions are bland and I feel like I'm skipping most of the episodes when I play. There aren't many challenges in the missions to help you get to where you need to go or are super repetitive, and the ones that are in the missions are not creative. It's climb this wall, shoot this target, climb this wall, move this box, climb this wall. 2 missions later, the episode ends. (It's 5 missions per episode, but with how short they are, and how much of the movie I'm skipping, it might as well be 2)R2 and other astromechs can't fly anymore. This was probably the biggest let down IMO. I expected to be able to fly across a gap like astromechs in TCS could. They allowed protocol droids to be able to jump and build, so that makes up for it a little bit.Flying in space is buggy as well. When I turn to try to destroy an asteroid or land on a planet, I barely turn and my ship starts to fly in circles and doesnt want to stop for a good few seconds. Usually after one complete 360 degree turn.Palpatine did not say ""It's treason then."" nor could you fight palpatine as Mace Windu.There was no ""Master Skywalker, there's too many of them. What are we going to do?""I'm not too impressed with the game, but I'm going to finish it just for nostalgia's sake. But I recommend the complete saga over this.Also Ki Adi Mundi's death scene was changed.Edit: I forgot to say what I enjoy about it.I like how the helmets of the clones (and i assume other helmeted soldiers) come off after hitting them in the head. It has a cool look to it.For non helmeted enemies, a headshot with a blaster is a one hit kill which i think is super cool and convenient. The humor is top tier. I nearly choked on some water when Jar Jar drank the hyperdrive fluid and immediately turned green and made the dumb face. Other people have said you cannot kill younglings in the Jedi temple, but you can. As commander cody, or a jedi, I have taken the lives of several children. Might be a bug on their games or mine. But I at least can kill younglings."

For some reason they decided that Anakin VS Obi-Wan should be single player and the second player just gets to watch as C3PO but Luke VS Vader is co op but breaks the boss fight.The cutscenes are rushed versions of the movies and they skip a ton of possibilities for levels and content.There is no battle of coruscant, The clones don't do anything at all, Endor was over in a flash, You don't even get to destroy the second death star in episode 6.There is no character customization (Though personally I never used it anyway.) and the FPS just drops on some levels despite my specs being WELL over the recommended.The game plays more like Mario Odyssey in being that it's a collectathon more than an actual game.They seem to have had a quota for making sure all the meme lines are in the game but the context seems to be thrown out sometimes.I've only played from 1-6 and in between all the cutscenes there were maybe 1-2 good missions per movie, not to mention there were as little as 5 in each one.I got the game as a birthday gift but frankly I can't recommend, they had over 3 years to make this work out and they just didn't pull it off.It sucks but that's the truth of it."

I played the heck out of them on my Playstation 2, Nintendo Wii and Xbox 360 back in the day, and still play them often on my PC. When they announced this game, it is safe to say my expectations were ultra high, especially since the last time they heavily changed up the lego formula was Lego Lord of the Rings (which is also one of my most beloved Lego games). I got this game day one on my PS5 and played it the night it came out, and holy cow was I blown out of the water! I wound up getting and playing through the game on my Switch, Xbox (most of the game at least) and on my PC too. It even made me dislike Rise of Skywalker less (marginally, but hey its something). If you like Lego Games or Star Wars ones, this game does not disappoint! I would 100% recommend this game to anyone looking for a good star wars game. The base game also has an absurd amount of unlockable characters, so the DLC isn't strictly necessary, but I also got the DLC because I like the characters in it (Andor, Mandalorion, etc.) since it doesn't add new levels or challenges or anything like that, so I'd recommend it only if you want to play as those extra characters specifically."

The free roam is amazing, the gameplay is unique, and there post-story content which is something I enjoy a lot. The missions added in this game are great for post-story gameplay and the animation for characters especially is amazing. You can tell how hard the developers worked on this, and it shows how much they researched the Star Wars franchise, even adding some inside jokes that only a true fan would get. This game is better than anything EA has done for the franchise, and it's a kids game. This game shows that the love for Lego does not die with age."

4347,QueenFreak877,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095820771/,4,,0,56.9,April,"6,",559,1,1,"so i want to preface this by saying i am a LOOONNNNNNNNNGG term lego game fan. Ive played and 100%d every lego game from Lego Star Wars: The Video Game (the original '05 one), which a blood relative bought for me brand new when it came out, all the way through The Lego Movie 2 Videogame multiple times (except Lego The Hobbit, which is because that game is utter trash and one of the few games ive ever regretted buying). I actually went back and starting replaying through my favourite most recent lego game (Jurassic World) in preparation for this game. so i LOVE almost every lego games. theyre fun, some of the jokes are still hilarious, and theyre a completionist's dream. Ive been looking forward to this game for as long as its been announced as a thing! I even made sure to buy the deluxe edition because thats how much faith i had in tt to deliver a great game....... and the final product is.. bad actually. Sure its gorgeous. the best looking lego game ever id say! and so far the worlds ive explored are lovingly detailed and winding just like a major starwars settlement should be. they feel believably huge. however, so far theres no depth to them. the collectibles arent hidden in any way and i cant even say theres any actual puzzles either. the majority of the puzzles i came across while exploring were ""stack some boxes and jump up/over to the kyber brick"". the rest involved switching to a character (if i had them) that could press a button and then boom puzzle is solved. thats it.and then theres the levels, or rather, the lack thereof. now it does *technically* have 5 levels per episode, but each is so brief, theyd fit right in in Lego Indiana Jones 2 (which was tt's first attempt at an open world in this style of games and was done at the cost of its levels, but was a good first attempt!). If youve playing any of the other lego games, they feel like a single section of one of those games' levels and barely take 10 minutes to complete. the majority of an episodes story is told by having the player go from point a to point b, watch some cutscenes that show the most interesting and enjoyable parts of the movies at super speed and skip so much as well that each cutscene feels like a small snippet of a scene itself! it makes it hard to follow whats going on even if youve watched that episode 100 times irl. I know others have written about this ""level"" already, but i think the lead up to ""Better Call Maul"" and its ""level"" are the perfect example at the games failing. leading up to the level, you escort padme and the naboo pilots through the palace section of the overworld and defeat 3 groups of about 8 battledroids on our way to the fighters that would launch to go defeat the control ship. thats it. simple escort, 8 battledroid groups, onto the next story beat. If youve played either The Complete Saga or the original Lego Star Wars game youd know that this used to be an entire level. it felt like you were actually sneaking and fighting your way to those fighters like they did in the movie! it was great. but in this game, thats all been simplified down a 5 minute walk with no real challenge or enjoyment. once you get to the hanger and start the level, a cutscene plays showing you the pilots taking off, then obiwan and quigon fight through battledroids and chase maul all the way to the area right before the red light door things that force the three to stop their fight and wait for them to open before closing again. THATS where the level begins. over halfway through the maul fight sequence. in the original and complete saga games, you actually got to PLAY through the ENTIRE chase and come to the realization that maul is toying with you like the sadistic apex predator he believes he is. but better call maul is just the room before the red light doors on and each part has been incredibly simplified. Its just so underwhelming that i think saying i was underwhelmed is a gross understatement.and i think that basically sums up. this game, which had been delayed for years and created under almost nonstop crunch, is grossly underwhelming. i feel like the tt higher ups decided to have everyone focus on the visuals and forgot to make a game before last year, then had the devs rush to throw in SOMETHING that resembled a game and called it a day. It honestly makes me wish this game had been cancelled and they focused on something else (like treating their staff better perhaps?). im only 3 hrs into the game and already 3/5ths of the way through episode one.... and honestly i have very little desire to finish this game. Im even considering looking into refunding the game, which is something ive NEVER done on steam before with any game (and i have several games like Genesis Rising which are completely unplayable in my library still because you know, i bought it. its my fault really.). but thats how lackluster this game is. i know this is a ""kids game"" but media for kids can be challenging and enjoying even for adults! it didnt have to be a bunch of pretty looking nothing.some other things i want to mention: i did local coop with my niece for the first hr and they got incredibly motion sick from the camera despite having motion blur and headbob turned off. I however was fine, so idk what the issue is that causes some people to be effected like that and not others, but its worth mentioning. I also had no interest in trying to do online multiplayer as the people id want to play with live with me so it doesnt matter to me. neither does character creation. by lego the lord of the rings, i only ever created for achievements, especially once the games let you just pick any character you had unlocked instead of just a small selection, so that also didnt bother me.to sum up my feelings: i wanted and hoped for a combination of the complete saga, the clone wars, and jurassic world games and got something i dont think should even count as a game. if i had to give it a percentage: 23%, and thats PURELY for the visuals, which again are amazing. i just wished they spent more time making actual gameplay."

A really good step up from the older Lego Star Wars games I played as a kid.  One thing I do miss and wish this game had was the ability to create your own characters.

It was missing a lot of the charm of the Complete Saga. The voice acting feels off on it as well. This is one of the feel games where I'll say the controls made me annoyed. The sensitivity even at the lowest option was still moving too fast for me. I barely got into the first level before I stopped playing. If you haven't played the Complete Saga yet and aren't used to the older style of Lego Games then this game might be for you. But the only Lego games I've played are the older ones and the differences between this game and the old ones is staggering. A lot of the story is missing from the game, a lot of the good times on Tatooine in the first episode missing (you start at Naboo).

Lazy mission design, boring and too quick missions.One example: Episode 2, when you get to ticopa city you literally just have to follow Lama Su for ~3 minutes and nothing else (theres some stuff to break). Then you get the cutscene of Jango and Boba and you start chasing them until you end up in a boss fight, except you literally just run like ~50 meters to get to the boss fight (unlike in complete saga, you had to do some puzzles and parkour)NOTE THAT YOU STILL HAVE NOT ATTACKED OR BEEN ATTACKED BY EVEN A SINGLE ENEMY. NEITHER HAVE YOU COME ACROSS ANY MANDATORY PUZZLE.The boss fight is not much different from complete saga, just damage sponge and then you go fight them in space.The ""open world"" sections are really empty, boring and not even needed. One example is when you enter Otoh Gunga in episode 1. All you do there is just run to the other side of the whole place, get a cutscene and then go back. Along that trip was only 2 puzzles (That I myself noticed). Then you later have to come BACK there, and go to the other side AGAIN just to get little bit of dialogue and run back.2nd player gets forced to play boring characters in some missions (Like R2D2 with its small range tickle) or parts of missions such as on the Obi-wan and Luke skywalker fight in episode 3, literally the only thing the 2nd player gets to do in that is just watch.You're better off with buying complete saga over this one. If you've played complete saga before, this will definitely disappoint youThe humor is not bad though, I'll give the game that at least. Still would not recommend."

Am loving it so far. Feels like Star Wars and Lego in equal parts; lots of space opera spirit enforced by quirky humour. I get the sense that this is a game where you get what you give to it. There is a levelling system and I thought this would be a bit of an ADHD dilemma for me, but it's more complimentary than necessary to grind, and the extra puzzles and side quests are welcome layering to the experience. Otherwise you can just shoot straight through the main levels. My only real gripe with gameplay is the space combat. It's not bad, far from it! I just remember the on rail sections in Lego Force Awakens having a more speedy feel to them, made the dogfights slightly more intense. Lightsaber and blaster play on the other hand is balanced as fleshed out without being too character-action driven. If you're a fan of past Lego games or of Star Wars, and want to play something that has a lot of depth but not too difficult, this will satisfy."

No. Are there things we would've liked? Sure. Is it still an absolute riot to play with the girlfriend, siblings, friends, or kids? Definitely.There could be a little more to the space areas - just let us get the feeling we're moving around a bit more and give us a little more environment up there and more elaborate repeatables. That said it's still fun, and having a damn capitol ship drop out of hyperspace is a nice touch.The planets all have a lot of great atmosphere and explorability, considering there's 20 of them. This is inarguably better than past games by orders of magnitude.I genuinely would not feel robbed seeing DLC that expands this down the road. They gave us a full enough game."

4439,-,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071193621/,1,,1,35.6,July,"9,",306,0,1,"Overall, this game goes above and beyond. (Almost) everything from visuals and sound to gameplay and level design is top notch. First and foremost, however, I want to make clear right off the bat; this is  a remaster of the classic Lego Star Wars games plus episodes 8 and 9 in that same styles. This game is a brand new take on Lego Star Wars. It's very very good, but if remastered classic games is what you want and the only thing you want, then for you this game is not. That being said, this is probably the pinnacle of Lego Star Wars games, and probably the pinnacle of the main-format Lego games as a whole. The visual styling is . The graphics are borderline mindblowing, and there was very obviously a hell of a lot of care put into bringing Lego games firmly up to modern visual standards without sacrificing the visual charm that the classic (lets call them 'legacy' from now on?) games had. There are places in the game that have quite a bit of non-Lego environment meshes, and places in the game that are made almost entirely out of Lego bricks but look so damn good that you don't notice its fully Lego at first (or perhaps at all). The first level in Episode IV is a good example of this. As far as I can tell, it's almost entirely made out of Lego bricks, and I was about halfway through the level when I noticed it was not, in fact, a bunch of non-Lego meshes. That isn't to say that the non-Lego environments are less enjoyable. If anything, the absurd visual quality of the non-Lego textures and meshes is far more enjoyable alongside the Lego bits than the muddy, gross-looking non-Lego environments of the previous games. Overall, the developers would have been hard-pressed to give this game a better visual presentation. Audio on the whole is pretty good too. Its not as much of a complete package relative to the visuals, though. If you are an ardent Star Wars nerd and/or played the original games with any amount of loyalty, then you  notice certain shortcomings in the audio design. Nothing gamebreaking. In fact, its all pretty trivial. Padme's blaster doesn't have that signature Naboo blaster sound, for example. Small stuff like that. Things that were likely design , not design . If you can overlook those admittedly very small issues in the audio design, then I have very few qualms with the audio design for this game. The voice-acting, however...(Yar! Complainey opinions be ahead! Read section fully before smiting me!)(Complainey opinions over. You may now smite me.)So... with  out of the way (sorry, not sorry), onto the gameplay. It's good. It's really really good. Whatever goals in mind they had at the drawing board for bringing the legacy games into the modern era of gaming, they smashed those goals and then some. The gameplay is , and really does feel like someone pressed a magic ""modernise"" button on the legacy games. There's not really a need to write a lot about this section, the gameplay speaks for itself when you play it. And you  play it.Finally, and because this is a Lego game, the topic of content amount. Uh, there's a . There is a 'lot' of open world to explore, and with all the DLC there are 380 characters. Now, rather disappointingly, they were quite strict about including characters only if they were in one of the main 9 movies. That means (with some exceptions, which you can find in the DLC list) theres no Captain Rex, no Cad Bane, no Ventress or Opress, etc. I find this rather odd, since this game is meant to be ""The Skywalker Saga"", not ""ONLY THE 9 MAIN FILMS YOU CRETIN"", but oh well. It's a shame to not have really any of the fantastic cast of characters from the Clone Wars, Rebels, etc., but it's still a fantastic cast of characters. In conclusion; get this game. Just get it right now. It's beautiful, funny, super enjoyable, and retains almost all, if not all of the classic charm of the legacy Lego Star Wars games. A truly worthy modern successor of some of the best games ever made. But if you're a stick in the mud, this is not a plug-in replacement of The Complete Saga. Its a totally new game, but hopefully TT Games realises that despite this game, not a single person would complain about a graphical remaster of The Complete Saga..."

I seriously think it's down to the expectation that everyone's going to have a PC that was at the very least built with the standard specs of 2020, which is not the case at all.Third, while I believe the voice acting and sound design are great, I can't actually prove it because even if I max out my speaker output and the in game master volume, it still sounds so quiet I can't hear a thing without subtitles. This really hampered the experience for me.And finally, the controls. Oh dear god the controls. I tried to play with a keyboard and the controls were abysmal. Nothing made sense and one of the buttons it required me to press to close the map menu wasn't a button I could press. No, I was not using a laptop keyboard or a keyboard without a numpad, the button just didn't exist. Then I tried with a controller, and although it sucked less, it still sucked. A LOT. I couldn't tell what button was what because the game assumes you're playing with an Xbox controller even though I was playing with a plugged in PS4 controller. Obviously, since I'm on Windows, it'll always think I'm using an Xbox controller, but it was still bad. The problem is that multiple actions are mapped to the same button even if the buttons are remapped. For example, you can't have jump and jump attack be mapped to separate buttons, they need to be the same. I despise when games do this because some people want to have more control over their controls instead of having their control be restrained. Also, the fact that menu buttons can't be remapped is dumb, because E should not be the back button. Esc should be the back button, not E.One minor complaint is that there is no character creation system, which is a real shame, since the Complete Saga had a very basic character creator. (though I do think that LMSH2 did character creation better)Overall, I want to like this game. I really do. But it's way too new, the controls suck, there aren't enough optimizations, and worst of all, it's really, really hard to get into. For now, until these problems are alleviated, I'm just gonna play other Star Wars games."

In my opinion this game feels way more different then all the rest of the lego titles. As a fan of the lego series I'm getting really disappointed by the new directions TT Games has taken it.Playing through the game feels like spliced together content. No clear transition. I can barely tell whats a level and what isn't, and EVERYTHING is free roam. I think some things this game needs is way more customization (Oh and the character customizer is just completely cut from the Game, my most favorite feature of every Lego game). Level design almost doesn't exist the level, it just feels just haphazardly thrown into the planet's hub world. Tatooine is pretty crowded. I suppose it works as a level, but as a freeroam, freecam experience, its like having the camera run into every wall possible, especially when doing specific stuff.Some of the cutscenes feel rushed. Important details just are breezed over, and meanwhile stupid stuff is happening in the background a lot.What this game needs is a clear and defined hub world. A place to load levels and worlds without the menu having everything crammed into one place; And better organization.Whats always been a trend in more recent titles, is a constant push to do the main story and nothing else, and even then getting to the main story feels awkward.The menu is also your character selector, and your world selection, and the vehicle spawner, and the upgrade menu, and etc, its too much! On keyboard and mouse, the menu is really awkward to navigate, and some buttons do the exact same thing as well. The character selector is awkwardly sorted, I mean one wrong button and your stuck trying to get back whilst pressing the same button multiple times. All because the mouse couldn't be used. I would rather have the big menu with the characters listed on screen then trying to sort through a tiny menu. Sorting is fine just split menus apart, or make em easier to navigate, and most importantly make the window larger!Oh and a lot of menu buttons are really small, even the main menu has icons that are the main focus, and what they do needs to be explained by little text right below it.Overall this game was hyped so much, and now that its out, its really disappointing. Its like the focus was mainly on character related gameplay mechanics then everything else.Hoping the game is refined through updates. Until then I don't know how to feel about it."

It is a grind fest from the start to the end, and it feels like the developers was as rushed, as they make you feel like you are rushing through the episodes stories, just so you can traverse a flat and uninspired ""open world"" with invisible walls everywhere, and disconnected puzzles and level design. Many puzzles can be straight up skipped using the right characters, which doesn't feel intentional/right. Going for 100% so far has been a massive chore, as the very short storyline that take 5-10 minutes, have several minutes worth of unskippable cutscenes. Character selection is super busted, where the game will constantly switch out your setup of chars seemingly for no reason, forcing you to navigate the clonky menu for resetting your preffered chars. ""free play"" is pointless for the storyline missions using vehicles, as you almost always get forced to use the default anyway, even encountering ""free play"" space ship missions, where the game will chose one at random, but not allow you to switch it.Unpolished, unfinished and unstable. For the price, it seems like a lot of corners were cut, and too many new things attempted. ""A"" for effort, but ""F"" for execution."

Game play in the levels is where I'm disappointed and in that regard I think LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga has better game play per level.  The levels aren't as in depth as The Complete Saga and you finish each Episode pretty quickly.  Again, the levels are gorgeous, but they seem too short.  Heck, in some ways I miss the red bricks too.  Am I mad I bought this game?  No, just disappointed a little when compared with my memories of playing The Complete Saga.

4508,GeT_SwErVeD,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063659985/,2,,0,13.4,May,"7,","1,568",0,1,"TLDR: For $60 I do not recommend this for adults, especially those who played the originals and/or don't like the sequels. Great for younger Star Wars fans.If you are a kid who loves Star Wars (the nine ""Skywalker Saga"" movies anyway) then you'll probably love this game. The graphics are amazing and the humor is funny. The prequels utilize voice actors from The Clone Wars animated series, so that's a plus. There are bugs at the moment (I've had to Alt+F4 a few times due to freezes) and PC controls feel like an afterthought, but as long as you have a controller and don't mind restarting every so often it's perfectly manageable.If you're an adult, specifically one who played the original Lego Star Wars games as a kid, this is not for you. Even more so if you're not a fan of the sequel trilogy. The Lego bit here is more of an aesthetic than a mechanic. You don't really build much, and the things you destroy mainly just drop studs. If you were to remake this game without the Lego medium, not much would change. While the originals were platformers, this game focuses on open-world exploration. I'd describe it as a cross between Assassin's Creed (or another Ubisoft title; open world with LOTS of collectibles), No Man's Sky (the space content), and The Force Unleashed (combat), all with Lego minifigures for characters. If you're here for story and substance, you'll finish the game very quickly as the actual levels are short, and there are only five per episode. The vast majority of the game's content is in the open world, and that content is comprised of fetch quests, puzzles, time trials, and other peaceful activities. Combat is practically non-existent outside of the levels, so unlocking new characters and upgrades honestly feels very pointless. You could easily ""beat the game"" without any of the upgrades and only one of each character. If you have the DLC you get to ""cheat"" anyway as you start off with multiple classes you aren't intended to have for a while. The only pain point here is with Scavengers, who you do need to play in story mode to unlock their abilities (sorry Kuill)."

The voice acting is trash and when trying to see if there were unique death cinematics for messing up I swear tard controls are put into place so it's impossible to fail ""quick"" time events. The combat itself is so basic you don't even need to block, you can go full smooth brain. The open world is empty and you only find things in it when following the story while it holds your hand. It messes up the story by taking out stuff or adding stuff that a 5 year old thought of. The only part I liked was that it somewhat kept the humour from the original 2 lego star wars games, hell if they removed the voice acting and kept the gibberish they used to do then the game would actually be playable but no whenever a cutscene happens I have to remove my headset incase my ears start to bleed and put up a case against me in the Hauge. And before you say ""hur der you only have (what ever hours it says I do) your review means nothing... I brought it just to write the review then refunded it, I waved the black flag to actually play it."

4535,Jilly V.,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TH3_SH1TST0RM/,1,,0,5.0,April,"6,","1,630",0,1,"TL;DR It's passable. graphically well presented with a large roster but it's missing far too much to make it worth picking up.Is LEGO Star Wars Skywalker Saga a bad game? No. Is it worth 60$? Also no. The game has serious flaws that hold it back from being what it should have been. Let's start though with the handful of positives that are here though. The game looks visually fantastic, the finer details are a huge step up from previous games. The lightsaber throwing mechanic is fun but also very unbalanced in combat. The 'wall cutting' mechanic is a fun new addition adding to the interactions with the world. The roster is absolutely packed with characters and that's great.Positives done; time for the laundry list of failures on TT's latest game.For an initial volley of faults; every planet is a HUB but they're all just excuses to stick 100 NPCs into the area and only maybe 20% of them are intractable and the only value in going back is to grid the over 1100 collectibles making the game an absolute chore to 100%. HUBs are both too big and too limited at the same time; areas are massive but they have so little to do and explore that it feels lacking. Minigames are scattered all over and NPCs issue side quests that force you to interact with one of the worst menus in any game I've ever played.Mumble mode is obnoxious and you can't fully get rid of subtitles. The game has too many 'accessibility' options turned on by default cluttering the players view of the game. The older LEGO titles had very easy to understand directions on what to do and where to go; this game slaps dozens of way points and guides the player everywhere by default because it's far too complicated.Speaking of overly complicated; the combat system is a combo-focused one that more closely resembles Streets of Rage than a LEGO game. The added complexity makes the combat more of a mess than it needed to be; the only worth while change is aiming and the lightsaber throw. Force powers aren't intuitive and break the flow of the combat if used in a fight.Split screen co-op is a mess. 2022 and 2 player co-op is still local only with Steam having Play Together functionality. It's almost unacceptable to still not have a means of 2 player story co-op. LEGO Star Wars II for the DS had better PvP and Complete Saga has better story co-op and level designs. Split screen is side by side only with no option for top bottom layout; an issue compounded by the camera being closer than any previous LEGO game making the view crushed down into far too tight of an area.Space gameplay is a horrid mix of Battle Front 2 and LEGO and has far too many issues. The space combat is a hectic mess and the environment is too open. The controls are a busted mess that handle poorly in all vehicle gameplay and are particularly bad in the 3D space gameplay.The lack of any Clone Wars content is inexcusable with the DLC having Solo and Mandalorian packs and a decade old LEGO game that stops its story at the early/middle of the Clone Wars show. The means of unlocking characters forces retreading of areas and makes the side quests a necessity to unlock the majority of content. Unlike the Complete Saga unlocks are locked behind almost anything BUT the main levels.In summation; Skywalker Saga isn't just a bad game; it's a bad game that SHOULD have been good, especially with all the delays it had. At best this is an easily forgettable 6/10 that has almost zero replay value."

4548,CmFive,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cm5cm5cm5/,1,,1,65.1,December,"10,",275,0,1,"Okay, while I will re-review this once I get 100% completion, here are my thoughts:The new on-foot levels are really fun! But also way too short, and the vehicle levels (like Complete Saga) suck. What this ends up meaning is, since half of the levels are vehicle, and the rest of the levels are only ~5m long, you get not a lot of interesting game play in the story mode.The hub worlds are absolutely great. I love how the fact that there are no flying characters forces you to think about how to traverse vertically! They're all beautiful, and collecting Kyber Bricks is so much fun! The only detractor is... The missions. Very few of them are creative, and there are so many of them that after a while you feel like you're doing the same 3-5 uninspired missions on repeat for hours on end.So, if all future LEGO games are like this, would I complain? Well, it depends... I would really be fine either way, but if they do continue in this style, I'm going to want some changes.- Longer Levels and put less of it in the Hub WorldSo many parts of the story that could be part of a level, or a level by itself, are just short romps in the Hub world. What does this mean? No collectibles, and less direction. Ugh.- More Character VarietyOkay, I might sound a bit crazy here, because there are like, 384923840284902384 characters in this game, but they all follow the same couple of archetypes, and they seem to never stray from them. The only way characters in the same 'class' differ from each other is in appearance and the very occasional extra move.- Just Ditch the Vehicle Levels, PleaseThey weren't fun in Complete Saga. They weren't fun in Clone Wars. They're not fun here. Get rid of them.- Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sell a Deluxe Edition Promising all the DLC and then Sell More Without The Deluxe Owners Getting Any of Iti think this one's self explanatory. speaking of DLC,- Level DLC & Character Voice LinesI'm going to be honest, Not the biggest fan of this game's DLC. It's overpriced and only adds a few characters. The only ones I played as at all were Ahsoka and Mando. Please, if you're going to make us pay for DLC, at least throw some levels (and maybe even some HUB worlds) in there.I think this game is very fun, but far from perfect. If future LEGO games are like this, there need to be some changes. Worth the purchase if you love either Star Wars or LEGO Games."

It also have the merit of making episode 1-2-7-8-9 funny and enjoyable. If you want a quick ride, it's possible to storm through all 9 episodes quite fast, but if you like a very long ride, know that getting 100% on all episodes and in all the open areas will take a long while. The game isn't hard so character upgrades feel kind of useless. The game remains fun and filled with objectives long after the main campaign (all 9 episodes) is completed. Don't expect a challenge though, it's a very easy game. This makes it, on the other hand, very accessible. Both young kids and adults can have fun and it seems to be the intention of the dev (to make dads play with their kids)."

The stories of the films have been reduced to the absolute minimum with tiny, buggy levels. Barely any character uniqueness as they all fall under set classes, characters in each class share the same exact abilities no matter what the character is. Most of the game is you just running from point A to point B with little to no combat, building, or anything. I had to refund it, it is not worth the full price tag. I don't even know how much it would be worth on sale as it stands. And I do doubt that a lot of these problems will be fixed as they seem to be core aspects of the game play now. Don't waste your money here, buy the Complete Saga. it still has heart."

I don't see many people mentioning the things that kind of suck the fun out of this game for me and even my children. My son actually plays the original complete saga w/out dialogue more than this game. I think the main reason is that you (the player) never really get the time to enjoy what you're doing in the game. Go to from point A to B then ten minutes later a movie and then another movie and then another movie. The game has terrible pacing issues when it comes to the levels. I really enjoy the open world, optional dialogue, and overall game play. I just wish the devs wouldn't have held the players hand so much along missions. As soon as you feel like everything is in your control a cut scene occurs and messes with the pacing. When my kid doesn't enjoy it as much as the older generation of games I know there's something lacking. This is the best looking Lego game to ever release and he would still prefer to go to the older one and enjoy a real level without cut scene after cut scene. Not bad enough to give a thumbs down, but the devs missed the mark on the cut scenes."

And the galaxy with all the planets is amazing. They really didn't hold back on enviroments. It's crazy how much work was put into these different open world areas. But I sadly can't recommend the game until they have fixed all of the game breaking bugs. This includes bugs that:- Breaks progression- Breaks missions- Breaks sound and video- Causes crashes- Puts you in story mode instead of free play mode so you have to reset a level multiple timesI think if you are a casual player who isn't looking to 100% the game, then it probably won't be too much of a problem, but for someone like me who has 100%'d all of the LEGO games I have played (last time I played one was 8 years ago though), it is really frustrating to have all of these glitches, bugs and crashes.It's in a really bad state at the moment, for me at least. So until they have fixed that, I wouldn't recommend the game for a completionist or hardcore LEGO games fan.EDIT:Lots of bugs are now fixed! Def recommend it now!"

I've encountered a couple bugs, nothing game breaking, but I'm willing to overlook fish flying through the atmosphere in Otoh Gunga, clipping through the walls. Update after an additional 45 hours of gameplay: I have encountered a few severe bugs that are stopping me from finishing the story. There is a community workaround for some but not all, I would have to say this is majorly detracting from my otherwise gleaming experience with this game. I really would like to be able to continue the story without starting it over, and finish my side quests, no matter where I stopped progression in them last. We're down to about an 8/10 with these bugs, before I hit the major ones I was feeling like 9.8/10. The lego experience really is excellent most times, this is a step above their already solid reputation.

I can't even beat episode 7's last mission because the game crashes every single time. This game should've been delayed to iron out the overwhelming amount of bugs. Please devs, we would rather you fix bugs than try to squeeze money out of us releasing DLC (not hating on the DLC, just want way less bugs).Update on review after almost a month of not playing: still running into all the same bugs.

I find it funny how they sometimes manage to cram multiple sequences from the films into a less than 30 seconds cutscene, the brevity of some of the lines makes it almost comical (which sometimes is clearly the intent others not so much) speaking of comedy alot of the gags here are pretty good, simple but good which is what you'd want from a game taking its wide range of audience seriously. While not a beat for beat retelling if you are a fan you know exactly whats going on, if you aren't well...there are worse ways to figure out the story.Controls feel good for the most part, vehicle segments can be somewhat jarring but thats just something to adapt to, fighting feels pretty good if simple. On the plus side its often quite flashy which makes up for the fact that you're only hitting at most 3 button combos on people. Shooting feels...surprisingly fun i've played AAA entries with worse mechanics.The interface is a bit on the cluttered side but i have yet to find a SW game that doesn't have a cluttered HUD for some reason. Fortunately most of the clutter is things that will fade off (hints, info etc) menu controls are fairly complex which can be a problem at first but soon you figure out how it all functions.Sound and music are spot on as one would hope of a SW entry. Not just the music but the blaster effects, ship engines, background noises and voices all feel very star wars.Gameplay is...easy...way too easy most of the time ngl. Dying has next to no consequence which some might be put off by, i feel like the devs simply wanted people to enjoy the setting and story and not let anything else get in the way of that fun.The puzzles however can range a good deal on the difficulty scale with a few surprisingly tough ones to figure out but nothing ever too extreme. There is a massive array of side content to explore and do as well as a myriad of unlocks whether it be ships, characters or the like.The excessive amount of DLC for the game seems a little off putting but at least the offerings aren't just cheap reskins, many come with their own unique move sets and abilities though you can only make use of most of these in the free play mode which makes sense."

From character selection to missions not allowing you to complete. Mostly minor apart from the Maz's castle bug, but they're frequent and annoying enough to kill your drive to keep playing.2. The actual story missions are too short and too few. The focus is on the open world which, while great, means there's not a lot of cool stuff to do with the characters you unlock. Especially since enemies end up not spawning anymore.3. No character creator. It's a let down because with this game's class system we could've had the best way to choose what your character can do.If they fix the numerous issues with the gameplay then this will be a straight recommend. Until then I can't encourage devs to think this is acceptable."

Have had to go back to main menu just to fix the endless amount of glitchy crap.  The mechanics are sloppy and frustrating.  I have soft locked it few times just by doing actions too quickly.  The game needs multiple patches.  Even the landscape is frustrating to navigate.  Basically no story.  Just random bits from the movies.  I do not recommend at all until the devs fix this mess of a bug infested game.  Game is basically all collectibles and with the mechanics glitching out and soft locking from quick actions it only adds to the frustration of collecting the stupid items.  Just play the other Lego games.  Much better quality.  I always recommend the Marvel and DC ones.

Sorry, they are, but they are 10 second cut-scenes and you're already 30 minutes into the movie timeline without touching a button.Boss fights are a button mash, everything is drawn out for you, none of the feelings from the original episodes, like dodging Jango Fetts missiles on Kamino, throwing missiles back. Jump, dodge, smack 2-3 times and you're already another 30min fast forwarded.I've looked forward to this as a ""Remastered"" edition of all episodes, running through doors for different chapters to each movie with 4K HDR perfection, but this is a big open world mess. Maybe it works for the younger generation but it has lost the entirety of its charm from when I was growing up.I'm sorry but this isn't the release I'd hoped for."

4675,Semarc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Semarc/,14,1,0,67.8,April,"9,",179,0,1,"Let me start by saying that i was a huge fan of the Complete Sage Game. It was one of my favourite childhood game and i played countless hours to get that game to 100% completion. I really like Lego Star Wars III (The Clone wars game) too. And compared to those games, especially compared to the Complete Sage, this game is just disappointing. there are certainly good things about this game but I'm writing this review to complain about what I don't like, so yeah.Disclaimer away, here we go:1.) The characters are boring. The game divides the characters into different classes (Jedi, bounty hunters, Villains, protocol droids, etc.). And every character in those classes plays exactly the same. And one character only ever belongs to one class. there are no characters that can do multiple things outside of their one narrow class, no, a few abilities are gouroped together in one class and there is nothing outside that rigid system. They had better system with characters that can do multiple things and are not just copies of one another in the previous games, so this is literally a step back. But i think i know why they did it, because of the levelling system:2.) The Character levelling feels kinds out of place. I can't even say exactly why, but somehow, levelling up procotol droids is not what i had envisioned from this game. And you know the developers themselves didn't quite know what to do with the system because multiple classes just have ""You get studs when you use some ability"" as an option for levelling. Truly riveting gameplay.3.) The Openworld is nice, but gets boring after a while. The open world certainly is nice, but its just too big. There are more than a thousand kyber crystals (the replacement for the golden bricks in the previous games), and over two thirds of those are in the open world. Some of the crystals are hidden behind nice puzzles, but a lot are just ""Switch too this character class (remember, all characters are the same inside of those ten boxes) and use one ability."" That in itself is not bad, but after a while that just gets boring. and I don't even get why they would do it like that. I mean, yeah, its good advertising if you can say that players can go through this big overworld but if that overworld is filled with tons and tons of the same kind of ""puzzles"" with just a few good ones in between, you are better of making a smaller but actually fun world to explore.4.) The levels are very short. I get that the point is to spend more time in the overworld and less time in the levels, but still, with the levels being *that* short, it just feels lackluster. This goes together with the last point; the levels should have been longer and the overworld smaller.5.) Space combat is fun. Okay I lied, I will say some good things about the game. The space combat is really good, and certainly better than in the last two games. being able to use the full 360° of space makes it feel really nice and dog fighting with tie fighters is just fun. It is a bit easy. yes, but nonetheless a lot of fun.6.) The humour is good. I feel like there is less of it than in the Complete Saga, but that might be me misremembering the old games too, but the humour that is there is really good, they really nailed that feeling of the Lego game humour. There are a bunch of other things i haven't mentioned, both good and bad, but still, while this game does have certain aspects really nailed down, others are just sooo lacking. The game is just a bit of a slog with some really good passages mixed in between, but overall the goods sadly doesn't outweigh the good. And I think that's sad. I really wanted to like this game, I was really excited for this game from the day it was released, so this is just disappointing."

However, like a large number of players on this game there are a number of game breaking bugs. Bugs that shouldnt be in the game, bugs that would 100% be fixed if it let you use manual saves and using multiple auto saves for each collectable. After over 70 hours i have lost my save. This is my warning to you. Do not buy this game. It is a waste of your money and time because of these issues. There is ZERO EXCUSE to have such issues especially with the love the developers have put into the game. However because of this i urge you to never fast travel during a story mission. I collected an item for a side quest on one area of a planet and it gave me the popup to teleport to hand it in. I stupidly pressed A by mistake. Due to this, i am locked out of progressing the prequel trilogy as i cant even transport to the other side of the planet. Other planets have taxis that let you go from one area to another. Naboo does not have any. If it does they arent loading for me. I wish I could get a refund for this game as it is a joke that something like this happens in a game with a budget such as this. But oh well, i have to grit my teeth and bear it. Thanks Developers for wasting 70 hours of my life, You guys are great."

I didn't think that it would be fair to write a negative review like this unless I experienced everything this game has to offer. As a Star Wars fan, and as someone who has a lot of nostalgia for the older games, I couldn't help but enjoy playing the game. However, the game is so brain dead easy that I could feel myself drooling throughout my playthrough. It is chock full of padding, and just straight up non gameplay that I don't think this is an experience for someone new to Lego games or Star Wars can enjoy. I know this is a game for kids, and I don't expect every game to be Dark Souls level difficulty, but it's pathetic how much of this game can be skipped, failed, or played with your eyes closed and still win. They made an effort to make the combat more complex, but made the enemy encounters so easy that it's impossible to die, and you can just stand and press X over and over again with your eyes closed. You can skip/fail the ""puzzles"" in the game and still win. It's sad. I hate this idea that kid's media doesn't have to be well written, or slightly challenging. The older games were harder than this, but we all look back on them fondly. Kids aren't going to stop playing because it's hard. If they like the game, they'll keep playing. I can't support this game, because there barely is one here."

If you are getting this to relive your childhood, like me, then just save your money. It pains me to say that the whole aspect of a lego game, completing each level, has been taken away. Instead it focuses too much on completing small puzzles to reach the so called 'level' which takes about 5 minutes. Don't get me wrong the combat mechanics are great, but there's just not really enough opportunities to properly use them, (unlike the complete sage or clone wars).Im going to be bold, and probably get a lot of hate for this; it hurts me to do this, but I've got to liken this to no mans sky: Its wider than the pacific ocean, but not deep enough to drown in."

Unfortunately it did not live up to the hype. While the graphics, character roster, and open world are amazing, the missions just feel vague and unimportant. After playing through the The Phantom Menace and about halfway through Attack of the Clones, I quickly realized that a majority of the levels/missions were just walking from one place to the other. There are very few actual levels. Instead, there are much more ""levels"" at greatly reduced lengths (mostly walking) as opposed to the traditional LEGO games formula. While the upgrades brought in this game are huge, it feels like TT Games went too far Triple A with this release and forgot its roots. It doesn't feel like a LEGO game anymore where I can just sit back and relax. While that may be great for some, it was disapointing to me"

When going around in free play I experienced a crash when I was stood still doing nothing. There's a jumping glitch where the character literally cannot jump over obstacles, which is kinda important in a platformer game ya know?I think the production hell this game went through shows. The complete saga is around £17 with a good balance between story and free play. This game is £50 with very little to the story, not to mention having quite a few glitches, some of which make the game almost unplayable. Did anyone bug test this game? I really want to like it but jesus christ, fix your game or at least delay it to get rid of these horrible glitches."

The gameplay has gone from parking under a sewerage treatment pipe to parking under a waterfall with a small amount of urine in it and it looks about as pretty as a game about plastic soul suckers can, but that's not what the lego games live on, they live on charm, a zany sense of fun and a deep love for the work in question. Tcs was so full of charm that practically every decision gave a laugh that left a deep warmness, a human touch of love, as this seems to be cynical jokes about sand and corporate, dead behind the eyes cynicism, which is miserable, I wanted this game to make me giggle like a kid again like the first did, but instead we're stuck with a dead eyed, watery knockoff that feels so thinly spread that the sheen off butter that is on the continent sized piece of bread barely even graces my taste buds.Puzzles are hard to find and easy to solve, making them relatively ok if you can stomach repetition and the feeling that someone is trying to steal your wallet. 4/10, only play if you've never touched a woman and would become a concubine for mickey mouse given the choice."
4749,Jerry Phoenix,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jerry_Phoenix/,3,,0,6.2,April,"28,",242,0,1,"OK, that's enough. I really can't continue playing the game like this. First of all, I got the game as a gift and I'm very glad I didn't spend any money on it. I feel sorry for the person who gave it to me though. It's a waste of money.About me: I've played every LEGO Star Wars game out there and quite a few Star Wars games more. I know every film, the series, comics, books and have been a fan since I was little.But what I'm offered here is an insolence.On the positive aspects.+ The game is really pretty+ It's not the rigid LEGO game it used to be, a little more dynamic, camera work works a little betterbut unfortunately that was it with positives.neutral pointsBut there is nothing else worth mentioning here either.And so on to the negatives... and oh boy, there's quite a bit we need to talk about.- first of all the intro, if you load the game and skip the intro, you still ALWAYS hear the last sentence from Rei and that's really annoying for me personally- when I load the game, it happens that I get 2 loading screens in a row, it's poorly optimized- The gameplay itself is also poorly optimized, there are tons of bugs, I can't keep up with reporting them all while playing without becoming an unpaid tester. If you try to climb with the lightsaber, it can happen that the pathfinding fails completely and the character does not reach his goal, the only thing that helps is reloading. Doesn't always work.- an important point for me is the creativity of the game. There are many repetitive passages where you have to follow an NPC to progress the story. Mini-games are repetitive, collectibles are a ridiculous number, and key gameplay principles that TT Games implemented years ago in LEGO Star Wars The Clone Wars would have been ideal here, but are completely absent- Instead, a lot of attention is paid to ""boss fights"" (if you want to call them that). These are ridiculous. EVERY boss, without exception, can be defeated in well under 5 minutes simply by repeatedly throwing his lightsaber at his head. This is NOT how good gameplay works!- another minus point is the implementation of the space battles, the control of the spaceships is stiff and sometimes clumsy. In fast passages you quickly lose track because the opponents rotate in the player and are therefore not accessible, except through an unnecessarily large loop. Otherwise you cannot get behind the opponent.- The content of the game is generally not correct. With 3 triologies, I expect more than 15 hours of gameplay for the story. In order to stretch the time, unnecessarily long passages with repetitive content were built in, which simply take away the desire to play.I think I could go on ranting like this forever, but I think you get the point. Maybe I have too high expectations because I compare the game to other games and I expect too much myself. OK. Taking that out, however, we still have a way too buggy game that doesn't provide good entertainment at the expense of fanservice. Ultimately, this game has taken all the flaws of the sequel trilogy/anti-triology and lost the spirit of Star Wars and LEGO Star Wars in particular. I'm taking a break from this game for the time being and stepping back to get a clear view of it from the outside.Until then I can only advise you:If you're a fan of the LEGO Star Wars games, stay away from the Skywalker trilogy.If you're expecting this full-price title to be mature, stay away.And if you get bored easily with repetitive sequences... hands off.I hope TT Games will deliver again, so it's just sad what the game has become. May my opinion be a little help when you decide whether to buy the game yourself and may the force be with you."

Story content wise, it is cut down more than you'd expect, because they're trying to fit a 2 hour movie into a 30 minute session, and that's for each movie in here. Some movies are shorter than others, Attack of the Clones and Empire Strikes Back are some of the shortest in the whole game. There's also instances of favoritism with the Original Trilogy, which I don't mind, but the prequels feel rushed compared to the amount of time spent on perfecting the OT. Character voices are really good, with a lot of Clone Wars TV actors coming back to finish the rest of the Clone Wars era with this game, Matt is a good Anakin, and whoever did Ben Kenobi's voice in the OT is amazing, its like a complete analogue of the original actor.Visually this game is outstanding, I can run the game on ultra and it runs so buttery smooth, the *only* problem is the sections in Attack of the Clones in the Geonosian droid plant where they do a picture in picture view of two characters in two different areas, and it quadruples the load of the game and slows my FPS from 120 to 20 fps, it was really bad and no graphical option I chose could fix it. Thankfully it was only one level in the entire series.   Apparently there's a bug where the game just ceases to function and your save gets corrupted if you go to Maz's Bar in episode 7, GOOD glad I didn't play further yet.The intro of the game is really annoying when you start it up, always having to skip the intro cutscene, and always having Rey say ""I need someone, to show me my place in all this"" and its really really REALLY cringey. I don't mind the sequel trilogy for how dumb it is to the rest of the movies canon, but having her be the center of the ""Skywalker Saga"" is really lame and not deserved. I sometimes wish the UI was a bit better showing secondary objectives, the general collectibles UI is blue but the secondary objectives color is the same kind of blue and its easy to get lost. Some side objectives aren't straight forward from the voiced/text encounter and you need to just pay attention to the galaxy map on where to go. Even if its on the same planet, its hard to find banana man on Yavin 4 because there's thousands of similar looking troopers on 5 to 6 different floors.No bonus areas like at the end of the original ""complete saga"" game, so we miss out on content that could have been unique to each episode. No golden bricks either, its all Kyber bricks now which is just to pad out the upgrade system.Speaking of which the upgrade system is kinda worthless? I only picked a few general upgrades but didn't really pick ones that were on a specific tree, I usually just stuck to villian, sith, Jedi, Hero and General. I'm sure I'll upgrade more eventually with there being 1100 kyber bricks, but it just feels like padding for paddings sake and no real reason to have any of these artificial downgrades. The music is really good, and its exactly John Williams score in each movie, but I wish there was a ""streamer mode"" in which it'd go back to a Lego Star Wars DS sounding soundtrack (See this video playlist:  that was free to use to streamers so we didn't have to get Disney copyrights on our YT channels. A small thing, but it would have gone a long way, and added to the charm of Lego.It would have been cool to have an extra that would change the graphics to the original Lego Star Wars Graphics mode, where it would have gave everything a more smooth look and less intense graphics settings to bring back some memories. Or even have the ability to change to their old skins from the complete saga.I wish there was an actual HUB area like in the original Lego Star Wars Complete saga, thats where a lot of us old folks had memories and nostalgia, it could have been a space port or the Mos Eisley bar. Something would have been nice, any hub area, maybe allow us to customize it too, with customizable characters which is again not in this either.There's a lot of weird censorship in this version of Star Wars Lego, they don't directly show any deaths, they cut away if something unavoidable happens like Qui-Gon, and it just shows him pass out. Padme doesn't say she's pregnant, just that ""something wonderful has happened"", her ""death"" isn't even shown, Anakin just accidentally hits her on the head with the wedding cake topper and that's what did her in after childbirth, which is a MASSIVE problem because that re-contextualizes how Leia and Luke got split up in the first place, they don't go with their ""not dead"" mother, they get split up intentionally by the Jedi and Organa. They're really not wanting to show Leia get hit on by any male character and instead gets replaced by C3P0 in a wig, or even the reverse where she can't hit on Luke by saying ""you're a little short for a stormtrooper"", instead its just some rat droid with a stormtrooper helmet. That being said though, its for the kids. I can see why they changed it, they don't want a child possibly feeling something bad about their favorite character dying and want to make sure everyone is happy and okay and nothing happens. In fact they skip Alderan's destruction for some reason even though even in the original movie there's nothing but Vader and Tarkin and Leia being distraught over a PNG exploding.There are sections in the open world hubs where you can clearly switch to characters like in Free Play, even though the game didn't explicitly say it was in Free Play, so I would skip over collectibles not knowing I could have save myself time by doing them early. Mumble mode is a cool addition for 10 minutes and then you switch it off because the cutscenes don't really have much of their charm without the voices. They would need to redo the cutscenes entirely to get the same level of charm the original Lego games had. This game feel more like Mario Oddessey than a Lego star wars game, with the different controls and the amount of collectibles, its just way too much for one person to do, its kinda overbearing. Not hard to do, but just time consuming. The only other change I really want is more Clone Wars characters, like Ahsoka in the roster of the game.I do recommend this game to any Lego fans, you will get your money's worth over this and especially since its $50 and not $60 its a more reasonable price, def check for prices elsewhere than here if you want something closer to $40."

In terms of story, they could have done so much to flesh the movies out and dive a little deeper into the source material. Instead, they chose to include EVEN LESS than previous games, mainly The Complete Saga (a game so small and dated I can play it on my iPhone) and instead stuff in some jokes. I'm not saying the games can't be funny at times but why are we IGNORING important plot points to make the game more suitable to children. Did the creators miss the fact that Star Wars was made with children in mind already?Real talk: the game is mostly walking to and from places with very few puzzles or interactive gameplay in between and boss fights. That's really it. Sure, there's stuff to explore and collectables to find but if you're just interested in playing through the story, you're looking at maybe three hours to get through the prequel trilogy (assuming you don't run into hiccups in the boss battles or get side tracked by asteroids).Perhaps I'm simply biased and am lashing out like some old coot but this game blows. It's really great at making you want to play a different, more immersive Star Wars game though.Oh, and Rei is the main feature of the title screen and always says a dumb quote before you start so that's great. As if anyone wanted that, or to be told that Rei is the most important character and that everyone else is beneath her. It's literally just her at the top of a tower of other minifigs. E p i c."

I wasn't expecting the same game as last time with the same levels but I was definitely expecting more. I know its more movies but still its just not enough. all the main missions in the game feel super short, its not fleshed out and most of them can be finished super fast with almost no secrets or easter eggs to find they needed to be significantly longer. also there's no extra dumb levels that were super fun like in the last. theres hardly any room to mess around. there is just no replay value for these. they over do many systems like there is over a thousand bricks to collect and the only reason to replay the levels is to get those but honestly its just not worth doing. and later you get an ability that tells you exactly where all the secrets are. that ability also totally clutters up the whole screen. they added a lot of open world areas and these suck they are just huge empty spaces with nothing interesting to do but collect more of the dumb bricks. this could have been cut and they could have just added a canteen space or something like that maybe a ship a single ship that is open to explore where they could fill that with secrets instead of 30 massive empty open areas. although I like the combat system for lightsaber bosses and some others the combat is slow and clunky I feel like there are significantly less enemies than other games and its because of the more focused fighting now. also there are micro-transactions in this game and that is that prevent you from using certain characters. and there's no custom characters like wtf that has always been a amazing feature why not add that in. now i haven't played into movie 4-9 yet but if its anything like 1-3 than im going to be super disappointed. I will say though the game does look incredible and I enjoy the voice acting. but I really dont have to much good to say about this game. I give it a 25/100 just disappointing"

There are nonstop puzzles that try to make the game larger. The creators focused too hard on making side quest the main purpose instead of the actual famous star wars storyline. ""Help c-3p0 find all his butt plugs"" and they will be scattered around the map. Like 5 of those in every single room you enter. I could probably beat the game in under 3 hours (im not joking).  Thankfully, You dont have to constantly look around the map for special items to help you out or special quests because all of them are worthless. If you want a game that immerses you in lego but gives you an action-adventure style gameplay,  this is perfect for you. The previous star wars lego games look like they were drawn with my left hand but this game has better graphics than gta 5 jesus christ. They decided not to balance out what they worked on so they spent all their resources making good graphics than surpass god of war and now we only get 32 minutes of gameplay. idk - -This game is designed for people who are obsessed with unlocking star wars characters.

This is basically what you were able to do in the other Lego Star Wars games when you are in the lobby/cantina and run into young Anakin. What is even worse is that this slaying is limited to younglings that do not have conversation options and that is most of them.This game, besides my issue with the younglings, is decent.

I experienced 4-5 crashes, 3-4 moments where the game refused to load after waiting for 10+ mins, many moments of npcs getting stuck and requiring I restart the puzzle I was doing or moving them in hopes for it to fix itself, and the geonosis factory level and endor open world area for some reason experiencing bad frame drops making them not fun to play around in. I felt disappointed when some major battles from the prequel and original trilogies got left out like the battle of geonosis or the space battle of endor. Overall I feel like if you want to play a average open world game, then go ahead and play this game but I believe this game is very average and you should just go play the older games and stay away from buying this buggy mess of a game."

Clearly most focus was put on the open world, and even there most of it is just very boring repetitive puzzles, not many are great. The visuals look good, but otherwise it's just so bland. I wasted 70 francs on this, could have spent that on some better games that cost a lot less. Why there is so much praise for this game is completely beyond me.

I played the first 2 Lego Star Wars games on the PS2 when I was around 3-5 years old and Lego Star Wars 3 on the 360 so I think I know what I'm talking about (of course I have replayed these games multiple times), and this is nothing like those games which is what I was hoping for. I didn't want a carbon copy, but something similar to the old formula would have been way better than what they were trying to do here. Let me start off with the biggest issue I have with the game which is the ""open world"". Most planets have hubs or areas you can find mini-kits, brick and complete quests for characters (another problem I'll talk about later). This is the root of the problem from what I can tell. As with most open world games the missions you get or side quests get very repetitive after a while. I really wanted to 100% this game and get all the achievements, but it just seems so boring and tedious to do it that I just don't feel like investing my time into doing that when I could be doing something else. I just don't really like open world games because the ones I've played including this one have repetitive elements, and that's just not fun when done wrong.On to the characters. Before you could just collect studs and buy the characters which I was completely fine with. Now, you have to find the npc that gives the quest for that character unlock (or you can buy the rumor), you complete the quest, and then you have to buy it. Of course because of how many characters and variations of those characters there are it is bound to get repetitive which it does. It just makes me not wso much better and I hope games don't start following this trend because I saw the same problem with Elden Ring. I respect them for trying a different approach to Lego Star Wars, but it just doesn't work here for me unfortunately, and I really tried my best toant to go through the effort of trying to unlock these characters.Puzzles are pretty much non-existent within levels. Yeah sure you'll come across one or two, but most of the time it will be either you have to aim at one of those purple markers where you don't figure out what to shoot instead it literally aims toward what you need to shoot for you, so that isn't fun. Or you have to move a couple blocks in order to climb onto something, or you have to use a console (Astromech, Protocol Droid, and Imperial) which are so simple that I don't even see them as puzzles at all and I think a kid would be able to figure these out very easily as well. The characters will also just straight up tell you what to do most of the time so that gets rid of the challenge that should be there.Another big problem that is very noticeable is the missed opportunity for levels. I'll provide some examples with some comparisons to the first 2 games.I'm sure I'm missing some, but these were the major ones I noticed and can remember (I also picked on Episode 3 a lot because it is my favorite Star Wars movie so yeah), but of course this is likely because they decided to put more resources into the ""open world"" than into the levels which are more important. I doubt people want to keep doing the same things over and over again just to collect items. On a related note though, sometimes there will be very useless sections where you just walk to the next cutscene, and then leave to the next cutscene.Not very many bugs, but these three I've encountered were annoying.The combat is fun I guess I will say it is definitely better than the other Lego Star Wars games. Only issue I had with it was when using blasters it zooms in so much it gets a little annoying I wish there was an option to reduce the zoom effect, not have it at all, or press a certain button to zoom instead of needing to zoom every time you shoot.The graphics are good looking for a Lego game, but it is 2022 so it's expected.The jokes are honestly funny most of the time. There are references to other media which I found cool most notably Breaking Bad which was referred to twice so far. This gives the game bonus points because I love Breaking Bad.Anyway, in an era of sweaty multiplayer FPS games that I honestly don't bother to play anymore, this is definitely a breath of fresh air because it's so casual, and can be fun at times. Although it does make me want to go back and play the Complete Saga and the Clone Wars because in my opinion those games were better.Honestly, if puzzles are more your thing, and you don't like open world repetitiveness I'd say at least wait for a sale. On the other hand, if you like shooting ♥♥♥♥ and decent lightsaber combat then go ahead and try this game out. I wish the game didn't take the open world route because I can tell it would have been in love with this game if they put in more time into the levels themselves. I was so excited for this game that when I launched it I had the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ smile I've had in a while. Honestly, if they had added those levels that I mentioned that were missed opportunities (there were more, but I can't think of them right now), and added more puzzles this game would be a 10/10 for me. I still have decent fun with it, but I can't go for more than 2 hours a day playing it without getting bored. I was considering giving this game a thumbs down since there is no intermediate option, but Lego Star Wars just has such a special place in my heart that I just can't do it in good conscience."

It’s so different compared to it you could even consider it an entirely new game which it technically is, optional voice acting or mumbling if you prefer, Mass Effect style traveling to planets and open spaces to just explore not just linear story missions like in TCS, a lot longer and more in depth, modernized gameplay and graphics and an entirely redone camera view that’s similar to a 3rd Person Shooter not a set position, very funny, even more so than TCS. There’s a few random people who I’ve seen complain in there reviews about it being short, which is not the case it’s way longer than TCS and has a lot more secrets and completionist goals that’ll at least quadruple your time in game if done. Now there’s a few issues one being optimization.. this is only really an issue in the droid factory in Attack of The Clones, or when there’s a lot of VFX like studs on the screen but still it occurs quite often. Another being the shooting at times is hard to aim and hard to keep track of your targets, with stronger aim assist and smoother camera movement this could be easily fixed lastly is an issue where the refresh rate resets back to the original 60 when I tab out of the game and back it, it wont keep 144HZ unless I manually change it back again. It’s well worth its price, especially since it’s marketed 10$ under your average Triple A game and unlike those games like COD and Madden this has the content to back up its price tag."

Basically, it's a bit of a letdown after all the hype I'd heard from it, and several parts are borderline insulting in my opinion. If you want to know more, read below.It's an alright game, I enjoy playing it. The overhauled game play has a bit of a learning curve, but overall I enjoy it. What I  like about this game is how they seem to have made light of everything, with jokes and silly things in practically every scene. It's off putting, especially when they do things like make Cordé (one of Padmé's handmaidens who dies at the start of episode 2) into a joke. Like, come on! That was a really emotional and potent scene in the films, and the producers just turned it into a joke. This is hardly the only example of this either, like with Qui-Gon's death, Han being frozen in carbonite, the list goes on.I understand that this game is more geared towards younger individuals, and I get that you need to be careful in what you include in the game because of this, but I don't think that making jokes about people dying is the way to go, especially with events such as the war in Ukraine going on. In addition, there are a lot of lines from the movie that don't actually show up in the game, which generally is a minor irritation at most, since I know that including all of them would bog the game down in constant dialogue, but again, there are some lines that weren't included that really should be because of their emotional relevance.Also, and this is really a relatively minor concern, I miss a bunch of the missions from the older LEGO Star Wars games. I get that the new framework makes it impossible to transfer them over exactly or anything, but these new missions are so short and, in a number of cases, largely unsatisfying, such as the Hoth missions. While before you had to work your way through several areas, blowing up ATAT's and ATST's as you went, now you just need to spend 5 minutes at most firing and moving around a relatively small battlefield, an issue that is also seen in the Death Star trench run. Meanwhile, other missions, such as the old escape from the rebel base on Hoth mission from previous games, seem to be omitted almost entirely.On top of all this, it feels that this game isn't living up to its full potential with the multiple paths and whatnot. While I do love the fact that iconic scenes from the films can now be explored extensively (seriously cool), I would prefer a more varied approach, as it feels like 80% of the game is just running around from point A to point B. Also, I find the battles that I do participate in to be unsatisfying. I've played through most of the first 6 episodes, and I can count the number of times I 'died' in battle on 1 hand, despite rarely using cover or any kind of advanced strategy.I know that's a lot, so I'll summarise my views in order of importance (as I see it at least). Ultimately, I want at least the option to have scenes that are truer to the movies, closer to how they did the LEGO Lord of the Rings or the original LEGO Star Wars games. I'd like the game to have a variable difficulty (or even just a bit more difficult in general). It would be nice to have the actual missions expanded, so that they don't consist of you running (or flying) around 1 small area (like Hoth and the Death Star), and so you can actually participate in certain scenes that you can't now (such as the attack on the second Death Star, the blowing up of the shield generator on Endor, and an expansion to escaping from Hoth)."

TLDR: the game is really really good but the lack a character creator leaves a sour taste in my mouth, they have posted to twitter a statement about them having no plans for content updates which kinda leaves the possibility of it being an update dead in the water."

Oh and there are quite a number of annoying and game breaking bugs to watch out for, luckily I somehow didn't run into any of the game breaking ones, but the bugs I did run into can be a real pain.

Sometimes everything will stop functioning except the pause button. (I beat the trench run by waiting for my ship to crash, turns out it victory is automatic) Always changes my resolution settings when starting or tab out so I have to change them EVERY TIME I start it up. Freezes when loading, crashes every few levels. Framerate can go from 144fps to 30 for seemingly no reason at all and stays that way for a while (vsync is off). Maybe not everyone's experience, but I literally cannot play the game because it wont recognize my controller or keyboard nearly every time I launch this. I have to just keep restarting until it eventually works for no reason. Actually literally unplayable. Wouldn't even run on my girlfriends computer, so she had to refund it. Even if she could we wouldn't be able to play normal co-op because this studio exists in a time vacuum and hasn't discovered we live in the 21st century and have had online gaming for 2 decades now. Split screen is archaic and gives me a migraineThis game also requires some extra options for HUD customization and accessibility such as:Turning off health bars, they're so gigantic they OFTEN cover the enemies. They also aren't really needed for a game like this.Turning off vision cones and attack markers. Anyone over the age of 3 doesn't need them and they are extremely ugly.Might be personal preference but one of the first things that genuinely bothered me from the start, turning off Stormtrooper helmets flying off when hit. Really constantly immersion breaking. Also, having rooms be absolutely filled with Stormtrooper armor is the worst. Definitely need to limit that in some way.

The Game-play is decent, but they took out aspects which MADE Lego Star Wars~ like Force abilities. The uniqueness of characters made playing them special and then they also took out the creation part as well, which makes no sense. *They'll probably add it as DLC* It's Fun if you are immune to mind numbing or speed through every mission and just do Story because most aspects of the game aren't necessary. Kyber Bricks and Data Cards are just for completionists, but hold no real value regarding the core of the game. This game was most definitely over hyped and mostly made for children hence the dull and conscienceless nature of it. It removed some of the more ""violent"" aspects that made the game immersive and dare I say Fun, and replaced them with a useless skill tree that has no real affect on gameplay in the slightest."

Makes it especially difficult to split-screen which is strictly down the middle of the screen, which limits your view pretty significantly.Day one DLC gets appears before the intro cinematic finishes, which is a bit of a slap in the face.Padme hits on Anakin like as soon as she sees him, like instantly. It's hilarious so maybe consider that a pro. Humour is generally alright, though it really depends on taste.It's fine, but nothing hugely special overall.

I think mostly this has to do with me wanting to have the glory days of the old Star Wars games, but it's just not the same.- The Co-Op is just split screen, making it suck for couch gaming, as the screen just gets too small.- The lego jokes are bad as always, but there is not a split second in a cutscene where they are not doing one.- The maps are way too open worldish. To the point where they needed to add a big annoying box telling you were to go. The original games didn't need this, as it was just straight forward.- Getting true jedi is tedious and you have no progress bar while playing, so just farm and hope you farmed enough.I can go on, played only 2 hours and more than 1 hour of it, we were forcing ourself to play.It's prob. good if you didn't try to relieve the old lego star wars days."

The combat's engaging, the comedy is funny, and it brings me back to my childhood and helped respark my love for Star Wars. There is SO much to do!! If in the future they decided to add an expansion that would add characters and missions from the Clone Wars and Rebels tv shows, I wouldn't mind paying for that; THAT'S how good this game is. The only gripes I have are the several times my game's crashed because of something simple like switching to Jango Fett and in free play mode for boss levels where it forces you to switch to the story characters (like if you wanna fight Anakin as General Grievous, there are points in the fight where it forces you to become Obi Wan), but even considering those annoying flaws, it's an easy 9.5/10!

Fast Paced Gameplay and tons of content to do, I can't wait to 100% this.The only flaws so far in this game is that the Change Character options in Free Play is confusing to figure out at first and is just too complex. For some reason in Attack of the Clones Episode I kept getting frame drops and laggy gameplay in two missions that really turned me off from playing but it only happened for 2 mins in each of those levels and it never returned. And the last flaw is that there is alot of walking to missions, it;ll be like Go here to talk to this person then you have to travel across the galaxy just to talk to a person with 2 lines of dialogue then go to another person and then the mission started. This mostly happens in the Pre-sequels and in The Last Jedi Episode but it was only for abit and didn't really affect most of the story since it was fast to load.Highly recommend at full price since its like 70 - 60 bucks, every penny is worth it."

as they stood out much more in TCSeverything else sucks oh boy where even start..- the voice acting is super bad. not only that the voices are unfamiliar but also the acting is unconvincing and often enough embarrassing- the whole star wars feeling got completely lost. the worlds look totally different, for example lukes homestead: if you remember the look of it in the original with the whole atmosphere that goes along with it.. the wide desert, the sunset, the emptiness.. its nothing like that here. here luke lives in a stupid village with many cliffs and mountains and hundreds of people walking around... its hard to put it into words but you will know what i mean when you see it. also mos eisley just doesnt feel like mos eisley at all.. i remember the old mos eisley in TCS. back then it also had a different placement of buildings and all but it WAS mos eisley. now all the buildings and textures and even color correction make it seem very strange. also the characters act very weird and funny but not in the way they intended it. for example obi wan doesnt seem important when he appears (as in the movie), he doesnt seem wise and humbly powerful.. he seems like a boring, distant, unlikable space terrorist- the new gameplay is just very boring and repetetive ""riddles"", following a 3d marker that tells you ALWAYS where to go and what to do, and shooting/lightsaber slaying stupid and easy AI which is barely ever different from each other. killing enemies takes quite long with both blasters and lightsabers so its just time consuming and annoying but never actually difficult- the ""open world"" is just small areas between the levels, that are incredibly full with stuff and characters yet feel completely empty and lifeless as these characters all behave in the same, boring way. vehicles are useless because you never NEED them to travel around and also the area is way too small and full with things as that you could actually roam around- the look often doesnt feel star wars-y. i think the colors and textures are wrong- the ui is too stuffed - there is too much going on, quests, 3d marker, the coin counter (its split now into three parts for whatever reason), minimap (why even??) etc. also the ui has very un-star-wars-y colors and shapes, for example the dialogue text is displayed on a purple rectangle with faded edges that (if you saw it) you would agree doesnt fit into the star wars color palette or anything. and its just one example for the many things that annoy me about the ui- there is too much stuff that has no meaning. in TCS u had the coins, the minikits and the red bricks which all had a purpose and made sense. now you have so many things to unlock.. areas, vehicles, characters, abilities in general/for jedis/droids etc., find 5 minikits per level, do short boring side missions in the open world- no steam preload for preorders- unskippable cutscenes all the time, that are way too long and still manage to rush the story and certainly will make people confused who didnt see the movies- no character creator- so many characters that you can play, yet nothing unique about them. r2d2 cant fly anymore, c3po is as fast as leia, droids can sprint, jump and fight stormtroopers now (even 3po). the gonk droid can be ridden now and he is much faster than he should be (in TCS he was just funny af cuz he was absolutely useless), the animations of 3po dont look like anyting 3po could physically even acomplish (and that doesnt make it feel funny or like its the ""lego experience"" but more like ""this has nothing to do with star wars"" and that the character you're playing might be anyone - not c3po)- no hub world where you could go to the bar and buy characters or start a level by entering that mysterious door. now this is all inside a menu..i didnt want to rant about this game, i thought it was gonna be amazing but its disappointing and you shouldnt buy it. it doesnt feel like star wars, the gameplay is repetetitive, boring and too easy and the story feels rushed and stupid."

I'd been waiting literally years for this to release and I'm absolutely gutted at how much of a let down it is. Let me start by simply stating a very old and famous saying which is very relevant here... ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Well, TT Games must've never heard of this because they certainly did try to fix something that wasn't broken. The ""fixes"" they have made to the core fundamentals of what Lego game fans have loved and familiarised themselves with for well over a decade are a huge step backwards - gone are the linear, long, in-depth, and story-rich levels that have been replaced with incredibly short and shallow ones. Whereas previous Lego games had the main story focused within said levels, it is now set mainly in an open-world setting (the hub areas of old games) and this has completely ruined the experience for me. It feels cheap. Hub areas were an added bonus, they were a ""explore them if you fancy it"" kinda thing, but now they are the dominant aspect of the game, and as for the ""levels"" themselves, don't get me started - they're so short it's unreal. Then there's the camera - so close up it's hard to see what you're doing and who you are fighting, it actually becomes a hindrance. The menus are convoluted and overwhelming too. Just so many unnecessary changes to a tried and tested format that worked so well for years, this game just equates to one massive let down. It's such a shame. I've requested a refund and will purchase some of the older Lego games that are actually fun and worthwhile to play."

This is my confession. If you're watching this tape, I'm probably dead, murdered by my brother-in-law Hank Schrader. Hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist. Shortly after my 50th birthday, Hank came to me with a rather, shocking proposition. He asked that I use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine, which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world. Connections that he made through his career with the DEA. I was... astounded, I... I always thought that Hank was a very moral man and I was... thrown, confused, but I was also particularly vulnerable at the time, something he knew and took advantage of. I was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family. Hank took me on a ride along, and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make. And I was weak. I didn't want my family to go into financial ruin so I agreed. Every day, I think back at that moment with regret. I quickly realized that I was in way over my head, and Hank had a partner, a man named Gustavo Fring, a businessman. Hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man, and when I tried to quit, Fring threatened my family. I didn't know where to turn. Eventually, Hank and Fring had a falling out. From what I can gather, Hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business, to which Fring flatly refused to give him, and things escalated. Fring was able to arrange, uh I guess I guess you call it a ""hit"" on my brother-in-law, and failed, but Hank was seriously injured, and I wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over $177,000. Upon recovery, Hank was bent on revenge, working with a man named Hector Salamanca, he plotted to kill Fring, and did so. In fact, the bomb that he used was built by me, and he gave me no option in it. I have often contemplated suicide, but I'm a coward. I wanted to go to the police, but I was frightened. Hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the Albuquerque DEA, and about that time, to keep me in line, he took my children from me. For 3 months he kept them. My wife, who up until that point, had no idea of my criminal activities, was horrified to learn what I had done, why Hank had taken our children. We were scared. I was in Hell, I hated myself for what I had brought upon my family. Recently, I tried once again to quit, to end this nightmare, and in response, he gave me this. I can't take this anymore. I live in fear every day that Hank will kill me, or worse, hurt my family. I... All I could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man, for what he really is."

Growing up  I had endless hours of fun playing and replaying the game. While I am still only about 60% of the way through of the game there are a few things I would say. First, there is not a ton of structured game play. While the original game was structured into Episodes and then subsequently organized into chapters. This game is very different then that. This game is primarily focused on the open-world adventure, and the secondary focus is on the structured gameplay. While this may be preferred, I can't say I am a huge fan of it. I think there is not nearly enough gameplay and the actual structured levels are too short. Not a bad game, but if you are buying it for nostalgic purposes, i'd watch some gameplay before doing it."

Boss fights just glitch and never end have to restart the whole mission. The AI is somehow worse than the complete saga failing to even do basic jump puzzles and just lock up and sit. Audio is so bad it's barely loud. Story is rushed all around where normal lego charm or actual levels could have been. NO CREATE YOUR OWN CHARACTER such a big roster and that is just gone, imagine the combinations so many options and does not exist sorry! womp womp Still recommend but the audio is the worst. Very dumb they didnt just use the voice lines from the movies like it sounded in force awakens lego but even then still hate voices and use mumble mode. Even though lots of jokes were not made in mumble mode either. The voice of qui qon man just the same actor from the lego batman games or even more"

All I was expecting was an enjoyable/relaxing Lego Star Wars game covering all the films. But the game is incredibly hollow beneath the initially pretty visage. What seems to have happened is that by making the game more open-world and having a number of hub-like areas with lots of collectibles etc. The missions themselves seem to have become an afterthought. There are so many memorable scenes from the movies that are absent entirely or have a tiny cut-scene dedicated to them and that's it. But even the familiar moments and scenes that are present here are over in what feels like a flash. I also ran into a number of bugs. Stuck loading screens/crashes to desktop. I can deal with that in itself but I had a far more frustrating visual bug that nearly made me quit playing hours ago (I wish I had). I realised quite early on that after entering interior parts of levels (they are signposted with a glowing aura) that when I then came back out the game was a literal blur. Seems to be a problem with changing area without an actual loading screen, so eventually I just stopped going into the interior rooms etc. Can't believe a bug like this wasn't noticed/hasn't been fixed.Despite not in any way expecting a masterpiece or a mind-blowing experience. I find myself nonetheless really disappointed with this. Such a shame. Your kid might enjoy it I suppose but if you are an adult fan of the films I'd urge you to give this a second thought before buying it."

5178,innuendo,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158410702/,1,,0,57.2,September,"26,",72,0,1,"Let me clarify that I almost never write reviews for games. And this is coming from someone who has sunk 60 hours into the game:     After playing almost 60 hours of this game, I can confidently say I've given the game a fair chance. At many points I found myself saying ""maybe the next mission hub world will be fun or interesting. So much was clearly spent trying to fill the many various worlds we see in the films with little ""puzzles"", but they all feel the same... just a different batch of paint slapped on. I'm guessing much of the development was spent designing these lifeless worlds. As the missions themselves play fast and loose with the mission lengths. Seriously, I again found myself saying ""WHAT I wanted to play that part"" but it was some cheap cut-scene (The part where the second Death Star is blown up at end of the battle of Endor for reference).      I spent a good while trying to complete planets, but after the third planet it really is so boring. Bright colors, a good amount of nps, and barely any non-mission dialogue makes this game feel like a form of punishment. An overwhelming amount of dread made me go over to my PC, in this very moment, and write this review. That dread was the byproduct of finishing up the first two trilogies and starting the force awaken's story. At this point I have completed maybe 30% of the game, and most of that was spent just running around a few of the hub worlds and trying to collected the 1200 kyber bricks ( I earned just over 402 bricks ). So trust me when I say this, this games fails terribly because too much time was spent trying to fill up these empty worlds and not enough resources were allocated to making the actual missions lengthy or enjoyable. I truly do not see myself booting this game up and time soon- if ever again- and I might just uninstall it now too. Seriously save yourself, this game is not worth the time spent playing it and certainly not $60. Got to go."

Many almost important parts of the movies were left out in order to cut time, not a good decision at all.

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself."

If you're looking for a collectathon of smashing crates or searching for puzzle pieces then you will have fun.But if you are simply wanting to relive the movies in an interactive way... I'm not enjoying myself. Cutscenes are insanely short (3 or 4 sentences each.) and it feels like u get a synopsis flavoured with lego humour, but no actual character interaction that makes you feel like you are there in the moment. TL;DR it's not immersive enough for my playerneeds."
5239,BeamierBump80,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198407138942/,2,1,0,34.9,June,"28,",372,0,1,"At first, this game was a blast. Surely, I thought to myself, this is going to be a wonderful romp through one of my favorite franchises, right? Nope. I know that this is a LEGO game but that does not excuse the mind-numbingness of it all. This game is one of the most, if not THE MOST buggy game that I have ever played, and I played Cyberpunk 2077 on a PS4 on launch day. There is so much to love in this game: the animations, cutscenes, the charm, and attention to detail to name a few. I even like how they changed the Extras, making it a little more difficult to get the stud multipliers, but not too hard. However, after the first episode, the threads start to unravel and the issues make themselves blatantly obvious.For starters, the game is stupidly easy. As many have probably said before me, enemies CAN NOT hit you, even if you are completely still. I don't recall a single time that I died by the enemy's hand. Also, the puzzles in this game are the easiest out of any LEGO game. I get that this is a kid’s game, and that is fine, but it is disappointing, especially considering that they spent the time and care to add a slick looking combo system that goes completely under utilized because of how quickly the enemies die. But this isn't even the worst part.There are just so many bugs in this game, it's incredible. You can accidentally sequence break or soft lock just about every other mission and have to restart. Out of bounds glitching is easy and will happen often, whether the game throws you under the map or you decide to employ Skyrim's revolutionary ""mountain hopping"" system to get collectables. This game is INCREDIBLY unoptimized on PC. There are times in the game where, no matter what your hardware is, you will experience massive performance drops. That being said, these moments are few and far between, about once or twice per trilogy in fact. The worst offender is the level Droid Factory in Attack of the Clones. I have a fairly high end AMD build, on the lowest settings and 720p, my fps rarely surpassed 30 for the duration of the mission, mainly hovering in the high 10s. The cause is probably due to the new engine and development crunch. To close, let me say that there is a great game here. If you can stomach many minor bugs, a few major ones, brainless difficulty, and poor optimization, you will have a lot of fun. However, as it stands now, I cannot recommend this game until more patches have come out."

The decision to make this game more of a collectable hunting game rather than an actual lego game is mind boggling as previous lego games balanced those two elements well.I would not recommend this game if you prefer the level based missions of previous lego games because all you'll be doing in this game is just walking around and watching cutscenes that should've been missions."

The level design was fairly boring and just involved a lot of cutscene corridors that skipped portions of the Prequel trilogy that would have been far more fun as actual levels.  I did enjoy the Episode 2 the most weirdly as it felt a lot more true to the original style of the Star Wars Lego games as well as captured some of the fun moments of the movie but it went by too quickly.I'm mostly an Original Trilogy fan but I felt the Prequels deserved far better in this game but the better level design was saved for Original but more so for the Jake Skywalker trilogy. On that topic, I got bored halfway through episode 8 and never played it again. It's a shame since I was very hyped for this game but it felt rushed and key moments were handled poorly."

They claim the game is shared screen split screen co-op.  This is not even remotely true. Know that they depend solely on steam remote play for this. The result of which is disastrous to say the least because two people cannot actually play together at once. Instead you take turns taking control of the game for the same exact character(s). There is no actual co-op happening. One plays while the other watches and vice versa. If you bought this don't make the same mistake I did and wait more than 2 weeks to ask for a refund.If you didn't then  the opposite direction. Don't stop, don't look back, pass go, collect your $200 and never come back again."

People that won't get this game because of the sequels I find absolutely ridiculous. It's a game. It doesn't matter if the films it's based on or good or bad. It's all still Star Wars, and that's what you're here for. Also they couldn't call it the ""Skywalker Saga"" without the sequels, so yeah. The only bad thing to say about this game is the Droid Factory level was REALLY laggy no matter how low I set the graphics. Most of the whole rest of the game runs fine though. Another bad thing is the game is pretty buggy in some areas, but I never found anything completely game breaking, but I know some people have.Anyway, this game is an absolute MASTERPIECE compared to every other Lego game, and I've played MOST of em. The nostalgia's there, the meme references are perfect, graphics, gameplay, it's all SO GOOD. PLAY. THIS. GAME. Especially all the way through, it feels so epic at the end that way.

And that's completely excluding the fact that this game is a buggy mess. Even the best PCs cant run some part of this game at more than 10fps. Lots of crashes, levels dont always work properly. Incredibly padded runtime. Most of the story mode is go here and talk to this guy, then go here and talk to this guy, then go here and talk to this guy, then go here and start the mission. Then the missions are as short as 3 mins. As well as them missing out major story levels like destroying the 2nd Death Star but we have a level playing as an ewok or on a speederbike with monotonous gameplay which comes down to move left or right and hold the shoot button for studs. This is a huge disappointment, get the original Lego Star Wars games if you actually want to have fun, not only are they better, not only are they cheaper, but they also wont crash or lag nearly as much as this.

Gone is the hit or miss level design of the original. But is rectified by the large amounts of open world content and freedom. The simplistic and braindead button mash gameplay of the original is replaced with a simplistic and braindead attempt at rpg elements. Id say its on equal footing of the original when compared to 2022 standards, the complete saga pioneered the genre but overall is the bare minimum and lacks the polish, refinement and effort that later lego games came with. A definite buy if you are a fan and just want a quick adventure from the lego perspective."

However, the in-game camera position is way too close to the characters and the camera view moves around too much and too quickly, inducing very strong motion sickness within 5-10 minutes regardless of the story level I try.

(you can choose free play, but the ship selection is still locked. not that it matters anyway. the only difference the ships have is that the targeting reticule is different and bombers get infinite torpedoes.2-1 (wait, where's chapter 6? there isn't any. all episodes have five very short levels. 99% of the game occurs in the large open world sections after completing the main story.)Zam Wessel's speeder chase. just aim for her and shoot. unfortunately this has four separate areas, so their way to prevent you from killing her before reaching these sections is making her temporarily invincible.2-2the fight with Slave I over Geonosis. nothing to say here. kind of disappointing that the bast levels in the game are the levels that can't be played any differently. maybe this is what Star Wars Squadrons plays like.2-3The droid factory. something's wrong with this level. I set the game to 800X600 Low setttings and still got a max framerate of 15fps. try to do precision platforming at 15fps. and they must've know about this, because every other level that features switching between two different points are fixed and doon't allow you to change. I feel like we've been given a beta build rather than the full game.2-4the execution arena. with all the puzzles removed and a fight with the Nexu(Cat), Reek(dinosaur-bull), and Acklay(big green spider thing). ends with a fight with Jango with none of the things that made the original good.2-5the Dooku fight. not very different from the original, aside from the fact that he behaves like a standard hack-and-slash boss. after a little fighting, he sends minions after you, you reach him to continue the fight, repeat three times and he's dead. 3-1What? you had the best ship combat in any Lego game to date, and you turn the battle over Coruscant into a cutscene? and for what? a short hallway to the second fight with Dooku?3-2straight to a fight with grievous. same deal with the first Dooku fight. fight, minions, hunt, repeat. 3-3remember how long the original Kashhyyk level was? I miss that. 3-4Yoda Vs Palpatine. for such an epic fight in the movie, I'm kind of disappointed.  I'd rather have the Jedi temple raid.3-5Obi-wan vs Anakin. Threepio, are you going to leave Padme lying there, dying? all right, then.4-1endless white hallways. no wonder they added a map. it's quite easy to get lost. and don't think the objective markers are going to help. half the time they just don't work. 4-2 the entirety of Mos Eisley turned into an arena fight while Chewie fixes the Falcon. another long level from the original game that I miss.4-3, 4-4not sure what to say about these two. way too short, not nearly as good as the original.4-5Infinite torpedoes would be really helpful right about now.5-1can someone get that giant spotlight out of here? This level would be a lot better in the dark.5-2meh5-3for such a momentous moment in the movie, this level really sucks. again, the original level is far better. 5-4again, meh.5-5Luke vs Vader. the new combat on focus doesn't give you a whole lot of time to focus on collectibles. although there's half of those canisters to get now. the fanfare for collecting them gets old really fast.6-1Why is there a checkpoint booth inside Jabba's palace? 6-2 the first time I played this level it locked up, and Boba turned into an immobile bullet sponge. i think I liked it better that way. there's not much here.6-3again. a rather frustrating level in the original is made so much worse, and in a quarter of the length of the original level.6-4If you're playing the game in chronological order, you'll get access to the Scavenger tools here. this is the only class with abilities locked behind progression. it seems very unnecessary. 6-5what? the majority of the level is inaccessible, what gives? and due to the auto lock on, you're forced into the fight with vader, and then Palpatine. no exploration or puzzle solving allowed.The Disney Trilogy after the atrocities that were the six original movies, I didn't bother. I tried to play the game as if the sequels didn't exist.The Open Worldwe've been waiting for a game that allows direct travel between space and surface since the cancellation of Star Wars Battlefront 3 nearly fifteen years ago. in TSS, you can't even get to different places on the planet without a loading screen. the various collectibles like character and starship tokens, datacards which enable the purchase of cheats, most of which are purely aesthetic like those of the ""original"" original game (The one on the Gamecube and PS2. not available since the listing of TCS.) and the over 1100 Kyber bricks, which are used in an RPG-style upgrade tree. I'm pretty sure there's more of these than you need for every upgrade. half of the planets in the game are from the Disney trilogy, and again, that collection fanfare gets real old real fast. miscAstromech jets are gone. differences in ships are stripped and what's left is pointless, you can buy your own capital ships, but they're so underdeveloped in their functionality, and once you get them, repeat encounters with the Lucrehulk and the Executor occurred way too frequently. the Providence, the Venator, the mon calamari cruiser, and the Victory II are missing from the list of possible capital ships, and you aren't really able to do anything with them anyway. most of the humor just falls flat and in a lot of cases it happens at really inappropriate moments. seemingly all moments referencing pain and death from the original are painted over with really bad humor. Jango after getting trampled is seen stuck to the underside of the republic dropship.Anakin having his hand severed is stripped of the seriousness of the moment.Palpatine is seen cringing as Anakin kills dooku. (off-screen)The Tusken raiders are all tossed out of the tent in pieces, but run off when Anakin exits the tent.none of the other serious scenes have the dramatic weight they carried in the original, and are all given incredibly bad gags to cover up their seriousness.character customization is completely gone, in a galaxy where no one recognizes the player as the character they play as, but as someone completely separate from the stories of the movies. would've made a lot more sense if you could go through the galaxy as a custom character with access to all the different class abilities at once. Edit: review was too long. in short go play the originals.Lego star wars the Complete Saga on SteamLego Star Wars III The Clone Wars on Steam"

5387,oſoMOʞ˥Oʞ,https://steamcommunity.com/id/KOLKOWoJo/,2,,0,14.6,April,"11,",121,0,1,"As much as I absolutely love LEGO games, I cannot with a good conscience recommend this game at this point in time.I wanted to enjoy this game to its fullest extent - and I mostly did. I loved the plethora of various locations as well as the main stories, which in my opinion were a bit too fast paced. I was ecstatic to learn that the voice actors of The Clone Wars series had an appearance in this game, and I had a hard time putting down the controller.Then I made my way to Episode VI, and came across a glitch preventing me from progressing further. I eventually made my peace with it and tried to enjoy the vast open world, I had a blast doing side missions looking for collectibles between planets, until I encountered another game-breaking glitch. I got softlocked in space, with no way to move or perform any actions whatsoever. The only thing I could do was pause the game and reload the save file - to no avail. Upon reloading the game I was left in the same state and the save became unplayable.Based on my experiences with this game, I wouldn't recommend playing it until the aforementioned issues are fixed, and players can enjoy the game without having their experiences ruined. I truly wish to update this review and leave a good word if and when a patch is released, but until then I'll wait patiently until I can enjoy the game again."
5388,SemenLizard,https://steamcommunity.com/id/semenlizard54/,No,,1,63.6,November,"13,",359,0,1,"I love this game. However, I paid extra for the deluxe edition as I was led to believe it would include all future DLC's. Now there's a new edition coming out with DLC that is only available to me if I purchase it. I should note that the DLC adds very little to the game, it's basically a collection of character skins. Game is 5/5 imo, DLC model and special editions of game are garbage. Just buy the base edition of the game because god knows if you get the ""galactic edition"" or whatever the newest one is there will just be another new edition with more content in a year.Edit: I almost forgot - this game is like 3 or 4/5 because there is absolutely no reason for a full priced modern game to not have online co-op."
5389,Dr Darkholer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/leonthegoat/,No,,1,0.2,March,6,415,1,1,"While I do not recommend it at full price, I still enjoyed it and you might wish to get it on a sale. It is still a fun game, despite having many issues, both old and new to LEGO games. Most complaints will be in the story and gameplay departments, as otherwise it is fine as a ""baby game"".The game is structured around it, with five levels taking place within each Episode, usually with a new location or a new one-off mechanic. The review is sectioned into components, and may contain traces of British English. You have been warned.If you liked the Lego games before this, then you might be disappointed. The traditional formula is half-thrown out in favour of a new one. Levels have small sizes in favour of the story occurring in the open over-world. This introduces a couple of problems:Outside of the game's formatting, which makes it difficult to follow the story after long breaks (if you don't already know it, of course) and to relive your favourite moments, here are my impressions:This is a quick one. The , and really drive home the idea of stuff being made of plastics. A lot of environments are realistic, but so were previous games in the series. It fits well enough, and too much Lego might make it harder to see. Some might dislike that the figurines are animated, so their faces change fluidly and printed outfits might react to the wind and such. I don't particularly mind.There are also certain oddities carried over from Lego sets, such as Obi-Wan with a cape having it printed on his figure instead of having an extra piece of cloth as an actual cape, like all other characters. This is because that is his depiction in set 75333, but it's still very disappointing to see such inconsistencies.If I had to describe it succinctly, it'd be poor man's Mario Odyssey. Instead of moons, you have kyber bricks. They are uniquely named too! Instead of captures, you have character classes, and instead of outfits you have even more characters. Overall, comparatively, the platforming is very basic, and enemy variety is also weaker. There are many fetch quests, and some time trials. They can get rather old after a while. Jetpack characters like the Fett twins are somewhat broken. (Episode 2) It's also hard to figure out how to get capital ships in-game. I mostly liked the idea of levels being smaller and featuring new designs. They felt quite refreshing, unlike the open world. On the other hand, the level challenges often felt like fillers and were not very interesting. I would remove them for a future entry in the same style.Well, this is where Lego took a turn for the worse. Characters lost a lot of their uniqueness because of classes. Menus are confusing and hard to navigate. Building is virtually non-existent. Everything LEGO about this has been reduced to a minimum. There is no need for a combo meter either for an easy game like this one either!"

The game play and writing are solid, but there is not enough there to justify the price tag. It should be only $30 for the base game and $40 with dlc. The whole story feels rushed and the star wars movies are on fast forward. Each episode only has five missions and most of them feel basic and are either rushed or tedious. There are the gems there but the game is just lacking interesting puzzles and content like other lego games. Most of the content comes from collecting things like bricks or finding the tedious side quest for a character. Honestly, I would have been happier with the complete saga being remastered because there would be more movie content there. This game was in development for years and more main story content should have been added and many of the good reviews are seemingly nostalgia blind. Give it a few months and people will realize we deserved better."

5479,MrLeonhart,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrLeonhart/,4,,0,24.5,April,"7,","1,382",0,1,"I loved the original LEGO Star Wars games and seeing Tt try and recreate that magic with a soulless cash grab is infuriating, i'm not saying it's all negatives i'm just saying that this isn't as good as it should have been. it genuinely feels like it was made for our money and nothing more, it doesn't feel like Tt looked at what the community wanted and decided to go for it, they just wanted to earn a paycheck. that being said i'll write pros and cons.PROS.- beautifully made, genuinely looks amazing and honestly exactly what i'd hoped for, gorgeous settings, beautifully crafted character models and the cinematic's are next to none.- Missions are straight to the point and tell their story without any unnecessary fluff but more on that in the cons section.- flight missions are enjoyable from what I've played of them.- general game play is really fun, i had an absolute blast fighting maul and fighting an army as jar jar binks was entertaining and i'd love to see more missions like that.- voice acting is fairly phenomenal to the point i sat there questioning if they actually got Ewan Mcgregor to voice obi wan or not. Cons.- buggy, pretty significantly buggy, I've had characters not show up, I've had the black screen instead of cut scenes, I've had brick missions not actually count towards my 100% mark so i'd have been locked out of 100% if i hadn't restarted and i've had qui-gon jinn's lightsaber decide to penetrate him causing him to not be able to use his lightsaber. After two years of pushing this back you kinda expect better.- continuing on from my pro of the missions being straight to the point, they're way too quick, i think i beat episode 1 in under an hour and spent most of it going between missions, thats genuinely disappointing, they shouldnt be this quick, at this rate i'll beat the story in 9 hours and spend 100 hours getting the rest of the collectables.- collectables. straight up don't need to say anything other than there are 1160 lego bricks to collect. what the ♥♥♥♥.- it's lacking that same love that we saw in the original games, this feels almost like a distant relative of those instead of the love child, you know?- DLC, im sorry but if you spend 2 years pushing back this game and then decide to release character DLC's with the release you're just as bad as EA. I just don't understand why you wouldn't throw them in the base game except to make a quick extra buck. - the pc port is lacking, i'm running a 3070, i 7 10700 with 32 gbs of ram and get 30 fps in a lot of area's, what is going on? the switch would be able to run it better than me at times.- extends and shortens story moments for the sake of cutting down time. this ones pretty self explanatory, because missions are so short a lot of what needs to be expressed isn't. no killing of sand people either? are you kidding?!in genuine love for the Tt lego games, i hope they patch this, i hope they expand on the missions, i hope they fix up all the bugs and i hope they're capable of recreating some of the love they've shown for these games in their next games. but looking at their history of patches, i don't see it happening."

5493,󠀡󠀡,https://steamcommunity.com/id/brainbrokefreak/,8,,0,141.1,July,"1,",249,0,1,"This is a review of someone who did 100% of the game. It's a review of both positive and negative parts and why I don't recommend the game. ---{ Graphics }---☐ You forget what reality is☑ Beautiful☐ Good☐ Decent☐ Bad☐ Don‘t look too long at it☐ MS-DOSThe graphics in TSS are amazing and have developed since the earlier LEGO Star Wars games. It's everything from a common shadow to a neon light being reflected upon a puddle. The shadow changes depending on planet/location aswell. If you are in an open map with a sun. The shadow is fixed until you find shading as the opacity of the shadow decreases or even disappears. Or in spotlight. The shadow changes depending on the multiple spotlights. ---{ Gameplay }---☐ Very good☑ Good☐ It's just gameplay☐ Mehh☐ Watch paint dry instead☐ Just don'tOne thing that stood out with Skywalker Saga than the other games is the camera. It's been changed from being far away and top down to close and behind the character you're playing. I returned to the Complete Saga, (CS), to make more detailed notes and to see the difference. In CS, the camera make it difficult to see where I had to jump from platform to platform or to walk straight over a bridge, as i fell off repeatedly. But in Skywalker Saga. The camera made it much easier. Not failing a simple jump. Much easier to walk straight or in any direction. ---{ Audio }---☐ Eargasm☑ Very good☐ Good☐ Not too bad☐ Bad☐ I'm now deafThe audio has also been upgraded. It's been changed from the generic blaster sound you heard throughout the old games having a specific blaster having it's own sound. Example, Jango Fetts dual blaster has the same blaster sounds from the movie. And even the ships have their own sound when they're flying or shooting Jangos ship, Slave 1, has it's own specific sound from The attack of the clones. Aswell as Darth Vaders ship from A new hope. Not every single ship will have its own sound since there are multiple versions of the same ship. But the majority of the ships will have their own sound. ---{ Audience }---☑ Kids☑ Teens☑ Adults☐ GrandmaLike normal Lego games. It will probably be popular with kids. But at the same time will be popular with Teens and Adults due to nostalgia and for the sake of the franchise. Im not sure about the older people. While some would play it for the franchise. Im not sure if they would be able to play it due to the controls in todays age. ---{ PC Requirements }---☐ Check if you can run paint☐ Potato☐ Decent☑ Fast☐ Rich boi☐ Ask NASA if they have a spare computerI did not look at the said PC requirements for the game. But from what I know is that the game is unoptimized. There's some places where the game is very smooth and you'll play at 60 FPS or 144 FPS. But there are also places that's horrible to play at. Even with a 3090, I had problems getting through a certain planet due to the immense unoptimization. I had done some stuff on that planet and I was laying on 15-30 fps. ---{ Difficulty }---☐ Just press 'W'☐ Easy☑ Easy to learn / Hard to master☐ Significant brain usage☐ Difficult☐ Dark SoulsThe combat mechanics has been changed since the earlier games. Since before when you had your normal combo and the iconic slamdown. The Skywalker Saga now has multiple combos you can implement from normal ground combos to combos in the air and even different slamdowns. While the move type was also the same for all nearly all the characters in Complete Saga. Certain character has different style and mastery to it. Anakin skywalker has his style while Yoda has another. The same goes for the characters who uses a blaster or those to uses their hands. ---{ Grind }---☐ Nothing to grind☑ Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks☐ Isn't necessary to progress☐ Average grind level☐ Too much grind☐ You'll need a second life for grindingLike I mentioned at the top. I did 100% of the game and had to put in alot of hours. I'm an achievement hunter and try to 100% everything I play. For the story mode of the game. I had to put in a total of 25 hours with a little co-op in the beginning and some adventuring on the side. But it took me more than 100 hours just to get every single thing in the game. After I had totally reached around 100 hours into the game. I got hardlocked at 97% of the game. I was missing 2 achievements and I couldn't do anything to progress. Im not gonna lie. At that point after I was hardlocked, I used another save file I found online. I had to spent more hours getting those two last achievements and get 100% of the game to get some form of successful feeling out of it. ---{ Story }---☐ No Story☐ Some lore☐ Average☐ Good☑ Lovely☐ It'll replace your lifeWhen it came to the story mode of Skywalker Saga. It resembled the movies to its maximum. What im trying to say is that the game follows exactly as the movies does. The locations within the game was identical to the movie, such as Gungan City or Palpatines office in the Federal District. And the events that happend within the movie. Happends exactly within the game aswell, example being in Attack of the clones after the assassination attempt on Padmé fails and Zams ship crashes into the Uscru disctrict. The ship lands exactly on the same side in the game as it does in the movie. A negative part about the story mode is how it's played. It's not the same as it was within the Complete saga where you're put into a larger map with multiple rooms. In TSS, you're more or less able to play through the smaller events happening. Example being when you're chased by the giant eel after getting a ship from Gungan City or when you are fighting Boba fett on Jabbas Ship. The scenes between each time you get to play has also been severely cut out to make the story mode from Episode 1 to 9 much shorter and quicker to play through. ---{ Game Time }---☐ Long enough for a cup of coffee☐ Short☑ Average☐ Long☐ To infinity and beyondLike mentioned before. It took me around 25 hours to simply play through the story mode, without focusing on any studs or minikits. But took me an extra 116 hours to 100% the game. With the addition of having to use another save file. But I'd say 25 hours is around average. ---{ Price }---☐ It's free!☐ Worth the price☐ If it's on sale☐ If u have some spare money left☑ Not recommended☐ You could also just burn your moneyWhile the game is updated to todays graphics and gameplay. I felt like a waste to spend 60 euros on this game. Maybe if it was on a great sale. Like 75% or 85%. Yeah, then you can get it, otherwise. No. ---{ Bugs }---☐ Never heard of☐ Minor bugs☐ Can get annoying☐ ARK: Survival Evolved☑ The game itself is a big terrarium for bugsThroughout my life of playing. Have I never seen a game more buggy. It's been everything from graphical glitches where the sky doesn't exist or is completely black. To the game softlocking and hardlocking on me. I can understand that having to maybe restart the game once or twice is okay. But I've had to repeatedly shut down my game and started it up. Having it crash multiple times during one session, not being able to move either character or spacecraft. quest bugging out and hardlocking me. Having graphical glitches where the sky doesn't exist or is completely black. So on and so worth. It hasn't been fun at all. It's unplayable where the game currently stands. But hey, what company actually fixes their games today.---{ ? / 10 }---☐ 1☐ 2☐ 3☐ 4☐ 5☑ 6☐ 7☐ 8☐ 9☐ 10So at the end. While I had a very fun time getting my fill of Nostalgia and child memories. It not been enjoyable due to all the bugs messing it up for me and having me put up with extra hours of gameplay to get 100% of the game. That's why Im putting it on a 6/10. I'm honestly surprised I gave it a 6 and not a 5. But still. For whats its worth. Don't buy the game."

I got up to landing on Tattoine, due to spending some time exploring the gungan city and Theed. Both worlds felt largely empty, and the ""missions""--if you can even call them that--did not impress.  The chase in the submarine was not interesting to play, mostly a glorified QTE experience. Running and slicing my way through the trade federation ship would have been cool if there were puzzles, or really any interaction at all with the world beyond hitting crates. Compare the first level of this game in EP 1 to the first level of EP 1 in The Complete Saga. The game may pick up after this, but in the first hour I was not hooked as I was in previous titles.I may be blinded by nostalgia, but those are my honest thoughts on the game I played so far.I'll be waiting for some more renowned critics to give this a fair shake before I decide to refund or not."

5578,Takadasuit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/takadasuit/,3,1,0,49.4,July,"18,",255,0,1,"The hype around this game really needs to stop.Pros:- Amazing visuals- You can actually buy and select which extras you want to unlock, you no longer rely on getting the correct red brickCons:- The open worlds are too large- The individual levels are either too short, too empty, or too long (relative to the screen time in the movie).> Some levels played in this game have never happened in the movies or are ever shown, they are simply filler with self-imagined dialogue. It is so baffling considering that they reduced the level count per episodes down to five, however filled those with trash that no one really wants to see. The things we do want to see however are cut short and never felt satisfying to me.- There has to be a quirky moment in every scene of a cutscene, it is getting ridiculous. Granted, some jokes are funny, but some are really unnecessary, and I doubt that even kids would laugh at some of them> Additionally, emotional scenes from the movies have to be quirky too. The complete Saga had respect for these scenes (example Anakin loses to Obi-Wan or Luke has his final conversation with his father), they were cutting out on the jokes, portrayed the emotion of sadness amazingly (without voice acting!) and finished it off with a little quirk to lift your mood after that scene. In this game, QUIRK, QUIRK EVERYWHERE.- ""I need someone to show me my place in all this"". If you know, you know- You cannot use the ""there is a huge variety of characters"" as an argument. Granted, there is a lot of characters to collect, however the point of collecting has been missed. Sure, having the characters to play is nice, however in previous games, unlocking a character additionally unlocked all the customizations options that came with this character. Buying a Stormtrooper in the old games allowed you to make your own Jedi Stormtrooper for example in the character creator. Here, it is just a Stormtrooper, what do you gain from purchasing this character, beyond getting 100%?- Gold bricks are now blue and transparent. I don't really understand why this change was necessary, and frankly, I do miss the dopamine of seeing something gold and shiny as a reward- They absolutely failed the point of mumble mode. Yes, many players didn't want voice acting, we don't need it, and thus, ""mumble mode"" was added, replacing all the voice lines with mumbling from the actors. A nice addition, but like I said, misses the point. The point was that back in the day, the cutscenes did not need voice acting, because the characters actions and mumbling was self-explanatory and made sense even for children. In this game, the cutscenes don't adapt and are not self explanatory, pushing subtitles for you to read and understand what is going on. Additionally, characters mouths still move as if they were speaking their lines normally, breaking the immersion of mumble mode. I don't want to read and I don't want to hear the voice acting, sorry. I want the complete saga or III again lol- I mentioned missing character creation, yeah? You do miss it, more than one thinks- R2D2 can no longer hover- There are still bugs in this game. For example, for me, it never remembers what Refresh Rate I select and always defaults back to 60, making my starting routine to move it back up to 144. Additionally, the game forgets some of my rebind key binds after every game launch. This has still not been fixed.- Controls can be very frustrating at times, especially flying controls.- ""Better call Maul"", Howard dislikes this onePlease, the love for this game needs to dampen. It promotes the developers to do the exact same cons I have mentioned again for their next games, and as an average Lego-video-games-enjoyer, I do not want to see that happen. In my opinion, the gameplaywise best Lego Game is Lego Star Wars III, The clone wars one. Here is why:- Mumbling was great and the cut senses were self explanatory and funny, the Lego Magic- Minikits were new Character, motivating more to collect for your character customization- There was one incredible hub world from where you could select your levels, which were exciting and well builtWhile playing this game, every time I think to myself that I need to get through the levels like chores, only to get my moneys worth. It is a damn shame. Please, wake up and make the next game different, I beg of you"
5579,AllTheVibes,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AllTheVibes/,3,,0,26.6,April,"6,",217,0,1,"Review Revision: Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is properly the worst option you have to experience the movies, and that might sound weird but my words are deliberate and i think is the best way to explain how this game is built, handled and played... well more so not played. The game does being a game horribly but functions at the best of times to solely retell the movies plots through its numerous cutscenes that often arent earned through gameplay but just another step in a an off beat trot towards the next level, There is very little to the game that makes it a game, the 5 missions pr movie is best done borderline speedrunning through them as to hold up a consistant blistering break neck speed that doesnt allow for the game to drop to a complete stop like it commonly does, but these levels are short, in no way lives up the quality of other Lego games star wars or not. The levels lack puzzles, length, interactiveness, ingenuity and in general they fail to be a Video game adaptation of a Movie franchise as it does LITTLE to utilize being a game to tell the story, it only really utilizes the Fights and chases to make into gameplay, no attempts are made to add its own unique content to keep us occupied and sell the game even lacking character unique or telltale abilties like Force lightning, Force choke etc. What the game does offer as its main source of content is Kyber bricks (rebranded golden bricks to fit the universe), there are 1100+ of these bad boys and they serve to upgrade your skills and as collectibles aaaand thats it... the collectibles is your main gameplay, and post game content which is a darn shame especially with how expansive the game is and sold itself as. The sets are recreated in astonishing accuracy and detail really giving off the vibe that care and time was put into this, but this is A GAME, its not a movie its not a visual experience its atleast meant to be an interactive medium and thats what i mean by this being the worst way of experiencing the movies, casue the game tries too hard to follow the movies to live up to its potential as a game. The pacing is all over the place from level to level, the phantom menace being consistantly drab and boring just blitzing by, but quality does go up segnificantly as we enter especially A New Hope and beyond, the levels are actually decently funny and decently entertaining and more interactive to play through.But that doesnt absolve or save the game from the fact it would've worked and seemingly was made as a Lego x Disney corporate collaboration to retell the Star wars mythos through legos than it has been handled as a game. I can see why other people enjoy it more than i do as content has improved the further ive gotten (kind oaf a shame that movie 1-3 was kinda crippled so movie 4-9 could walk) but this to me is the worst Lego star wars game as its handles being a game the worst out of the 4(5?) other entries (but possibly has the fullest Cinematic star wars experience). (Old review bellow) So far its a very mixed bag, its a lego game for sure, its extremely pretty, combat is more interesting with a combo system, but So far going through phantom menace the game is too open, its kinda... Missed the mark for what lego games do.Lego games take key plot points, Funny them up with lego physics funnyness like Oh haha lego men can take their legs off so Maul loosing his legs is alot more funny, and everything in between that we dont see on screen is made up to tightly knit an interesting level needing simple but satisfying puzzle solving to complete. But thats kinda missing so far from what ive experienced, the closest to a real level was the pod racing level, other than that it just kinda feels like those open world tasks from modern lego games and escort missions called a level, there is no real and proper boundry between open world and mission you just kinda walk to a place, cutscene, walk somewhere else, cutscene (they have even managed to fail at having the plot points to understand the movie without watching it, for example we dont see Ani's speeder get sabotaged while minor was the lynchpin of the 1st acy of The Phantom menace) the open world is made well enough to just barely qualify for a level, but it doesnt have this tight thought out 4act level design that takes a worth while to complete. you can of casue call each hub a level but that doesnt do it any favors Unless this changes or improves in quality i would either not recommend it OR get it on sale"
5580,Lilgiff,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lilgiff/,4,,0,27.1,May,"24,",56,0,1,"People hyped this game up too much and can't accept the fact that this game is not good...  I've played plenty of Lego games and I love Star Wars, but seeing how blind people are to how boring this game is, is appalling to me.  The Skywalker Saga being a ""kids game"" or a ""Lego game"" is no excuse for a bad game.  For a while I actually did enjoy this game, seeing all the Star Wars characters back looking better than ever.  The cut scenes and little easter eggs were also charming and enjoyable to watch.  But unfortunately, this is where the fun ended.  I realized I was playing an extremely shallow game that is too easy even for an infant.  A 4 year old could figure out all these horrible copy and paste puzzles scattered through this so-called ""open galaxy.""  As mentioned before I've played many Lego games and this quite possibly could be the worst one I've ever played.  The puzzles in this game hold your hand and tell you exactly what button to press, even the platforming which has always been a good part of Lego games, tells me to press ""A"" to jump to the next platform...  Even if the puzzles are easy, none of them were even memorable enough for me to enjoy them like in past Lego games.  The boss fights were all exactly the same with a couple exceptions, but they were essentially just copy and paste baby play time.  They would show you where the boss would attack, essentially just an area of effect attack or just a line in front of them, and then throw you into a quick time event which had no risk at all if you missed any of them.  Now, this wouldn't be a problem if the bosses were actually unique, but they weren't.  The game also has this skill tree that basically gives you zero benefit, besides a few that would attract coins, detect collectibles. or make you run faster.  But, besides those, there were a lot of skills offered with very little benefit that would just make this game slightly easier, like it really needs that.  The game promised an open galaxy with planets and space to explore.  However, there was nothing to explore in space sections and each planet only had very limited sections of the planet to explore.  In other Lego games, the open world was actually fun to explore, knowing that you would come upon a unique puzzle and be rewarded with something interesting.  With The Skywalker Saga, exploring became a monotonous task to just complete things that had to be done.  For most of the puzzles you would approach it and have to change to the character it tells you to change to, then let it hold your hand some more and tell you what buttons to press too. These are my main issues with the game but I will briefly list some others I won't dive into.  There wasn't much building in this game, taking away from it's Lego charm.  There was 384 characters promised for this game, and most are just re-skins of the same character 8 times.  There were significant portions taken out of the game like the battle over Coruscant, which was one of the best levels in the original.  The co-op is not very good, only letting one player do most work while the other has to play a boring side character that doesn't help much, especially in the boss fights.  There is no risk at all in this game, which could be argued the same for other Lego games, but this one really has no risk at all.I would not recommend this game to someone who wants to play a fun and good Lego game.  However, if you are a big Star Wars fan, you can find enjoyment in this game because the remake of the movies in the cut scenes is a good parody and is actually funny.  But, let me warn you, this is where your enjoyment will end, and now your forced to play this extremely easy and boring 50 dollar game with no risk and nothing to work for."

5589,Unikran,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cdriscal/,8,3,0,11.7,April,"7,",137,0,1,"I’m 24 years old, and I was around 5-6 years old when the original game came out. Close to twenty years later here I am with the latest installment of Lego Star Wars. So far, I’ve played for around 10 hours of the game. This game provides a new experience not unlike the original released games, but enough difference to not be the same. So far, my experience with the game has been mostly positive however that’s not to say it doesn’t have its flaws. This is, what I think, an honest review of this game. Covering the good, the bad, the nitpicky, and the ugly. It does contain spoilers for happenings in the game and how it plays. THE GOOD: The graphics and concepts of the game expand on the previous installments of Lego games, you’re greeted with familiar concepts such as stud collection and “minikits” much akin to their original counterparts, along with new puzzles and concepts that can only be done with certain classes. The game offers a unique play style where it integrates the open world “Hub worlds” along with the story. Along with levels scattered throughout in between these segments. You don’t have to progress linearly, as you can do side quests alongside the story which can be a breather from playing the saga all the way through. These “hub-worlds” are populated with various familiar Star Wars settings and are over all very fun to play through and explore. The Hub-worlds are large enough to be engaging, with loads of content to delve into whether it be the main story or side quests. I feel engaged overall playing the game, there’s always something to do and play around with at every corner. Overall, I do feel engaged with the Star Wars universe, there aren’t many slow periods in the game where you’re not doing anything, and the comedy that the game has to offer is generally entertaining. Love the fact that they put Anakin and Padme in a bunk bed as opposed to a king sized to keep it family friendly.At first, I thought have that having the characters being voice acted would be a bad direction for the game as within the originals you have that “mumbling” that a lot of us are used to, however it fits perfectly here. As forementioned, this Lego game expands upon the originals released, and this game plays more out like an RPG than anything, which necessitates the need for voice acted segments. It was a charm to hear familiar voices like Matt Lanter’s and Bradly Dee Baker’s voice again and it’s always welcomed in my book. THE BAD: You will find with this game that you can tend to rush through the story levels quite quickly, they’re no where on the level of length that the originals were on. For example: Whereas in the first segment of the original Lego Star Wars, the trade federation negotiation level took a good amount of time to finish, whereas in the Skywalker Saga, it feels more like I’m walking down a few hallways and suddenly I’m on a trade federation landing crafted headed to Naboo. I feel like the levels are a lot shorter, and they are. This is to accommodate that “Hub-world” feature, much of the game is meant to be played or enjoyed within these hub-worlds, and these story levels feel more like an interlude to exploring these hub-worlds. It can at time, give a mediocre feel. That mediocre feel is perpetuated further as I feel like certain opportunities are missed. For instance, many cut-scene segments in the game I feel like could’ve played out as actual levels. In example, in the original Lego Star Wars, the battle over Coruscant took up an entire level, whereas in this game, it takes all but a 10 second cut scene. This was highly disappointing for me as the Battle Over Coruscant segment was one of my favorites. Other examples include the attempted arrest of Palpatine, or the death of Anakin’s mother. Whereas you’re traveling to these locations with little to no game play but cut scenes. I understand there is a story to progress, but why not take the opportunity to cash in on those moments and make them playable? This can all be argued against, as again, this is a game centered more around that “hub-world” feature, and you must remember that there nine episodes of Star Wars content crammed in this game. You’re not going to get every single scene playable. However, it still constitutes the feeling in me: “Why can I not play this? Why does this moment have to be a cut scene?”THE NITPICKY: Music and sounds. We get to hear a lot of original music from the movies and sound effects, however in some locations it just doesn’t match up well. For instance, on Kamino, instead of the theme traditionally played on Kamino, we get an original arrangement. To me it feels like it’s not as immersive as it could be. Additionally, some sound effects don’t match up correctly, such as Jango’s classic blaster sound, or that royalty free generic alarm when fighting Anakin on Mustafar. Lucasfilm was directly involved in the creation of this game, so why wouldn’t certainly sounds or music be matched to their corresponding places? Additionally, I feel like a lot of the puzzles and game has been dumbed down, whereas in the original games as a kid I had to figure out what the puzzles were and figure them out, in this game, a lot of everything is simply told in the form of dialogue boxes. Like for example, being told to dodge as opposed to letting me fail so I can figure out how to properly counter attacks. I feel as if it plays as if it was directed to a younger audience, but I understand that, this game was in fact designed for a younger audience, that’s just my personal nitpick, but again at times it feels like sometimes the puzzles and events are a tad mediocre. THE UGLY:Game breaking bugs. Unfortunately, like many new titles, this game has bugs. Certain bugs are fine to overlook, like the discovered duplicate bugs, but in my play time, I have run across a game breaking bug. At a point during a story mission early in episode IV, I decided to leave the game for a while, while during a story objective. Upon returning, and booting up the game again, I was surprised to find out that I was continuing from a future point in the story, to which when I completed the mission, it set me back to the place where I was originally, trying to complete the previous mission, only I couldn’t progress in that previously mentioned mission. No matter of trying to reset myself was able to get me to progress and I have been stuck in limbo ever since, with my only hope being to restart my save losing all my progress. For this reason, and this reason alone, I cannot recommend this game until this bug is fixed. It saddens me to know that I have spent 60 dollars on the deluxe version to find out that the game is broken, and I cannot progress. CONCLUSION: This is a good game. I think a lot of people ride the nostalgia and consider it to be the best, and if people think it’s the best that is totally okay, people who are upset by it need to lower their expectations for releases. Many people over hype a game's release, which in the long run just makes you upset that the feature you wanted isn't included.  It’s fun like Lego games usually are, and if you’ve enjoyed Lego games in this style, especially Lego Star Wars, you will enjoy this game, as I have also enjoyed it. You just need to understand that this game is centered more around the ""hub-worlds"" and less of the actual story missions as it focuses more on the intertwining of the Star Wars Universe as opposed to approaching it in a linear fashion. I am sure the developers will resolve the critical issue with the game in time as the developers have been actively replying to issues on the subreddit. When a fix is applied, I will positively recommend this game."

I've had 15 crashes, a bunch of softlocks, incompletable missions, menu woes and a bunch of small bugs that added overtime. There's just a heavy lack of polish across the board, making me wonder if some things were even playtested. That's just for the gameplay, but for the presentation and story levels they feel incredibly rushed, even more so than the complete saga sometimes, and that game doesn't have dialogue.Still had a good enough time, they did  their lore research on this one, but wait for a 50% discount or more as I  only truly had fun for 10 hours or so."

The almost 3 year delay was def worth it give us what i would consider the most explorative and adventurous feeling star wars game ever made. combat is more than mindless button mashing, while you can still do that you are rewarded for doing combos with stud multipliers which has been seen in other lego games but imo is best implemented here.the graphics are phenomenal. to me the latest cod, battlefield or other hyper realistic looking triple A games look worse than this. the fact that they were able to add such stunning visuals in a cartoonish fricking LEGO game is astrounding. also ray tracing was a nice add in to make the game even better looking.this is also a game that i suggest getting the deluse edition instead of the DLC cuz u get all the character packs for only 10+ bux is great.my only con with this game is that i couldnt really even play it on launch day cuz for some reason the pc version got it later than the consoles but idc really since i can play it nowanother one is that there is no custom characters in this game which makes me kinda sad since it was fun to costumize them in other games but with over 380 characters i think people will be fine without iton another finally im playing a game that is completely unplayable at launch kek, in fact over the time i have played i havent found a single bug.i streamed all 9 episodes in 1 setting and it took over 14 hours and i wasnt bored at all and enjoyed every single moment of it. def suggest getting this game and this game deserves to win GOTY in my book.this game is an absolute masterpiece.and i mean cmon grievous dabs that is how u know u are playing some quality."

They made a really awesome combat system but every enemy dies in a few hits and its just easier to hold the trigger and stun them until they die. most missions are run from a to b and maybe to a puzzle. the open world is amazing but i dont have any motivation to do anything because the rewards for doing it are small and boring. i played the complete saga as a kid and this does not hold up to it. i went in with high hopes and got really disappointed. the only good part i can think of is that you can battle each other as luke and darth vader in ep 6. but they ruined it by not having them both fighting sidious but instead fight his guards. and to continue on that you dont blow up the death star 2 either. i really wished they did the battle of coruscant in ep 3 because that part in in the complete saga was the greatest part in the entire game. but in this game they completely skip it as well. every mission i was sitting on the edge of my seat thinking am i going to do this part in the movie or am i going to have to watch a 30 second cut scene skip it.do not buy this game for full price. the dlc isnt worth it either. i thought we were getting extra missions as well but its just character packs which is very disappointing."

A tiny nitpick I have with the story is there are times where you cannot skip the cut-scenes and have to sit and watch and but other times you can skip. Lego Star Wars The Skywalker Saga is a poor excuse of a PC Lego port and the developers need to fix the game for it to be more polished to where none of the problems that I have with others are gone from the game, I enjoy playing this game, but these things annoy me."
5663,David / Waveshaper,https://steamcommunity.com/id/saltydaveiv/,2,,0,50.8,May,"31,",615,0,1,"This is the only modern Star Wars game where you can play the story of the movies, and for that, it's propably the best collection and best singleplayer experience. However as LEGO games are primarly a cooperative fun for us with my fiancé, I'm sad to report that this game is a huge miss.While the game includes all 9 main movies, sadly not much of them is playable compared to the classic Complete SAGA (1-6). A lot scenes that used to be entire levels back then are just 5-10 second long cutscenes. What little remains as playable, became fragmented to shamefully short missions (some are less than 10 minutes for god's sake) that are usually 4 or 5 rooms, but often even less. This is well represented in the usual 10 per level collectibles being only 5 now, because levels are simply so short.This is where all the effort went, and it's actually incredible how you can visit nearly every single planet from all the 9 movies (some that were present for a few shots like Felucia, are missing), and all of them have a small-to-medium sized open world area for you to explore, talk to NPCs (writing is fun!), accept sidemissions and do collectible activities, which are Kyber-Bricks now instead of gold. You'd think having 1200(!) bricks is a lot to collect, but we have 600 of them in 30 hours, because sadly there are only very few type of puzzles copypasted over every planet: run over buttons in time, shoot 4 targets in time, target practice, race, escort a droid, or go find carrots on another planet and come back, that's pretty much it, 1200 times over. It would've been more fun if the bricks open up new mini missions like they did in previous open world LEGO games where in MARVEL Super Heroes for example if you got 80 gold bricks, you could enter Dr Strange's house, have a fun new mini mission there, and unlock it's related characters. Here, instead you spend money on any character you want (some do have conditions but it's completing the copypaste puzzles and story missions), and you use the bricks to spend on a pointless RPG system that gives you more HP, or gives you +10% damage when you shoot... it's pointless, all the upgrades are pointless, there are no new features, skill, moves, anything in them, they are just increasing numbers in a game that is NOT an RPG. For example, you get 3% more damage reduction per cloth piece (you can dress as a stromtrooper with 3 pieces) you find. So in the end, you'll take 9% less damage, in a game where you have so much health and supporting system and autodefense and 2 hitting enemies they have no chance to ever kill you. Feels satisfying to spend 50 bricks on this, right? No. So collecting stuff is only for the sake of collecting and BEING IN STAR WARS, but don't expect any fun out of unlocking anything.First of all, they changed the camera from fixed classic LEGO to TPS, and when playing in cooper there is no longer dynamic split/merge, it's just flat divided vertically, which results in 80% of the times your own character's shoulder view TPS camera hiding everything from you, as you stare at the back of your character unable to see the world. The lack of view horizontally is particularly frustrating when you need to see new checkpoints in a race for example, despite it being right in front of you, you often don't see it, because it's juuuust very slightly off to the left or right. During story missions, all the important battles that were somehow made fun and cooperative in classic Complete Saga, are now fun for only one player. The duel on Mustafar for example had us play as Anakin and Obi Wan, running through a series of puzzles to survive the collapsing mining facility, and fight each other from time to time. Here, one of you plays as Obi Wan against a QTE-heavy, scripted Anakin, while the other player follow you as C3PO / R2D2 to... move a platform sometimes, so you can keep following? Imagine if you had to play that role, while the other player has Duel of Fates (okay wrong movie but still). It's just bad, all except the Darth Maul fight and the final battle against the Emperor as Luke and Vader fight each other (2 players) but eventually team up against Sidious. The rest are diappointing if not outright pathetic.There is really nothing left to say, that covers the entire game's content I'm afraid. Sure there are almost 400 characters, but they are divided to too many categories which will always force you to switch between them far too often. For example, you cannot heat up or cut gold boxes/walls with a lightsaber, or a flamethrower, you need a bounty hunter who can shoot it fast enough to heat up. Or, how there is no difference between a sith and a jedi anymore. Only evil imperial characters can have granades, nobody else can explode silver. Leia is a hero who has a grappling hook, but Grievous or Jango who both have grappling hooks they extensively use in the movies, have no grapphing hook. It is just super weird and uncomfortable, and the lack of character creator (WHY IS THERE NO CHARACTER CREATOR THIS TIME?!) even prevents us from re-creating a favourite movie character with added abilities for comfortable play. There is no flying anymore, even Jango / Boba can only have like 1.5 second horizontal floating with their jetpack, but when you need to glide, you must pick a Scavanger like Rey, to build the VERY SAME JETPACK and now you can glide with that. WHY?! And characters who evolve, like Rey, don't become more flexible: no, you get a 2nd Rey character who is a Jedi now, who lost all the scavanger abilities, and if you want to build stuff, switch to scavanger Rey. It is just frustrating, and every time we play I honestly feel like we should go back to the classic games, because this is the perfect example of LESS IS MORE, and how the Skywalker Saga is ""more is often less"". Sadly the game falls short in every aspect compared to other LEGO games like MARVEL and DC games when it comes to fun of character flexibility (forced to swap too often, immersion breaking), puzzles (lost a lot and overall poor variety, copypasted twice as many times), and open world (no flying around, no continously rewarding longterm goals to open new areas), missions became extremely short, the game is not optimized for cooperative play at all (I cannot underline this enough, terrible, horrific stepback compared to all LEGO games prior), and on top of it all it's badly optimized on all platforms, certain areas like the droid factory mission going as long as 10 fps. The game doesn't look bad, but c'mon it's LEGO, if I can run the Witcher 3 near maximum with stable 60 fps, there is no excuse for a LEGO game to rightfully ask for lowest possible settings just to stay in 50+ region (with drops to 30 sometimes). We'll keep playing it just to have a cooperative Star Wars experience, but I regret buying it at full price (it's a 20-25 euro range), and I would recommend the Complete Saga (or better, the classic and the prequel trilogy LEGO games separately, for even more levels!)."

If you want my honest and truthful opinion, its kind of just disappointing you know. i had such high hopes for this game and it still can be the most amazing lego game they have made but it just seems they dont care enough to fix the actual game.

The modding community is fixing a tremendous number of issues that should not be present, but I am still left unsatisfied by what should have been the greatest lego game of all time. The force mechanics are good, I love first person shooting, but I can't keep this game above 30 fps and there are only seven sith characters in a game that is supposed to be comprised of EVERYTHING star wars. Content aside the newest patch didn't even fix the droid factory, a gruelingly low fps level, nor many of the gamebreaking bugs. I blame Warner Bros. and Lucasfilms far before I blame TT games, but that doesn't stop me from being insanely dissapointed. Play the other lego star wars games, but don't pay full price for this. Maybe in a year the modding community can perfect this game, but I have to ask why that's our only alternative in the first place."

It wasn’t because the graphics were great or there were so many abilities, but because the story, the individual levels and tasks were so beautifully designed that my 12-year-old didn’t want to get away from the Wii. The story in Lego humor offered so much variety and also tasks that you could spend countless hours in it.A few years later Lego Star Wars the Clone Wars came out, which I loved and played with every afternoon.This game. . . is grotesque in terms of level design. The individual levels are designed so loveless that in each level you feel like playing the previous one again. The mechanics of Clone Wars, that you play battles and try not to be overwhelmed by droids, have seemingly been forgotten.Ergo, you run from A to B, knock out two three droids, and at point B it’s either a boss fight, or you shoot targets like a moor chicken. After that, the level is over.And this is repeated every level.The new graphics and the so-called Open World were probably so present in the development that it was completely omitted to keep the player happy.In my opinion, it is almost 60€ for this game, if you buy it in the Deluxe version, well above what you get for your money. If you compare a GTA V which cost a similar amount to release with it, this is really a cheek.For 60€ I recommend everyone to buy 5-10 old Lego games and play them. Wait until the price is 15€. Because it’s worth it.Too bad TT Games, I expected more from you.And Lego, you’re on your way to becoming a meme. . ."

Certain parts are quite PG but its a lego game.- The controls were quite clearly designed for controllers, this is fine if this game was released on only consoles but it wasnt. The controls are awkward. It can be seen very clearly that this was designed on controllers when you use the menus, there is no cursor ever so you have to use A and D or CTRL and ALT to navigate menus. When you press the shoot button in front of an enemy you get aim assist onto that target which is fine if it wasnt on a keyboard and mouse. - Boss fights force you to always look at the boss which makes exploring the area of getting collectables harder.- The DLC characters are just reskined characters. They dont have any new abilities, missions, voice lines, or anything really to convince someone to buy them other than the look.- Force using characters are just better than most others due to their range of abilities. A force user can throw their saber, push with the force, use the lightsaber on enemies, and influence characters whilst blaster heros can shoot, may be able to throw a thermal detonator, and hit enemies which is mediocre in my opinion. Astromechs are even worse as they can just hit targets. They cant fly, use ranged attacks.- Certain parts of the films are condensed into less than a minute of video, this is fine for some parts but others, like operation nightfall, it feels like they just didnt want to develop the levels further. - Boss fights feels very easy and there is a lack of control overall. Most of the time the boss fights devolves into just standing, shooting and dodging every so often. There are a lot of moments where its just hitting E or left click which isnt fun.- Most of the 300 characters they promote are actually just different variations of the same character. Most of the variations are the same except some like Farmer luke who doesnt have a lightsaber compared to the other lukes.- The time to exit the game is too long. If you want to exit the game then;   You have to get to a location or period in the story where you can save  You have to select the exit to menu option  You have to watch the whole assembling cinematic for the main menu  You have to press a button like you just entered the game and press space to acknowledge the saving icon  You can then go across the menu to select the exit game optionThis could be fixed by just adding an exit to desktop option ingame.This is unrelated to the review but most of the reviews on this page are worthless in that they are just saying minor things which they love and arent actually reviewing the game which i find sad but kids do that a lot."

There's a way to play coop on a console, if you're both playing on the same device. However you can't play coop on PC because there's no online coop. Not even LAN. So I can't invite my brother to play with me on the same WiFi, on seperate PCs. I find this to be annoying, especially since I thought there was coop available. On the previous Lego Star Wars game (Nintendo DS), you could play coop on seperate consoles. Why they removed it, I have no idea. It was available on Nintendo DS in 2008, it's not available on PC in 2022.Edit: Yes, I'm aware Remote Play exists, but it doesn't really work for us. We can launch it, invite the other player, but he has no way to control one of the two characters. That's what prevents the coop."

But it feels it put to much into the open world aspect and not enough into the levels. In the first three chapters all story level were either starship mission or boss fights or a combination of both. and while both are great for levels i miss the older level style from my childhood lego starwars games where the levels are where the meat of the game is. it gave just enough of a challenge to make it fun and skillful which this game lacks on a big degree.

It is a game, it looks nice, it runs fairly well, but it lacks a lot of the magic and fun that the originals had. Is it nostalgia? Maybe some of it, but the design is really weak all throughout in a game that had the time and resources to come out much more solid and developed. The big thing that hit me playing in singleplayer is how poorly coop was thought out, really kills any reason in every trying to drag anyone in to slog through it when i can immediately tell they didn't even try to give the second player something reasonably interesting to do. Also, just throwing out an absurd amount of collectibles doesn't make your game more fun, it just makes it more tedious and boring."

R2 can't hover/fly, Palpatine and Dooku can't use force lightning outside of pathetic looking combo attacks (for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-apologists, yes, a soft class system has always been present in lego games, but it was merely limited to ""use of rapid fire to destroy golden objects, explosives to destroy silver objects, astromech to open astromech console, etc."", it did not limit characters to only one kind of ability).Besides, while this is the first lego game that is playble with a mouse (how revolutionary!) and not just a keyboard, the control system is not designed for k&m and cannot be remapped in a way that would fix it (melee attack is on q, ranged attack on m1, you cannot set both to m1), and thanks to the new, freely moveable camera perspective and aiming being a ""feature"" now, playing with a controller also feels clunky and less than ideal, so pick your poison, input customisation has always been a lowpoint for TT games.In summary, Lego SW The Reywalker Saga is a cookie cutter open world, streamlined to the maximum degree, and a step down from lego's other more recent releases that leaned into fleshing out the abilities of the characters they were recreating brick by brick, rather than simplifying them even further. The combo system is lack luster and certainly not worth giving up core character abilities for (look up force lightning in Lego TCW and compare it to the combo attacks here). Oh, and mumble mode is a joke, and they know it, given their behind the scenes video. The original characters grunted and used visual humour, these characters either talk, with poor choices for a lot of the voice actors, or babble, like 2-year-olds."

Not gonna lie, I am almost at the point of being disappointed with this game overall.First of all, the fact that this game was delayed for OVER 2 YEARS and there are still simple optimization bugs? How is the droid factory and ewok village both chugging my 2080ti to below 15 FPS?!?! I have to pause my playthrough and wait for an update because its that bad.God forbid the ""Endor the Line"" mission from Return of the Jedi. The shooting mechanic is terrible and its combined with your lasers literally going through enemies. Best part about it is that it takes SO long to kill those Bike Troopers that sometimes the game stops loading the level and you get stuck in a black void. So you spend 20+ minutes wasted on your first try, or are forced to restart if you are farming it for studs.Overall, the game is pretty awesome but the levels are quite short. The open world makes up for it a ton, but I do think we should have gotten many more story missions. I expected more than Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, and although the quality is 1000% up from that game, the length isn't. Again, open world makes up for it, but this is a Star Wars game showcasing the story of the entire Skywalker Saga... It deserved more IMO.Its hard to say, but this game is both awesome and disappointing at the same time. For now, it gets a thumbs down purely on game breaking bugs at launch after 2 years of delays.Small Star Wars nerd rant... I LOVE Mandalorian, but why give it a DLC pack for each season? How does absolutely nothing get added for the Clone Wars or Rebels show...? Remember that Mandalorian wouldn't even exist without the Clone Wars TV show, so its quite insulting to ignore it for a game called ""The Skywalker Saga"". hopefully it means it comes in the future as a character DLC."

SO. MUCH. WALKING. BACK AND FORTH. So many annoying repetetive quests. And I was excited to use capital ships... But all they do is unlock the potential to get more collectibles and you can't even use them to move around and shoot...It would've been amazing... They are expensive and boring. Don't expect anything special about this game. All I can finish off is: If you want to grind and spend time moving around and ocasionally play on a full moon then buy it. Because trust me. You'll get more bored by the minute every time you play.The pros that i can say however: They made combos pretty fun and made grievous have the most fun melee fighting style."

To the point where I wonder why they even put it on steam other than as a cash grab. The menu controls are a weird combination of escape, tab, wasd, arrow keys, and Lctrl/Lalt. 39 hours in and I still resort to randomly pressing buttons until I'm where I need to be. The biggest problem however is the random bugs and softlocks that exist in the game. Droid Factory Frenzy is capped at 30 fps. The absolute worst level is Endor The Line, which is virtually impossible to beat without aim assist and it glitches out 80% of the time and will constantly say you need to kill more and more stormtroopers without actually spawning them in so you're stuck just flying on the speeder until you reach the end of the map and constantly falling into the void losing all your studs without any fix other than restarting the level. The game is fun albeit frustrating to play on PC. There are several other areas of maps that will softlock you preventing you from escaping an endless cycle of death losing all your studs. These glitches have existed for months and they're everywhere on Reddit and Youtube it boggles my mind how a game this expensive hasn't fixed these level breaking bugs. Pretty disappointed."

This game is more a world with LEGO bricks in it. Some of the bricks do not even look like actual LEGO bricks, but some model that had to be created with a few LEGO-points on it.This game tries to the same thing that all the other LEGO Star Wars games tried to do. Visual comedy. Except the other games did so succesfully, and in this game it feels a bit too forced. Any cut-scene with Jar Jar in it, has him flying around getting hurt.A thing this game does do different, is having full spoken dialog, but a lot of the characters sound like someone just speaking into a microphone and not actual voice-acting.The menu-intro came to my mind while writing this... You have to wait for a bunch of characters to line up and display themselfs, before you are allowed to ""press any button to continue"". And it can not be because of loading as it takes the same amount of time each time. When you then start the game, you have to sit through the ENTIRE chapter-introduction (That classic Star Wars scrolling text one), no matter how many times you have seen it. The game does not even load during this time, but will instead start loading AFTER the intro...The combat is, fine. I don't really get the combo system, but I guess some people will ike that."

With the exception of angel food and chiffon cakes, most recipes call for greasing and flouring the pan or lining the pan with waxed or parchment paper.As for knowing what type of baking pan to use, our Test Kitchen prefers shiny pans for achieving a golden appearance. If you use a dark or dull-finish pan, reduce the oven temperature by 25°F and check doneness 3 to 5 minutes early to prevent overbrowning.Step 2: Allow Ingredients to Reach Room TemperatureMany recipes require cake ingredients such as eggs and butter to stand at room temperature. This allows the butter to blend easily with other ingredients and the eggs will yield a higher cake volume. (For food safety reasons, don't leave the eggs at room temperature for more time than specified in the recipe.)Test Kitchen Tip: Never use melted butter when softened butter is called for. It will ruin the cake texture.Step 3: Preheat the OvenWhen a cake bakes too quickly it can develop tunnels and cracks, too slowly and it can be coarse. Let your oven preheat for at least 10 minutes, and use an oven thermometer ($7, Target) to make sure it reaches the proper temperature. If you're using dark cake pans, you'll want to reduce the oven temperature called for in your recipe by 25°F.Step 4: Stir Together Dry IngredientsDry ingredients usually include flour, baking powder and/or baking soda, and salt. Rather than adding each dry ingredient individually to the batter, whisk ($6, Walmart) them together in a bowl beforehand. That way you know the ingredients are equally distributed throughout the batter.person beating butter for cakeCREDIT: KRITSADA PANICHGULStep 5: Combine the Butter and SugarWondering how to make a cake with a light, airy crumb? Creaming butter and sugar is the most important step. Here's how:Using an electric mixer ($23, Target) on medium to high speed, beat the butter for 30 seconds. Generally, a stand mixer requires a medium speed for this step and a hand mixer requires a higher speed.Add the sugar (and vanilla if the recipe calls for it) and beat the mixture on medium speed until it is combined and has a light, fluffy texture. This will take 3 to 5 minutes. (DON'T cut this short). Scrape the bowl occasionally while beating. Tiny bubbles will be created as the butter and sugar are combined, which will give your cake that dreamy, light, fluffy texture.Step 6: Add Eggs One at a TimeAdd eggs (or egg whites) one at a time, beating well after each. Their protein creates structure around air bubbles to maintain texture.Test Kitchen Tip: Break eggs individually into a custard cup or small bowl first. This way if you get shell fragments, you can easily fish them out of the cup rather than try to get them out of the batter.Step 7: Alternate Adding Dry and Wet IngredientsAlternate between adding some of the flour mixture and some of the milk (or other liquid specified in the recipe) to the butter-egg-sugar mixture, beating on low speed after each addition until combined. Begin and end with the flour mixture. This is because when liquid is mixed into flour, gluten begins to form. Too much gluten makes for a tough cake, so be sure to start and finish with flour, and not overmix once you add liquid.Test Kitchen Tip: Be careful not to overmix at this stage or you might get elongated, irregular holes in the finished cake.person spreading cake batterCREDIT: KRITSADA PANICHGULStep 8: Pour Batter into Pans and BakeDivide the batter evenly between the baking pans. Use an offset spatula ($9, Bed Bath & Beyond) to spread the batter in an even layer. Be sure to spread it to the pan edge. Bake your cake according to your recipe's directions.Related: 21 Essential Baking Tools Every Home Cook NeedsStep 9: Check Cake for DonenessOverbaked cake equals dry cake and no one wants that. Start checking the cake for doneness after the recipe's stated minimum baking time, avoiding opening the oven door until it's time to prevent letting the heat escape. For creamed cakes, insert a wooden toothpick near the center of the cake. If the pick comes out clean (with only a crumb or two on it), the cake is done. If there is any wet batter on it, bake the cake for a few minutes more and test in a new spot with a new toothpick.baker placing cake from cake pan on wire rackCREDIT: KRITSADA PANICHGULStep 10: Cool the CakeLet the cakes cool in the pans on a wire rack ($15, Walmart) for 10 minutes maximum. To remove from the pans, run a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen it from the sides. Place a wire rack over the top of the cake and flip the pan. Lift the pan off the cake, being careful not to tear the edges of the cake. If you used waxed or parchment paper, gently peel the paper off the cake.Allow the cake to cool completely (about 1 hour). This is a key step to letting the cake firm up, making it less likely to break apart as you frost it. (And it keeps the frosting from melting as soon as you spread it!)"

There are awesome and hilarious moments that you won't forget!The gameplay is smooth as butter and I'm loving the combat as they have been revamped from previous titles in which they added combo attacks and with that you earn stud bonuses. Cover system is now a thing in this game in which you take cover from blaster shots and start firing your way while taking cover!There are only 5 story levels for each episode. For instance, Episode 1 has 5 main story levels and that's it. The same goes to the rest of the episodes making a total of 45 levels.Free roam is fantastic! Unlike past LEGO Star Wars games where the missions are linear and Mos Eisley Cantina being the only single hub in the past games, you now have the freedom to explore planets now. Coruscant, Tatooine, Hoth, Naboo, Geonosis, Kamino, you name it! Hell even ships too like the Trade Federation!This game runs fine even if you have an old PC so there shouldn't be any problem running it!I give this game a solid 9/10 and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!

All of the new ""features"" add too much control complexity to the game for my taste. Sure I enjoy being able to throw a lightsaber, but I don't want to control the camera, aim force movements and all that. I miss just highlighting an object and interacting with it.

5868,Swaid,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DWN-10/,2,3,0,89.6,April,"15,",314,1,1,"I was inspired to write this review earlier then I would have liked due to a bug that has softlocked me out of the last mission of Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.Having entered the mission, it immediately became apparent there was something wrong. The B button prompt was up -I play most actions games with a controller- even though I wasn't being locked into a LEGO® Lightsaber™ clash. I could press B and the button would fill up like if I was in a clash, but also LEGO® Obi-wan™ would keep using force push while I was pressing it. Determined to win against whatever evil foe the LEGO® Sith™ had sent to assist the now evil LEGO® Anakin Skywalker™, I kept pressing B rapidly for perhaps a little too long, which didn't yield much but my thumb being a bit sore. I swapped to LEGO® C3-P0™ and the prompt was gone, likely having seen LEGO® Obi-wan™ was trying to Force Push™ an enemy that wasn't there the entire time confused beyond all belief. Since the B button prompt issue was LEGO® Obi-wan™ exclusive, I decided the best course of action was to press forward with LEGO® Obi-wan™ and hope the issue resolved itself.Going forward saw LEGO® Obi-wan™ LEGO® Lightsaber™ clashing with LEGO® Anakin Skywalker,™ bringing up the B button prompt, however, something was amiss. It was one B button prompt layered over the prior one, so I was filling up to B button prompt bars, clashing with both the real LEGO® Anakin Skywalker™ and the invisible LEGO® Anakin Skywalker™; clearly, the LEGO® Gods™ were testing my LEGO® resolve, so I pressed forward.Everything seemed to be going according to the level, until we reached an obstacle that I'm not sure was a result of the mischievous tomfoolery that is invisible LEGO® Anakin Skywalker™ forcing me to constantly press B to fight him off or a completely separate LEGO® issue altogether. LEGO® Anaking Skywalker refused to continue the sequence and just stood atop one of the LEGO® Mustafar Droid Mining Factory Arch Arm™ twirling his LEGO® Lightsaber™ and taunting me with a little LEGO® dance. Switching to LEGO® C3-P0™ or LEGO® R2-D2™ to try and continue the sequence did not work, so I had to quit the level.When I returned to the LEGO® space above LEGO® Mustafar™, there was no primary mission prompt in sight and I could not continue to the final level of Revenge of the Sith™ and now I just don't feel like playing anymore. How can I start Episode 4 if I haven't beat Episode 3? It's unnatural.Also side peeve, stop with Reye always saying she's looking for someone to 'show me my place in all of this' EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. WE. BOOT. UP. THE. GAAAAAAAAAME!!! If you want to make people hate the sequel trilogy even more, that's how you do it. Are you purposely trying to shove this stuff down our throats? Because its just going to get people to dislike the trilogy moreso then they already do. Instead of trying to Force Feed™ everyone the sequel stuff, do your best to prop it up with that signature LEGO® polish and let it stand on its own. When I do continue this game, this game's version of Episode 9: The Rise of Skywalker will be my first time viewing it in any form because I figured the LEGO® version would be far superior to whatever crap Disney churned out in theaters that I didn't bother to go see in any capacity.EDIT: I was going to come back to change the review to a positive, but this LEGO® Endor™ Swoop Bike™ level is a crime against humanity. Who thought going through the same bumpy terrain with a vehicle that has a static laser over and over again while trying to shoot other vehicles was a good idea? On top of that, the level bugs out and I've had to restart it three times and the LEGO® Scout Troopers™ just keep coming long after the level has worn out its welcome. The LEGO® Zam Wesell™ LEGO® Coruscant™ chase was perhaps even more grueling and a slog to get through. You do so little damage, you can't hit civilians, your laser frequent gets disabled, LEGO® Zam Wesell™ phases through buildings, and its so hard to hit the other vehicle it felt like I wanted to set myself on fire just to feel some sort of sensation again. You guys at LEGO® suck at doing chase levels, they feel like a chore to play through.EDIT 2: This will likely be my final entry for this review and I've decided to leave it at negative. The game has had tons of issues since I've got it like frame-rate drops that go as low as 10 and stay there, consistently after it builds up over time, getting lower and lower until its unplayable. Quests not completing properly. Space battles glitching out loading unrendered ships into space battles. Chase levels constantly crashing and being a pain in the ass without auto-targeting, getting soft-locked and having to restart my save file.There's also what I believe is fundamentally wrong with the game, its the same trap Bethesda falls into with a lot of their RPGs where they just increase raw numbers without providing anything of substance. While I adore the level-up system that makes it so you want to go out and get Kyber Bricks, the rewards for doing so are minor increases to damage, health regeneration, and other trivial things that due to how simple the game is, feel like they don't really add anything. Sure, I could do more damage with ranged attacks, but how does that really change how the game is played? I just have to shoot less, which means I just end up playing less overall. A lot of the options are like this and don't do anything fantastic with what they have so the level-up system feels flat and it makes it so I don't really feel the need to level-up, which means I don't feel compelled to play the game because as far as I know, the only reward for collecting all the Kyber Bricks is being 100% leveled. That would be interesting, if that meant something unique other then just hitting harder and taking less damage. The class upgrades that do provide unique functions, like giving Bounty Hunters stun grenades, were a step in the right direction, but the problem is, EVERY Bounty Hunter then gets stun grenades. Very few of the characters really feel that unique, especially when they all benefit from the same class system. While I understand the simple nature of the class system, there needs to be more done to make the characters feel individually unique not just aesthetically, but game-play wise in what they can do. Like, sure I could get Jabba the Hutt as playable, but what does he do? He's just a fun side character you'll forget about after the novelty wore off. But if you could level him up specifically, like making him be able to bribe minions to do his bidding like a Jedi Mind Trick or calling 1 to 3 Gamorean Guards to fight for him and follow him around? There could be more done here, the pieces are there, you just need to build it."

They all seem to do this, and this is even before you start playing. Is it loading the menu? Does that really need two loading bars? Why does it take so long to load the main menu? Then the game plays a long animation that you can't skip. And finally, once you get into the menu, the menus run poorly even if you have an up-to-date computer, which is mind-boggling, because it's a menu. I shouldn't have lag in a menu.

There's definitely fun to be had for sure but I just can't bring myself to finish the game due to all of its problems let alone finish a single chapter. The game just didn't meet my expectations considering how long the game look to get released. The game just has way too much downtime between getting to a level and actually playing it. The game blatantly wastes your time as your forced to travel from hub world to hub world just for you to get to a mission that'll take you less than 5 minutes to complete or just to talk to an NPC that'll send you right out the door. The actual missions don't make up for the amount of time spent getting there in my opinion. The gameplay is pretty decent for a lego game and the graphics are surprisingly impressive but the frame rate issues and glitches definitely brought down the experience for me. I set the game to 1080 and while it looked nice and felt good to play the frame rate would tank tremendously when playing with a friend and the game tends to freeze up and slow down when one player triggers explosions. The game as a whole feels half-ass and tries too hard to reinvent the wheel. I'm personally more found of the much older lego games and their simplicity and while this game isn't challenging or even ask that much of you when it comes to it's combat, it feels like the devs just kept throwing different ideas at the wall to see what would sick and unfortunately none of it really does for me. I get that this is a kids game at the end of the day and while I wasn't expecting the game to exactly be a genre defining experience I at the very least wanted this game to be way more engaging and worth my time than what I was given.  5/10"

When a Jedi has to force lift something to move it somewhere, the camre ends up flipping	2. In the fight with Darth Maul, you have to change characters (when playing alone) to be able to attack Darth Maul             from behind. The free camera will look into the wrong direction (in the direction of the first character).	3. When fighting a boss, the free camera is always aimed at the boss, which can make things a bit awkard	4. If you stand too close to something, the camera doesn't know where to look (although this happens rarely)- The AI in the game has some problems (e.g. Characters regularly bumping into walls while trying to move somewhere)- Flying in general is a disaster:	1. If you steer too hard in one direction, the game will not register your input once you steer in the other direction	2. The enemy AI likes to fly through houses and asteroids- Fighting bosses as a Jedi is just simple lightsaber throwing- Guns are stronger than lightsabers- In the first mission of the first film, I got the impression that almost the entire world was gonna be made of Lego like in    this mission, but unfortunately it isn't (a matter of taste)- In the german version, which I played, they didn't use the original voice actors"

5919,Jake Mook,https://steamcommunity.com/id/JakeMook/,No,1,1,35.2,January,1,129,0,1,"Let me preface this with I never thought I'd enjoy a LEGO game. I bought this as I love Star Wars and remember playing small amounts of the original LEGO Star Wars games as a kid.  I didnt realise the depth of this game, it re-tells the movies in a fun way, that never ever feels dull. The level design is literally flawless, every single planet and stage is designed in a way that is easy to get around, but at the same time large enough to get lost in all the details of the Star Wars world. The game's attention to detail is so surprising I'm genuinely confused why not of my friends have given it a shot. From the LARGE planets you can free roam around on and just explore. Literally no Star Wars game has has had such immersive free-roam. I would of never expected it from a LEGO game. Additionally the fun little detail of your character model getting effected by the environment (for example Luke getting dusty on Tatooine) is fun and you can tell the developers really put a lot of love into this game and it really shows.The very large amount of characters and ships that are playable is a great feature as well. I wasnt expecting almost 380 playable characters just in the base game, and I definitely wasnt expecting near 100 flyable ships. The sheer amount of content in the game is just crazy to me. The prime example being that I'm 8.7 hours in, but have only played through Episode 1 & 2. There are so many collectables, and I often find myself doing a mission then proceeding to run around whatever planet I'm on collecting side quests.This game just feels like perfect Star Wars, and although I never thought a LEGO game could do the Star Wars franchise proper justice, I was wrong. Its the perfect setting for playing through the Star Wars movies."

You cant even change all of the in-game controls. If i could remove all of the sequel trash and the controls were all able to be edited this would be a 10/10 (for a lego game)

Although after a good few months even with there new logic of the new kyber bricks encouraging more gameplay the game still peaked. I also did not like how they game limits the players creativity with not character customizer (even though the devs excuse for that was ""we have over 300+ characters"") the game can get boring when you can not customize as much as you could in the previous game. I have a brother and friends that I play coop with and a lot of times we are very bummed that there are no customizers and the mandalorian duplication patch they made to the game. even though there are a huge amount of coop glitches such as the glitched landing animations, they still decided to fix the Mando duplication glitch... After showing us it is possible they still limit us to 2 characters(smh). All around I am fond of the game but by taking away the character duplication glitch and not adding a character customizer I am very dissapointed. I'd say If they added the 2 back to the game a whole lot of people would be playing more and not get bored as easily me when playing coop."

6038,Ninjyte,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ninjyte/,No,,0,111.5,June,"10,",282,0,1,"I'm shocked this game isn't getting more negative reviews for the poor optimization, even worse than Cyberpunk 2077 for me.I've played through episodes 1-5 and am in the middle of 6, and so far there have been two story levels and now one free-roam level where framerate drops from 144+ fps down to 15-30 fps. The two story levels thus far are the Episode 2 droid factory mission and Episode 3 Mustafar duel, and now I've hit the Ewok village on the Forest Moon of Endor in Episode 6, which is free roam, that drops to as low as 15 fps. And while I have 64 hours in at the time of reviewing, as I've been doing a semi-completionist run collecting all the kyber bricks and characters, this 1% of of game content that has these dramatic frame drops are enough to be nearly unplayable.For clarity, I have a Ryzen 5 5600x, RTX 2070 Super, and 16 GB 3600 MHz RAM. I have been running 99% of the game at 1080p 144+ fps (144Hz monitor with RivaTuner Statistics Server 143 fps cap).And it is not just the framerate, the video display and graphics settings are severely lacking, as well as some notable bugs. There are only 5 graphics settings, and changing them all down to low does not affect framerate in the low fps segments. When launching the game the fullscreen display option automatically switches from 1080p144hz option to 1080p50hz option, and the borderless fullscreen when starting the game does not fit to the screen properly so I have to switch off and on the borderless option every time after launching. There is a V-sync option but no framerate cap for borderless window, so I have been using RivaTuner Statistics Server to cap the fps at 143. Some notable bugs are dialogue lines playing twice, some collectables on the map (when using the collectable locator unlock) not appearing, and a rare issue where I could not change characters on Tatooine and couldn't even open the Esc/Start menu to exit the game.What is especially concerning is that TT Games have only released one performance patch in the two months since launch, and it was before I started playing Lego Star Wars.The game itself is pretty fun and satisfying as a Star Wars fan, though the puzzles and level design of the prequel episodes strangely aren't as good as levels and planets in the original trilogy episodes. I have not finished episode 6 or played any of the sequel episodes yet, so I don't know if there are any more performance issues in the rest of the game. I would be more than likely to recommend Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga if these optimization issues were addressed but the developers seem to be very quiet on post-launch support."

IT IS THE 4TH PART OF THE REVIEW AND PLEASE SHARE THE REVIEW IF YOU CAN AS TO TRY AND HELP SOME OF THE CHANGES AND SUGGESTIONS TALKED ABOUT IN THE REVIEW HOPEFULLY REACH THE DEVELOPERS AND COME IN A FUTURE UPDATEPART 1: INTRODUCTION -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------While I have only finished the Phantom Menace through A New Hope on story mode, I can tell the amount of work that was put into the game and how great the game is already. Also within the short time I played I found several things I did not like about the game. Also please note that I will be editing and adding to the review as time goes on and may even start a Twitter thread with edits of the review and thoughts on the game. Now before I go into what I think, just to establish my credibility and knowledge of the LEGO Games, here is the list of all of the LEGO Games I have played (Minus the mobile games):> Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga*> Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures> Lego Batman: The Videogame*> Lego Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues>Lego Harry Potter: Years 1-4> Lego Star Wars III: The Clone Wars> Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game> Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7> Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes> Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham> Lego Dimensions> Lego Marvel's Avengers> Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens> Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2> Lego DC Super-Villains> Lego Battles: Ninjago *Both the Wii Game and DS Game which have different content. So I have played my fair share of LEGO games and there is really only one LEGO game that I didn’t like, which was LEGO Dimensions. PART 2: THE POSITIVES -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------So let’s start with the things that I think were great in the game. I love the open world aspect and the fact that we can even have space near the planet that we can fly around in and enjoy the Star fighters. I have bought the Trade Federation Command Ship and I have unlocked but not bought the first Death Star, and I have to say, so far I am in love with the Capital Ships.  Only thing I wish is that there was a hangar that stored all of the ships that you own, and maybe like a captain's quarters/bedroom for you to just relax. I adore the change in character selection and like how it is easier to find the character I wanted when I wanted and have what type of character I need when I need it.  I also love the wide selection of star ships that are available and how you can unlock mini ships when collecting all of the Mini-kits in a level.  Next I absolutely adore the skill tree mechanic going on with the Kyberbricks.  I think it is a great addition to the LEGO games and shows much you have progressed based on how powerful your characters are.  Now the graphics.  When I first started playing I was blown away by the sheer amount of detail that has gone into the graphics.  The fact that your character can get all sandy on the sandy planets and covered in snow on the snowy planets is just mind boggling to me in a good way.  I adore the graphics, the sound design, and effects of the game.  The lightsaber fights feel so immersive just on how great these graphics are.  Now the level design is different from it's predecessor LEGO Star Wars games, and all other LEGO games that I have played with the new open world level select that there is.  It takes sort of takes aspects from both versions of the level select system from both types of the LEGO games.  The old level select system was that you had a lobby, like the Mos Eisley Cantina in the Complete Saga or the Batcave in the LEGO Batman game and there were different chapters and 6 doors in each chapter room and each door would take you to that specific level.  Now the new version is more of you go to a specific location on the open world map and that's how you start the level.  This takes both and merges them keeping the Chapter aspect and the open world level select for the individual levels.  It is very complicated to explain, but a lot easier to understand visually.Staying on the topic of levels I also adore the length of each Episode, as it doesn't feel too long but also not too short, keeping that good balance of playtime. Now I have only completed The Phantom Menace through A New Hope, so I can't speak for Empire Strikes Back through Rise of the Skywalker, but so far I enjoy how it is going.PART 3: DISCLAIMER -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I can go on and on about the praise I can give this game, but the things I do not like I feel are more important for the game than the things I love.  Now these will consist of the things I do not like or I think should be done in order to keep people playing this game and continue spending money on it. But before I begin on the negatives, I do need to state that no matter what I do not like, do not completely hold it against the creators of the game as creating a LEGO game has to be incredibly difficult, time consuming, and stressful, as the LEGO games have such a high reputation and standard that it must be very challenging to not only meet the standard, but go above it as so many LEGO games have done in the past.PART 4: THE NEGATIVES-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Now the main thing I most disappointed and worked up about is the removal of the custom character creation.  With one of the last LEGO games being centered around your custom character so much that it was the main character of the game, (LEGO DC Supervillains), the excitement I had coming into this game after all of the innovation and freedom I had from DC Supervillains to make my own custom characters to then be met with not just a downgraded version of the character customization, but to have it be removed completely, seriously took away from the experience and excitement I originally had for the game.  I bought the game super excited and had tons of plans of making a Custom Revan character and kind of roleplaying a bit with it and just embracing my inner child with this game and enjoying myself as I did with LEGO Star Wars the Complete Saga so many years ago, to have those hopes crushed by the removal of the mechanic. To be completely honest I could do without all of the other suggestions/missing mechanics that I hoped for but the fact that the custom character creation is missing just makes it feel less like a LEGO game and more like it's just another RPG.  While not as disappointing as the removal of the custom character creation, still saddening is some of the missing characters from the previous LEGO Star Wars games.  While I do not know how many are missing I can name 4 off the top of my head, with only 1 of them really having a reason of his absence.  These 4 include the 3 Force Ghost characters and the hidden India Jones character.  I understand why Indie is missing from the game as the reason why he was in The Complete Saga was to promote the release of the LEGO India Jones games, I do not see why the Force Ghosts are missing, as I was excited to have all of the Force Ghosts back and I was hoping to get a Force Ghost Qui-Gon and a Force Ghost Luke.  Now if they are hidden Characters, I do not know that they are in the game, but so far, I have no indication that they exist in the game.  CONTINUED IN THE COMMENTS"

On the other hand it's full of bugs, bad user-experience and useless filler. If I could give it a grade it would be 5/10There's plenty of bugs: action prompts will stop working as you try to execute them even if they're right in-front of you, and sprinting frequently breaks for seemingly no reason. There's plenty of fun elements: lightsabre combos are cool and I like collecting random stuff.Ultimately I can't recommend this game for the price it is.

6086,ndee,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ndeendee/,1,,0,6.8,May,"4,",241,0,1,"Unfortunately, a month after release, this game is still completely unplayable. Like many PC ports, Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga has been completely neglected. While console versions have received several updates, there has not been one single PC update since release on April 5, 2022, to address the numerous softlocks and glitches that completely break and prevent further progress. This does not count the numerous other bugs and glitches that cause frame drops, CTD, and prevent events/collectables from being able to be 100% completed. Tech support for the game merely suggest restarting your 100 hour savefile if you encounter any game-breaking bugs. It's pathetic that a game can be released in this day in age in such an abysmal state and not one single reviewer (paid off or not) made note of any of these tech issues before launch. At this point, I have no faith that TT has any desire to fix all the issues the game faces (especially the minor ones that are somewhat cosmetic and are annoying, but not gamebreaking, like everything you've discovered in the Databank always being marked ""new"" when you restart the game). It was wrong to release the game in such a state, as many of these are obvious issues I encountered only during 6 hours. Regardless of whether or when these issues are fixed, due to their lack of care for their own product and their abject failure to communicate with the community over the progression of any bugfixes, TT has lost me as a future customer, and I STRONGLY recommend you stay FAR AWAY from this game."
6087,kwhite8105,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198979687764/,1,,0,32.8,May,"4,",138,0,1,"Definitely not worth $60 or even $50. I will say first off that for a Lego game the graphics look very good and there are some things I do like such as better saber throws and combos. But unfortunately the bad outweighs the good. Just as everyone else has stated there are lots of bugs and needs major improvements. For me personally I absolutely love Star Wars and this was a huge let down and disappointment. I got stuck on the last mission of episode 3 where R2 refused to move when I needed him too. When I travel to Naboo my HUD refuses to load and often I'm not able to walk into buildings that normally I would be able to. If I try to leave the planet I get stuck in a loading screen and have to reload the game. The worst bug of all is the awful stuttering in between levels and free play. The stutter on screen is so bad that you can't barely move around or do much of anything. I didn't rule out it could be my computer but even after adjusting the graphics settings down as low as they would go it did not resolve my issue. Mind you all these bugs have happened already and I haven't even made it to movies 4-9. Also the levels are really short; maybe 15 mins tops if you're actually looking around for collectibles. They made 45 missions for 9 movies. On top of all that I have spent maybe 3 quarters of my play time just searching for collectibles in the FREE ROAM OUTSIDE of missions! I haven't even collected anywhere close to half. Not very good balance of story compared to just running around for useless characters that I know I'll never use or serve no purpose. These are just the bugs I've encountered so far so who knows what other bugs could occur later in the game. If this game was, and hopefully will be very soon, fixed AND was maybe $20-25 then yes it would be worth it. I would not personally recommend this game even after the bugs were fixed unless it was cheaper. The gameplay just isn't worth the asking price overall. Honestly for how long this game was delayed there is no excuse why this game has so many bugs. I don't expect it to be perfect but what can I say when bugs make the game unplayable."
6088,gg.nadrewod,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nadrewod/,No,,0,68.8,May,"3,","1,120",0,1,"This game is a buggy mess, and with no PC patch in sight, it's best to avoid this microtransaction-filled cringefest.  You're better off buying the old ""Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga"", since that at least works without any major bugs/crashes (and as a bonus, you aren't paying for any of the Disney """"""sequel"""""" trilogy garbage).Bugs I have encountered so far:Another thing of note: despite giving players the option to complete the Episodes in any order they see fit (with first movies from the Prequel Trilogy, Original Trilogy, and """"""Sequel"""""" Trilogy all unlocked at the start, and the 2nd/3rd movies of each trilogy unlocking after you completed the movies before them in the trilogy) and being able to get an entire roster of characters with the various factions (Scoundrel, Scavenger, Bounty Hunter, Villain, etc.) with just the hub worlds unlocked from Episodes 1, 2, and 4, some of the unique abilities are locked behind the first use of those abilities in a Story episode (such as the Scavenger, which I assume is basically useless until either Episode 6 [the Jabba's Palace and/or Sand Barge scenes] or Episode 7 [Rey's entire 1-page backstory]). This wouldn't be so annoying if, when exploring the hub worlds in Freeplay, the game constantly tells you to switch to the useless Scavenger to solve a puzzle that you literally can't complete yet. There are a few Kiber crystals I've come across that are supposed to be Scavenger-exclusive which can be collected by other characters with good platforming, but for the most part, you're simply unable to complete several hub worlds until you find the right story trigger to unlock more class abilities."
6089,max,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maxvandalen/,No,,1,25.7,May,"3,",41,0,1,"A great game but doesn't have enough to offer for experienced players who are used to playing triple A third person or first person shooters (including myself). I know that the game doesn't cater towards that audience but i shouldn't've gotten my hopes up. For me the problems start with the aiming mechanics for blaster characters. Your field of view is extremely low by default (if your standing still). I'd say maybe 65 degrees. When you start shooting this decreases even more. To make matters worse you have quite a hilariously large crosshair (I know this game is meant to be played on consoles). Then the shooting mechanics are very simple, just like boss battles but more on that in a minute. Your recoil is low but the the hitbox of the people you're shooting at is very unpredictable. There is more luck involved in hitting a headshot than skill. After firing your first shot - and thus zooming in even further - it always (ALWAYS) takes 3/4ths of a second to zoom back out. This doesn't sound like a huge issue but imagine the scenario where you are running through a corridor (on the Death Star for example). You shoot at some crates to your right to get studs and start running again. Your zoomed in on the wall but as you run the camera slowly starts rotating, in combination with motion blur and the delayed zoom out not only does this feel like the nausea effect in minecraft. You also often find yourself disoriented in game. Everything feels very unresponsive and you really have to concentrate on what you are seeing on your screen to stay aware of your surroundings. You have to put in effort to not get lost. Looking around above you and below you requires a lot of movement and looking around. Most of the times you can't see puzzles in their entirety. Melee combat has been expanded by allowing the player to use light attacks (Q), heavy attacks (E) and jump attacks (SPACE) but it still doesn't feel like a very major addition. It still feels like you achieve the highest DPS by just spamming Q but i could be wrong.Fighters/Planes also feel extremely unresponsive, especially with keyboard and mouse. If you are in a plane, it doesn't matter which one, and you drag your mouse from the far left corner of your mousepad to the far right side. The game will register this movement but will not execute it immediately. Instead your plane will just rotate for 4 seconds straight as if it's trying to catch up to my movement. This makes flying fighters extremely annoying and borderline unplayable. Does the game just expect me to move my mouse less during flying? You can counter this by moving in the other direction but it's just stupid. You are constantly correcting correcting your movements like a metaldector stuck on a piece of metal. If you mainly play shooters like CSGO, Valorant, COD or whatever or even third person RPG's. You'll literally have to teach yourself to NOT make rapid movements when you are in planes. The only way to effectively use fighters in this game with a mouse is by roleplaying a CCTV camera.Then, the boss battles are an absolute joke. Considering the target audience for this game it is only to be expected that the game helps you in certain ways during gameplay. If you're in a plane you will bounce of walls, combat is simple and without depth but the boss battles are in a league of their own. Each boss battle shares the same concept, your opponent has one or more lives and you have to kill/remove all of them. 9/10 times you can kill the boss whilst only using one hand. As a Jedi character just repeatedly throw your lightsaber at the enemy until he reaches low health. This will stun him and do quite some damage. Unironically, this may be one of the fastest methods to kill bosses. When the enemy is low he will run towards you and you have to spam either Q or E on your keyboard to counterattack. Doing this wil remove one of his/her lives, rinse and repeat. Pretty much every boss fight follows this same recipe. Besides, once an enemy is low you can't deal any more damage with standard attacks. You have to wait for them to come close and encounter you. Once i kept running away from a boss for 2 minutes because i didn't know that was the only way to progress in the boss battle.It certainly is a fun game but if you're purely interested due to nostalgia it might not be worth it. Considering you might have grown up since the first LEGO Star Wars games, the core gameplay simply doesn't have enough depth. Exploring the entire galaxy can take countless hours which is great. The graphics are fantastic and overall it's a good game. Take my review with a grain of salt please. I'm not a LEGO Star Wars veteran at all. It's easy to bash on the negative aspects of a game :DSome general annoyances:- I neEd SOmeonE to sHoW mE My PLACe in all this- Optimization is not great (one level in the droid factory i reached an average of 20fps, regardless of video settings. I'm on a RTX2070S and R5 3600)- Fullscreen/Windowed/Borderless functions don't seem to be working properly at all times. Often windows task bar still appears.- Ally AI is absolutely 0 IQ. They will just stand there for the entire duration of a level and do absolutely nothing.- Prequel missions are... questionable. - COOP?7/10"

Having my character gain a million velocity because my lightsaber forgot its supposed to be put away, and many various Soft/Hard locks playing through.and to 100% the levels within 20 hours but takes 60 hours to complete the open world that is just a bunch of lazily placed arbitrary collectibles which number over 1100 (~250 form actual levels). At least the battle mode in Clone Wars was fun to play after the game was finished. I couldn't uninstall fast enough."

Also if you do choose to use free roam to do collectables and challenges , if you swap out to a certain character to do a specific action that the normal regular characters in the movie cannot do like pull a platform down and there is a cutscene later on , it will swap back to the original characters for you automatically and if you happen to need the character from before, you will have to go into the menu to swap againFrequent crashes with missions and buggy parts where you can not advance.

I loved it and so I bought this game asap.In all honesty, the game is very good, but I have a few criticisms:1. I really like the fact that you can speak to a lot of people, but there seems to be a bug (if it is a bug) that the dialogue icons reset (they reappear) after you restart the game. This burns my eyes; please fix it.2. There is a yellow dot in character menu (for example) and also in the missions menu (as another example) for the missions and characters not seen. When you hover over these characters/missions the yellow dots disappear (like they should), but when you restart the game they appear back again. Like for the first point, this also burns my eyes.3. So far I haven't seen a way to create custom characters. If there is no such option then I'm gonna be sad.All in all, please fix the first 2 points (the third is optional). I have brain damage because of this.Other than that, the game is impeccable."

Or rather its not fun if you are an adult. There's plenty to do but it is all very easy and going around smashing the upteenth block of legos does not appeal to me.

Making me have to restart the game many times, which got me really frustrated. Like I said, the game isn't bad, so I'll continue playing, but it's not worth $60 in my opinion. I'd wait for a sale."

Not everyone would agree with this, if your not one of them this game will be more fun for you.So far still enjoying moments in the game as I like Lego Games, but not too big of fan of just summing up movies where it feels like its a giant speed run. But overall there are some good well placed jokes and silliness. Definetly cannot wait to see what else they will do with this from here on out.Still playing the game and will update this review on completion."

I regret buying this and it was definitely not worth 60 dollars. It wouldn't even be worth 40.  They took away from the missions so much to develop the open world and the visuals. 5 Missions per episode and those missions are very short, taking 10 average minutes to beat first run. Go buy Lego Star wars Complete Saga and Clone Wars, save yourself money, time and get better gamesOh and I forgot to add this, the 'open world aspect'. Yeah, it took less than 10 seconds to run from Jabba's palace to the sarlacc pit. So yeah... The only place that felt open was Naboo. Which lends me to the thought of they piled all effort and content into the first and second episodes so people reach the third and later episodes and can't refund the game due to being over 2 hours."

Running a 2080Ti, i9 9900k, 32gb ram and you cannot maintain a stable 60fps at 3440x1440p. Often levels run at 30-50fps on low settings with the worst being the droid factory at 10-20fps. Levels that run at 30fps would be tolerable - although not acceptable - if you could limit your framerate to 30fps, however you cannot do that with 3440x1440p as your resolution. If you are a Star Wars fan, wait for a sale but do not buy at full-price because if TT Games put this little effort into optimising this game for PC pre-release, they are not going to fix it post-release. Runs worse than Cyberpunk at launch and worse than Halo Infinite, both recent examples of lacklustre PC releases. Unacceptable in 2022."

One admission i have to make however, is that this game, for some unknown reason, features lightsaber combat better than most other star wars titles on the market, in a lego game! go figure."

Even if you played Lego star wars TCS, you should still play this game, because the missions are very different, so you don't feel like you're playing a remaster. TT developed the combat system much more, making combat way more interesting than the previous games.TL;DR: if you're worried about buying a remake of TCS, you aren't."

If you didn't grow up with those games then you'll probably enjoy it. Even if you did grow up with those games you might enjoy it, depends on how open to the changes you are. However, if you're like me and wanted a revamped, but classic feeling Lego game, you will be greatly disappointed. I highly recommend reading the other comments to see how this game is different from past Lego Star Wars games to see if the changes would ruin it for you like they did for me."

The vast majority of the story is listening to dialogue while watching cut scenes. You have intermittent combat missions that last all of 5 minutes at most. I have nothing against games that tells a story through cut scenes or non-combat game play. However, the difference is this game simply lacks combat. If you want anything like the original trilogy, don't bother. If you are looking for something similar to the lego clone wars, don't bother. This game as beautiful and well as it runs, was focused on a relatively empty open world and is banking it's success and popularity through that. I will say, this actually follows the story significantly closer than the other lego video games which I appreciate however, it doesn't make up for the lack of actual missions or combat. At that point though, I would much rather just go watch the movies."

Finished Episode 1 and 2 and I don't remember building any structure.The open environment is great and looks awesome but most of your time will be spent escorting an NPC or running to a cut-scene.The new over the shoulder camera game-play is great but you need a controller to play co-op, its 2022 and we still only get LAN co-op?Overall, a very good looking game but game-play is subpar for a complete saga fan."

I couldn't put my finger on why I've had so much dissatisfaction from many big games today until now. This game is in direct contrast to the overall direction of the industry. It's purely an uncompromised vision from a team with passion to create an experience. Before the PC release, I was interested but didn't quite understand why it was given game of the year until playing it.Done.It's a rewarding experience, but not through the typical means. Ultimately the game is about building connections, this thread is woven into the story but also between players. The most satisfying thing to happen to me is struggling myself along a path for the first time to the next station, laying down a ladder to cross a river myself and for me to return the next day and see that same ladder was used and helped about 500 other people cross the river on their own journey.This is hardly touching on most aspects of the game, from the compelling world with the urge to try and make sense of what the LEGO® Star Wars™: The Skywalker Saga is, to its gear system that gives you actually useful gear to help you traverse the land easier.Overall, if you are after a chill game to kick back to at the end of the day. If you are vaguely interested in it, chances are you are going to like it. In terms of what TT Games set out to do, it delivers in all areas. Every aspect of this game was thought out and crafted to precious and it shows. It’s an experience that was made to be experienced and not just to drain your wallet."

It makes me so motion sick that I can't play for more than five minutes at a time. Tried fiddling with all the settings, played farther away, windowed, took motion sickness pills, nothing helps. The camera floats and swerves around so wildly. If you're prone to motion sickness there's no way you'll be able to play this. I think I might be in the minority here, so I'm not holding out hope for a solution like an FOV slider, but if that comes in an update I'll give it another try. Until then, had to refund."

The Emperor famous for electrocuting his foes to death now NO LONGER has this ability UNDER Player control...while clearly boss fight has tons of his Force Lightning Abiltiies. This is a clear MIDDLE FINGER to all SW Fans who waited for this ""ULTIMATE"" Lego Star Wars Game experience.Ultimate DISSAPOINTMENT.Not only there was no PRE-LOAD for PC Steam Players . On top of that CHARACTERS are no longer unqiue and LIMITED to the BEST possible way .If you want to play as Sith YOU WILL BE disappointed.The Emperor Dooku etc they have to do do sith force lightning after you tap SQUARE/X key on the controller and then tap heavy attack. The abilitiy is NOTHING like in the moview/boss fight version. Its NOT Continous. Bobba Fett  also can not fly long anymore but very very short time... and his FLAMETHROWER attack is RIDICULOUSLY short.What else.. Levels feel like BIG ROOMS or corridors . Yes Gameplay itself feels fun but taking away characters UQNIUE stuff is A BIG NO Deal to me a modder who was fighting and modding games to unlock AI/BOSS only skills for player characters in an OFFLINE GAMES...Such a disappointment. FORCE AWAKENS , COMPLETE SAGA, Clone Wars they remain better for me.I dont suggest purchasing this game to any serious SW Fan!Glad I was able to refund it."

However, once I tried playing the co-op, the repetitiveness and poorly-designed game mechanics reared their head. Most missions, only one person gets to really play while someone else is stuck as a droid. The droid challenges that are randomly dispersed through every mission are so boring and time-consuming and take away any sense of urgency from the game. To be playing the Obi Wan v Anakin duel and have to stop halfway to do some protocol droid challenge or switch to R2 for something was terrible. After playing about 15 hours of this game, I'd wished I had just purchased the original LEGO Star Wars."

But did you actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ need to also-Hire people who can't for the life of them sound nothing alike the original, Anakin, Palpatine and Padmé are the glaring examples I've encountered thus far. Padmé sounds like she's impersonating Queen Elizabeth II, Anakin sounds like he's 5 & Palpatine (SPOILZORZ ALORTEZ) use his Darth Sidious voice constantly which sounds farcical while he's pretending to be a nice boi.-The way the brown capes drapes over the model's back makes them look like wafer thin, very burnt waffles. This with all settings set to max I looked for but couldn't find a setting which could help.-Odd lack of tutorialization before you're thrown into your first combat, especially considering the gameplay (at least to me) is incomparable to previous entries.-I really wish I could customize the controls more. For Force users ""Q"" (using Defaults as an example) is your straight up main saber bonk, Left Click is your Lightsaber Throw. That would itself be fine if I could switch them, I've played games released during this millenium so I'm more accustomed to using L-click as my main attack, ""Q"" would fit lovely as an alternate attack. However Default controls for shooty-people (L-click to shoot, ""Q"" to melee) would then be messed up, would be fixed if I could set those controls separately.-Odd design choice to leave spend time and resources on making sure the plastic injection molding seams are visible in the game-Please fix Padawan Obi-Wan's ""upside-down clay bowl"" bowlcut.-Jar Jar does not have a dumptruck ass, there's not even a glimpse of a cheekI would like to put forward my final point as a rhetorical question;If you were to create a title screen featuring basically the whole ensemble of main characters from 9 films, and you would pick one of them as the centerpiece and give them their own ""epic"" voice line to sum up the mindset of the SKYWALKER SAGA;-The ""Mary Sue""-styled disservice to women's representation as strong main characters in sci-fi which wasted the talents of a talented actress on a generic character on an even more generic ""I need to find myself and become strong"" journey. A good idea would also be to think her voice and delivery of declarative lines is as good is Gal Gadot, you could then give her a Daddy-issues laced line which would feel so disconnected, considering this character featured in 3 out of 9 of the main films.-The person who features in a majority of the films, who's character actually goes through a journey of growth, hardship, failure and loss before achieving their ultimate goal. Not to give away which one I'm thinking of, this game contains this character's name in its title.-The beautiful vixen of a green milk animalHere are clues to help you arrive at the answer;-Traveller's Tales picked the only wrong of these three options.-The No. 1 obvious correct choice does not even feature in the title screen ensemble."

The control on keyboard and mouse are a bit difficult to get used to but  controller support and custom configurations makes this criticism pretty obsolete. The puzzles are very laissez-faire so there is many different ways to solve them, even if you don't have certain characters abilities unlocked yet. The one real cirtisism I have is that the game is relatively buggy. I've had 3 instances of bugs crashing my game and/or breaking it so badly I had to turn off the game and restart it. I also have had issues being able to use some of the DLC characters, where they don't appear in my roster. Cut scenes also have occasionally given me a black screen and soft locked the game which has been a bit frustrating. There are also some slight issues with optimization, especially in the droid factory level, however, that was a very elaborate level so I chalk that problem up to my hardware more than anything, although I have been playing with 120 fps on ultra high settings for every other part of the game, that made me reduce it to medium graphics just to keep a 45+ framerate. Overall, its very good. I would like to give it a 9/10, however, it would need a few more bug fixes for me to really give it that so as of april 7 2022,  its an 7.5/10"
6498,2001 DVD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/2001DVD/,No,,1,22.9,April,"7,",377,0,1,"This game is great, for the right person that is.I've seen people talk about how short the levels are and I completely agree with that. However, I feel that the developers chose to make the focus of the game on the hub worlds over the story. Don't get me wrong, I get that the game is about the movies, but it really feels that they're not the main focus.It's not an open world to the extent of something like Breath of The Wild, instead, it's expansive smaller areas that make up pieces of what is a gigantic map.Every other Star Wars game has you put into a story, this Lego game has you put into the world. The audience they sought for this game were people who were interested in exploring areas and with characters you wouldn't think would be there. You can run around Theed in Naboo as Darth Vadar watching all it's people run in fear. That alone warrants conversation.There are space battles (and let me just say I did not expect the battles to be as fun as they are), the ships in the game are cool, though I've noticed that they are pretty much the same other than looking different from each other.The sounds of the blasters and, omg, lightsabers are amazing like they sound GOOOOOD. Matching that with the combat in the game is honestly blissful. Throwing a lightsaber and watching it come back and the character doing a cool spin with it... idk it's just really cool looking.One of the things that really upsets me is that you can't create a character of your own in the game. Many of the most recent Lego games have had the option to make your own character. This game does not. It's not something that kills the game for me as its completely an optional thing that existed, but the fact its not in this game is just a bummer.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone who wishes to explore fantastic worlds and play as really cool characters (300+ that is). 8/10."

I changed my resolution from 2560x1440 to 2560x1080. After playing for some more time, the game is fun and worth the price for star wars fans. The level design seems a bit boring, most levels are just walk from point a to b, watch a short cutscene, then back to a. Then you have space ship missions which are fun, but mouse controls are bit weird (if you flick hard, your ship will keep spinning until it catches up to where it should be). I still enjoy space missions, regardless of weird controls. Finally, there are boss fights. So far, I've only fought maul (only finished phantom menace as of writing this) and it was fun. There's obviously a ton of free play content to see so not worried about a lack of content. I still would appreciate an fov slider though."

There's also 1100 bricks to collect to upgrade your abilities, (not individually, destroying an asteroid got me 5) which is weird considering how little meat there is to the actual game. The combat is overhauled, but again, I don't see the point if you rarely use it. Non-companion AI is brain dead. Enemies should be blasting you with blasters but they just stand there waiting to be killed, even though there's now a block button. Friendlies are the same way, during the Gungan battle (in which you kill roughly 2 dozen droids, build a catapult, and then just gun down a mob with it) it's only you and the player 2 AI doing anything, despire being surrounded by other gungans.   Slapstick is back at least. Port's nice, ultrawide is actually supported. Still no online multiplayer unless you want to use steam play though. Not asking for open lobbies, I just wanna play with friends.   All the game's resources went into making hub worlds. If you want a collectathon, go for it.

And this is the worst part of this game - so y'know that level where you go through the second death star in the millenium falcon and hit the core, and then have to race out as the fire is burning behind you? Yeah, its not in here. Its a 10 second cutscene. I am sorely disappointed, as I was looking forward to that alot. Its like one of the best levels in the entire series. Yeah this ones kind of a bust, and is completely lacking in content. 380 characters doesn't matter if essential levels and scenes just aren't there. Edit 2: Also, I forgot this, but at one point Luke on Jabbas barge completely bugged out and just kept running in one direction. Had to kill him multiple times to get back in control. For some reason, the in-game scenes tend to be a little glitchy, and camera movement takes way too much time. Every 5 seconds is either a panning shot to show you what to do, or just takes control away for way too much time. I know I'm comparing this to the originals, but its just overall a clunky experience.Now, I might change this. But right now, its just not fun. Like I know nostalgia and everything, but every single cutscene feels so rushed and fast and is so off putting in an odd way I don't understand. 20 minutes of this and I'm already at the Death Star? Where did the C3PO and R2D2 get sucked into the Jawa ship go? Where did the Uncle Owen buying C3PO and R2 go? There's just so much missing, or skipped. I wasn't even that hyped for this and I'm still disappointed. I know some of you are going to go ""but theres more content your just not doing it"". Well guess what, Lego Batman had an open world, and Lego Marvel had an open world, and those two had better and more interesting level design. This is not an open world game, this is a set of levels, with too much empty hub world between them. If the cutscenes weren't so fast paced, and characters had even a moment to breath or for there to be just a single moment where something isn't happening, it would be so much better. The original games handled the story much more elegantly, but still kept it goofty, this one just doesn't cut it"

Had plenty of variety, plenty to do, and was a great experience with so many characters and being able to play through all 9 movies. I haven't touched it since that first week.Upon playing through the older games like Complete Saga, Batman, and Indiana Jones, I realised the 1 core problem of this game.It is too big.Part of the charm of the old games was how they were short and simple. You could get plenty of enjoyment and fun out of them, and if you chose to, you could 100% them in roughly 16 hours. You could hop into a level and be done in 15 minutes, perfect for when you don't have alot of time. This game however, is an absolute SLOG to get through. Getting through all 9 episodes was one thing. It is after the main story that the game becomes dreadful. Each and every planet is fully fleshed out with quests and hidden collectibles to be found everywhere. I started my journey going one planet at a time. This proved a fruitless effort, as some quests were locked behind quests on other planets. By the time I hit Tatooine, I was done. I was burnt out and exhausted. Tatooine I believe is the largest planet with the most to do, and WOW do you feel it. There are also at least 2 planets that are very similar to it, being Crait and Jakku. The whole thing is extremely overwhelming with endless collectables and quests that go on for seemingly hours. Then replaying the levels you remember that there are 9 episodes, each with a handful of levels each. And many of them are extremely open, making you need to go through them with a fine tooth comb. And after ALL THAT, most of the puzzles and quests feel very empty and bland. You start to feel this generally by the 3rd-4th planet.I can't go back to this game because it looks like FAR too much work ahead of me. Theoretically it is possible to beat it, but you are going to pour so much time and effort into it. In the end, will it be worth it? Will it be enjoyable? Your answer may vary, but mine is very much No."

I experienced 2 game breaking bugs in this game that prevented me from game progression: One was on the Endor mission with the speeder bikes, the objective said to eliminate storm troopers, but the storm troopers would not spawn so I was just sitting there shooting trees and just getting unlimited studs. The second was in Maz's castle, the objective portal at the entrance of the castle would not show up, and there is no fix to this bug other than to just keep restarting and wait for it to work, and this process for me took an ENTIRE IRL MONTH to get past it, really annoying bugs. And on some levels and cut scenes (not all) your game would just drop to 30 fps and it was super annoying. And no it is not because of my pc, i have an RTX 3070 and a ryzen 9 3900x, no matter how good your pc was, you would drop FPS pretty frequently due to the poor optimizationIf you are buying this game I would suggest only really playing the main story for the side missions and open world mainly just consists of breaking random ♥♥♥♥ collecting studs."

In the area of story game-play the game feels rather short and rushed, with only 5 missions per episode and some filler set-up missions in-between. Yes I know its a Lego game and they are more focused on the collectables side but it would of been nice to see a bit more story mission game-play.For the collectable 100% side the game, It is spectacular and quite over-whelming at times. The grind is hard but its fun in the prepossess. The 750+ puzzles are mostly different and refreshing each puzzle and the side-missions are different and fun too.Overall amazing game 9.5/10 but i do not suggest to players that do not intend on attempting to 100% or play through free play."

6591,Chad Champion,https://steamcommunity.com/id/neanderthalchad/,9,,0,17.9,April,"8,",201,0,1,"This game is fun, but I have come to find more disappointment then excitement while playing this game. Levels are short and most can be summarized by following the objective markers and killing a few waves of enemies on the way. Many key moments in the movie are replaced by cut scenes or completely skipped. There's barely any building or puzzles, and I haven't seen any of the alternate paths other than the one showcased in trailer.With that being said, I still do think this game is worth it, just not at full price. All the jokes hit and the open world is cool to explore. The combat is fun, but it is very easy and can be a bit repetitive on long sessions. All the boss fights I have had so far were pretty enjoyable, but I was kinda hoping the lightsaber duels would be a bit more challenging and had more depth.     I know this is a kids game, but considering a large portion of the people who bought this are teenagers or young adults, I think it is fair to point out. TLDR: If you want the real LEGO Starwars experience, just play The Complete Saga. In my opinion, it still remains the gold standard for LEGO Starwars games, as others have said this is just a lazy platformer with the LEGO style and modern graphics."

Also while I was playing Episode II, the game was playing at lower than 10 fps, which made my eyes bleed. While most of the gameplay is quite fun and an improvement over previous Lego games, it just got boring after finishing Episode I. The thing I hate most about this game so far is the Jango Fett level, which consists of chasing him through the asteroid belt.

6616,Princess Muu-Muu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Samurai_Ninja_Kitty/,2,,1,101.6,April,"13,",631,0,1,"I want to start this review by saying I was one of the original Complete Saga fans and was highly skeptical of this game.Firstly, I heard a lot of bad stuff recently about TT's game development, a lot of reviews/comments were saying the that original was better, and I personally hated my first two hours on this game. Going into it, I had pretty low expectations and was even thinking about refunding it. After a while, I found myself hooked. However, there's a mixed bag of things this game does better than the original Complete Saga but also things it does way worse...*You can turn into any character in the game that you have unlocked at any time. (But... NO CHARACTER CREATION.)*The game looks really good graphically. (But... The FOV is really tight and can even be sickening at points.)*Way more exploration and collectibles than previous games. (But... The game reuses locations and crams so many collectibles in, its overwhelming. Hours of grinding collectibles amounts to nothing when there's 1000+ collectibles.)*You can aim blasters properly now. (But... Melee combat is non-existent. Enemies just stand around and let you stun lock them in combos.)*Boss fights actually feel more like free form boss fights. (But... This makes them all feel the same.)*They paid homage to cut missions from the original Complete Saga. (But... Removed some of the most fun and iconic levels to add and extend boring levels.)*They included a lot of movie scenes into the campaigns. (But... You have to travel to a mission starting point just to watch it play out in a cutscene to progress...)*They embraced Star Wars memes into the game's script. (But... They keep reusing their least funny memes over the course of episodes.)Overall, I think the new game is a net positive if you're into Lego games for the completion. If you don't like collectibles but are a fan of the Complete Saga, you probably wont like this game in comparison. This game's episode missions are often boring and short. On average I only found a scene or two, maybe an entire chapter of each episode to be fun. For me, I enjoy the collectibles. These larger maps they let you free roam have a lot of freedom and multiple ways to access collectibles. I also found some of the side quests to be more engaging than the chapters themselves. I definitely got my money's worth, I just want them to add an FOV slider as it will improve the game dramatically."

Jet packs are rubbish, there are no enemies to be found anywhere on the maps, low amount side-quests, cutscenes feel sorta rushed (even if it supposed to be Lego), the game starts with a long ass tutorial instead of a node at the bottom of the screen like older Lego games, the HUD sucks, no custom character creation, and the story mode mostly consists of walking and it only gets fun when you fight a boss, but every boss fight is pretty much the same. Also the story cannot be replayed without having to go back to the episode selector in order to play another level. Anakin's boss fight in Revenge of the Sith (EP3) has a bug where he pushes you away instead pulling you in to continue fighting him through Mustafar. You're then forced to make a new save file since you CAN'T REPLAY THE FREAKING STORY.The vehicle control in this game is awful, and you can only play the Mos Espa Classic podrace in first person. The class system is cool but feels like it fits more in an online type of game. The opening, voice acting and graphics look amazing though.The game looks great but it isn't much fun. For me, It's mainly a masterpiece from an art perspective. Only buy this game if you love Star Wars like me."

Juggling between KBM and mouse to fight is godawful.You cannot move mouse and click in menus.Splitscreen camera is terrible. Too zoomed in to see anything. Is there some kind of adjustment settings I'm missing?Why is there no online co op or some kind of friend sharing? Games like It Takes Two can do this, and TT has done online co op in the past with Indy Jones 2.So far I have only played 30 minutes of Episode 1 and the levels lack the same soul the original games did. I guess I'll soldier on hoping to find a gem in the rough but these new TT LEGO games are just so taxing.EDIT 1: Played a little bit more and explored Mos Espa. Holy moly is this camera so awful. It frequently gets stuck behind objects so that your character can't be seen when trying to perform some puzzles. The FOV in single player is still ridiculously close."

This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well.

I loved playing the complete saga when I was younger and I expected this game to be a million times better than the complete saga. I mean this was created 15 years after the complete saga so my expectations weren't too much. I heard that this game would have a ton of fancy graphic options. I  load in and try enabling all of the fancy options and it doesn't seem all that different or cool. It could have just been by computer lacking the fancy technology to run the fancy graphics. Whatever. Let's talk about the actual game now. THE COMBAT IS AWFUL! When I saw the combat is awful, it truly is. I was expecting there to be some challenge to fighting enemies, but no. You could quite literally stand in front of an enemy completely still and they would kill you after like 15 minutes. The game even has barriers to shield yourself from enemy fire, but i don't see a point of that when you could just run right past all of the enemies. I understand that this maybe is targeted towards children, but I think even children get frustrated that they could just run past everything with no consequences. Then you have the mobility and parkour things. The parkour has no challenge to it at all. All you do is switch to a bounty hunter and repeatedly press the same button to jump through parkour challenges. That is super boring. I want to actually jump and time jumps so that I am successful. Not just spam A with my eyes closed and pop up at the top of the parkour challengeNow the giant fight sequences. What a joke. For example, in attack of the clones when Padme and Obi Wan are in the gladiator battle and count dooku shows up there is supposed to be a full out battle between jedis, bounty hunters, sith, clones, and droids. The complete saga did a perfect job of this, but now in the Skywalker saga you have a measly like 5 droids rendered in at a time. One would expect with all of the new innovations to technology we had in the last 15 years  we would be able to render in a ton more entities on our screen, but it seems that innovation has done the opposite and only allows us 5 battle droids. You could see another example of this on the planet Kashyyyk. Kashyyyk is the place that is home to all of the wookies in revenge of the sith. There is supposed to be a full out battle with clones now battling jedis and wookies everywhere. Once again, you only get like 4 clones rendered in at a time making the game very simple and not what I expected. The game also has some annoying features like when a kyber brick is collected, you are forced to watch your character stand still while the kyber brick counter ticks up by 1. Then slowly fades away.  Then the character says a catchphrase and you are off to play again.  This gets annoying when you have to collect all 1200 bricks. Another annoying feature is when you start up the game. You are welcomed by a 2 minute long cut scene. Good thing the cut scene is skippable. But it gets annoying that every single time you open the game, you have to skip the cutscene. Even after that is ""skipped"" you have to hear Rey talk for an extra like 10 seconds. I just want to get in the game and not watch a movie before I launch the game.Overall, this game just seems like everything is handed to you and you are carried all of the way through it. There is almost no challenge or parts you really have to think through. Even for all of the kyber bricks and minikits, there is a giant blue marker that appears through the walls to show you the exact location of everything. Maybe they should have implemented a difficulty feature or something so it makes it seem like we aren't just guided all the way through the game. The game is also just a disappointment to what I was expecting. i was expecting a giant improvement to combat and gameplay, but it was all just turned to poo."

Every episode I had the game crash at least once with an infinite loading screen every other episode. Other times whole puzzles don't load in so there are a bunch of empty rooms for no reason until you reload the game. There are a handful of levels that drop to about 15 fps almost regardless of hardware. There are multiple people complaining of having their saves get corrupted and a few videos of people stuck in infinite death loops after space battles.As for the game itself...It sacrifices a lot of the story and levels in favour of open world areas. I feel like they really missed the mark with the open world areas. They feel so disconnected, most of the time they don't feature in the story in anyway other than walking through. On a handful of levels you might have to fight your way through but they're a rarity. Outside of that there are 5 levels per episode that aren't usually long. Luckily this means when you get to a level with poor performance (enough to give me motion sickness) you can get through it fairly quickly. The games pacing is off too. For example about half way through Episode 1 you'll notice icons with an electric drill for the scavenger class. You'll get the tutorial and first unlock of this class on Endor, towards the end of Episode 6. Most of the side quests you pick up just have you going back and forth throughout the galaxy doing fetch quests. If they were local they wouldn't be so bad but you're constantly back tracking. It doesn't help how you can only track one quest at a time. Also added to the fact the UI isn't great. You'll constantly find yourself in the wrong menus opening and closing tabs not really getting anywhere. It's really noticeable when you're trying to swap a team member with one that isn't in the quick select. All in all it feels like they've taken too much out but not replaced it with enough. Unless you're really into the trend of every game ever now being open world. I tried to power through the games major performance issues but in the end the game itself stopped me from playing it. So after that I really can't recommend it.Comments are disabled because the community members of this game are very young and are yet to develop common sense and fundamental communication skills.

Why would i need increased weapon damage and abilities when there arely is ever any fighting and when there is, its so short with just a few enemies.There is no hub where all the characters can be seen walking around nor any trophy room where you can see the things you have unlocked and yet to, the environments are very open, very petty, but very empty and have no point other than aesthetics. All of the unlocks and collectables are in a menu, and only serve to get more kyber bricks (used for meaningless upgrades).It feels like so much work has gone into this game, but none of the quality and shine of their previous games are there. Its as if Warner Brothers used a different studio and a dev team who never played a lego video game and told them to hurry up and make something to sell.And thats really all this game is, mediocrity designed to sell and barely pass as acceptable."

Had a blast with lego star wars 3 and the complete saga in particular. This game, gameplay wise, has evolved and gotten better. The graphics have been improved, and more characters are unique. However, during playing the game, I grew bored quickly in the ""open-world"" aspect of it before each mission. The open-world is great if you enjoy doing multiple different puzzles with multiple different characters. But besides that, there were no enemies. No other challenges. Just walking from point A to point B with some optional puzzles in between. The missions themselves (for what I completed, which mind you was up to Episode 2), were not that creative. They were way too simple (including the boss fight). So yeah lack of creativity I felt. On top of that, whenever I played with my friend, I would get a headache after an hour of playing. The camera is the main cause I believe. So yeah, don't come into this game thinking it's going to just be a better old school star wars. It's not, and it's just more complicated regarding the ""skill trees"". (Which at least in my time playing, you did not need anything from any skill tree)."

Within the first mission I found myself already rushed through Episode 1 in less than an hour for the first movie, a lack of puzzles and combat making my first impressions rather negative and the open world not really providing anything of worth via collectables. I persisted and carried on with episode 2 and 3, encountering bugs and areas that had frame rate issues, yet the lack of puzzles, any meaningful combat, lack of worthwhile collectables and the serious pacing issues did not change my stance on the matter. luckily moving into the OG Trilogy and Sequel Trilogy I found an increase in puzzles and gameplay and the story smoothed out, yet still felt rushed in many areas. The combat now included more dynamics and puzzles into it yet with the shortness of each mission quickly putting a stop to any fun, releasing me back into an empty open world with worthless collectables. Combat:The new combat mechanics are a much welcomed improvement and take me back to Lego City Undercover, with counters and combos feeling rather fun to pull off when your able to. The gunplay is the highlight for me personally in terms of the new combat, with the splash of the energy bolts and AI reactions to being hit, adding some weight and impact to each encounter. The new cover system is very much like that of Mass Effect or Gears of War, yet feeling far more polished and seamless. Yet with all the positives come the Negatives, the good examples of combat are far and few between, with most encounters finishing within a matter of seconds or ending up as easy shooting galleries without much else. The AI whilst advanced, isnt able to shine enough or provide any challenge at all. Boss battles are not a new concept yet with the Skywalker Saga, they've rewritten the basics of it. Puzzles have been removed and clunky, buggy, repetitive Quick Time Events take center stage. Every boss fight will be the same, hitting the boss until a QTE drags you from across the map to mash a button or key, with the QTE's offering no challenge once again, but against what I said above, now and then you may find a fight sprinkled in with a basic puzzle to lead to the next QTE.Overall, combat whilst fun at its core, sorely lacks anyway to shine and to provide a memorable experience or challange, relegated only to filler to bulk out extremely short missions or for boss fights.Space Combat:I dont really have much to say on this but the space combat is very good despite a view poorly designed missions (Ships flying into the back of you), overall the space combat is very fun and officers more challange.Puzzles/Building?:The main staple of the lego games have always been its well thought out puzzles and building which go hand in hand, yet in this instalment it has been utterly looked over in favour of shooter mechanics and gameplay. When you do find puzzles in the game, the developers have had the bright idea to highlight each step for you, whether that be from finding a key to unlock a door or finding parts to build a ladder, all the steps are highlighted, making these some of the worst puzzles I have ever encountered in any game. A concurrent theme throughout this game is the lack of any form of challenge what-so-ever, and this is mostly shown through the lackluster thought put into puzzles when you do get them. With the lack of any meaningful puzzles as well, also means the gameplay and levels are lacking heavily, owing to their shortness.Overall the puzzles are pathetic to what has come before and severely hamper the game.Open World/Upgrades/collectables:The open world whilst seemingly large, is rather small and empty, offering not that much in the way of content besides finding crystals to use in upgrades or unlocking minifigures through unoriginal missions. Minikits meanwhile have been reduced from 10 to 5, with most being easily obtainable through shooting galleries. The upgrade tree is practically useless and provides no benefits or reason to sink time into, with this being the main focus for the collectables in the small open worlds, it leaves areas feeling empty or providing no reasons to explore.Overall Thought/Score:When compared to its older games, TT Games have made an empty, boring game that is easily forgotten. With lacking combat and puzzles (If you can call them that), to poorly paced story telling and dreadful mission design, this is in my opinion one of the worst lego star wars instalments to date. The time they spent producing this with the content offered leads me to believe the game went through development trouble, as the final product is more akin to a months worth of work rather than years, leaving me incredibly disappointed and underwhelmed. The game is not worth the price, more content is offered from indie studios selling their games at £14.99 than this game offers.Score- 4/10"

They make you use the mouse, taking awake the unique gameplay lego games provide and dont even give you the ability to go back to the old controls. And they even took away another unique feature of lego games, the character customiser. So what if there are 300+ character, u just need 1 from each class and you are done, but having a character customiser brings more to unclocking characters to use their parts to make your own lego characters. And with the way the classes are it would have been really amazing.

It also doesnt even give a good gaming experience because everything is super stale and bare-bones... The ""jokes"" are super bad and way too corny compared to the old game and the corniness of the jokes just makes them horrible. There is almost no building in this game which the older games had tons of to complete levels which made it fun and interactive but in this one it lacks it and makes it feel like a recap of the old games, ""recap"" in the way that its like when you start a new season of a series that took 8+ months to get a new season and they start off with a 45-75 second recap.Shooting in this game feel like a ""hold a button and just shoot"" there is nothing fun about it when its so lackluster in every single scenario and makes the experience fall even lower.The voice over sounds horrible and ""off"" because they use new voices instead of cutting the original voices from the movies into the game.The only good things about this game is the fact that you get all the games in one game, graphics and the fact its open-world, but with that said that is literally everything the game has going for it. Is it nice with 400 characters to unlock? yea ofc but that is literally just made to make the game feel long and that shouldnt be what its for.3/10 score, Do not buy."

6779,Riverfurball,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Riverfurball/,No,,0,43.9,April,"28,",878,0,1,"As much as I'd like to give this game a great review for what the game is overall I can't justify it due to the constant problems I've had with this game over my 30-hour run.When it comes to the base content there are easily 20 hours for the base run through and id guess roughly 50-60 hours for a 100% run. The game has an improvement in pretty much every way from the previous lego star wars games for combat, classes and the overall world to explore. The game consists of hub worlds that include areas on the world and its space is mainly used for races and challenges with the worlds themselves being large while being compact with an assortment of content and over 1000 bricks to collect. Outside of this are 5 missions within each episode that vary in quality with many being fun and improvements within boss battles while others feel a bit short and crammed in, but most of all riding/space missions are now actually enjoyable with them being scattered throughout this time around.But the main problem comes with the stability and game-breaking bugs throughout my entire experience. The first part is the fairly common crashing with my run consisting of around 18 to desktop while black screening in cutscenes happening over 15. The other problem occurs when the mission has you switching between characters in boss fights particularly in boss battles as the game seems to get stuck and won't switch the player back and instead of forcing a restart this has happened more times than this mechanic working.The final part is the overall stability that causes problems with multiple missions and hub worlds dropping below 10 fps at 1440p on high (ryzen 7 3700x, RTX 3080) such as droid factory, wrestle with wesell, a lot of the space missions for examples. With bugs including unable to build, characters getting stuck in the wall/ground, reappearing after cutscenes outside of the map and free play generally easy to break the game.As much of a pain as this game was, I stuck with it as I planned to 100% it but the final straw was my save game being corrupted after the final crash (Spend an hour trying to fix nothing suggested worked) it has killed any motivation left to complete. I'd recommend putting it on your wishlist and waiting for a few months or a year from now as I'll eventually try it again."
6780,Noci,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nocidoki/,2,,0,8.3,May,"1,",110,0,1,"I have to give this game a thumb down - even though its a good game. But its kinda missing the LEGO Element.The graphics are great, controls are good (little bit fiddlely with starships) and the typical Lego Humour is there. But one big aspect is clearly missing. I played 1,5 Episodes now, with lots of extra play in the open-world parts and there is nothing to build. You can smash crates, lights, benches but they never drop parts to build something new out them - a key factor of Lego games. It has every aspect of a good game, but the best part is sadly missing or only very rare. Maybe it will get better in later episodes, if so I will update, but right now it feels like a generic Star wars game with Lego textures on top."
6781,AquariusHD,https://steamcommunity.com/id/AquariusHD/,1,,0,14.0,May,"20,",112,2,1,"The game was really good pre-update 1.05. It would've been top 5 games of all time for me. In the update, they removed at least 5 different good bugs. Literally any popular speed running game has 1000000 fun bugs that don't affect anyone's experience unless they're actually trying to do said bugs. Game devs typically don't remove those bugs because they only have a positive impact on their game. The devs for this game did remove them. They went out of their way and did all of this extra work, just to make their game objectively worse.You can still get old versions again, so it wouldn't be that bad, but the game crashes 3-10 times each time my friend and I play it. I had accepted that I'll just have to live with the crashing, but now they'll release new updates to make the game crash less often (maybe 1.05 already fixed it), and we can't get them if we still want to have fun while playing the game. We now have to choose between the game crashing very often or playing essentially a completely different game, a 46.5% worse and 88.3% more boring game (I crunched the numbers and that's literally what they came out to).Tldr: The game was really good despite some bad crashing issues, but the developers removed some fun bugs that hurt ZERO people's experience.

EDIT: i forgot to add, while you rescue padme inside the droid factory, i had a gigantic bug that i could only go around with extreme precise jetpacking. i was thrown back and all thing to climb with were broken but the big bar at the top, dropped me off as soon as i touched it. i have no idea why this happened yet it almost soft locked me. 3. very minor bugs mostly countless visual bugs; big space ships in low res during smuggle missions spawning often, twice an executor which i went inside of. a millenium falcon randomly spawning after going above a planet while being it itself, i destroyed it, nothing happened but it had a lot of health. characters keep duplicating during mini cutscenes probably because of freeplay mode. npcs sometimes clipping out of their correct position in mini cutscenes. suddendly luke used the force once, but he was A.I. the weird thing was how my camera centered to the object he used the force on. once the game showed me an enemy signal, however there was nothing and i could even shoot proton torpedos at the nothingness. a star destroyer having invisible walls behind it during a mission, even though instead of placing an invinsible wall i die from maybe restrict me from going there. while you destroy the deathstar theres a minicutscene right before you shoot a torperdo down the vent, in which the game shows you the lights emitting from the engines of lukes x wing however not the ship itself if you play in freeplay and picked another ship. sometimes when you boot up the game every character that has a face just is faceless. during cutscenes, the opening sequence, and while you play. a weird white ish font was there for a small time while starting the same mission over again in freeplay. i saw clone troopers bouncy into the air and when i came close to them they despawned. if in freeplay at count dookus hideout, you can use a jetpack to go over the cutscene trigger. during mini cutscenes the baguette extra loves to break by showing lightsaber and baguette and once only a ip in hyperspace. a geonisis monster clipping trough the floor in reverse after being defeated. on kamino theres the flying  animal things and at one specific spot theres one that keeps flying into an invisible wall, freezing in place. while driving over to the broken death star (second one?) not using the vehicle will make it steer completely out of control sometimes. a kyberbrick that was a minikit? i dont think that was supposed to be like that. i once spawned inside the air at the wrong place while wanting to fast travel to a side quest giver. with boba fett i got launched into the air twice. a lot of npc's clearly just despawning. a grappling blaster stuck in the air. obi wan once blocked grevious with air instead his lightsaber. on camino a bunch of npcs clipped into eachother. c3po and r2d2 not correctly doing the animation, instead just spawning in. the heaviest glitch here was a side quest boss spawning in randomly on camino, beating him again gives nothing but its hard and annoying to trigger the cutscene.*this game was not worth the 50 euros, no matter how fun the main missions are, 100% in this game arent only annoying trough bugs, but straight up impossible sometimes.*"

While I do appreciate them trying something new, I feel like this game did not need an open world, as the fun of the classic lego games came from the fun level design. The main gripe I have is the story mode missions. They are short, easy, and lacking in fun puzzles, and to top it off there aren't many of them. Many of the story mode missions are ""walk here and watch a cutscene"" and that's it. The fun missions are the boss fights, with the expanded combat mechanics they are somewhat interesting at first, but quickly get kind of samey. However, the multiplayer experience during these boss fights was not fun at all. I've only played up to episode III so far, so maybe they improve later, but in the Grevious, Palpatine, and Anakin boss fights, player one gets a lightsaber character and fights the boss for most of the time, while player two struggles to deal damage and find things to do during the fight. This was especially bad with the Anakin fight, where player two has to wait around and do nothing as either C3PO or R2-D2 while player one gets to actually fight as Obi-wan.At the end of the day, this game just makes me want to play The Complete Saga."
6806,Kain Klarden,https://steamcommunity.com/id/klarden/,2,,0,20.6,April,"23,","2,209",0,1,"Ever since Lego Star Wars: The Video Game from 2005 Traveller's Tales has been almost exclusively developing the Lego-licensed action adventure videogames. And they all followed the template established by that 2005 original with very few and rather minor changes. Even though the mumbling voices and original movie clips were swapped for voice acting recorded specifically for the games, even though more open world segments and different mechanics were introduced, the formula of the games was rigid and predictable. Which is one of the main reasons, I stopped even looking in the direction of these titles after The Lord of the Rings title - playing these titles became way too boring. Which meant that I've missed a rather curious attempt at making the gameplay more varied and fun in the Ninjago Movie Video Game from 2017. I still got bored with it, but at least that one had some genuinely fun ideas to it (and wasn't developed by the main Traveller's Tales studio).Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga was supposed to be a refresher of the series. Not a revolution, necessarily, but a long needed evolution. It was built on a new engine, restructured the game world, reshuffled the ideas that were at the base of all previous Lego Star Wars titles and, based on reports, had a really messy development. It is a shame, then, that the end result of this effort is the same boring TT Games' Lego title we've seen for 17 years, just with a new coat of paint.In case you haven't had experience with the these titles, TT Games' Lego games are action adventure platformers with level based structure and some hub or open world segments. The Skywalker Saga in particular is mostly the open world where story-driven content can also happen, and only occasionally the classic linear level gameplay. Also unlike many older titles, the camera in the game is mostly controlled by the players, whereas in older titles it was often set to fixed camera angles. Being a Lego-licensed game, a big emphasis is put on how almost any piece of decoration on the level can be broken into Lego pieces, and performing this act also usually grants you ""studs"", which is the in-game currency for purchasing upgrades and items. Though, that often requires the collection of other hidden items that might be locked behind a puzzle or a little challenge.Additionally, all characters are grouped into separate ""classes"", each of which have their own unique abilities that cannot be used by others. For example, only Jedi or Sith can move objects with Force, while only the ""villains"" have access to thermal detonators to explode items built with a specific material. This means that during each open world or linear level segment you will be coming across things you cannot interact with as part of the story-driven campaign, as the characters available to you are locked at that point, but you will be able to later revisit them in Free play mode, where you can use any unlocked character in any level. It's simple, rather intuitive and fun and can be enjoyed by players of essentially any age, as these titles are often very easy. In fact, the change to how the health and item collection works in this game, combined with less death pits and invisible damage fields, makes this entry even easier to play than before. Which is totally fine and fits the ""for all ages"" idea of the series.Problem is - this is all fun if you've never played any of the previous entries, but if you have, there's hardly any reason to play the new game. It has changes, yes, and some of them are good. Already mentioned player health situation is an improvement. The combat is a bit more involved too, with combo possibilities and counter attacks - nothing as fancy as that Ninjago game, but still less boring than it used to be. The abilities are, arguably, better handled and the concept of having a story-driven moment (like a boss fight) as part of the open world exploration is good, as there's no need to build a unique level just for the sake of a one-off situation. But it doesn't really feel any different. And the open world structure is only going to be fun who's not already bored with the typical open world games in addition to TT's Lego games.The entire time playing The Skywalker Saga I couldn't drop the feeling as if I was playing a game from early 2010s. Sure, the series did evolve from the 2005 formula, but to another outdated formula. The abundance of boring mini-games, the overreliance on terribly unexciting and pointless QTEs, the open world that exists just so they could have many markers with ""stuff to collect"" on the screen... Lego Star Wars: The Video Game felt exciting and creative but limited by the technological restrictions of what could be achieved in 2005. The Skywalker Saga has none of that excitement, creativity or freshness. It's bigger, longer and more pretty, but is nowhere near as fun as what that first game was for the time. Even as far as humor goes, it's shockingly tame and boring most of the time, with very few jokes that land well and are not simple slapstick comedy. And taking them as standalone ""retellings"" of the movies is still impossible, just as it was with the older titles - you have to know the originals to understand what's going on and why.Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is an evolution for the series, sure. And it is probably going to be fun for those who have never ever played a Traveller's Tales Lego game before and likes Star Wars. Oh and if you're among those who care about games packing as much ""hours of content"" as possible, you might find yourself doing things here for a long time. For others, though, I just don't see the appeal."

I liked the simplicity of the old games where it was more about exploring an area, where enemies could be defeated with one swing, where the camera wasn't following the player character so close it feels like you can see individual strands of LEGO hair.It's worth considering when buying this game that you might not enjoy it, so be prepared to keep track of your playtime so you can refund it if you get an hour or two into it and realise that you haven't enjoyed a single moment of it. It seems like a rare reaction to the game, but I guess I can't give any other opinion other than my own based on my own experiences.Such a shame too, I was looking forward to this for years.

I play lots of the Lego games and I thought this would be one of the best. It was fun to start off with, but as soon as you start a mission in a ship, it doesn't let you go up or down! I found this out at the end of The Phantom Menace, when young Anakin destroys the Trade Federation's ship, a level that should have taken me 10-15 minutes. Due to the steering issues, it took me nearly an hour and a half. I then hoped that it would not happen again, for it was fine when flying around planets, I started episode 2 and within the first 10 minutes of playing, I got another flying level. If you would use this with a keyboard and mouse, DON'T GET IT. This game is alright, but no way near as good as the original games which you can buy for nearly a quarter of the price on Steam as The Complete Saga. The free play worlds are expansive but lame. The game has hardly any challenge to it, with most of episode 1 being travelling. This game is extremely disappointing. If you can get this game for under five pounds, then it may be worth it but I would say, DO NOT BUY. If you want a Lego Star Wars game then get the Complete Saga, which has episode 1-6 in, or if you want a Lego game with space travel, then Lego Marvel's Avengers.

Some are less egregious than others, but the issues are not just surface level and patchable.There are many weird glitches and hiccups. I've had various visual bugs and random crashes or larger, more baffling glitches that confused us while playing. Nothing terribly gamebreaking, but the game doesn't need any help there.But the underlying game here has striking issues that can't just be patched out. I'm not going to write a full essay about everything wrong with the game, but I can give some highlights. Everyone tends to agree that lego games got worse when they started talking. The same holds here. Instead of being ""Star Wars Charades"" it's ""Star Wars on Fast Forward."" There's the occasional funny visual gag, but the majority of cutscenes are condensing, like, 10-20 minutes into 1 making sure to hit every meme line so people think it's funnier than it actually is. The combat and puzzle design aren't stellar, but lego games were never great at that. What they were good at though, was level design. To this day, I can recall exact screens and level layouts from the older lego games I played years ago, but the same can not be said about this game that I've been playing since it came out. The level and world design philosophy seems to have been ""big"" instead of ""good"" or ""memorable.""There are other issues that become apparent as you play, but the most significant and baffling one, to me at least, is the treatment of player 2. So frequently in story missions player 2 just has nothing to do. Lego games have always given the more important character to player 1, but they always made sure that player 2 was doing something fun and helpful. Here, player 1 will be Luke fighting Vader and player 2 will be R2-D2 that can't easily do anything to Vader and whom Vader just ignores. They can run around and break things and get past 3 things in the entire level. And that's one of the better examples.Let me reiterate.THEY DID NOT CONSIDER PLAYER 2INALEGOGAMEYou can tell from some of the dialogue and moments that are people who worked on this that legitimately love Star Wars and wanted to do what they could to do it justice. But they were drowned out, likely by corporate interests wearing mouse ears.I have enjoyed playing this game to make fun of it. It is a funny kind of bad. But you pretty much need to play with a heckling partner and that person has to be fine being basically useless for most of the campaign.I would give it a thumbs up for that enjoyment, but I do not wish to contribute to the bafflingly high rating this game already has."

I'm going to go against what people are saying here. I feel the game is good overall, it encompasses all the episodes of the franchise which are detailed and show great quality, throwing in the visual gag here and there.I think that's where the positives end for me.You are thrown in at the deep-end with no real guide on how you accomplish certain tasks or what means what. Because the game is so all-encompassing and vast you spend most of your time doing other things unrelated to the game (e.g. there is >1000 Kyber Bricks to collect!), you could easily sink 500 hrs into this game for 100% completion, but that distracts you from the main story so much that it becomes demotivating to play.The gameplay within the story is quite flat, the general consensus of the playthrough is - go to this place, follow this person, fight these people, cutscene. I know I haven't played a lot of the game, but that seems like the general consensus to me. The menu system isn't perfect (it could be worse) and can be confusing to navigate at times. I think if you are a Lego/Star Wars fanatic, then you will love this game because you will get much more out of it than any other John/Jane Doe, however for a more general audience, it falls a bit flat."

This open world format in a lego game isn't a step backwards or forwards, its walking off of a cliff. My heart goes out to the folks who worked on this game having to put in months of crunch time to make this happen. Some of the other new features are interesting, but frankly there's too much of this nonsense with abilities and lengthy exploration with no purpose in what should be another simple yet satisfying lego game. I will still play this since I paid for it, but this could have been leagues better if they even just copy pasted the complete saga + force awakens into this with a fresh coat of paint and a new hub world. To be clear, this isn't bad per se, its still entertaining enough, but they were clearly trying to play off nostalgia with this title and then delivered something completely different.

Sure, some of the cutscenes were goofy and funny, especially when streaming the game to my friends over discord, but that's really all I can say, the entire experience I was just waiting for the next mission to end, I said in the phantom menace ""the game feels like it's rushing this episode"", attack of the clones felt long while not even being long, and revenge of the sith was okay, but that terrible excuse for co op in the final mission is insulting.

I'm not going to write an Essay, but here's the pros and cons+ It's very pretty (even despite of the Lego aesthetic, this is a very good looking game)+ Prob the largest Open World Star Wars Game available (If you like star wars.. you can fully explore a lot of iconic areas which is pretty cool) +/- Voice acting, some of it is pretty good, particularly people like obi-wan, they also got a lot of the VA from the clone wars TV show - Missions are jarring, strange and don't really have any connection (A symptom of the new Open world format.. but if you're nostalgic for the original Lego star wars games.. a lot of these ""missions"" are just walking in the open world to a cut scene.. which is a let down from the sprawling puzzle filled levels of the original game)- No custom character creator (again.. one of my favorite features of the original.. yeah they have a ton of characters you can play as.. but what's the point of unlocking them if you can't use parts to make your own?)- No online coop. This seems like game that really shines with coop.. not having any option to play it online with a friend in 2022 seems like a weird decision as I feel that would increase the fun by quite a bit.- Puzzles seem too easy/non-existent.. maybe because I started with episode 1? But I remember more puzzles from the original games. -/+ it's way to easy.. YES this is a kids game.. but I grew up with the original star wars games.. and while they weren't super difficult games.. they were harder then whatever this is trying to do... They also revamped the combat system with combos ect... which is AWESOME, there's just NO way to actually fully experience the new combat system since everything can be killed in 1 hit or mashing buttons.I will say boss battles is where the system shines more.... it's still easy as hell but it at least takes slightly more advantage of the combat. If you're super into star wars you'll prob like this.. it's also a cool experience to travel around these iconic locations in an open world format.. but it just seems like a ton of stuff in this game.. but it's all so useless.. like the perk system.. IT'S Pointless... WHY bother?Whats that saying about Bethesda games? As wide as an ocean.. as deep as a puddle.. Seems like TT Games is headed in that directionEDIT:  I just finished episode Revenge of the Sith.. and honestly that one was pretty good.. way more combat sections and felt more like the  lego star wars of 2005. Clone wars was also a bit better than episode 1.. but the factory section was lagging like crazy.. and I have a 3080ti and only play at 1080p so that was a bit bizzare. Still going to keep the negative review.. but the game seems to be getting better.. episode 1 was horrible up until the fight with Darth maul though...."

It infantilizes it’s audience in a glaring misstep for a franchise that is nearly 45 years old and has proved it can grow with it’s audience without alienating it’s many generations of fans. Normally, I’d end with a judgement on whether to recommend a game or not, but this game is special. Not only can I not recommend it, I urge fans to not play it. I urge newcomers to the franchise to stay away from it. This game butchers Star Wars to such an extent that I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game be anything approaching a first impression for a new fan. It get’s an incomprehensible amount of the movies wrong and omits an even larger, more staggering amount; and inexcusable oversight for a game that bills itself on being the definitive collection of all nine movies. Do not play this game. If you want to play the first 6 movies in LEGO form, play the Complete Saga. TSS has no reason to exist, and is actively damaging to the legacy of the movies.Full Review here: Edit: It's been a few months, and the thought of how badly this game handled both Star Wars and the legacy of Lego video games still makes me sad"

The missions feel shorter and less saitsfying then in previous entries, and focus on smaller or just strange sections of the movie, but I guess it was a way to differenciate it from the Complete Saga.What's here is good, and very fun. If you're a fan, you needn't think twice. Otherwise, wait for a sale, I'd say."

But instead its all just one quick cut scene that is so quick that it barely mentions anything else. I am very disappointed that this game doesn't have more story.

6933,A Lot A Nuts,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198252663992/,15,6,0,4.4,April,"7,",98,1,1,"I've been looking forward to this game for over 10 years, I've played the complete saga over and over again and yet this doesn't capture the same magic for me.I've played episodes 4, 5, half of 6, 1, 2 and half of 3 and the levels and puzzles are just far too short, shallow and easy. Despite the voice acting, it feels like no character has any proper depth. The story is told in extremely fast increments, within a 2 minute cutscene Lando both greets you in cloud city, betrays you, Han gets frozen in carbonite and then Lando saves you, all without any gameplay. Lego Star Wars the Complete Saga was able to make two levels out of that sequence each lasting atleast 15 minutes. But it seems like the skywalker saga just wants to get it over with asap. It's fine adding all this extra content but at the end of the day we came for the skywalker saga, not ""lets run around and help people without doing any of the story for 75% of this game"". The levels and sidequests also have no depth and it feels like you're just running around with no real goal.The dagobah mission in episode 5 is my absolute favourite in the complete saga, you start off as Luke, unable to use the force unless you have yoda on your back and throughout the level you learn what you can do and you feel Luke learning. Puzzles are solved, you connect with Luke's struggles, and it all ends with a boss battle against vader where you use everything you've learnt. You can really feel Luke's growth. Compare that to this game where you've already seen Luke using his lightsaber on Hoth, Yoda is introduced in about 15 seconds and even though there's voice acting you get nothing like the relationship he and Luke have in TCS. He comes in like a weirdo, Luke says ""I need master Yoda"" and then Yoda says to Kenobi ""He isn't ready"". Luke says ""I am ready"" and then the level starts and lasts a total of 5 minutes. You jump across some logs, jump up a tree, have a minute-long battle with Vader and you're done, move on to Cloud city (which also only lasts 5 minutes). I guess the game expects you to fully explore the planet but when I want to do a story mission it's because I want a break from the constant exploring, not so I can get the story over with as fast as possible.The new combat mechanics are fine, I enjoy shooting but wish it wasn't so clunky and slow. Dodging, aiming and shooting aswell as melee combat have all been done extremeley well. The lightsaber combat is fun and I really enjoy the mindtricks you can do with force powers. The boss battles in the prequels are also extremely well done. The only issue I have is the small delay when aiming and taking cover while shooting. Having good combat is amazing, but when I can just run past all the enemies with a droid without them noticing it's a problem. In TCS no enemy would attack droids and I'm glad they kept that, but when droids can solve puzzles, push buttons, build, push objects and pull levers, there are entire sections that can just be skipped. I played through cloud city the first time by running to the end with C3PO, only stopping for one puzzle. It was only later when I decided to go back because I felt bad for skipping it that I actually enjoyed the level. I know that's my fault but when a game is that easy to run through, there's a big problem.Ship levels are slow and somehow they made the snow speeder level worse than in TCS. Not only is it shorter but they made tying down the ATATs so much slower and less destructive. In free play the ship battles are actually pretty fun but the story missions are just disgusting to fly around. At one point I got stuck in a backflip loop because my ship wouldn't turn fast enough. Even in free play there are so many issues; 3 puzzles I tried to do got softlocked until I reloaded. I got given 2 astromech missions which took away my controls until I rebooted. The character selection is slow and clunky, using the force (which was fun even in TCS) is slow and clunky, climbing up ladders is slow and clunky, pressing buttons is slow and clunky. Everything has been slowed down to this crawl and there's no way to speed it up. EVEN BREAKING THINGS HAS BEEN MADE LESS SATISFYING because your attacks barely destroy anything and guess what... they're slow and clunky.It seems like all the impact of building has been taken away, there's a soft sound that plays and your character flails their arms a bit but there's no oomf behind it. In TCS you had a satisfying clunk sound and the characters looked like they were tossing every piece. in Skywalker Saga there's barely a sound for building and the characters have no emotion while building... NO OOMFLevels and hub worlds also seem very barren, Hoth, Theed Palace, Jabba's Palace, Prequel Tatooine and Cloud City just seem big without there being much going on; while places like mos Eisley, Genosian Arena, and the Jedi Temple are full of so much detail that walking into that area seems so magical to me. It doesn't help that some of these areas are only seen for a split second in actual gameplay. While visually amazing, it lacks any kind of depth or simple problem solving from TCS. In my opinion, they replaced a lot of what TCS did right with a lot of empty open world where most of the game is spent going from quest marker to quest marker and where the puzzles are randomly scattered across the world rather than in the levels. There seemed to be a lot of ""go here, pick this up and go back"" with little to nothing other than very similar side quests in between. When you want a break from the samey side quests and do a story mission, it lasts all of 5 minutes and has as much depth as a small puddle on a rainy day with the cutscenes trying to fit as many references as possible into the dialogue and the missions being small snippets of a bigger pictureI honestly can't play this game any longer. It has SO MUCH potential and yet it's disappointed me at every turn. The first 30 mins to an hour of each era were fun but after that, it just got repetitive and boorish. The fact that a 10-year-old game still holds up better to me is extremely disappointing. Hopefully it gets fixed but the issues I have with it are from the game's core and it just can't be redeemed"

Each episode is the equivalent of about one mission (exaggerated, but basically true) in any other Lego game; meaning the game is nowhere near as massive as they made it seem it would be. Playtime is 13 and 1/2 hours on average if you google it. 13 hours is perfectly fine for the typical Lego game, but not one that aspires to be 9 stories in one. That is less than 2 hours per episode, most of which you are breaking things for studs. From personal experience, episode 1 took 2 hours (most of it messing around with the new features). They basically spent all of their time creating massive, pretty environments and none on the actual game. They skip through each episode, leaving you with no character attachment and no coherent story. It was like watching a movie, which you needed to read the book to even know who the characters are. While I do see that some may flaunt going back to planets, as if the main story is just the side-gig, main story + extras is only a 23 hour playtime. So, if the main story is not the draw of the game, why are the extras only 10 hours worth of content? (Completionist at an average of 39 hours) Besides the story and game length just not being what it should be for an idea this massive, they add many new features that are simply not used AND not explained properly. You are tossed in with a whole new menu setup, getting spammed with random tutorials that pause the game, while neglecting to explain main parts of the new functions. The whole upgrade system is virtually pointless, you just run through the levels smashing everything anyway (like a typical Lego game). The puzzles have been majorly replaced with things that you button mash. There is literally a single puzzle per level, copied and pasted about 3 times. There was a single build-able in the entire first episode. What in the world am I even playing if this Lego game doesn't have any build-ables? I also didn't like how menu-based this game was. In Lego Villains you would travel by vehicle, air, foot, etc to your location (just as an example). I found that most of the time in this game I was in a menu clicking to start an episode or travel to a new planet, rather than getting in a ship and flying there or walking around the planet. It felt like there was never a break from the mission to just go around beating up civilians or running each other over with vehicles (or whatever you like doing in-between missions of a normal Lego game).Overall, my main gripe with this game is the lack of structure. I really just feel like this game is all over the place compared to the normal linear setup. I do understand that they are trying out something very new with this game, and I am interested in seeing them improve upon it; however this feels like an experiment rather than a fleshed out game. Perhaps I simply didn't experience it the way it was intended to be experienced, but that still points to flaws in their in-game communication to the player rather than my naivety when presenting something new like this."

Here are my highlights:The SW content you came here for (NewHope, ESB, RTJ) is really cool.  I did this part first.Luke especially is using original dialogue and it sounds really good to me. I think i'm spotting some EU content here and there, or maybe just other SW game callbacks which isn't much different.  Hard to be sure but it feels that way.  Like i'm pretty sure Slave I has had cannons that sounded similar.FIrst time playing an area you are limited to certain characters, Afterwards, you can come back in 'free play' and be anyone you want.  There are about 8 classes with different skills but you get at least one of each early enough so this is how you really explore the area and go for collectibles or whatever.  Boba Fett I was able to get early enough;  I like how he calls himself a jetpack mechanic.    i wasn't expecting the apparently neutral bounty hunter faction that neither side seems to shoot on site.  Stormtrooper disguises work like this, too.   Mildly confusing here though - sometimes you pick up and wear a st disguise, other times, you actually are a version of the character that just is the st version, or a non-helmeted st (han and luke in new hope are like this).The puzzles aren't overly complicated, just enough to be a bit satisfying.  At best.   getting some of the collectibles are a little challenging, but nothing so far I've wanted to research online.   its a kids game so the piloting is easy, gunplay is fairly assisted, and melee is generally a mash-a-thon.Those are the best parts.here's where i take some exceptions:Some of the puzzles are downright childish.  Press an arrow key when indicated, really?Whatever it's a kids game cant set too high of a bar here, but it could really be nice to adjust difficulty and rewards around some of these,""Free-play"" in an area isn't quite.  I wasn't finished wasting ugnauts in cloud city, but something triggered and  forced me to continue the story, AND switched me to ESB Luke(?)I mentioned the unskippable cutscenes.  Plan to read the scrolling text.  every time. slowly.There are MANY sections of mandatory cinematics,  these are WAY more prominent in the disney content.  way, way more prominent.  here's the part I'm salty about:my plan was to enjoy the good movie parts and ignore the plot for the sh**ty movie parts.  just approach these like a game i don't already know the plot to:  NOT POSSIBLE.   you get force fed the disney content.  like i played the original trilogy and the cutscenes were what they were, but then i started force awakens and  this really ratcheted up.  Now it's all snap to black backdrop and dolly zoom,  it's the contrast that kills me.  Luke doesn't get this kind of treatment. I DON't want to be force-fed story-lines about rey or finn or poe or jarjar.  yet they really seem to be the focus.  Rey in particular is front and center of every startup.   Every time i start the game, she says ""I need someone to show me my place in all of this.""  Well i have an answer: just like cpt marvel, you didn't earn your powers, that's why your place in all of this is to be despised by many people who understand what's happening. (girl-power is chicom propaganda to denigrate masculinity and reduce western birth rates)"

I've played every Lego star wars, and the clone wars game was by far my favorite. my only con is they didn't take the army mechanics from that game and incorporate it into at least a few missions. I really enjoy the game however. Feels like a true successor and upgrade to the complete saga, with the sequels added to fully round things up. When it comes to bugs and UI issues, I think there's a bit that can be improved on. I'm sure no keyboard and mouse player is enjoying the lack of a cursor in the entire game. The into screen is annoying because you have to listen to Rey go ""I want to know my place in all of this"", as there's like 10 seconds of animations between all the characters. The hit boxes on the Kyber bricks are sometimes finicky, and the camera lock for targets can get extremely frustrating. I've black screened only a couple times, with no legitimate ""crashes"" where it shuts the game. Overall though its a great game with lots of exploration, funny quips, unique characters and mechanics, an amazing skill tree, funny extras, while also condensing the story enough to where the pace of the game is purely on you. 9/10, 10/10 if cons were fixed, and this is a score based off of only other Lego games."

The actual missions in the game are a small portion of my playtime, 5 missions each episode (all can be beaten in 7-10 minutes at most even if you are destroying everything and going for all collectables) broken up with open world travel sequences to the next cutscene (sometimes a forced walking sequence that the NPC they will not continue their path without you walking with them at a snails pace.) The cutscenes feel alien with the script being ripped from the movies but the visual gags treating you like a ADHD riddled child and having a new ""joke"" every second. The ""new"" combat system replaces the X spam with spamming the same 3 buttons because anything else would be inefficient. Bosses are just dodge the red and wail on a reskin enemy with hyper-armour, and blasters are reduced to generic cover based shooting you would usually see during the PS3 era of third-person shooters trying to be Gears. The open world part is a boring collect-athon that gives the player no real reason to do and definitely padded out most of my play time. Compared to previous Lego Star Wars games, the main levels are outdone but the much cheaper and more complete experience of The Complete Saga and the over world is outdone by The Clone Wars, with its planetary evasion mode and galactic conquest system.It's crazy to me how this was the game that they took more than their usual year to make and it feels significantly more hollow than ever, despite being the biggest game with the amount of collectables and literal play space it is by far the most vapid and boring Lego game to date."

The trailers hyped the game to be this amazing game that was a love letter to Star Wars fans, but instead it came out as boring, tedious, brain rotting, and down right insulting to players. The game has no charm whatsoever, the gameplay is piss poor easy, the boss fights are the same monotonous dodge then hit garbage, and there's no challenge at all. I see people online claiming how the gameplay is so amazing and unique, like what is so unique about it? All your doing is the exact same thing again and again. There's also way too much stuff that doesn't need to be. In Revenge Of The Sith, you have a mission where you need to go to Palpatine's office to confront him and you have to play as Mace Windu and Kit Fisto to confront him. Wouldn't have it been so cool if this was leading to a boss against Palpatine where you have to fight him as Mace and Kit? Well TT Games doesn't and only has that be a cutscene where both of them get axed. In the same episode, you have to play as Padme to board her ship to go to Mustafar. You know what would've been better? Playing as Obi-wan to sneak into Padme's ship without getting caught by her. In The Empire Strikes Back, you have a mission where you need to rearrange satellite dishes to find Luke, as oppose to playing as Luke and having a boss fight against the Wampa. Another thing, there is a tutorial for everything! Even when you're done learning all the controls, the game will still hold your hand like a baby and tell you what to do! But the one big sin this game committed is that it has no charm. Look, Complete Saga wasn't perfect either. In that game a lot of the times for bosses you would use your jump attack to beat them. But that game had charm all over it. All of the old Lego Games had charm. Lego Batman 1 and 2, Lego Indiana Jones, Lego Marvel Superheroes (the 1st one not the 2nd), and even Lego Star Wars 3. This game has no charm. The gameplay is repetitive and boring, the boss fights are far too easy, and there's just nothing fun about it at all. And I know there's gonna people coming to tell me ""ItS a GaMe MaDe FoR kIdS oFcOuRsE iTs GoNnA bE eAsY"", to that I say kids deserve better than this. Heck I've seen kids game that are challenging. Games like Fortnite, TF2, Genshin Impact, Smash Bros, Dragon Ball FighterZ, etc. I've seen kids who play these games and I have some dignity to see that some of them are quite good at those games, because the people who made those games cared about making games anyone could enjoy whether you like them or not. TT games didn't care about making a good game here and only cared about making money. And if they don't care, then why should you?"

That is, provided you enjoy exploring.Unlike the original Lego Star wars game (that I played), this doesnt just go from Story to Story. Instead, in between you have open Areas, HUGE open areas, with tons of stuff to explore. If you're into that you'll love this game.This feels alot more like Super Mario Odyssey (in a good way!), you can go through the map and explore, and it's fun because you get rewarded for basically everything you do!And even better: Player 2 doesnt just play a cap. Instead he gets his own character and can do anything you can!So, if you like this kind of gameplay, dont wait, just buy it and enjoy it!"

The combat is just mashing buttons and the blaster is just about shooting at someones head three times in a row. Personally I hate the Camera moment, I love the camera moment on the old games however it seems that will never be returining. No hub world which is quite sad, instead you get this open world which me and my friend easly exploited which was probably the best bart of the game unfortuanlly. I gotta hand it to them tho, the game looks amazing and the VA and cinematics are pretty epic too! Even funny at times! However the lackluster gameplay, wanky controls, boring mission, gamebreaking bugs and teadious battle mechanics just puts me off. Sorry.5/10, its better then most big titles that has come out the past year but it come no where near close to the classic of LEGO games like Star Wars the Complete Saga or Indiana Jones. I know a lot of people enjoy this game but it was just not for me.Update + 50 hours of play from previous review. I'm a lego 100% type of guy, every lego game I've come accros has been 100%. However this game is so buggy and broken that I have been effectivly LOCKED from completing the game!!!. I'm quite literaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, crinyg, farting and cyming right now. This is absoluty unacceptble! When are we getting a patch bro, how are people enjoying this buggy sheehs. I know, I know most people dont do 100% runs or atleast I think so. If they where they would be fumming right now just like me. Constant crashes, bugs, slow load times even on an SSD and general instability. I've 100% game, its not a beauty. I'd rather play the original or just another title entirely. The gameplay is very stale, the most effecient way to kill is to use general grevious, spaming lightsaber throw or using bountyhunters multishot and using anything makes the boring fight take even longer. In the old games enemies where defeated super easily but that was the point! You defeat with a yoink sa ploinky puzzle and dazzle em up with anything you have. Oh an BTW the puzzles, jesus christ. Around 700 puzzles and about 70% are about opening this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ box with a kyber brick. Taking Data Cards fellt like the most under achvining thing I've ever gatherd in a video game. Its just not fun to gather 700 kyber bricks that are hidden in plain sight and you are just looking for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ target, swtich or button to press every single time. Now there are a few bangers, gotta admit that but they arent that memrabel, atleast I cant remeber them. The minikits in the episodes was the good shiz unfortuanly there is only 225 minikits but 1166 bricks. Character switching is annoying, in old games you just press a button and you could in a matter of seconds switch to your needed character, in this game if it aint in your stupid submenu then you go scroll through like two menus just to get the charactor. The game barely saves the characters you select and sometimes just switches them. Platforming was very good, it was awesome, espacily picking characters who cant use the little jedi poles but jumping on them anyways just for an extra chalange, good times. Its been three weeks and no patches only more DLC, quite sad really. I have no ill will towards the developers but this game is kinda stinky tho. Bugs, Crashes, Incorrect mission trackers and more. The most annoying is probably; if you have a capital ship and are doing mission in which you are delivering cargo in hyperspace but are being stopped by some thugs/impire/first order/CIS with only small fighters (dont know how they manage that, hell they cant even stop one ship in episod 8 even tho they have like 100 Capital Ships, sheeehs). Anyway, a very low poly version of your capital ship will always be in sight and if you picked the executar you probably spawned inside it. The capital ship which is basically in the middle of the entire fight and all 3 of them is completely ugly and you cant colide with it, nor does it help in your battle, that would've been awesome. Or maybe even capital ship and capital ship action like classic Battlefront. Also space battles can eat my stinky gym clothes, or just space flight in general is sooo stinky. Its like playing the new battlefront all over again. They should've just taking the control scheme from the classic battlefront or any real space fighting game. To put it bluntly the handling is like thorwing a disc around and hoping to that ends of said disc are facing the enemy. Instead of disc you are using your mouse and throwing it accros the room just the look behind you. Funny, you can press alt+ctrl to do a flip but not one that ends you looking backwards like older lego titles. This is a bit exagerated but nonetheless it felt bad. Overall, the game is meh and compared to older games its even more meh. It hints at being something amazing, with epic combat, puzzles and space battles (with those capital ships) but it end it is faded away into obscurity in a matter of moments. :(   ;(    :(      3/10, gonna buy the old complete saga on steam (PC) and try it out again, lets see if my view changes."

By making the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game for the 400th time, I've played this game countless times, but it was just called Lego Ninja Go or Force Awakens or Batman, this gameplay loop is not only boring, but it doesn't have additional flavor, batman had the cool costumes, where here, there is no new stuff, the galaxy exploration isn't seamless and is a drag and the game holds your hand like crazy, it LITERALLY tells you via characters what to do, it is a game that is unoriginal about a toy that's only goal is to be creative, it is truly sad, however, if you're a Star Wars fan the humor is still amazing and hilarious, and it's worth it somewhat, if you like Star Wars pick it up since I had fun, but Steam doesn't let me choose an ""In Between"" option so looking how it has more cons than pros, I chose accordingly, one thing that bothers me is that they nailed a lot of stuff in Lego City: Undercover so how do you ♥♥♥♥ up 7 years later? 5/10, 6/10 for references"

The only real marketing aspect for this game is that it has a lot of land to explore and walk around, and many lego characters to play. which is fine. but the majority of gameplay is simply following the path that the game shows you. there is so incentive to explore the game since the only prize is kyber blocks. which allow you to upgrade your characters, you quickly see that this game mechanic is UTTERLY USELESS to the actual gameplay. other than the upgrades that increase the length in which you can absorb studs. Even worse, SOME of the upgrades deal with things like character specific minigames. such as hacking a rebel terminal, or an astromech terminal, these upgrades simply reduce the time it takes to complete one, or skipping it entirely. which begs the question. WHY WOULD YOU ADD THIS FEATURE INTO THE GAME IF IT ITS TOGGLEABLE TO SKIP. This also goes for the toggle-able settings to turn off the button mashing features for certain mechanics. I played through the entire campaign, explored it a lot of it on freeplay. Got many many kyber bricks and even some of the cheat datacards you can find hidden around. Go play the older lego star wars games, if you havent. and you'll quickly realize this is a shallow and cookie cutter excuse of a lego star wars game. theyve lost touch with the whole point"

I've also had some weird issues where NPCs or objects don't load, leaving puzzles unsolvable until reloading. Also, trying to capture/record/stream this game seems to make the performance issues even more pronounced. Some settings don't save properly, or save inconsistently, or will save but the next time you change something else and relaunch the game they'll reset themselves.Those issues aside, though, it's really nice to see a fresh take on the Lego game format. The switch to a more typical action-oriented 3rd person perspective really does a lot, and while one could argue there's no reason for this game to be open world, it doesn't particularly detract from the experience. Combat feels nice, certainly better than the original Lego Star Wars ""mash attack button to win fights"" combat. Puzzles are good, humor is the typical Lego games humor, which may or may not work for you. It's nice to see Tt finally perfect the Lego games formula, although it's a shame it had to happen at the same time as them losing the exclusive contract to make Lego games.It would be nice to see future DLC/expansion which includes content from the Clone Wars series as playable levels.

I was hoping to relive some nostalgia with this game, and maybe its because I am now 22 years old playing a game clearly targeted for kids, but it just felt like this missed the mark from the little bit I played.  At first, it was alright but the game quickly got stale.  To my knowledge, there is no big hub area like the bar area in The Complete Saga.  Additionally, let me just quickly note my biggest gripes.  For starters, this is a game released on Steam in 2022 with NO NATIVE ONLINE CO-OP FUNCTIONALITY.  This alone almost turned me off of the game from the get-go.  Much of the memories I have with this franchise was playing with my brother, and I was hoping to play through this game with him and/or my friends but this is not possible outside of Steam Remote Play which can have its own issues.Also, I got to a level and could not enter it without the game crashing every single time.  This was the point where I ultimately decided to refund.  If I'm going to spend $60 on a game (I bought the deluxe version), I expect to get a lot more enjoyment than I was getting.  I was extremely excited for this game, and ultimately let down.  I will admit that once again, I am not the target audience, but this doesn't change my disappointment.

The puzzles are also very infuriating in galaxy completion as there are more then there needs to be. Most puzzles repeat throughout playing and are just tedious to do. The lack of vehicles even featured in the cover art is also a clear sign that this game is unfinished as the cover art shows spider droids but the player is unable to use them and are only featured a few times/none. My initial rating was an 8/10My rating after completing the story, 100% a third of it and getting to 60% galaxy completion is 7/10I would still recommend but hopefully some bugs and features get improved"

The game is very lacking in content and doesn't actually feel like its going through the whole story. Misses on some big parts for context in the movies and just always seems to have way too many goofy scenes to cover for it. The combat is also very weird. Combo system in a Lego game just seems really stupid honestly. The lightsaber combos just aren't that fun to learn or even continue to do. The game doesn't even tell you the combo system exists you just kinda figure it out. This game is almost like all modern media; taking a nostalgic or loved title and giving us the smallest amount of content.

Lacking many parts from the ACTUAL MOVIES)10/10 Music, Star Wars OSTs are so Amazing.4/10 Bugs, there are random FPS drops in odd spots and Cut scenes being locked at 30FPS... what a Joke.3/10 Character Voices and WRONGNESS in Blaster Sounds (Jango, Boba, Han all had Unique blasters...)So yea, overall, 5/10... not great, but not terrible, it has been fairly fun so far, and It is nice to see the game in a new light.And anyone calling this a REMASTER is WRONG. VERY WRONG. It is a REMAKE not a REMASTER, nothing was Recycled from old Lego star wars games.*****************LONG REVIEW: ******************************Disappointed. I was Disappointed.So many things changed, and a lot... not in a good way.There are aspects I like, but there are so many things I really dislike.-----Let's start with a few things first.This game Looks amazing, the lighting, the characters actually have the mould lines.. like a Real Minifig would!The worlds are amazing and fun to explore. The models and animations are super well done.The Humor is back and there is Mumble-Speak, like the GOOD Lego games, I honestly HATED when they started speaking normal human talk. There are tons of things to collect and do., however the Kyber bricks... 1166 of them to collect, NO THANKS that is TOO MUCH. Lots of good characters, but most play exactly the same which is a downside...But I cannot say enough how the Open Worlds and Spaces are. Flying in Space and blasting things is just so fun!And then to go down to a planet and explore the worlds we see in the movies.-----Alright, on to the negative...-Characters Voices are not the same, a few characters do have the same voice, but it all SOUNDS SO WRONG.-Missions are SO F****NG SHORT, too short, its like TikTok long... right as I am having fun the missions end...and to go with that... there are cutscenes that cannot be skipped and take up half the mission (imo)...-Character unique blasters DO NOT SOUND THE SAME, they sound generic... EA did a better job with sound design.-The levels have TONS of cut content from them, there are sequences that wouldve been there in TCS or even the MOVIES THEMSELF... that just didnt make it in. Then there are missions where it becomes a boring rail-shooter...-Jedi Slam was Removed-Custom Characters were Removed (not a big deal, but would be neat in a game with so many minifig parts)-They renamed some characters and ships... F*** Politically Correct Culture.-FPS drops in Random Places (PITIFUL, especially since im 32GB Ram and RTX3060TI)-30FPS Locked Cut scenes, what a JOKE, its 2022... most games run in 60-120FPS on PC these days.-Certain Characters dont die how they would, why remove it if kids are just going to watch the movies and see them die? WHY EVEN CHANGE THAT?! -1166 Kyber Bricks is a ridiculous amount of something to collect, that is beyond Ubisofts crappy collectathons...-Only 5 levels per Episode, instead of 6-STUDS dont look that shiny... they look boring now-NO GOLD BRICKS?! -and personally I miss the Mos Eisley being the HUB, but I do like the freedom, so... take it as you will.My biggest offense besides some of the blasters not sounding unique anymore... especially Boba Fetts...is the level design, they are way too short... and there are scenes from the movies that were removed that had a part in TCS, and yea, call me Nostalgia blind, but seriously, short missions are not fun mission. They are Alright at best...Everything else is Fun, I still enjoy playing it here and there... but it feels lacking.I'd say, buy it, cause you will probably enjoy it. But, personally, I wouldve liked to see better levels, and blaster sounds... and characters that are the actual actors... not some Lego Batman actors. (Yea, QuiGon is voice by Com. Gordon)AND IF THEY COULD REMOVE REY's Line from the Intro, then it would be better.She shouldnt be front and center, and I say this not because she is a woman, I wouldve said the same thing if anyone that WASNT A SKYWALKER was there. She is a Solo, not a Skywalker... ""Show me my place in all this"", Alright.. in the tresh, GTFO Rey."

I was not expecting a collection of hubs separated by vehicle levels. There are boss fights. There is combat. There is building. There is platforming. But all of this takes place in what we would expect to have been made into a hub for levels back in the day. I kept playing and asking ""okay, how do I get to the actual levels"" until I realized that this was it. This was the game. If you are, like me, here because you played lego games back in the day, don't get this.

Not because it's bad, but because there's SO MUCH wasted potential. From a technical standpoint, it looks and feels astonishing. However, the gameplay and story were lackluster at best, considering that it's 2022 and if I have the time to game at the end of the day, I need to feel like I'm having fun and being challenged. As far as story, a big issue is the choice to make it non-linear and open world. This decision causes the movies to be split into 'missions,' which are often placed in really weird spots. My prime example is in TLJ, where you have to chase Porgs around and go back and forth across Rian Johnson's nightmare-scape known as Ach-To Island. Why is this a level and not a cutscene? The devs/writers also seem to have lost their gift for creating that silly LEGO charm in cutscenes that keeps us all coming back, with the humor feeling bland, unoriginal, and uninspired. There are quite serious moments from the movies that they are portraying just as serious, only to make a weird joke that pulls my immersion and makes me confused as to how they want me to feel. For example, when Padme's stunt double dies and we see nothing but a gag of the old man who kept saying ""I'm Padme"" earlier? Aight.Gameplay wise, it's all flair and no fun. Lightsabers especially feel weird in battles, with bosses becoming repetitive and boring to defeat. Sure, it's cool to hit people up in the air and do a couple spins but at the end of the day it's the same old button spam we're all used to. Also, the missions on speeders or similar vehicles feel pretty terrible and I've encountered multiple game breaking bugs in them. There's also a lot of boring roleplay walking where companions go SO slow and you have to listen to them blab on about plot to movies we've all already seen, instead of the exposition being included in the cutscenes so there's that.My expectations were probably too high for this game but regardless I still have a better time playing something like The Complete Saga, Indiana Jones, or Clone Wars. Maybe I'll finish this game one day, maybe not.Also, and this is important, PLEASE ADD ONLINE CO-OP. I FEEL LIKE I'M STUCK IN 2007.

7097,WIWA,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ModernMax/,6,3,0,8.2,April,"11,",380,0,1,"I'm going to be honest, this isn't what I expected out of TT Games. I stopped keeping up with their games after they started including voice lines (raw audio ones at that, though it seems they learnt their lesson - no more background sounds from the movies) as that was a turning point for their games. Mumble mode made that slightly better, I guess.But I've seen a lot of high praise for this, saying it's one of their ""best"" lego games. For new audiences, maybe this is true, but for those wanting to relive the games like with the Complete Saga game which came out much more than a decade ago now, you won't see it here.What TT Games has done is apply modern game design elements to something which was already perfect, and in doing so has lost a lot of the magic the original two trilogy games had. The open world adds a lot, and everything is visually stunning, I'll give them that. But outside of a major graphics overhaul, the ""overhaul"" to the story missions is completely off base.Within Episode 1 alone, there are several elements of stories which are just slowly following a character from point A to point B - running ahead leads to them stopping, and you're stuck slowly following them. This is a common 'mechanic' in modern day games which is a blight on the industry; why not simply make these elements of the game cutscenes? They don't shy from cutscenes for a majority of the game.The character selection is now much more bloated, with each character belonging to a specific category which controls what their abilities do. The UI for this feels cluttered and poorly implemented, but that's just my opinion. The original games' character selection UI felt much more intuitive and let you very quickly go through all your characters. This doesn't even mention the lack of character creator, which seems to be a commonly mentioned topic in reviews.This doesn't even mention the Day 1 DLC for additional characters and story content. I despise these kinds of models for game releases personally as a member of the industry. They encourage a negative behaviour that just continues as long as companies earn money from it."

Even putting aside them being my favorite, these are the introductory levels to the game and they are so incredibly bare bones it's not even laughable, it's just sad. For comparisons sake: In the original, level length was pretty much the same between all the levels, baring some exceptions, and every level had its own share of interesting and fun puzzles to engage in or return to in free play. In this game, any of the original levels that are here (cause theres actually VERY FEW) they don't even last upwards of 10 minutes. If you start the first mission of the game and don't worry about exploring (cause theres hardly anything to do in it anyway) you can finish that level legitimately in under a minute, not even a speedrun, just walking forward for like 30 seconds will beat the FIRST level. This trend only follows.Pacing, pacing.. Wow, the pacing is grotesque. They cut out several key story points, and threw back in some in the completely wrong spots, such as the battle of naboo happening AFTER the fight with darth maul(?????????????????????) These problems ALSO only continue...Optimization is fine for the most part, albeit I did receive massive frame rate issues (somehow??) in episode 2's factory section.Oh yeah, and they added pointless lite-open-world levels that serve no purpose other than to inflate the players time in the game looking around trying to do something, only to find out you can't do anything and have to come back later in free play. Seriously, these lite open worlds are complete garbage. Cut this out and actually make proper 1 to 6 episodes with good level length, none of this fake open world garbage.Finally, my last complaint.Voice Acting.Go watch my stream if you wanna hear me actively complain about how disappointing this game made me, I'm gunna continue to play through it & pray that these developers just HATED the first 2 movies and did them dirty on purpose, and the rest of the game is somehow phenomenal."

Once (or IF) they get the problems sorted out......it will be a good play through for about a $30-$40 price point. Even fixed......do not give the robber barons $60 for a Lego game.

7137,MissCandle,https://steamcommunity.com/id/misscandle/,No,,0,93.7,April,"19,",126,0,1,"Where do I even start. Spoilers for gameplay if you care.This is not a game about the star wars movies. This is a game that uses the star wars movies as a vehicle for collectables. Cutscenes and dialogue that happen in freeplay areas outside of the missions are, as far as I can tell, unable to be experienced a second time. Once you finish playing all 9 movies, the only thing left is a scavenger hunt for dozens of ships, hundreds of characters, and more than a thousand bricks.That being said, significantly more care was given to the sequel trilogy over the others, which is surprising given how bad those movies were, but not too surprising because disney didn't make the first two. The last story mission in 7 covers han solo in starkiller base, poe doing the trench run, AND rey and kylo in the forest, but there's no mission to blow up the second death star at the end of 6. (Don't come at me for saying the sequels are bad. Even jj abrams has been quoted in interviews saying that maybe they should've planned the movies before making them.)The speeder bike level in 6 is embarrassingly broken. The bike laser passes through the bottoms of enemy bikes if you've turned auto-aim off. If you kill both enemy bikes too quickly they'll end up staying behind you, and since there's no throttle control you need to restart the level. If you stay in this state too long the level will run out of track and dump you in a spawn loop off the map.Some levels, especially the droid factory in 2, have huge performance issues. They run like a slideshow when everywhere else is fine. Cargo missions in freeplay space feature a giant low-res droid battleship in the middle of the combat encounters that the player and enemies can pass right through. Combat is a slog. Missions will sometimes have you killing 30 or 40 enemies with little variation, with weapons that are sorely underpowered until you progress far enough up the skill tree.And you don't even get to customise your own character? C'mon guysIf collecting things is an itch you need to scratch, the skywalker saga will do it for you. Me, I can't believe I spent so much money on this thing."

You're just watching a worse version of the movies where half the scenery isn't even made out of Lego.

From them not using movie audio and instead relying on voice actors who can´t capture the original actors likeness (Han Solo is my favourite character from the OT movies, but I feel nothing for him in this game, no happiness at all), to the missions being WAY to short, to them skipping certain important scenes or dumbing down scenes to much. They should´ve used the movie audio like they did in LEGO Lord of the Rings, added DLC with the full Clone Wars and have the voice actors do those voices, longer missions and fixing certain cutscenes. I´m just here for the nostalgia like the rest of the older audience so I feel like this game wasted it´s potential. I´m sure the new kids will like it since it is actually, originally made for them. It saddens me a great deal that it fell short like it did. Edit: I just finished the game and the sequel trilogy was so painful to play through! I didin´t even bother getting ""True Jedi"" on any of the missions. Peace out!"

I have completed this games story mode and the ever increasing amounts of bug being discovered are sad. basic stuff like capital ships being where they are not supposed to be, characters loading without faces, lightsabers, or even their base model. thankfully i did not experience the maz glitch which can shutdown gameplay i did experience a multiple glitches that affect character selection. one glitch where changing the character roster is never permanent and the other where trying to change a character changes the one 2 over from it instead. i have been launched up to the worlds height limit several times and even glitched into the ground by leaving ships and buildings. this game has a ridiculous amount of glitches and after all this time none have been fixed. other issues include vehicle levels not actually having freeplay, bricks being reduced to stud multiplier and cosmetics. hell sith powers are also reduced to only base force powers and a few select doors that can also be done by a time wasting puzzle that gets repetitive around the third time. the characters feel like nothing more than re-textures of each other except for the jet pack characters that trade a double jump for horizontal movement that breaks so many puzzles. the levels that feature auto movement and splitting paths tend to also break by preventing enemies from appearing. this game feels more like i'm beta testing and not playing a completed product. this is a very disappointing addition to the lego starwars series."

7167,The Quizmaster,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ScepTiKaL/,7,1,0,0.8,April,"8,",71,0,1,"While you can tell the devs put a lot of effort into it, it's simply just not as good as the originals. There are more characters but they're just skins as they all function the same - r2d2 can no longer hover, palpatine doesnt shoot lightning, etc. Also the levelling system just makes the game grindy and almost tacky - the achievement should be to become a true jedi and collect all the minikits - not increase sprint duration by 10% etc.Most importantly however is the new aiming feature. I hate it - the auto aim in the originals is far better. Auto-aim not only helps determine what structures are destructible, but also means you don't have to 'work hard' to play the game. It's not reasonable to be able to destroy everything you want when using a controller - maybe if using a lightsaber but its still more difficult and time consuming than it should be. This is not the type of game you want to use a mouse and keyboard on, but unfortunately you have little choice.Plus, the open world idea has just made the game more boring. Too much running just to get to the next cut scene.It's not a *bad* game - in fact, it's probably ok. However, the originals are simply superior - thats why we loved them so much all those years ago. You'll have more fun on those than you will on this."

On that level, it works, and I certainly can't fault the absurd amount of work that had to go into building all those worlds (pretty much every major planet seen in a SW movie) and stuffing them full of things to find.The problem is basically everything else.The main plot missions are short, repetitive, and almost absurdly easy.  And, I mean, older LEGO games were *easy.*  This is streamlined to the point that all you need are basic motor skills, and I'm not even sure that's a requirement.  There's also a surprising lack of creativity in things like vehicle levels and boss fights.  Pretty much every lightsaber-wielding boss as well as almost any boss with a melee weapon fights in the exact same way, with the exact same patterns, and it gets really obvious the devs ran out of ideas before the halfway point.  The mob battles in Ep 8 and 9 are particularly painful, as you just have to plow through a bunch of nearly identical mini-bosses all fighting exactly the same way.Likewise, the ""puzzles"" utilized to open doors or operate control panels are exactly the same every time, and get old really fast.  It's little wonder there are upgrades available that let you skip them.The vehicle missions - a highlight of previous games - are downright dull here.  This has the single most boring adaptation of the Death Star battle I think I've ever played.  And that's when they bother adapting them at all.  Numerous major vehicle battles are simply not playable at all.  I hope you weren't looking forward to fighting in the Battle of Coruscant, or doing the core run into the Death Star II, or trying out some lightspeed skipping.  They're just cinematics here.Even the trademark LEGO humor seems downgraded.  For the most part, cutscenes and story beats are simply knockoff actors reciting a chopped-down version of the movie scripts, with very few changes.  Then typically with something wacky happening in the background, even as the characters in the foreground play the story totally straight.  I really miss the whole ""Vader pulling out baby pictures"" vibe of the older nonverbal games.  There are definitely some good jokes here and there, but way too much time is spent simply recapping stuff fans have already seen.And on top of all that, as of writing 4 months after release, there are still a *ton* of bugs and problems with the mission scripting.  They seem to have fixed all the major game-breaking bugs, but there are still a lot of things that can go wrong, or force you to restart a mission due to a glitch.Basically, having finished the main story, I'm already kind of bored.  I can't even imagine spending the 100 hours needed to get 100%.  Otherwise, the next time I have an urge for LEGO Star Wars, I think I'll just stick to the old Complete Saga, even if it doesn't have 7-9."

This game is extremely dissapointing considering its predecessors. Game lacks any depth or interest for me to break anything and explore the levels. The levels are extremely short (about 5-10 min, especially vehicle levels are really short), you barely build anything in levels or interact with anything, some levels like The Phantom Menace first level don't make any sense to be an actual level (a vehicle level underwater with a big fish is a joke) or the levels have things that werent in the movies (a level with Jango Fett returning to shoot at Millenium Falcon in The Empire Strikes Back for no reason). The hub worlds feel extremely empty and uninvinting and we spend 10-20 min just walking around to next level or escorting/following a character each time we finish a level without interacting with anything (These people made Lego City Undercover). The cover system is completely pointless and disguises make you pretty much invincible. I wouldn't be too dissapointed about it if it didn't cost 50 euros. No, i am not too old to understand this, I played most lego games in last year and enjoyed them like Complete Saga, City Undercover, Indiana Jones, Lord of The Rings, Batman and Clone Wars.

It's not, it's a high quality kids' game. Buy it for your kids or for a nostalgia trip. This review is written by someone who has played and owned most lego games of this style, and evaluates the game as a standalone product for someone with considerable experience with video games, mostly to illustrate that it isn't. Pros:+ This game is light-hearted and knows it. I never laughed out loud but many people call it charming and it is. The humor and tone is absolutely the main appeal of this game. It's like a playable version of the family guy star wars parody but less cringy. + This game is gorgeous. The textures are some of the best if not the best I have seen in a video game. + The new class system is a necessary streamlining of the wonky character system from the old games. + There is a lot of content. Aside from 5 missions per film there are many smaller regions which function together as an open world of side quests.Neutrals:- The shooting is a massive improvement over older lego games, but note that this says very little compared to contemporary action games. It's no longer a chore, but it is barebones. Shooting rewards headshots which hints at a slight challenge if you want it, but dying is still meaningless so the skill floor is very low. The cover system sucks about as much as it does in every video game. If you've played enough shooters to have a standard for that it's easy enough that you never need to take cover. - Melee combat is also improved. There's a combo meter that rewards spam rather than punishes it, which is weird but cool i guess. Enemies will start blocking if you spam punch them though, which forces you to switch up your game. The bosses forcing you to stay moving is good. Again, this is barebones but a massive improvement over literally being able to defeat darth sidious with your eyes closed. - There's a lot of content, but none of it is very engaging due to the core gameplay loop being extremely easy. It works fine as a checklist to cross off while turning your brain off and as more opportunities for the game to transmit its signature charm. Cons:- The PC port is a little janky. It's allergic to alt tabbing which is a pet peeve of mine but i suppose is somewhat expected for a series that just added mouse support. Said mouse support doesn't allow for more than 3 buttons.- UI layout is garbage. The UI looks good but is a bother to navigate. - There is no character customization. This was kind of a dealbreaker to me personally, it's a staple of the series that would have seen huge benefits from the new class system.  Summary: I sound negative here but the purpose of that is to dispel the idea that this is a masterpiece for adults. It is very good at what it's trying to do: Entertain children, give older fans nostalgia, and being a love letter to Star Wars. At this the game succeeds with flying colors. What this game isn't trying to do is be revolutionary, or even good, as a contemporary action game. The fact that this games size comes at the cost of the health and working conditions of its creators is also a massive deterrent for me."

Here's what i have to say.TL:DR - Buy it on sale, but it's buggier than Cyberpunk.Story - When i was young i was obsessed with Lego star wars games, not only those, but any Lego game. But i have to say, level wise... I'm very disappointed.You may say ""They have to keep levels short because of how many episodes there are!"".And i'd somewhat agree, BUT Lego Star Wars 2 had 6 fully lengthened episodes. Filled with 10 minikits and a hard to get true hero. There are hub worlds, but these worlds are more detailed than the actual story itself. I found myself doing anything BUT the story because there was so much to do.So overall for story, it's lacking movie details and key battles, Disappointing.Graphics - Absolutely smooth and lifelike, they've really done a good job with them. No complaints about them.Gameplay - The lightsaber battles are the selling point imo.That being said, there is really no skill involved other than spamming Left Click (I understand this is a kids game... and is marketed towards the lower ages, however the same was said for OOT and Super Mario)I have to brush over the other things too - If, like me, you went for 100%... Then you have to SLOWLY do everything Kyber Brick related.What i mean by this, is you have to watch the same animation 950+ times.There have been a few times i have glitched it so it skips, but this happened maybe 50 times.SIDE NOTE - The character voices are pretty annoying when you have to switch constantly. They say the same things EVERY time you switch, even mumble mode doesn't really solve this issue.The quests are Meh at best. The best way i can describe them is like a Halo campaign. What this means is that it's basically, ""Go here, do this, Go here, Blow up this"" etc etc.Overall, again disappointed.Bugs - As a guy who has beated Cyberpunk 2077, 4 times. This game really does take the cake as one of the buggiest games, it literally has nothing on Cyberpunk.Just a little list:Crashes everywhere.Framerate issues on 2 specific missions.Bugged Quests.Settings resetting mid game.A weird 4:3 resolution bug which happens if you have more than 1 monitor.Overall - A decent ""open world"" Lego Game.But due to the bugs, lack of story and lack of mission variety..6.5/10.Extra - I spent more time finding where to go for a campaign mission, than being IN the mission itself.You could speedrun an episode in 10 mins... And there's 9 episodes..."

This was terrible for me, as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on Tiktok. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, did the tutorial but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought my son and I closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories."

You have to take down Storm Trooper Bikes in what seems to be endless waves until the terrain doesn't generate and softlocks you forcing you to redo the entire level. Not to mention your blaster shoots under their bikes 19/20 times (This *could* be because I have Aim assist turned off to make the game challenging.)UPDATE: I beat it.

The gameplay isn't very interesting and is tedious at times. Exploring the maps and completing the side content is a bore, since the maps are kinda empty and not very compelling. This means that I have zero desire to go back and get new characters/ships or to do any kind of free play; I was basically speedrunning the game to get to the story bits. Speaking of which, the story is very short and skips a lot of content, where The Complete Saga fleshed out each part a lot more. Not worth the money or the hype. I'd wait for a sale if you really want to play this game."

Not only did it regularly soft lock and crash, but it also crashed my entire computer three times. One of those crashes was 70 hours in, and it corrupted my save file, so I lost 70 hours of progress. That is completely unacceptable in any game, and shows a clear lack of care went into the stability of the game. Luckily, I was able to find Reddit threads with a ton of people who had the same issues as me, and based on what they said, I was able to spend 3 hours and hack together a Frankenstein's monster of my corrupted save and a new save, to more or less get my progress back. On top of that, the camera is broken and constantly gets stuck on terrain, the controls regularly don't do what they say they'll do, and every single time you shoot a weapon, it zooms in the camera for no reason, then zooms the camera back out. Playing this game is nothing short of a miserable chore. I suffered through the entire game, because I couldn't believe that the game would stay as bad as it started, but it started out horrible and stayed that way.If you liked the original Lego games, then this game will feel like an absolute middle finger. Everything fun and creative from the originals has been stripped away and replaced with generic third person shooter mechanics and an irritating upgrade tree. Every action from switching characters, to using the force, to starting a level, all take a ludicrous number of button presses to perform, where they would take one button press in the originals. Every character, even among the 9 classes, feels exactly the same. The game is bogged down with endless unskippable cut scenes, random lingering camera pans, and nonstop walking in a straight line through the hub worlds. Everything has been meticulously designed to be as slow, tedious, and frustrating as possible.Playing through some of the episodes in story mode is literally 80% doing nothing. I recorded my play through of the game, all 83 hours, looked through the recordings, and measured the length of everything. About 20% of the episode was playing levels, and the rest was sitting through cut scenes and walking in a straight line in the open world. Even that 20% of playing the levels is still bogged down with cut scenes, unskippable animations, and endless boring quick time events where you spam a button. Calling this a game is damn near false advertising. I play video games to interact with the game and do things, not to hold down a button and watch cut scenes.The only positive I can say about this game is that the open world occasionally had moments where it felt like a Lego game, but to get to those moments, you have to slog through so much insufferable filler, that it's not even remotely worth it.It took me 83 hours to 100% this game, and if it weren't for all the terrible cut scenes, unskippable animations, and quick time events, this would've been a 30 hour game, maybe even less. This game is an insult."

And I did, but:- The campaign is packed way too tightly, many interesting missions and locations are skipped - like the Battle over Coruscant from Ep 3.- The cutscenes are way too fast and try to fit in way too many jokes, so I can hardly catch them all.- Barely two hours for one episode.- Many bugs and blackscreens.- Some hubs are pointless and barebones - like Gungan city and Lake Paonga are there just for the sake being there.- Slave I is not called Slave I but ""Boba Fett's ship"" for the sake of safespace.- Forced diversity - black female Stormtroopers and so on.- Minifigs not longer feel unique. They do have superb animations, but they ALL have the same mechanics. Nearly all characters can do a forward-jumping attack - even droids! Even C3PO can jump, sprint and bash.- TPS combat does not suit LEGO games at all. Keep that for Battlefront games.- The combat is just EASY. No challenge whatsoever. Yeah it's a Lego game, but comeon, you know that non-kids play this game too.Now some pros:+ Graphics is superb, so are some animations.+ Space combat is decent, but still easy.+ Comedy is pretty good too+ Voice actors are surprisingly good!TL:DR Less is more!!!!"

Sadly playing not even playing through 2hrs of this game they've changed the old jokes the game had and won't even kill Jango by chopping his head off, like they previously did. This game has gone even more PG than it used to be. Majority of the time you can stand still and no enemies will attack you and you automatically block shots coming your way. This may be a kids game, but so were the originals and they weren't hard to play when we were kids, now the game is stupidly easy. They've also added a lot of unnecessary mechanics to the game that don't really change a lot. They're just there because they wanted to update the game somehow. In an effort to make the game size smaller (I think??) they've also made the levels really short for some reason?But don't get me wrong this game looks amazing and if you want to buy it for that instead of the originals that are also on Steam understandable. You, do you. But this game had a lot of potential, and it feels like they took all the best bits out of the game, in an effort to make the game the most PG friendly thing you've ever seen."

I don't recommend it in its current state as episode 8 & 9 are locked until you complete 7- leaving you with 2/3 of the advertised game. Triple A prices for Indie bugs. You would assume any amount of testing would have caught this one. The team should consider being even more inclusive and include some talent on their next project. PC controls for piloting are horrid. 7/10 if they can manage an update before I get bored of waiting and delete it - otherwise it isn't worth playing just watch the films.

Of course I have watched all the movies and series but I am not a hard core fan of the series. I just wanted to say that before I continue.I bought the game cause I had seen pretty much everyone praising it for being ""the best lego game"" or ""the best game of the year"" or something like that. When I started playing it I was kinda hyped even. I had played the complete saga when I was little so I kinda had a nostalgic connection to all the lego games in general. So I booted up the game and started playing.First thing I realised was how short the levels were. I just played the game casually and finished Phantom Menace in only 1 hour. I get that you have to search for all the collectables and stuff like that but I did find some and I even did a some side mission that were just that I had to do some puzzle and then get something to some guy. It basicly goes like this. You go somewhere. Than you get a 10 second cutscene (The older lego games had even 5 minute long cutscenes). Then you run to some other place and fight some guys (that are childishly easy) and then repeat. The game should make a difficulty setting for non 3 year olds. It gets really boring. And even the cutscenes are ruined by some weird humor that only a 4 year old would find funny. I get that lego games are made for children but come on. They have to know that most of the people who are going to buy this game are like in high school and get this game because of nostalgia for the other lego games. Then after you have run for like 20 minutes you get thrown into an ""open world"" area. These areas are just empty places that have some npcs that give you side missions. And these places are HUGE. And quess what you'll be doing in these areas? Run. You have to run in these beautiful places and there is like nothing to do (apart from searching for the collectables for an hour that mostly give you cosmetic stuff).So yes. I wouldn't recommend this game. Even to some one who is a ""star wars fan"". And yes I get it. Some people who really like star wars just want the game because they can see darth vader looking cool. If you want to spend 50 dollars. Like 50 dollars for a lego game! I'm done. I even played The new hope to see if the prequels were just bad but same thing.Hope this review helps some of you to think again before buying the game."

Heck, I prefer this over the recent battlefront games, and I probably like this almost as much as Jedi: Fallen Order, both of which is in my library.However, it does NOT have character customization, which is my personal, primary reason for playing Lego games at all. Got it refunded after 3hrs and 45min. Why that exact time? It is because that is when I actually found out that there was no customization, by googling how to customize our character in the Skywalker Saga game.I didn't even expect to be able to customize with all the characters. That would be crazy, and probably too much, considering how much the devs have already worked on the game. Wouldn't complain if they do it in the future. If they do add it, or even add it as a DLC, im willing to buy the game again WITH that DLC. But considering how hard they worked on the game, maybe they could select a limited number of aspects and parts that can be used for customization. I hope they do something like that. But until then, I will not touch this game.Don't get me wrong though, it is still an amazing game. The puzzles, humor, and open-world exploration is better than ever. Visuals too (might need a semi-strong pc). The only reason I'm downvoting this is because I'm just really disappointed that you cannot custom-create a character at all. They could have included a smaller version rather than using the whole roster, but they did not even do that. If you are like me, and absolutely must have character customization, I recommend that you delay opening up your wallets."
